803,FCX,ratio stay area total revision activity heat dramatically next month so be reason very serious concern net cut be very widespread ratio firm rise mean estimate fall be year next year sector have more cut increase year next
804,FCX,light generally downbeat economic news be not surprising be not see lot estimate increase catalyst positive earning surprise slow revision period revision ratio be generally less significant period high activity do not mean be ignore completely be flash yellow caution light pretty brightly now
805,FCX,strong earning performance have see particularly large multinational company earning most track report be single most important argument bull favor low valuation base earning thus start crack big way be very big concern recap key datum event last week
