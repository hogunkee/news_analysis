4,FDX,"Stocks opened to very tight gains on Monday, ahead of a heavy week of political and policy events. The world's attention is trained on Tuesday's summit between President Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un, but a Wednesday press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be a focal point for investors.The Dow Jones industrial average managed a 0.2% gain.

11,FDX,"General Electric (GE) launched a drone business, while it sheds others, as the U.S. ropes in companies such as GE, Intel (INTC) and FedEx (FDX) to help it manage the sharp growth in unmanned, autonomous vehicle technologies on the ground and in the air.XGE's new company, dubbed AiRXOS, will help government agencies, aviation authorities and private-sector firms manage drone traffic and achieve safer flights, the industrial giant said in a news release Thursday.The AiRXOS launch comes almost a month after news of a partnership between the U.S. government and companies such as GE, Intel, FedEx on drone projects. Details on what role Intel and GE would play were scarce at that time.FedEx will use drones to inspect aircraft and deliver parts at Memphis International Airport. American cities and states have similar tie-ups as drones proliferate, with T-Mobile (TMUS) helping the city of Reno, Nev., test defibrillator deliveries via drones.Notably, tech and retail giant Amazon (AMZN), which has pushed for drone deliveries, was snubbed in that public-private sector collaboration.Shares of GE closed up 1% at 13.78 in stock market today.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

This allows for safer more frequent inspections, while reducing costs, GE said.GE Aviation is seen by some analysts as a crown jewel in its sprawling portfolio. The Boston-based company seeks a turnaround that will see $20 billion in assets offloaded and even perhaps the giant broken up into separate publicly traded companies.""What AiRXOS offers is the infrastructure and advanced operations necessary to unlock the emerging markets of autonomous flight,"" said Kenneth Stewart, AiRXOS general manager.While drones have generated some controversy, the Trump administration seeks to integrate them in the broad aviation landscape.

And it comes as people find more reasons to cast drones into the sky — from aerial inspections of all kinds to the Olympics. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao told IBD in January that she lamented the many ""outdated and duplicative regulations that really hamper the growth of innovation.""The DOT culled 10 pilot projects from 149 applications. They are part of a White House initiative known as the Unmanned Aircraft System Integration Pilot Program announced in October.Under the program, the Federal Aviation Administration partners with state, local and tribal governments. Those governments then team up with companies in the drone business to figure out how drones can coexist with the other aircraft in the sky.""Data gathered from these pilot projects will form the basis of a new regulatory framework to safely integrate drones into our national airspace,"" Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said in a statement on Wednesday.The governments selected will gather a wide range drone-related data over the next 2-1/2 years to help develop that framework. They'll collect information related to night operations, detect-and-avoid technology and flights beyond the line of sight and over people. They'll also collect information related to ""reliability and security of data links between pilot and aircraft,"" the DOT said.The 10 governments selected are: the cities of San Diego and Reno; the Virginia Tech Center for Innovative Technology and the University of Alaska-Fairbanks; the transportation departments of Kansas, North Carolina and North Dakota; Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; the Lee County Mosquito Control District in Ft. Myers, Fla.; and the Memphis airport.Richard Carlson, Kansas' secretary of transportation, said in a statement that the program could give the state new ways ""to reduce the risks to our workers during infrastructure inspections, search and rescue, and remote area assessments.""Kansas' vast rural territory made it an ""ideal"" location for testing, the statement added. The pilot program would help industries like transportation and agriculture and could help manage bridge inspections and traffic flow on roads.Similar to Flirtey in Reno, North Carolina's transportation department said its proposal focuses on working with drone delivery companies to set up a distribution network to deliver medical supplies.AirMap is working with Reno and the three transportation departments, along with San Diego and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:This Company Wants To Secure Your Home With Phones And DronesGoPro Drone Demise Offers Opportunity For Mota GroupDrone Uproar Could Hit Google's Cloud-Computing Business

The bank set the rate, which links the yuan to the dollar, at 6.4586. The surprise move halted the yuan's steep, two-day slide. It also eased global concerns that China might devalue the yuan and allow its stock markets to suffer the consequences in response to the country's trade standoff with the U.S.China's stock markets responded by kicking up out of mixed trade to a solid finish. The Shanghai Composite rose 0.3%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 0.8%, but remained down 2% for the week.Global currencies reacted to the PBOC move with an uptick in confidence. The euro rose against the dollar, while the dollar gained vs. the yen. Government bond run-ups in Germany and the U.S. paused.

London's FTSE defended a 1% gain in afternoon trade. Miner Glencore and home grocery delivery leader Ocado topped the FTSE 100.

The discussion reportedly began at 9:30 a.m. ET.China-based stocks were again in focus in early trade. Some of the biggest names, Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba Group (BABA), NetEase (NTES) and JD.com (JD) were little changed.Among the more volatile plays, Huya (HUYA) bounced 6%, after taking a 12% dive on Tuesday. IQiyi (IQ) popped 3.6%, looking to grab back Tuesday's 3% loss. Both pullbacks could be positive for investors looking for entry points into these China-based tech IPOs.21st Century Fox vaulted 6.6% higher after Disney agreed to raise its bid for company assets to 38 per share, up from 28. That lifted the total value of 50% cash/50% stock deal to $71.8 billion. Fox agreed to the deal, which would give Fox shareholders 19% of Disney ownership following the transaction.  Fox shares ended Tuesday 15% above a flat base buy point at 38.66. Disney shares were up 0.7% in early action. The stock is mired in a 13-month consolidation.Comcast (CMSA), who's earlier bid was topped by Disney's new offer, rose 0.7% in early trade.Winnebago hitched up an 10% opening gain, after reporting above-forecast earnings and revenue for its fiscal third quarter. A 9% jump in earnings surprised analysts expecting a 3% decline. Winnebago shares remained below their 40-week moving average, aiming to start up the right side of a six-month consolidation.FedEx (FDX) slipped 2.2% after its fiscal fourth-quarter report. Oracle dropped 4.1% after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter results.Netflix powered up 1.4% at the start of trade. The streaming entertainment titan rammed nearly 4% higher against a falling market Tuesday, lifted by a trio of analyst upgrades. The gain points the IBD Leaderboard stock to an open more than 20% above the stock's 338.92 buy point from a May breakout. That would place it in a profit-taking zone.Facebook opened 1.6% higher. The gain moved the stock back above a buy range over a handle buy point at 188.42.RELATED:Stocks Trim Losses As Trade-War Salvos Rattle Global Markets, Dow SputtersChina, Trade Loom Over These Earnings: Investing Action Plan If You Missed These Explosive China Stocks, Here's How You Could Get In

Affiliates of Blackstone offered $27.50 per share for Gramercy, which owns warehouses in the U.S. and Europe that it leases to companies.Gramercy has been increasing its industrial assets, which are now about 80% of the company's portfolio.

23,FDX,"Roadie — a startup that gets everyday folks to deliver packages while on their way to wherever they're already driving — has notched a lot of oddball same-day delivery jobs that Amazon (AMZN) doesn't do. A glass aquarium from Fountain Valley to Long Beach, Calif. A set of keys to someone locked out of her house in Georgia at 2 a.m. A box of trial evidence from San Francisco to Napa in time for a panicked lawyer's court date.Around 80%-85% of its shipments are same-day affairs, fueled partly by individuals with curious packages, but mostly by bigger businesses. And Roadie, which provides Kroger (KR) grocery delivery in select areas and brings lost luggage to Delta Air Lines (DAL) customers in about 40 markets, is not alone.Roadie rivals Instacart and Deliv have separately joined forces with Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), Kroger, Macy's (M) and Best Buy (BBY) on same-day shipping. Target (TGT) even went so far as to acquire Shipt for $550 million. The bull's-eye is ""becoming the first retailer to offer same-day delivery nationwide,"" said Target CEO Brian Cornell last month at retail conference Shoptalk.The driving force behind this latest retail trend, as ever, is Amazon. Its Prime same-day delivery service follows a free-shipping perk that is now a de facto requirement for online shopping. But after scrambling to catch up to Amazon on free shipping, these old brick-and-mortar titans are rushing to stay ahead of the e-commerce giant on same-day delivery. And this next online battleground might actually tilt in their favor, some analysts say.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSpeedy delivery doesn't come cheap. Customers could pay anywhere from $5.99 to $9.99 per shipment for the pleasure. But demand continues to mount, which makes it ""absolutely essential"" for retailers in order to compete in this ""instant-gratification economy,"" said Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins, who thinks one-hour delivery might be the next goal. ""People want to see a package on their door when they return from work.""As President Trump continues tweeting his rage at Amazon on a near-daily basis over its use of the U.S. Postal Service, it's the Shipts and Instacarts and Delivs (not to mention the Postmates and DoorDashes in food delivery) that are harvesting this ripe market. And they may not even emerge as the biggest winners. Instead, logistics giants like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) have the scale and infrastructure to capture at least 80% of the future same-day delivery market, a 2017 McKinsey report noted.To a physical store, looking to a web-based firm to hurry along online orders might seem like hastening one's own demise.But the McKinsey report called same-day a ""$200 billion opportunity for retailers in Europe and North America over the next decade."" And it pinpointed brick-and-mortar stores as potentially recapturing turf from online pure plays.The firm said that only traditional retailers ""have the dense network of physical stores to support same-day order fulfillment and delivery.""Perhaps surprisingly, that dinosaur of retail — shopping malls! — is also poised to benefit from the interest in same-day delivery.Daphne Carmeli, CEO of delivery startup Deliv, had an aha! moment when she realized that this could offer shopping centers a ""line of sight ... into e-commerce revenue"" that they wouldn't otherwise have.If you live in Palo Alto, Calif., and place an order on Macys.com, for example, that purchase is likely to be shipped out from a nonlocal distribution center in, say, Atlanta. In that scenario, only Macy's and UPS make money off that transaction.But if you place that online order through Deliv, and the nearby Stanford Shopping Center fulfills that order (and a few dozen others) from its own in-house Macy's, then the mall owner gets some of that revenue, because of the way that leases are structured.Malls ""make money on real estate and rent,"" said Carmeli, adding, ""the more sales the actual Macy's makes, the more the actual mall operator makes.""Which is why malls are willing to carve out parts of their own budgets to hire runners to fulfill Deliv orders. Deliv has partnered exclusively with — and has strategic investments from — major operators Simon Property Group (SPG), Westfield, General Growth Properties (GGP) and Macerich.Luckily for Deliv and its rivals, the technology to make same-day drop-offs happens to have come a long way since the early dot-com days. Deliv's Carmeli, whose company serves 1,400 cities across 35 U.S. markets, was once told her idea was the ""stupidest idea ever.""""Do you remember Webvan? Do you remember Kozmo? Do you remember all the hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars that were deployed to build up these companies that ended up exploding in colossal fashion?"" she recalls being asked.Deliv, like many of its peers, avoids being blown up by using modern-age technology to orchestrate an algorithmic symphony of scheduled pickups and drop-offs from nearly 150 retailers — including Macy's, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Sam's Club and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Express — straight to people's homes.Retailers nowadays have a better grip on inventory visibility, says Carmeli. And smartphones make it easy to crowdsource drivers.Her predecessors, like Leonardo da Vinci dreaming up helicopters in the early 1500s, tried to make same-day work on a mass scale before the right equipment existed.Boston Retail Partners analyst Scott Langdoc knows that serious pain. As a former C-suite exec at ""mini-Webvan"" delivery company PDQuick at the start of the new millennium, he says that Google Maps would have made all the difference.""If I had the tools that are available today, starting with Google Maps but fast-forwarding to the (artificial intelligence and machine learning) tools that are available today, it's amazing to think what I could've done at my scale or what Webvan or Kozmo could've done at their scale,"" he said.Like many of its peers of the time, PDQuick didn't survive. It was bought out and went back to its roots as a scaled-down SoCal neighborhood delivery service, Pink Dot.""What we'd intended to do before the 2001 implosion was basically do what Shipt did, which was to generalize the delivery and logistics capability for any retail platform so we could bring in inventory. A retailer brought in drivers and you would be able, based on location, to provide that capability,"" said Langdoc.""Fast forward 15 years, that is what Shipt is; that is what Instacart is.""That doesn't mean that same-day delivery is not without major challenges. It's expensive, for one. And as grocery delivery emerges as the next massive battleground, the stakes are being raised beyond mere speedy delivery of things like T-shirts, to more delicate items like yogurt and tomatoes.Even first movers are encountering issues.""It's not free and you can lose an awful lot of money trying to do it for free,"" said Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea. ""Amazon will approach $10 billion in absorbed delivery costs this year. There aren't a lot of companies that have the ability to absorb that, either from a financial flexibility perspective or shareholder patience.""That has bestowed upon Amazon a ""fairly significant advantage,"" he said.Still, other companies have advantages too. If any physical retailer could conceivably take on same-day delivery in-house, it's Walmart, say experts.So far, Walmart's grocery-delivery pilot employs its own trucks in just one of six test markets, Denver. It relies on Deliv in San Jose and on Uber in Dallas, Orlando, Phoenix and Tampa.The Bentonville, Ark.-based mega-retailer recently declared that over 40% of American households across more than 100 cities will have access to its online grocery delivery service by year-end. That effort is expected to add thousands more to its already 18,000-strong force of personal shoppers.On Tuesday, Walmart said it enlisted courier Postmates to deliver online grocery orders starting in Charlotte, N.C., before rolling out to other cities.""We know one thing's for sure: that (customers) want a delivery option and so we're committed to that,"" Walmart spokesperson Molly Blakeman told Investor's Business Daily in late January. The company filed to trademark grocery delivery-related ""Wam! by Walmart"" earlier in the year, which Blakeman confirmed is associated with active, ongoing projects.Still, even as analysts agree that same-day shipping, including grocery delivery, has to be an option for shoppers now, some question if the effort is worth it.""In this arms race to provide faster delivery, are you providing too many resources to a very small niche product, or a small niche customer base?"" asked Moody's O'Shea.There are more households in America that make less than $30,000 a year than more than $100,000, he said. So the idea of same-day, for most products, isn't hugely compelling at current price points.""I would not say that the demand is minimal, it just has a definite ceiling — at least as far as the pricing stays where it is,"" echoed Euromonitor analyst Tim Barrett.And if you're wondering whether same-day delivery could ever scale up and reach rural settings, the answer is: ""No way,"" he said, laughing.""Simply put, that's not going to happen,"" said Barrett. ""We have seen traditional grocery stores struggle to sustain enough traffic to justify real estate and actual brick and mortar, let alone expensive delivery, let alone even more expensive same-day delivery.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

But the stocks quickly pared losses.X The new service, ""Shipping with Amazon,"" will pick up packages from business then ship them to consumers, sources told the Wall Street Journal. Sources also said that the service, which initially will be limited to third-party merchants that sell on Amazon, will start in Los Angeles in the upcoming weeks and Amazon hopes to expand it to other cities later this year. Amazon has been testing the service in LA for a year and has rolled out the program in London.FedEx shares fell 1.7% 235.31 on the stock market today. UPS sank 2.6% to 106.39, falling intraday to its worst levels since late May. In premarket action both had signaled losses of 5% or more.Amazon.com retreated 0.8% to 1,339.60 after tumbling to its 50-day moving average intraday.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market is now in a correction. Read our cover story on why stocks sold off and what you should do now.Amazon will likely charge less than UPS and FedEx for shipping because it already delivers some of its own packages so it can fill extra space on its trucks with outside business without raising costs, sources told the WSJ.Earlier this week, Amazon said it would start delivering Whole Foods Market groceries to Prime members in Austin, Texas, Cincinnati, Dallas and Virginia Beach, Va.But the success of ""Shipping with Amazon"" remains to be seen as FedEx and UPS still have an advantage of massive shipping networks that have expanded over the last 30 years. Both have invested heavily to expand their networks to handle e-commerce shipments. Even so, UPS suffered high costs in the fourth quarter due to high holiday shipping volumes.Patrick Fitzgerald, FedEx senior vice president of integrated marketing and communications, said that the WSJ headline ""demonstrates a lack of basic understanding of the full scale of the global transportation industry.""  FedEx pointed to a video stressing its vast global infrastructure. FedEx has said that no customer, not even Amazon, accounts for more than 3% of total revenue or volume.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Retail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchUPS Dives Amid Continued Struggles With Holiday Shipping Volumes

28,FDX,"A Federal Reserve rate hike on Wednesday is a near certainty, so the focus will be on Fed policymakers' projections of future policy, especially whether they see a fourth hike in the cards in 2018.If Fed members don't step up their expectation for three quarter-point hikes on Wednesday, they're very likely to by June — even if inflation remains tame.The Fed's most influential dove in 2017 explained earlier this month why low inflation won't prevent a more hawkish policy turn: Policymakers need to stay ""vigilant"" to contain any financial-system excesses.Unemployment appears on course to fall to rarely-seen levels that tend to come with ""elevated risks of imbalances, whether in the form of high inflation in earlier decades or of financial imbalances in recent decades,"" Fed Governor Lael Brainard said, alluding to the dot-com and housing bubbles.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBrainard echoed new Fed Chair Jerome Powell's congressional testimony last month that economic headwinds have turned to tailwinds. Powell said there was still no evidence in the data that stronger growth has led to an acceleration in wage gains, which Fed theory sees as a precursor of upward price inflation.Yet once a pickup in wage growth materializes — and it's very likely to this spring after wage hikes by Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX), FedEx (FDX), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and others — Fed members will adjust rate-hike expectations upward, if they don't do so on Wednesday.Stocks overall have paused in recent weeks, with the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average all falling more than 1% Monday as Facebook (FB) triggered selling. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones are both below their 50-day moving averages. But the major averages have rallied sharply over the last several years. The major averages rose modestly on Tuesday.Brainard noted, ""While asset valuations appear to be elevated, overall risks to the financial system remain moderate because household borrowing is moderate"" and the banking system is ""well capitalized"" after financial reforms. Still, she said, ""We will need to be vigilant"" because a booming economy can lead to a relaxation in lending standards.Vigilance is code for being proactive, raising rates if the economy runs hot, even before any acceleration of inflation. Yet there's a risk that the Fed will overreact to faster growth this year and into 2019 which is fueled by a one-time fiscal boost from tax cuts and a big increase in federal spending. That's the recipe for a big economic slowdown late next year or in the first half of 2020.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Inflation And The Fed Rate-Hike Outlook: What You Need To KnowTrump Triple-Witching Week: The Fed, Tariffs And MuellerThese 5 Top Stocks Stood Out Monday

The recent IPO fell 9.8% on Wednesday but rose 5.6% for the week.Accenture (ACN) reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that topped expectations.

That normally would be a clear buying opportunity, but the triple-witching impact meant that investors couldn't know how much true institutional conviction buying was happening. However, shares have kept sprinting higher in active trade.Micron Technology earnings surged 566% in the November quarter vs. a year earlier, easily beating views. Sales leapt 71%, also topping forecasts. And the memory chip giant gave bullish guidance.Micron rose 24 cents to 43.95 in the regular session, just above its 50-day line.

48,FDX,"United Parcel Service (UPS) is showing it can make money from the surge in online shopping, just in time for the crucial holiday season.XRevenue for each package in the U.S. climbed 2% in the third quarter, the courier said Thursday as it reported earnings. That more than doubled the increase of a year earlier, before the world's largest package-delivery company implemented higher prices and new fees on over-sized items.The sales gain for each parcel is bolstering results as UPS seeks to reap the rewards of stepped-up investments in automated warehouses, new jets and upgraded technology. The year-end shopping rush will test the company's efforts to improve the efficiency of home deliveries, which are booming because of e-commerce — but are far less profitable than shipments to businesses.The ""result was impressive, particularly considering weather-related/natural disaster disruptions in the U.S.,"" Benjamin Hartford, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co., said in a note. ""International segment results remain outstanding.""UPS shares fell to 117 early, then rebounded off their 50-day moving average to climb 0.7% to 119.33 on the stock market today. Shares are in buy range from a 115.44 buy point decisively cleared on Sept. 11. FedEx (FDX) shares rose 1.55%, also still in buy range.UPS's earnings excluding certain items rose to $1.45 a share, matching the average of analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in the third quarter climbed 7% to $16 billion, topping the consensus forecast for $15.6 billion.The company said it would earn $5.85 to $6.10 a share this year, a nickel higher at the low end compared with the previous forecast.Drivers at UPS typically deliver only 1.1 packages to a household, compared with more than three to a business. While the company is investing heavily in automating its package-sorting facilities to make them more profitable, the added spending is expected to pressure operating profit by $200 million in the next few years.This summer, UPS announced it will charge most users of its residential ground network a peak-season fee of 27 cents a package during certain weeks in November and December, a first for the Atlanta-based company. That's persuading some customers to ship during weeks that aren't subject to the fee, although not all packages can be shifted, said Kate Gutmann, chief sales and solutions officer.""It's helping to steer where possible,"" she said.Customers are expected to send more packages during less busy periods to avoid the surcharges, UPS said on a conference call with investors and analysts.The question now is whether UPS can replicate its smooth holiday period of 2016, said Kevin Sterling, an analyst at Seaport Global Securities. In previous years, it underestimated demand for last-minute deliveries and failed to drop off packages by Christmas, or overestimated demand and wound up with idle workers and facilities.This year, UPS projected global holiday demand for 750 million packages. Deliveries between Black Friday and New Year's Eve will rise 5% from a year earlier, the company said.""UPS is a show-me story of how they handle fourth quarter and peak season,"" Sterling said.

53,FDX,"Executives from Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), JetBlue (JBLU), Southwest (LUV) and others met with President Trump at the White House on Thursday.As the meeting began, Trump said he would work to cut ""burdensome regulations"" in their industry and said the current air-traffic control system is obsolete. The president also said he would have an announcement related to taxes in the next few weeks.Gulf-carrier competition, which for years has been a major sore point for the U.S. network carriers, was not discussed, apparently, despite widespread expectations it would be high on Thursday's agenda.When asked by CNBC after the meeting if the subject came up, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said the focus of the meeting was ""solely"" on taxes, regulations and the need for infrastructure investments.However, Trump did allude to looming competition from abroad during introductory remarks at the meeting.""I know you're under pressure from a lot of foreign elements and foreign carriers — I've been hearing that a little bit,"" he said. ""At the same time, we want to make life good for them also. They come with big investments. In many cases, those investments are made by their governments.""Trump's executive order suspending immigration and refugees from seven largely Muslim nations deemed a security risk was not on the agenda, Bloomberg said. Airline stocks sank after that order was signed, on Jan. 27, amid concerns that it would hurt travel demand. Late Thursday, a U.S. appeals court upheld a lower court's suspension of the ban.Executives from Alaska Air Group (ALK), FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) were also set to attend, Bloomberg said. American Airlines' (AAL) CEO, Doug Parker, did not attend due to an already-scheduled management conference taking place.Delta shares were up 2.6% on the stock market today, while American rose 2.75% and United advanced 1.8%. JetBlue added 3.5%, Southwest rose 3% and Alaska Air rallied 1.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Norwegian Air International is an Irish subsidiary of Norwegian Air Shuttle, whose low-cost trans-Atlantic flights already pose more competition to Delta, American and United. The big three are trying a variety of cheap and expensive seats to compete. Following the meeting, statements from the airlines also notably left out any mention of the Gulf carriers.JetBlue: ""Today we had an extremely encouraging conversation with the president about modernizing our air traffic control system to reduce frustrating flight delays and further improve aviation safety. Everyone agreed we need an infrastructure plan that will once again give the American public an aviation system we can be proud of.""United: ""We share the President's passion for the tremendous opportunity this country has and his commitment to protecting and creating American jobs. We look forward to working together with the President on the many initiatives and issues that will make America better and the U.S. aviation industry the best in the world. This includes modernizing our aviation infrastructure and cutting the red tape that gets in the way of our industry's ability to deliver the best experience for our employees and customers.""Delta: ""We had a positive discussion about many of the major issues facing U.S. travelers, airline employees and the aviation industry, which is a vital economic engine for America.""The big three U.S. airlines have repeatedly complained that three Persian Gulf-region carriers — Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad — benefit from government subsidies that give them more room to expand and compete in the U.S. The Gulf carriers, in turn, have repeatedly denied that claim.The subsidies, the U.S. airlines say, violate the Open Skies agreements that facilitate cross-border service.""If left unchecked we will continue to see the Gulf carriers expand in the U.S. market, causing further harm to hard working Americans,"" CEOs from Delta, American and United said in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. ""In fact, for every long-haul route lost or foregone as a result of subsidized Gulf carrier competition, more than 1,500 American jobs are lost.""But a battle could be heating up over those agreements. CEOs of JetBlue, Hawaiian Holdings' (HA) Hawaiian Airlines, FedEx Express and Atlas Air (AAWW), in a letter dated Tuesday, urged Tillerson to reject the big three's demands to clamp down U.S. access to the Gulf carriers. Their letter, which expressed support for maintaining global Open Skies arrangements, said those demands ""would jeopardize Open Skies and reduce competition in an already overly concentrated U.S. airline market.""U.S. carriers also argue that Norwegian Air International's recently approved service to the U.S. would allow the carrier to dodge labor and safety rules, Bloomberg said.Trump also said he wanted travelers ""to have the greatest customer service with an absolute minimum of delays, and with the greatest convenience all at the lowest possible cost.""Those remarks follow the bruising that airline stocks took for much of last year and 2015 after airlines dropped fare prices in some markets to lure passengers. That competition damaged unit revenue, an important industry metric that gauges how much money an airline makes compared to its supply of seats and flights.Meanwhile, American Airlines said earlier Thursday that passenger traffic for January fell 0.3%, while carrying capacity rose 1.2%. American backed its first-quarter forecast for a 2.5%-4.5% increase in unit revenue and adjusted pretax margin of 3%-5%.RELATED:Delta Air Lines Sees Market Share Pressure Over AtlanticJetBlue Trims Capacity, Delta Upgraded, Ryanair Warns On EuropeAlaska Air Beats Q4 Forecasts; Trump, Carriers To MeetAirline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back Up

54,FDX,"The broad stock market outpaced JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund (SEEGX) in three of 2016's four quarters. But the market has turned into a brisk tailwind for the fund this year. That's a boon for investors holding the fund in retirement accounts and other portfolios.The $12.5 billion fund's 9.07% advance year-to-date going into Friday topped 87% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its direct rivals averaged only 7.52%.That recent run contrasts with the past 12 months, when the fund's still-enviable 21.40% gain lagged 55% of its peers.The fund's recent spring got a boost from chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO), an IBD Leaderboard stock and part of the IBD 50. The stock is up 19% so far this year.IBD'S TAKE: Despite reversing lower Thursday, Broadcom is generally acting well after clearing a 208.85 three-weeks-tight entry Feb. 17. Shares have notched a 20% profit since their initial breakout. Many stocks pull back or start a new base after this level, so investors may want to consider locking-in some profits, as IBD's Leaderboard notes. Investors with more conviction may decide to hold for further gains before taking profits.The fund also got a lift from electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA), a smaller holding that is up 20% this year. On Wednesday, Tesla said its aggressive production plan for its mass-market Model 3 sedan was still on track. But the car- and battery maker reported a fourth-quarter loss of 69 cents per share, which was more than the 42-cent loss expected by analysts. Earnings per share rose 88%, beating the consensus estimate.Tesla also released information about development of its battery factories.Tesla shares' fall on Wednesday and Thursday triggered the stock's move from IBD's Leaderboard to the Cut List. The pullback left shares well below an alternative buy point of 269.44 and mildly below a regular 258.57 entry.Facebook (FB), a top-10 holding as of Jan. 31 and part of the IBD 50, was another top performer for the fund. The social media giant, which the fund has been trimming in recent disclosures, is up 18% this year.Facebook is ranked No. 4 in IBD's Internet-Content industry group. It has a good 89 Composite Rating from IBD. And its annual pretax margin is 60%.Amazon (AMZN), another top-10 holding, is up 14% so far this year.The online retailer and provider of cloud services sports a so-so 78 IBD Comp Rating, but that has not prevented mutual funds from boosting their stakes as a group for eight quarters in a row. The estimated earnings per share growth this year for the company is a solid 48%.Among other holdings, five of seven top new buys as of Dec. 31 had Comp Ratings in the 80s or 90s.Those included UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Southwest Airlines (LUV), MercadoLibra (MELI), Morgan Stanley (MS) and FedEx (FDX). UnitedHealth and FedEx are forming basing patterns. The others are extended from recent buy areas.UnitedHealth, a health care insurer and benefits provider, has posted EPS growth of 17%, 13% 23% and 51% the past four frames. It is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, thanks in part to four straight years of annual EPS growth.Southwest has seen two quarters in a row of declining EPS, with another decline expected for the current quarter. Still, its three-year average annual EPS growth rate is 56%. And its annual EPS have grown for five straight years.Argentine-based MercadoLibra is Latin America's No. 1 e-commerce company. It is often referred to as the eBay (EBAY) of Latin America. It is ranked No. 3 in IBD's Internet-Retail group. It boasts a good 94 Comp Rating, and four consecutive years of annual EPS growth.Morgan Stanley, with a strong 98 Comp Rating, is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Banks-Money Center industry group. Revenue grew 14% and 22% the past two quarters. EPS is expected to rise 17% this year.Delivery service FedEx is another No. 1 ranked stock in its industry group, Transport-Air Freights in its case. Still, EPS growth has slowed for two quarters, growing 24%, 20% and 9% the past three stanzas. Its three-years average annual EPS growth rate is 23%. And it has delivered three straight years of annual EPS growth.Several of the fund's top holdings are household names like Apple (AAPL) and MasterCard (MA). In addition, four top-10 holdings have Comp Ratings in the 80s and 90s, including Home Depot (HD), Nvidia (NVDA) and Comcast (CMCSA).Graphics chipmaker Nvidia, for example, has a top-notch 99 Comp Rating — the highest possible — and six straight quarters of EPS growth acceleration. Sales shot up 55% last quarter.RELATED:Reynolds American Bolsters JPMorgan Large Cap Growth FundWhere Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 2017

57,FDX,"United Parcel Service (UPS) fell short of Wall Street estimates for the critical holiday fourth-quarter Tuesday and gave weak full-year guidance. While Amazon (AMZN) and e-commerce has been a boon to UPS and rival FedEx (FDX), it's also a problem.UPS saw a ""significant shift in mix to lower revenue products,"" CEO David Abney said on the conference call, with residential deliveries accounting for 63% of total package volume. Abney said Q4's results indicate that UPS should ""quicken the pace"" of investments and network shifts to handle increasing e-commerce.Meanwhile, Amazon confirmed late Tuesday that it will builds its first air hub in Kentucky, near Cincinnati, Ohio.Here are the results and outlook:Estimates: Earnings per share up 8% to $1.69.

64,FDX,"It's not hard to find top growth stocks in IBD's Sector Leaders screen. ZTO Express (ZTO), one of many top growth stocks based in China, debuted in Monday's screen. The screen also includes China names Baozun (BZUN) and Alibaba (BABA).ZTO Express is an express delivery firm with a market capitalization of around $12.8 billion. It's very liquid with an average daily volume of 2.7 million shares.It was an inauspicious debut for ZTO Express when it went public in October 2016 at 19.50 a share. The good news at the time was that it priced above the proposed range of 16.50 to 18.50 a share. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were the underwriters. The bad news is that the stock headed lower after its first week of trading. Shares fell about 35% over the next four months.Fast forward to today, however, and a booming e-commerce market in China is fueling growth at ZTO Express. Just like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) deliver packages for Amazon.com (AMZN), ZTO Express does the same for Alibaba.Earlier this month, the company reported adjusted profit of 17 cents a share, up 70% from the year-ago quarter. The results marked the second straight quarter of accelerating growth. Sales growth, meanwhile, accelerated for the fourth straight quarter, rising 48% to $563.4 million.Parcel volume in the fourth quarter totaled 2.015 billion, up 35.8% from the year-ago period. Full-year parcel volume in 2017 increased 38.3% from 2016. Parcel volume market share increased 15.5% in 2017 from 14.4% in 2016.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn the Q4 press release, CEO Meisong Lai commented: ""We are optimistic about the growth prospects of the express delivery industry in China. As China enters the new retail era with e-commerce continuing to grow, industrywide parcel volume is estimated to increase from 40.1 billion parcels in 2017 to approximately 70 billion in 2020, according to the State Post Bureau.""ZTO Express is near the top of a long consolidation that started in November. The conventional entry is 18.18, 10 cents above the Nov. 10 intraday high of 18.08.Since ZTO Express is relatively new as a publicly traded company, fund sponsorship is on the light side.At the end of Q4, 155 funds owned shares. But if ZTO Express maintains its growth trajectory, an increase in fund sponsorship wouldn't be surprising at all.RELATED:Best Chinese Stocks To Buy And WatchAs Baozun Bounces, This Top-Ranked Chinese Stock Nears Buy Zone

75,FDX,"As malls die, Macy's (M) plans huge job cuts, and Sears (SHLD) closes 150 stores, online sales on sites like Amazon (AMZN) and devices like your Apple (AAPL) iPhone, to the surprise of perhaps nobody, were higher during the 2016 holiday season.Online sales rose 11% a record $91.7 billion, Adobe (ADBE) said Thursday, slightly surpassing the company's own expectations for $91.6 billion. More of those sales were made via mobile devices, which drove half of site visits, Adobe said. Mobile sales jumped 23% to $28.43 billion.Other surveys have suggested that Amazon grabbed a huge share of that e-commerce growth. But it didn't entirely hog the spotlight. Online auction site eBay (EBAY) was the most mentioned retailer on social media, ""with eBay sellers promoting their items for purchase and eBay buyers highlighting products they bought that they couldn't find in stores,"" Adobe said.Amazon shares rose 3.1% to 780.45 in heavy volume on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day moving average. Amazon hadn't closed above that key support level since Oct. 27, when the online giant missed earnings estimates and gave cautious guidance.Shares of eBay edged up, continuing to trade comfortably above their 50-day. Apple, which announced December App Store revenue hit $3 billion in December, also nudged higher, close to a buy point.Amazon, Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) lagged eBay in social-media mentions.Pokemon Sun/Moon was the most frequently mentioned product, followed by Barbie, Oculus and Legos.""But it's not just the total online sales figure that made this a historic holiday shopping season,"" said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst and director at Adobe Digital Insights, in a statement. ""This year, Black Friday set a new record by surpassing the $3 billion mark for the first time at $3.34 billion, with high growth in the evening hours.""Black Friday also became the first day in retail history to bring in more than $1 billion in mobile sales, she said.And Adobe's report indicated that more people are doing their buying later in the holiday season — posing more challenges to the delivery infrastructures of UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX).Sales accelerated closer to the end of last month, Adobe said, as shipping cutoff dates approached and more customers made purchases online and picked them up in stores.IBD'S TAKE: As malls become relics of the retail and real estate world and Amazon comes to dominate more forms of commerce, many store chains will face a reckoning this year.The gains in online sales have come at the expense of many brick-and-mortar retailers. Macy's and Kohl's (KSS) slashed earnings views late Wednesday as both reported a 2.1% same-store sales decline in November and December. Barnes & Noble (BKS) also said holiday sales were grim, while Sears announced a new raft of store closures and sold its Craftsman tool line.Macy's shares crashed 14% Thursday, Kohl's 19% and Barnes & Noble nearly 7%. Other department stores, apparel retailers and makers and other retail-related groups were big losers Thursday.Those follow other signs that physical stores were suffering.Handbag maker and retailer Kate Spade (KATE) is reportedly exploring a sale, while Nordstrom (JWN) management, according to a JPMorgan report, said brick-and-mortar traffic was at its worst levels in more than 40 years.Off-price retailers, however, have fared better against the likes of Amazon in part due to their ""treasure hunt"" appeal, in which shoppers don't entirely know what kind of bargain they're going to find.RELATED:Christmas Meltdown: Macy's, Kohl's, Kors, Fossil, L Brands, OthersWhat's Driving The Success Of 'Un-Amazon-Able' Ulta Beauty?Ross Stores: A No-Nonsense Retailer Free From Amazon's Clutches

Electronic and appliance stores edged up just 0.1% while clothiers' sales were flat.

Shares of Target and many brick-and-mortar retailers rallied sharply following the election and amid relatively upbeat earnings and outlooks. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, also has risen, despite a brief sell-off on weaker-than-expected Q3 sales. Target, Wal-Mart and many traditional retailers are seeing significant online sales growth.As for hot products, the Apple iPhone 7 likely will be a solid seller. Apple iPads and Samsung 4K TV were hot sellers on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, thanks to big discounts.Hefty discounts make it hard to tell if a retailer's holiday sales will translate into big profits or weak margins.Next week, FedEx (FDX) will report quarterly earnings, with close attention paid to the shipping giant's comments about holiday shipments. FedEx and UPS (UPS) offer a rough proxy for e-commerce sales.Also next week, Nike (NKE) and mall-based athletic shoe retailer Finish Line (FINL) should give an idea about holiday demand for athletic footwear and apparel.In stock market trading, Amazon ended the trading day down 0.7% to 768.82, still below its 50-day moving average.

Just how much can the U.S. economy, which delivered solid June jobs growth on Friday, still grow after a nine-year expansion?Analysts expect another blowout quarter in Q2 — 20.7% earnings-per-share growth for S&P 500 index components and an 8.1% jump in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. Wall Street is betting on continued scorching results for the rest of the year. But they may not be as scorching if President Donald Trump's trade wars with China, Canada, Mexico, Europe and others become more heated. The quiet earnings growth next year might be even more muted.Analysts say the effects of a trade war have yet to be priced into financial forecasts.""I think the first tangible impact should start showing up in estimate revisions as these earnings results come out,"" said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks.In other words, the second-quarter earnings season could offer some higher drama than CEOs' usual blanched remarks about ""headwinds"" and ""tailwinds."" Investors, even more than usual, will focus on earnings guidance and post-earnings call commentary to get some answers as to how the tariffs will affect profit, sales, prices, corporate strategy and shareholder returns.Higher costs for parts and supplies that U.S. companies bring in from overseas could mean higher costs for customers. Businesses could rethink or even uproot complex global supply chains. Higher prices on U.S.-made goods sold overseas could crimp international demand. Companies could cut or delay major investments.S&P 500 index companies, filled with hundreds of U.S. multinationals and exporters, are more exposed to tariffs and global demand than the U.S. economy itself.As for the second-quarter itself, the gains from S&P 500 companies come courtesy of President Trump's tax cuts and an enduring U.S. economy.Rebounding oil prices will lift the energy sector's Q2 earnings by around 141.5%, with sales up some 20%, according to Thomson. S&P 500 energy stocks, which include Dow Jones giants Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as ConocoPhillips (COP), Valero (VLO), Marathon Oil (MRO), Schlumberger (SLB) and many others, have generally been strong performers.Analysts expect the S&P 500 financials to clock a 22% gain in earnings on a 4.5% bump in revenue, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other banks enjoy lower taxes and deregulation. Thomson forecasts semiconductors and internet software and services to lead the S&P 500 tech components toward 25.5% earnings growth. Tech revenue is seen jumping 12%. Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) are all slated to deliver solid-to-stellar growth.As estimates stand now, Thomson Reuters is forecasting the 20%-plus earnings growth to reach into the third and fourth quarters.""The last time we had earnings growth in Q3 and Q4 like this was in 2010,"" Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters, said in an email.However, looking past 2018, analysts appear to have a harder time justifying bullish expectations for S&P 500 companies.""You look at the numbers going forward, you really don't start to see a significant drop in growth until you get into 2019, when again, you'll be back to apples-to-apples on the tax rates,"" said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.But tougher comparisons aren't a massive concern right now, analysts say. And next year's growth still looks solid. Dhillon said that for 2019 investors can expect a 9.7% earnings growth rate, ""which is still higher than the 20-year average of 7.3%.""Wall Street also worries that the U.S. economy has fewer tools at its disposal to keep its marathon run going. The dollar is stronger. The yield curve is flatter due partly to the Federal Reserve's decisions to lift short-term interest rates.The narrowing yield curve, the gap between rates on short-term and long-term government debt, looms large for banks in particular. The flatter curve, also seen as a precursor to an economic downturn, has dragged bank stocks lower in recent months.Banks also lend money to borrowers based on long-term rates, but borrow from depositors according to short-term rates. The narrower the difference between the two, the narrower the banks' net interest margins. JPMorgan, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report second-quarter earnings on Friday.The three banking giants, which all announced hefty shareholder-return packages last month, are expected to deliver solid EPS growth. But JPMorgan stock, along with that of Citigroup, Wells Fargo and others, is near 2018 lows.When the Fed raises rates that affects the money flowing into global, emerging markets as well.""If U.S. interest rates are going up,"" Mian said, ""and an investor or a class of investors is scouring world markets for yield and returns, and if the yield and return is going up in a developed market like the U.S., then there's no reason to take the extra risk of going to Argentina or Turkey when you can get it in the U.S.""The U.S. on Friday lobbed tariffs at $34 billion worth of Chinese products — more than 800 types of products total. That's the first part of a $50 billion response for what Trump says are China's trade abuses against the U.S.The U.S. tariffs target aircraft parts, industrial parts and equipment, some vehicles and other machinery. The duties from the U.S. targeted products related to China's tech-focused ""Made in China 2025"" plan. Trump has said that initiative would ""hurt economic growth for the United States and many other countries.""""The United States can no longer tolerate losing our technology and intellectual property through unfair economic practices,"" Trump said in a statement last month.China on Friday responded with penalties of its own on U.S. products, including automakers and agriculture. China aimed those tariffs squarely at Trump's base.Trump has threatened to levy another $200 billion in tariffs on China, and even more. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to impose a global import tariff on autos. That follows duties on steel and aluminum that have spurred Europe, Canada and Mexico to retaliate.Further trade discord could force companies to rethink their supply chains. Those adjustments could undo corporate America's efforts over the past two decades to more efficiently manage their inventories. Such practices over that time firmed up businesses' balance sheets.The brinkmanship has swept up some of the most iconic American businesses along the way. General Motors (GM) said as much last week, warning that more tariffs would lead to ""reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company.""Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would offer more detail, on its earnings call this month, about its plans to move some production out of the U.S. to skirt tariffs from the EU. Brown-Forman (BFB) is raising the price of Jack Daniel's in parts of Europe because of the tariffs imposed by the EU.No one knows how the Trump trade wars, and their impact on S&P 500 companies, will play out.""We expect company-specific risks from tariffs and China-trade exposures to be a central discussion topic during 2Q18 earnings calls,"" RBC analyst Deane Dray, who covers industrials vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, wrote in a note last month. ""But no one has a crystal ball on how the tariff situation will ultimately play out, especially the potential knock-on effects.""He said companies like 3M (MMM) and Danaher (DHR) looked best equipped among industrials to handle the trade disputes.The trade war also threatens chipmakers like Micron (MU). A Chinese court blocked sales of some of its chips in the country, a move seen as pushback from the nation against Trump's trade salvos. China has held up approving the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Boeing (BA) isn't subject to China tariffs, but Beijing could favor Airbus (EADSY) jets in a protracted U.S.-China trade war. The aerospace company in April downplayed worries over a trade war.Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford covers transportation and logistics companies like UPS (UPS), FedEx (FDX) and Expeditors International (EXPD). Hartford wrote in a research note last month that he'd seen no ""material evidence (yet) of freight volume weakness amid rising global trade tensions.""Some analysts, like Tigress' Ivan Feinseth, expressed optimism that strength in corporate earnings would offset any trade damage. Others wonder how much a trade war will hurt corporate travel for the likes of global carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and cargo demand broadly. Delta Air earnings are due Thursday.""We still expect demand to grow, but those expectations are dampened with each new tariff introduced,"" Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said of air cargo demand in a statement this week.

88,FDX,"Stocks dug into substantial early losses early Tuesday, as an intensifying U.S.-China trade spat triggered a deep sell-off across Asian stock markets. China trade-sensitive stocks, including Boeing (BA) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), posted heavy declines on the Dow and the Nasdaq 100.A broad range of China stocks spearheaded the early losses. JD.com (JD), Ctrip.com International (CTRP), Baidu (BIDU), Huya (HUYA) and JinkoSolar (JKS) were among the deepest decliners.The Dow Jones industrial avereage came off opening lows, but was down 1.2% shortly after the start of trade. Boeing and Caterpillar (CAT) led the downside. More than half of the Dow's 30 issues fell more than 1%.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each shed 0.7%. About a dozen S&P 500 names sold down more than 2%. China trade sensitive names CF Industries (CF), Freeport McMoRan (FCX) and General Motors (GM) fell furthest.China names were among the Nasdaq's worst decliners. JD.com, NetEase and Baidu had three of the Nasdaq 100's four worst losses.Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors continued to ping-pong on U.S.-China news, as the Senate passed a bill Monday that would reinstate stiff penalties vs. China telecom giant ZTE Corp. Qualcomm (QCOM) has been attempting to acquire the NXP in a $43 billion deal which China's regulators reportedly approved last week. But the approval had been hitched to President Trump's forgiving ZTE for its violations of trade sanctions vs. North Korea. On Tuesday, NXP dropped 1.8% to one of the Nasdaq 100's deepest early losses. Qualcomm was down 1.6%.The Dow has five straight declines under its belt, falling back below the 25,000 level on Monday. The index appears headed for a break of its 50-day line at Tuesday's open, although premarket action does not always follow through into regular trade.  The S&P 500 ended Monday 3% above its 50-day line. The Nasdaq remains just a fraction off Thursday's high, and 5% above its 50-day level.With 25% tariffs on $50 billion on imports from China set to kick in on July 6, China has said it would impose equal penalties on U.S. imports. If those tariffs go into place, President Trump on Monday said he would increase the scope of U.S. tariffs to $200 billion worth of China goods.As a result, Asian stock markets careened lower Tuesday. The yuan dropped to a five-month low against the dollar and investors scrambled to get out of the way of the worsening trade dispute. The Shanghai Composite swooned 3.8%, the Shenzhen Composite dived 5.3% as more than 1,000 stocks hit their daily 10% loss maximum circuit breaker. The selling quickly infected Japan's market, where Tokyo's Nikkei 225 plummeted 1.8%, cutting below its 50-day moving average.Asia's rout moderated somewhat in Europe, where markets traded sharply lower in afternoon trade. Frankfurt's DAX fell hardest, down 1.3%. The CAC-40 in Paris was 1.2% in the red, while London's FTSE 100 dimmed 0.5%.Sellers went after a number of China-based stocks in early U.S. trade. JinkoSolar dropped more than 4%. JD.com, Ctrip and Weibo (WB) all showed losses deeper than 3%.  Among the scorching-hot trio of China IPOs: Huya, iQiyi (IQ) and Bilibili (BILI), gtwo reversed premarket losses and punched higher: Huya gained a fraction. IQiyi scored a 3% gain. All three stocks are due for price consolidation, and pullbacks could present investors with buy opportunities.Another China-based IPO, Sogou (SOGO), broke out on Friday, then retook its cup-base buy point Monday in a huge-volume gain. Shares dropped 3.8% before Tuesday's open, holding just above the base's 14.80 buy point.China names also led the early declines among IBD 50 stocks. China Lodging (HTHT) dropped 3.6%. YY (YY) fell 1.9%. Momo (MOMO) dumped 3.7%. The declines did not do significant damage to the charts of either China Lodging or Momo.The loss dealt a setback to YY, which has been struggling to build the right side of a three-month base pattern.On the Dow, Boeing unraveled 3.2%, cutting below support at its 10-week moving average in heavy trade. The stock is trading below a 365.10 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. A fall below 335.89 would trigger the automatic sell rule.Verizon (VZ) scored one of the Dow's lonely early gains, rising 1%. Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to buy, from hold. Verizon has been attempting to start up the right side of a four-month base pattern.China-based Autohome (ATHM) notched the deepest early loss among IBD Leaderboard names. Autohome dived 3.9% at Tuesday's open. The stock is extended after clearing an ascending-base buy point at 107.64 on May 30.In economic news, U.S. housing starts jumped more than expected in May. The Commerce Department reported starts rising to an annualized rate of 1.35 million for the month, up from 1.286 million in April and above consensus forecasts for an increase to 1.32 million.Building permits, which gauge upcoming building activity, slipped to an annualized pace of 1.301 million. That was down from April's 1.352 million pace and well short of views for a jump to 1.35 million starts.FedEx (FDX), Oracle (ORCL) and La-Z-Boy (LZB) report quarterly results after today's closing bell.(For updates on this story and other market coverage, visit stock news today)RELATED:Dow Slips, Techs Recover, Small Caps Lead; Tesla Extends GainsOnly A Stock Market Rout Can Avert A Trump Trade WarIf You Missed These Explosive China Stocks, Here's How You Could Get InThese Stocks Just Came On – And Off – IBD's Stock ListsIBD Stock Of The Day: Newest S&P 500 Member Blasts Into Buy Range

The cartel will increase the official production target by 1 million barrels per day. The actual boost will likely be around 600,000 bpd as some members like Venezuela are unable to ramp up. Oil prices and stocks, which had trended lower ahead of the meeting, rebounded Friday. Crude futures rose more than 5% for the week to $68.58 a barrel, with the most of the gains coming Friday.

That should provide a GDP boost near term. But existing-home sales unexpectedly slipped 0.4% in May, and 3% from a year ago amid tight supply and higher mortgage rates. Rising mortgage rates have hit affordability and seem to have slowed the increase in home prices. The FHFA house price index edged up just 0.1% in April and 6.4% from a year ago, slowing from 7.4% earlier this year. A Housing Market Index dipped in June, but still shows builders are upbeat.PayPal Holdings (PYPL) agreed to buy Hyperwallet Systems for $400 million, expanding its global payments platform.

Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW) now meets that criteria, with an increase from 74 to 85 Friday. X When looking for the best stocks to buy and watch, one factor to watch closely is relative price strength.This unique rating tracks technical performance by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that indicates how a stock's price action over the trailing 52 weeks matches up against other publicly traded companies. History shows that the stocks that go on to make the biggest gains often have an 80 or better RS Rating in the early stages of their moves.Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereAtlas Air Worldwide broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 67.00 entry from a flat base. If a stock you're watching clears a buy point then falls 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base.

104,FDX,"The Fed hiked its key interest rate on Wednesday, surprising no one, while signaling no rush to step up its gradual pace of monetary tightening this year. The S&P 500 index and other major averages, after initially extending modest pre-announcement gains, then weakened as Jerome Powell held his first post-meeting news conference as Federal Reserve chairman.The initial market focus was on the Fed's near-term policy trajectory, but the takeaway may not be quite so positive once investors digest the more hawkish long-term outlook which hints at concern that there's greater risk of the economy overheating.As in December, the quarterly economic projections reflecting the individual views of each Federal Reserve policymaker pointed to a likelihood of three quarter-point rate hikes in 2018, not four, as Goldman Sachs and some other Wall Street firms anticipate. But the Fed did step up its rate-hike outlook for 2019.Fed policymakers now expect three quarter-point rate hikes in 2019, up from two in December, as the jobless rate falls to 3.6% in 2019 and core inflation rises to 2.1%, just above the Fed's target.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Fed's patience could give stocks a bit of running room as policymakers await evidence that faster economic growth, fueled by the big Trump tax cut and spending increases that have yet to hit, will boost wage growth and inflation.Powell said that if the Fed hikes too fast, ""inflation doesn't get up to 2%.""The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite initially extended moderate gains following the 2 p.m. ET policy statement. But after Powell began speaking at 2:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq  led the averages into negative territory in the stock market today. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 fell 0.2% while the Nasdaq lost 0.3%. However, the small-cap Russell 2000 managed to climb 0.6%.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones remain below their 50-day moving averages, while the Nasdaq recently found support at that key level. Bank stocks were among the gainers after the Fed meeting, thanks to signals that policymakers are willing to let the economy run at least a little hotter.The 10-year Treasury yield initially slipped after the announcement, then turned higher to about 2.92%, before backtracking as stocks weakened. The yield is not too far off the key 3% threshold that hasn't been breached in more than four years.If there's one reason why stocks turned lower as Powell spoke, it could be because of his discussion of the significance of the Fed, for the first time, expecting above-target core inflation of 2.1%. The forecast raises the question of whether the Fed may really think of the 2% inflation target as symmetric — meaning that the current undershoot should be balanced out by a future overshoot.Yet Powell, in his press conference, said policymakers will aim to avoid any ""sustained or persistent deviations.""""We're always going to be seeking 2%.""Investors probably shouldn't be too reassured by a largely status-quo announcement on 2018 policy from the Fed. There's good reason to expect policymakers to step up their expectations to four 2018 Fed rate hikes by June — even if inflation remains tame.Once a pickup in wage growth materializes — and it's very likely to this spring after wage hikes by Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX), FedEx (FDX), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and others — Fed members will likely adjust rate-hike expectations upward.The Fed's most influential dove, Lael Brainard, in 2017 explained earlier this month why low inflation won't prevent a more hawkish policy turn: Policymakers need to stay ""vigilant"" to contain any financial-system excesses.Unemployment appears on course to fall to rarely seen levels that tend to come with ""elevated risks of imbalances, whether in the form of high inflation in earlier decades or of financial imbalances in recent decades,"" Fed Governor Brainard said, alluding to the dot-com and housing bubbles.Brainard echoed new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's congressional testimony last month that economic headwinds have turned to tailwinds. Powell said there was still no evidence in the data that stronger growth has led to an acceleration in wage gains, which Fed theory sees as a precursor of upward price inflation.Brainard noted, ""While asset valuations appear to be elevated, overall risks to the financial system remain moderate because household borrowing is moderate"" and the banking system is ""well-capitalized"" after financial reforms. Still, she said, ""We will need to be vigilant"" because a booming economy can lead to a relaxation in lending standards.Vigilance is code for being proactive, raising rates if the economy runs hot, even before any acceleration of inflation. Yet there's a risk that the Fed will overreact to faster growth this year and into 2019, which is fueled by a one-time fiscal boost from tax cuts and a big increase in federal spending. That's the recipe for a big economic slowdown late next year or in the first half of 2020.Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other bank stocks, which can benefit from higher short-term rates, especially when long-term interest rates rise even more, were only slightly higher before the Fed meeting statement on Wednesday, though JPMorgan Chase saw healthier gains. Bank of America and JPMorgan rose a little more after the announcement.Even though the 10-year yield was slightly lower, the 2-year yield fell a little more. A wider yield spread is good for bank profits.E-brokers are among financial stocks that benefit from a higher Fed interest rate, in part because  floating-rate margin loans for trading accounts are based on short-term rates that move in tandem with Fed policy. TD Ameritrade (AMTD) CFO Stephen Boyle said on the Jan. 23 earnings call that the next 25-basis-point increase to the Fed's target rate could yield an estimated $60 million to $110 million in pretax income. Shares of Ameritrade were up slightly ahead of the Fed announcement and rose a little more later.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Inflation And The Fed Rate-Hike Outlook: What You Need To KnowTrump's China Trade War Could Start To Get Real ThursdayForget Facebook: Why These 5 Chip Stocks Are Stock Market Bullish'China's Amazon' JD.com Has These Futuristic Projects In The Works

105,FDX,"Having a growth strategy has paid off well for American Century All Cap Growth Fund (TWGTX) since the start of the 2009 bull market. And the fund's early purchase of its largest holding Alphabet (GOOGL) in early 2009 might have something to do with it beating the S&P 500 since then.X The $1.2 billion fund is up 4.09% this year through Feb. 22, ahead of S&P 500's return of 1.41% and its large-growth Morningstar category's 4.12%. The fund also has returned a stellar 20.75% in the past year, plus average annual returns of 10.42% and 14.22% in the past three and five years, beating the S&P 500 for the one-year, but slightly lagging it for the other periods.The fund recently changed managers. Gregory Woodhams, senior vice president and co-chief investment officer of American  Century's global growth equity, and Joe Reiland, vice president and portfolio manager, took over the fund's management as of Feb. 16. Before that, Michael Orndorff and Marcus Scott comanaged the fund for the past nine and six years, respectively.American Century All Cap Growth strives to invest in companies that show continuous accelerating earnings growth and a strong price momentum. While it can invest in companies of all sizes, over 70% of its holdings fall into the large-cap category, 25% comprise midcap stocks, with the remaining allocation in small caps. It primarily invests in U.S. stocks, but had a less-than-5% allocation to foreign equities as of Dec. 31.Last year, the fund benefited from the risk-on rally that began shortly after Donald Trump won the election in November 2016. Growth stocks were lifted on expectations of President Trump's stimulus package for individuals and businesses, a solid earnings season and overall economic strength.Stock selection played a large role in the fund's performance in 2017, as much on the positive as the negative side. Its top-10 holdings represent 37% of the fund and include names such as Alphabet, IBD Leaderboard member Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Mastercard (MA) and FedEx (FDX). These stocks soared between 33% and 53% last year.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersAmong the fund's largest sectors are technology at 30% of the portfolio, consumer cyclical 17%, health care 15% and financials 12%.

Its earnings and revenue skyrocketed between 94% and 216% the past four quarters. Earnings per share jumped 110% last year and analysts estimate a 29% increase this year. The maker of GoToMeeting, OpenVoice and join.me also recently announced it will acquire cloud-based phone system provider Jive Communications and Unified Communications. Shares of LogMeIn advanced 20% last year. The stock is 13% off its Feb. 15 all-time high, having sliced through its 50-day moving average after the company reported 94% gain in earnings that beat expectations, but was light on revenue.Within the software space, creative design program maker Adobe Systems (ADBE) and customer relationship management firm Salesforce.com (CRM) also did well, each jumping 70.2% and 49.3% last year, and 15.3% and 12% year to date. Adobe, which successfully transitioned to cloud-based recurring subscription services recently announced that its longtime CFO Mark Garrett will be retiring. The maker of Photoshop and Acrobat plans to grow its e-commerce business. It's also on IBD's Leaderboard.Among banks, which are expected to benefit from rising interest rates, the fund holds Zions Bancorp (ZION) and SVB Financial (SIVB)). The holding company for Zion Bank, which operates via 436 branches in 11 Western and Southwestern states reported double-digit earnings growth in the past six quarters. Its stock is up 8% so far in 2018 after advancing 19% last year.The holding company for Silicon Valley Bank SVB Financial reported accelerating earnings and sales growth in the last five quarters. In the most recent quarter, earnings per share rose 53% on revenue growth of 32%. The stock rose 36% in 2017 and 5% this year.Among key detractors to American Century All Cap's performance in 2017 were biotech stocks such as Shire (SHPG), where despite reporting good results, ""investor concerns over competitive threats to the company's hemophilia franchise weighed on the shares,"" notes the latest fund annual report. Shire's stock fell 6.3% last year.Natural gas producer Range Resources (RRC) also was a drag on performance due to unfavorable weather conditions and gas prices.

106,FDX,"So far this year, cyclical industries such as oil suppliers, fertilizer, transport and steelmakers are leading IBD's 197 industry stock groups. That reflects confidence in the U.S. and global economy as well as benefits from the Trump tax cuts. The corporate tax cuts are likely to benefit energy and other old-economy sectors more than tech giants that can more easily avoid taxes.X While 2018 has barely gotten started, most of these groups have been top performers over the past several weeks. Investors need to be watching for sector rotations so they are always focusing on the leading groups and stocks.Many of the stocks in these groups are either extended from breakouts (FedEx (FDX), U.S. Steel (X)) or still recovering from long downtrends (Schlumberger (SLB)). But a few, including steelmaker Nucor (NUE) and Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM), are in or near buy range.S&P 500 futures rose 0.25% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.3%. Dow futures advanced 0.2%.The Chemicals-Agriculture group has soared 13% so far in 2018. This includes fertilizer makers such as CF Industries (CF).But Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile, which makes specialty fertilizers, is also now seen as a lithium play. Sociedad Química y Minera has a 63.90 buy point, closing Wednesday at 61.81. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is lagging somewhat after a strong three-month uptrend to late September.Mining giant Rio Tinto (RIO) reportedly has dropped out of the bidding for a 32% SQM stake owned by Nutrien (NTR), Bloomberg reported late Wednesday, citing sources. Fertilizer giant Nutrien, formed from the merger of Potash Corp. and Agrium, agreed to sell the SQM holdings to win regulatory approval.Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) is now viewed as an indirect legal marijuana play.This group is up 8.7% this year. Group giants include Schlumberger and Halliburton (HAL). Crude oil prices have risen to three-year highs above $63 a barrel in the U.S. But oil services stocks were slower to rebound than many shale producers as customers remained reluctant to step up spending. Both Schlumberger  and Halliburton on working on the right side of long, deep consolidations.This related energy group has climbed 8% in 2018. Notable members include Baker Hughes, a General Electric Co. (BHGE).This small group, dominated by FedEx and UPS (UPS), has rallied 8% as well. FedEx and UPS stocks are extended.Steelmakers have climbed 7.9% this year. Steel stocks were among the big immediate winners after President Trump's election, but then made little headway for most of 2017 before moving higher in Q4. U.S. Steel and Steel Dynamics (STLD) are extended, but Nucor is just in range from a 66.10 entry in a consolidation going back nearly 10 months.

107,FDX,"After nine straight down days on the S&P 500, the indexes bounced back hard Monday. Several top-rated stocks, including Planet Fitness (PLNT) and FedEx (FDX), also rebounded strongly. While one up day doesn't guarantee the market has shaken off recent selling pressure and is ready to keep heading higher, it does mean you want to make sure your watch list…
"
108,FDX,"A little more than 10 years ago, Amazon.com (AMZN) unveiled a service that business customers embraced because it saved them money, letting them pay only for the computing power and storage capacity they actually used, hosted on computers they didn't own but accessed via the internet.This early experiment in cloud computing is now called Amazon Web Services. With more than 1 million users per month, AWS is expected to surpass $13 billion in 2016 sales. That puts it in a similar league in size and growth to all of Amazon in its first 11 years.And its parent company? This year, revenue will likely come in near $145 billion, and Amazon is reaching into new businesses of all kinds to keep its sales and share price growing.In his letter to shareholders in April, founder and CEO Jeff Bezos wrote that Amazon — which originally billed itself merely as ""the world's biggest bookstore"" — wants to be ""an invention machine."" And so it's full throttle in such fields as delivery services (including deliveries via drones), computerized warehouses, online video and music services, tablets, personal digital assistants, and no doubt more arenas besides e-commerce and cloud services. Even physical stores are now part of the plan.""Amazon is doing a marvelous job at becoming a bigger and bigger part of daily lives,"" Trip Miller, managing partner of hedge fund Gullane Capital Partners, which holds a position in Amazon, told IBD. ""They want to be a one-stop shop for consumers. (They are) making it less likely customers will switch to another service.""Winning big new markets is by no means assured, and Amazon's spending on its far-flung initiatives is immense, which already has created earnings disappointments.  But Amazon's growth record so far speaks for itself. As Bezos put it, 20 years ago he was driving some boxes to the post office and thinking about forklifts. In a letter to shareholders a year later, Bezos wrote that online bookselling, and e-commerce in general, ""should prove to be a very large market."" It did.The No. 1 online seller posted revenue of $107 billion last year, 22 years after its founding, hitting the $100 billion mark quicker than any company. Its stock has surged roughly 330% over the past five years — and nearly 200% in the last 10 years vs. just over 60% for the S&P 500.IBD'S TAKE: With a big jump over the past two years, Amazon.com shares took up residence on IBD Leaderboard, an exclusive list of the very top stocks near or at buy points. But the stock Leaders can change fast. Amazon fell 16% from Oct. 6, its all-time high, though Nov. 14, and it's off the board, at least for now. Investors should keep daily track of Leaderboard.Bezos has said that both Amazon and AWS ""were planted as tiny seeds."" Not every seedling will grow into a redwood, but Bezos says the goal for each seedling is annual sales of at least $1 billion.AWS leads its field though it faces a horde of big-name rivals that quickly caught on to Amazon's move, led by Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM) and Alphabet (GOOGL). ""Amazon Web Services is a major reason to own the stock,"" said Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which holds a position in Amazon.While Amazon shows a willingness to boldly experiment, some efforts have flopped. The biggest flop might be the Amazon Fire smartphone, now off the market.Other efforts produced unexpected hits, like the Echo — an in-home, voice-activated digital butler that plays music, reads books and provides traffic and weather, among other things. Teamed with Alexa, its voice and brains, the Echo smart speaker has grabbed a post position in the race to give the world the best and smartest digital assistant, another battle that pits tech's giants.Amazon won't say, but analysts estimate it's already sold some 4 million Echo speakers, at prices ranging from about $100 to $200. It's a product that further cements a user's attachment to Amazon.""Amazon is not a simple company; there's a lot of moving parts,"" Synovus Trust's Morgan said. ""I still feel strong about what they are doing.""Those parts include retail. Amazon reportedly plans to open dozens of small retail storefronts in shopping malls over the next year to showcase its hardware such as the Kindle and Echo.The first Amazon physical bookstore opened last year in Seattle. Amazon has since opened bookstores in San Diego and Portland, Ore., with another one coming in Chicago. The bookstores also sell its hardware, reflecting Amazon's ongoing drive to reach consumers through a variety of channels.It's also pushing deeper into the grocery business, which it entered in 2007 with the launch of the grocery delivery service Amazon Fresh.""Groceries are a key part of our offerings to customers and we're playing with very different models to see which works and for what needs,"" Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said during the company's Q3 earnings conference call.Amazon plans to develop convenience stores as well as curbside pickup locations, the Wall Street Journal has reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Amazon apparently will let customers order groceries online and pick them up at a company facility, which could add billions in revenue, says Pacific Crest Securities, posing an increasing threat to No. 1 retailer Wal-Mart (WMT).Analysts also expect Amazon to become a force in the shipping business, competing with the likes of FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS). The company has announced the purchase of a fleet of trucks to ferry goods between its fulfillment centers. And Amazon has an agreement to lease up to 20 Boeing 767s from Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) to expedite delivery of goods.""They're not afraid to invest and go outside the box,"" said Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify Investments, which holds Amazon stock. ""And almost all of their initiatives have been very supportive of its core online retail focus.""Of its many ventures, Amazon Prime might be its biggest success. Launched in 2005, for $79 a year the loyalty program gave users free two-day shipping. The perks have steadily risen. The price, too, has risen, but just once, to $99 in 2014.Amazon Prime perks now include free access to Amazon streaming videos and commercial free music, free photo storage, free same-day shipping in 27 metro areas, exclusives on select offerings and more. Prime members spend on average about $2,500 a year on Amazon, vs. $550 for non-Prime members, according to Morgan Stanley data.Amazon won't say how many Prime members it has, but the figure is near 65 million members in the U.S., according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.""Amazon loves to connect with customers in as many ways as possible,"" said Amplify's Magoon, ""and in that process they are creating a protective moat.""These investments come with a cost. Amazon has been far from a profit-making machine. In 2014, in fact, it lost 52 cents a share despite revenue of nearly $89 billion.For the recent Q3, EPS tripled from the year-earlier quarter to 52 cents, but that missed Wall Street expectations by 26 cents. Amazon shares fell 5% the next day. Its EPS outlook for the current quarter also missed analyst expectations.In Q3 operating expenses jumped 28% to $32.14 billion, with fulfillment and shipping costs jumping 34% to $4.34 billion as the company focused on improving its shipping times.It opened 18 product fulfillment centers in the third quarter and will add a total of 26 fulfillment centers this year. The expansion is its biggest in four years, growing warehouse square footage by 30%, vs. a 20% increase in 2015.Moreover, Amazon says its investments in video content and related marketing expenses will nearly double in the second half of 2016 vs. the year-earlier period.""So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is a step-up investment primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment,"" said Olsavsky in the conference call. He said Amazon is also adding a lot of resources to Echo, as well as to expansion in India and in AWS.The investments, says the company, will attract and retain more customers. Analysts at times grumble, but they generally agree.""Seeing the large opportunities ahead, Amazon has decided to enter another large investment cycle, and strong investment is expected to continue in Q4,"" wrote Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities, in a research note. ""We believe that this will better enable the company to produce strong top-line growth.""Seyrafi rates Amazon stock outperform and has a price target of 875. Some analyst price targets go as high as 1000. Amazon stock rose 2.6% in the stock market today to 780.""We'll continue to invest in things that we believe enhance the customer experience, particularly the Prime experience,"" Olsavsky said on the Oct. 27 earnings call. ""We are honing the businesses that we're in and making them as efficient (and) as profitable as possible, while also investing very pointedly and very wisely, we believe, in things that will enhance customer experience and create lasting businesses for us down the line.""RELATED:How Amazon, Microsoft, Google Crushed AT&T, Verizon In Cloud ServicesAmazon Seen Dominating As E-Com Rises WorldwideAmazon Hits Record High As Prime Continues To Add SubscribersAmazon Takes Its Netflix Rivalry Global With 'Grand Tour'

110,FDX,"Having skin in the game matters. Especially with mutual fund managers. Funds with at least one manager who has a lot of their own money invested in the fund are more likely to outperform than funds whose managers have little or none of their cash on the line, according to a recent report by Russel Kinnel, director of fund research for Morningstar Inc.Among the 100 largest mutual funds tracked by the research firm, 56 have at least one manager who has more than $500,000 of his own money invested in the fund. Thirty-one of the 50 — or 62% — with the best average annual gains over the five years through Oct. 31 have at least one manager with more than $500,000 invested in the fund.Top performers with more than $500,000 of their own skin in the game include $43.6 billion Vanguard Health Care (VGHCX), $46 billion Vanguard Primecap (VPMCX), $32.6 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth (TRBCX), $55.8 billion Dodge & Cox Stock Fund (DODGX) and $35.6 billion Fidelity Growth Company (FDGRX).Their average annual returns over the past five years range from Fidelity Growth Company's 14.30% to Vanguard Health Care's 16.82%.In the same period, the S&P 500's yearly pace was 13.57%.What stocks are driving these funds?

The tiers are zero, $1 to $10,000, $10,001 to $50,000, $50,001 to $100,000, $100,001 to $500,000, $500,001 to $1 million, and $1,000,001 and above.Three of Vanguard Primecap's managers had $1,000,001 or more invested in their fund: Theo Kolokotrones, Joel Fried and Alfred Mordecai.

Forty-seven percent of funds — with a manager who had more than $1 million invested over the past five years — outperformed their respective benchmarks.That success rate falls to 43% for funds whose managers have $100,001 to $500,000 invested.And it falls further, to 35%, for funds whose managers have none of their own money invested in the portfolio.Among just stock funds, those whose managers' personal exposure was in the top tier had a 39% success rate.

111,FDX,"Amazon (AMZN) on Thursday announced that it will hire more than 120,000 seasonal holiday workers this year, up 20% from a year earlier, as the e-commerce giant continues to deliver blistering growth. Meanwhile, brick-and-mortar retailers plan flat to lower holiday staffing.Amazon's second-quarter revenue rose 31% vs. a year earlier, the best gain in more than four years. Part of that is due to its booming Amazon Web Services cloud-service unit, but the company's core business of selling goods is still robust.As for traditional retailers, Target (TGT) has said it will hire 70,000 in-store staffers this holiday season, unchanged from 2015.

122,FDX,"The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday after its two-day policy meeting, as expected, and longer-term rate projections show an even slower pace of increases.Still, policymakers painted a mostly upbeat picture about the job market and overall growth and signaled that the Fed's key rate will rise before year-end.Markets have increasingly been pricing in a December hike -- currently 59% --  but have seen just a 33% chance of another hike before September 2017. Fed projection materials point to two hikes in 2017, consistent with recent comments that they would hold rates low for longer.The Fed said in its statement that policymakers decided that ""the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened but decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress.""However, three policymakers dissented from the decision, all favoring a hike now, leaving a 7-3 vote in favor of staying put.But the Fed's forecasts show policymakers expect three rate hikes through the end of 2017, down from five at their June meeting. The estimate for the fed funds rate in 2017 has slipped to 1.1% in 2017 from a 1.6% view in June, 2018's views dropped to 1.9% from 2.4%, and the longer-run forecast is now 2.9% vs. 3%.Investors seemed pleased with the Fed's intentions, sending stocks significantly higher and the Nasdaq to an all-time best. The 10-year Treasury yield fell slightly.The Fed assessment that ""the labor market has continued to strengthen"" seems to be a little too upbeat, given some surprisingly bleak details in the August jobs report, notably that the length of the workweek had shrunk to a five-year low. The latest data from Treasury also point to a weakening in federal income and employment taxes withheld from paychecks.The read on household spending — ""growing strongly"" — also seems to ignore the back-to-back declines in retail sales as auto sales went into reverse. The statement does note that business investment continued to be soft.Despite the Fed's positive read on economic data and a backdrop of core inflation approaching the 2% target, policymakers clearly think that they can be very patient in hiking rates over the next couple of years with little chance of an outburst of inflation.At her post-meeting press conference, Fed chief Janet Yellen characterized current policy as only ""modestly accommodative.""Earlier, the Bank of Japan vowed to keep the 10-year Japanese government bond yield near zero. The yen initially sold off hard against the dollar, but then reversed all of its losses and more as markets signaled doubts that the latest moves would be any more successful in reviving inflation than prior ones.Japan's plight is clearly in the thinking of Yellen and other Fed doves who stress that it will be easier to tamp down inflation should it surprise to the upside than it would be to shake off a bout of deflation.""We're not seeing evidence that the economy is overheating,"" Yellen said. Meanwhile, more people are being drawn into the workforce than she had expected, giving the economy some extra running room, she said.Yellen noted that she sees the recent 180,000-per-month employment gain as unsustainably high.She also discussed commercial real estate, highlighted as an area of potential overheating by Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston Federal Reserve. ""While valuations are high,"" Yellen said, she noted that lending standards have tightened and that debt growth was not raising red flags.So why didn't the Fed hike Wednesday? ""Our decision does not reflect a lack of confidence in the economy,"" Yellen said.But she added that labor market slack is being taken up at a slower pace. And the Fed's ""cautious"" approach on rates reflects her belief that with rates near zero it would be easier to tighten quickly if necessary than to cut rates rapidly.Even though economists see a November rate hike as almost unthinkable given the presidential election just days later, Yellen stressed that the meeting would be a live one, meaning a rate move is possible.U.S. stocks opened higher on the BOJ moves as well as on strong earnings from Adobe Systems (ADBE) and FedEx (FDX), but had erased most of those gains heading into the Fed announcement at 2 p.m. ET.Among Fed-sensitive stocks, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and LGI Homes (LGIH) have found support near their 50-day lines recently.JPMorgan is still up after the Fed meeting, but has pared gains.

125,FDX,"Stocks added gains after the Federal Reserve decided to leave interest rates unchanged Wednesday afternoon.The Fed said economic strength has strengthened, increasing the case for a rate hike. An increase by year end appears to be still on the table. Notably, three of the 10 Fed presidents voted against leaving rates unchanged. The Fed did trim its growth outlook and now expects the U.S. economy to grow 1.8% this year, down from a June forecast of 2%.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., urging him to resign over the bank's cross-selling scandal. Stumpf, who said he learned about the issue in 2013, said he was ""deeply sorry"" for the sales practices, and the bank said it was ending retail-banking sales goals. Authorities say Wells employees, starting in at least 2011, opened up to 2 million unauthorized consumer accounts in attempt to hit sales targets. Some analysts said the financial fallout – a $185 million fine to regulators but with a U.S. investigation intensifying -- appeared limited, for now.

131,FDX,"Justice: Three recent court victories got little in the way of headlines, but should be required reading for every corporate executive in the country. In each, companies refused to do what so many have done before -- tuck their tails in and settle out of court.Exhibit A is a case involving Texas-based Professional Janitorial Service and its yearslong battle with the Service Employees International Union.As it has done countless times before, the SEIU targeted the company with a vicious, all out ""corporate campaign,"" designed to ruin the company's reputation and starve it of business, until it submitted to the SEIU's demands. In this case, the union created fliers, emails, and op-eds to smear the company's reputation. It sent thousands of letters to the firm's customers claiming that PJS was engaged in disreputable labor tactics.The SEIU's campaign to ""kill PJS"" was literally out of the manual. In this case, a document called ""Contract Campaign Manual,"" which details strong-arm tactics the union encourages such as ""jeopardizing relationships between the employer and lenders, investors, stockholders, customers, clients,"" threatening legal and regulatory action, and using the media to ""damage an employer's public image.""Not content to give in to this form of extortion, PJS sued the union. As the Houston Chronicle noted, it was the first time the SEIU ""has had to defend its tactics in front of a jury."" And after hearing the sort of blackmail techniques SEIU had been using, the jury ordered it to cough up $5.3 million in damages to PJS.This is a milestone victory that should embolden other companies to stand up for themselves, and discourage unions from making false and defamatory claims in the hopes that companies will simply cave.Exhibit B is Chevron's decision to challenge an environmental lawsuit that aimed to extract $17.3 billion from the oil company. Instead of settling, which most companies end up doing, Chevron decided to sue the attorney, Steven Donziger, under the RICO statute.As attorney John Shu explained in an IBD commentary piece detailing the case, this was a ""courageous strategic decision to fight back."" And its victory, he says, ""should improve the cost-benefit ratio for corporations who choose to fight fraudulent claims.""Exhibit C is a case filed by the Justice Department against FedEx, claiming that the delivery company broke the law by delivering drugs illegally ordered from online pharmacies.This case was part of Justice's broader effort -- called deferred and nonprosecution agreements -- that amount to an extortion racket where Justice forces companies to pay money and adopt various ""remedies"" to make the case go away.According to the Manhattan Institute's James Copland and Rafael Mangual, Justice collected more than $6 billion in 2015 through these agreements.Rather than give in, FedEx took the case to court, and federal prosecutors dropped its case in June, two years after indicting FedEx but just one week after the trial started. FexEx ""called the government's bluff and won its case,"" they said.Each of these cases amounted to nothing more than extortion on a scale the Mafia could never dream of. Companies are given a choice: Pay up or have your companies destroyed.While not every firm has the wherewithal and the determination to mount such fights, they all owe these and other companies a debt of gratitude. By remaining resolute, they've made it less likely that others will have to suffer the same fate.RELATED:

133,FDX,"Starbucks (SBUX) says it's getting a $350 million tax cut this year from a 7-percentage-point reduction in its effective tax rate to 26%.""The majority of the savings will go to the bottom line,"" CFO Scott Maw told analysts on Thursday. The other 40%-plus will go to investments in workers, via wage and benefit enhancements, as well as digital investments.X Starbucks joined companies like Wal-Mart (WMT), FedEx (FDX) and Wells Fargo (WFC) in tying wage increases to the Trump tax cuts. Meanwhile, dozens of other companies including AT&T (T), Disney (DIS) and Verizon (VZ) have awarded bonuses to well more than 1 million workers, crediting tax cuts for their generosity.With the U.S. economy seemingly ready to finally shift into high gear and wage growth overdue for a pickup amid 4.1% unemployment, the flurry of wage-hike and bonus announcements has raised hopes that the GOP tax reform will provide rocket fuel for a late-1990s-style growth spurt. In a sign that economic growth is breaking out to the upside, the 10-year Treasury yield rose as high as 2.67% on Friday, a level not seen since early 2014.Yet there are reasons to be skeptical that a major economic and wage acceleration is at hand. Take Verizon, which on Tuesday said that tax reform would shrink its 2018 tax bill by $3.5 billion-$4 billion. Yet the company hasn't settled on any plans for deploying that cash windfall, other than sending about 10% of it, or $380 million, to employees via a bonus grant of 50 shares of stock per full-time worker. While those Verizon shares are worth about $2,700 at Friday's close on the stock market today, economists generally believe that consumers are much more likely to spend ongoing income gains than gains in paper wealth.IBD'S TAKE: Starbucks is ranked No. 11 by IBD in the Retail-Restaurants industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see the leaders in each category. Restaurants have turned in a middling performance as a group, ranked No. 84 out of 197 groups. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks in leading groups that break above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.On a static basis, leaving out growth effects, tax cuts are supposed to provide roughly $200 billion in 2018 to the corporate and household sectors, equal to about 1% of GDP. While lower federal tax withholdings are set to take effect in February, raising household take-home pay, tax cuts are initially geared more to the business sector. That's in part because the new withholding will reflect the elimination of personal exemptions, but not the doubling of the child tax credit, which won't get paid until tax season in 2019.That means this year's boost from tax cuts will depend a whole lot on what companies do with their windfalls, though it's also looking like Congress will reach a spending deal that further boosts deficits and gives the economy a lift — assuming the government doesn't shut down again.Yet company after company seems to be signaling that they have fairly modest plans for putting their extra cash to work. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) told analysts last week that corporate tax reform would boost earnings and cash flow by $1.7 billion in 2018 after an additional investment and added operating expenses of $200 million to $300 million in artificial intelligence, data analytics, digital health and other initiatives.Iron-ore miner Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) said it's getting a $250 million cash infusion over the next several years and will owe no tax for years to come. It's still figuring out how to put the cash to work but said it ""will be primarily deployed towards debt reduction, as well as future CapEx needs associated with our core business, and last but not least, potential capital returns to shareholders,"" according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Railroad operator Union Pacific expects tax cuts to add $1 billion to free cash flow this year but doesn't have any extra investment plans for now. ""The lower tax rate and increased cash flow resulting from it does not change the calculus that we used for the returns that are attractive to our shareholders and for reinvesting in the railroad,"" CEO Lance Fritz told analysts. ""Just because we have increased cash, it doesn't increase the pool of either projects or markets that are effective to us.""It's still very possible that the economy finally breaks the 3% GDP growth barrier this year. The economy may not need all that much extra fuel right now with labor markets already quite tight.Although income gains outweigh stock market gains, a long, powerful bull market will surely loosen purse strings. Wal-Mart's minimum-wage hike to $11 an hour may lead other employers to follow suit, if the experience from their last big wage hike in 2016 is any guide.The upfront bonuses, while surely appreciated by those who get them, are mostly meant to buy goodwill — probably both for the employers and the Republican Party, whose control of both the House and Senate are at risk in the coming elections.Still, the effectiveness of corporate tax cuts and their power to trickle down to employees can't really be judged in the short term.The whole idea is that improving the relative attractiveness of the U.S. as a place of business will, over time, lead to more productivity-enhancing investment, faster growth, more demand for labor and higher wages. Yet the real legacy of the tax cuts over the longer term will depend in part on just how bad budget deficits get, which may determine whether the tax cuts can be sustained over time.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Tax Cuts Will Fuel Economic Growth At Just The Right TimeHere Comes A $1 Trillion — Scratch That — $2 Trillion U.S. Federal DeficitFacebook, Apple, Amazon To Grab Earnings Spotlight: Investing Action PlanHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

138,FDX,"Apple (AAPL) and Bank Of America (BAC) top the latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, but these large investors also placed big bets on stocks in the medical, semiconductor, building, chemical and machinery sectors.X Fund managers tend to take a longer-term approach, so their investments over the last three months in stocks like managed care provider Aetna (AET), chip equipment stock Applied Materials (AMAT), homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) and industrial machinery maker Illinois Tool Works (ITW) show they expect continued growth this year in the key industries and sectors that often drive GDP and the overall economy.And despite fears that Amazon (AMZN) is primed to rule the retail world, these leading mutual funds also established new positions or added to their existing ones in Home Depot (HD) and Best Buy (BBY).Apple saw the most new buyers and the most money invested, with 65 funds picking up an estimated nearly $1.8 billion of the iPhone maker's shares.Apple has been carving out a flat base as part of a second-stage base-on-base formation. The stock closed Tuesday's session 1% below the 176.34 buy point.BofA was the only other stock on the list to get more than a $1 billion investment, as 57 funds sunk $1.04 billion into the banking giant.The Charlotte, N.C.-based company's share price has nearly doubled since Donald Trump's election in 2016, and the stock is now 19% above the 25.45 buy point it cleared last September.Many names on the list, including Best Buy, Texas Instruments (TXN) and FedEx (FDX), have already broken out and are now extended beyond their buy ranges, but Apple is not the only stock on the list in or near a potential buy zone.Graco (GGG), which provides equipment to measure, control and dispense fluid and powder materials in the manufacturing processing and construction industries, cleared a 44.80 buy point on Dec. 15 and is now trading at the upper end of the buy zone.Defense contractor Heico (HEI) also broke out in good volume on Dec. 15, but then pulled back to its 93.10 buy point, where it found support. The maker of jet engine components and electronic systems closed Tuesday's near the very top of the buy range.Pulte is up over 40% from a breakout in June, but the Atlanta-based homebuilder has been trading in a very tight range in recent weeks and may offer an add-on buying opportunity at 34.70.Applied Materials is trying to form a new base, but note that it's late-stage and the semiconductor equipment maker's relative strength line is well below new high ground. The stock continues to tests support at its 50-day line.Although Bank Of America received the aforementioned $1 billion buy-in, it also topped the list of stocks being sold with 36 net sellers (93 funds selling minus 57 buying).No. 2 on the sell side was fellow financial titan JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which had 35 net sellers (91 funds selling minus 56 buying).Defense contractors Boeing (BA), Honeywell (HON) and Northrop Grumman (NOC), as well as Aetna and Southwest Airlines (LUV), were also among the 10 stocks with the most net sellers.RELATED:2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New YearLooking For The Next Nvidia?

141,FDX,"It's the science-fiction nightmare we've all dreaded -- perhaps the rogue computer from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" somehow joins forces with the brutal robots from one of ""The Terminator"" movies to seize your job.In more realistic terms, you might fear your company's bean counters finding any excuse they can to automate you out of employment. Maybe these manic cost cutters end up cooking a gourmet recipe for a robot economy -- that seemingly inevitable era where inefficient humans are rendered useless by hyper-efficient cyborgs.Well, something resembling that day may already be here. But it's not as dreary as you or Hollywood has envisioned. At least not yet.Robotic and artificial intelligence systems being developed by IBM (IBM), Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, Tesla Motors (TSLA) and others are sophisticated and cheap enough to spread rapidly through the economy. As a result, more systems will be put to work, drastically altering the job landscape.""Virtually every industry in existence is likely to become less labor-intensive in future years as new technology is assimilated into existing business models,"" wrote Janus Capital Group lead portfolio manager Bill Gross in a May 4 Investment Outlook report. He added: ""Millions of jobs will be lost over the next 10-15 years.""Routine tasks such as data entry and research could be increasingly automated. But they're the tip of the iceberg, and some professions that could be hit might surprise you.Among the vulnerable: truck drivers, attorneys, nurses and even nuclear technicians.IBD'S TAKE: Artificial intelligence seems like a smart bet for many companies. Alphabet and Facebook are in buy range. Nvidia, whose chips are being used in many AI systems, soared to a fresh high Friday after reporting another quarter of blowout earnings. ""Medicine, manufacturing and even service-intensive jobs are at risk,"" said Gross. ""Investment managers too! Not only blue-collar but now white-collar professionals are being threatened by technological change.""Oxford University researchers studied the future of employment and how susceptible jobs are to computerization. They concluded that a staggering number of jobs are at risk.""According to our estimates, about 47% of total U.S. employment is at risk,"" the researchers said.Others see no need for knee-jerk paranoia.""While automation will eliminate very few occupations entirely in the next decade, it will affect portions of almost all jobs to a greater or lesser degree,"" according to a McKinsey report released in July.At-risk doesn't necessarily mean gone. New technologies generally improve productivity, creating higher-value, higher-wage jobs, experts say. They also create fields of work that didn't even exist before.By one popular estimate, 65% of children entering primary school today will end up working in jobs that don't exist now, according to the World Economic Forum.Still, the number of jobs in certain fields will likely dwindle in coming years, affecting many people in the workforce. A Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report last December projected overall U.S. employment will grow about 6.5% from 2014 to 2024. That compares to labor force growth of 5.1%.Here are some middle-class jobs that will be affected by automation in that time frame. Some will grow despite the incursion of automation, some will decline and others will expand at a slower than average rate.Truck drivers are one of the most endangered blue-collar jobs. In May 2015, autonomous trucks began rolling down U.S. highways for the first time after Nevada licensed a new Daimler (DDAIF) Freightliner 18-wheeler called Inspiration. For now, a human has to be in the cab during the prototype phase.Tesla Motors is working on plans for self-driving, all-electric heavy trucks, CEO Elon Musk wrote in his recent ""Master Plan.""Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford says all leading trucking companies are experimenting with autonomous truck technology.""UPS would be the most logical. I know they have looked at the possibility,"" Hartford told IBD.UPS already employs driver-assistance systems on many trucks, but says full autonomy is further off, with regulation being a key issue.Truck drivers are in short supply now, and self-driving trucks would fill that gap. But if large numbers of self-driving trucks roll out -- with no human in the cab -- Teamsters and other unions would likely resist.""That will be a potential issue,"" Hartford said.Overall, jobs for truck drivers are projected to grow at a slower-than-average 4% rate through 2024. And for light-truck delivery services such as UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX), jobs will grow at just a 3% clip.Modest employment gains could look great next to the longer-therm outlook. Trucks are expected to lead the push for autonomous vehicles on American roads, which could drastically shrink employment among the estimated 3.5 million professional truck drivers in the U.S., starting in the 2020s.""Improved routing through GPS technology can make existing light-truck drivers more productive, which may limit the demand for additional drivers,"" the BLS said.Ross is an artificial intelligence system that does legal research using IBM's Watson supercomputer. It searches through mountains of case files for data points that attorneys can use in court. IBM says Watson can read 40 million documents in 15 seconds, replacing some entry-level attorneys.The system's inventor, Ross Intelligence, rolled it out in early 2016. It's at work in a few law firms today, including BakerHostetler, which employs more than 900 attorneys across the nation. Users ask spoken questions and Ross reads through ""the entire body of law"" and returns a cited answer and topical readings from legislation, according to the startup's co-founder and Chief Executive Andrew Arruda.Machine learning, which gives computers the ability to learn rather than having to be programmed, will make robo-attorneys even more useful.""Artificial intelligence is going to be included in all software,"" Arruda told IBD. ""It will learn and get better and do a lot more with less as we move away from programming systems to teaching them.""As Ross handles more of the grunt work, it will free experienced attorneys to tackle more cases and do more in-depth research. The BLS estimates that the number of jobs for lawyers will grow 6% by 2024, a bit lower than average. But if more law firms employ AI systems like Ross, that could grow at a slower rate.Alphabet's Google recently said its Deep Mind technology research unit is harnessing artificial intelligence in its work with Moorfields Eye Hospital in London. The goal is to develop treatments for ailments such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of blindness among the elderly.""By allowing earlier detection and treatment of AMD,"" Google says on its website, ""machine learning has the potential to help save the sight of many of these people.""Rising numbers of aging baby boomers requiring more health care, however, will offset productivity gains from AI and robotics. BLS projects the number of jobs for licensed vocational nurses and registered nurses will grow 16% by 2024.Underwriters evaluate the risks of insuring specific potential clients to determine how much coverage to provide and the right premium to charge. Automated underwriting software is enabling underwriters to process applications faster.""As the technology improves, more underwriting decisions can be made automatically,"" the BLS says. As a result, 11% fewer underwriters will be needed by the mid-2020s.Employment of surveying and mapping technicians is projected to fall 8% by 2024.""Advancements in surveying technology, such as robotic total stations, let surveyors complete more work in less time, reducing the demand for surveyors,"" the BLS said. Still, some surveyors will be needed for tasks that haven't been automated yet, such as certifying boundary lines and reviewing sites for construction.By studying the Earth and its land features, geographers create and modify maps and analyze geographic data to create reports. They use tools such as satellite-based global positioning systems.More than half of all geographers work for the federal government. Advances in computer technology that create a faster, more efficient work process, combined with government budget cuts, are expected to reduce employment by 2%.Public safety communications operators help keep communities safe. But jobs are projected to fall 3% by 2024.""Consolidation of emergency communication centers, enabled by advances in technology, is expected to reduce the employment of dispatchers,"" the BLS said. ""Still, job prospects should be good because the stressful nature of the jobs results in many workers leaving the occupation,"" and this turnover opens up positions.When ATMs came into wide use in the 1970s, some observers predicted the number of bank tellers would fall. That didn't happen.""Job growth for tellers was driven by the expansion of bank branches, where most tellers work,"" the BLS said.But as online and mobile banking have grown more common, the number of branches has shrunk. According to market tracker SNL Financial, U.S. banks finished 2015 with 92,997 branches, 1,614 fewer than a year earlier.""It extended a continuous branch reduction trend that dates back to 2009,"" SNL said in a Jan. 12 report. The BLS forecasts the number of teller jobs will fall 8% by 2024 to 480,500.According to the Nuclear Power Institute, nuclear power accounts for 19% of the electricity generated in the U.S. today. Nuclear power plants have gained greater acceptance in recent years and are seen by some as a cheap, clean energy source. They face tough competition, however, from lower-maintenance renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, both of which are gaining popularity. Some technicians will be needed to maintain and upgrade existing nuclear plants, but employment of nuclear technicians is expected to fall 5%.Drafters use software to convert designs of architects and engineers into schematics and technical drawings. The BLS says computer-aided design and other automation tools ""allow engineers and architects to perform many tasks that used to be done by drafters."" As a result, employment is forecast to fall 3%.---Despite job losses in these fields and others due to advances in artificial intelligence, robotics and automation, the economy should benefit overall from productivity gains and creation of new jobs, according to Matt Anchin, who heads communications and content development as senior vice president for Monster Worldwide's (MWW) Monster.com job site, which lists roughly 5 million jobs.The jobs market continues to evolve rapidly, Anchin said, and he's optimistic about the overall outlook""Mobile technology is creating nothing but opportunity,"" he told IBD. ""We see it as a ripple effect.""Think of transportation, Uber and Lyft, part of the sharing economy,"" he said. ""Humans are remarkably good at adapting as new technologies emerge.""

A Cowen & Co. research note said those costs could weigh on results through much of next year as well.""We believe the Amazon relationship will ultimately prove to be very profitable, but the startup will be slightly disruptive in the near term,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker wrote Wednesday.Atlas Air shares gapped down 6.9% to 38.25 on the stock market today.

Both UPS and FedEx have benefited from the growth in e-commerce.IBD'S TAKE: Air-cargo servicers Atlas Air Worldwide and Air Transport Services Group have benefited as Amazon tries to take more control of its deliveries. But the e-commerce giant's moves could mean more difficulty for UPS, for whom Amazon is a huge customer. See how the Transport-Air Freight segment is performing in IBD's Stock Checkup.In the second quarter, Atlas Air's earnings per share fell 46% to 80 cents, missing analyst forecasts for 93 cents. Revenue fell 3% to $443.27 million, short of views for $473.05 million.The Amazon deal is part of Atlas Air's plan to shift more toward express and e-commerce delivery. Under the terms, an Atlas subsidiary will operate 20 Boeing 767s for Amazon for at least seven years, and Amazon has an option to acquire as much as a fifth of Atlas Air's common stock over a five-year period. Over a seven-year period, Amazon can acquire an extra 10% of Atlas shares.Atlas Air's stock spiked 27% after the deal was announced. The company at the time said the deal would be ""meaningfully accretive to Atlas Air Worldwide's earnings and cash flows over time.""Amazon, which has tried to assert more control over how its products are delivered in an attempt to control shipping costs, also announced a similar deal this year with Air Transport Services Group (ATSG).

153,FDX,"It's hard to think of LogMeIn (LOGM) as an underdog anymore.This scrappy tech firm took on the likes of Cisco (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and Citrix (CTXS) and pioneered remote access to desktop and handheld devices via cloud computing. Now it's turning its guns on targets like Salesforce.com (CRM), Oracle (ORCL) and Zendesk (ZEN).XEarly this year, it tripled in size overnight to become one of the world's top 10 Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, companies based on revenue, thanks to its $1.8 billion merger with Citrix's GoTo business.""The company is well on its way to its three-year, post-acquisition targets, and we believe the cash flow opportunity still justifies a much higher stock price,"" JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty wrote in a recent note to clients, after LogMeIn disclosed financial results for the third quarter. JPMorgan is a market maker in LogMeIn shares.Based in Boston, LogMeIn offers software tools for cloud connectivity and collaboration, secure device access, and remote customer support. For an increasingly mobile and global workforce, it offers products such as Join.me, for online meetings; GoToWebinar, for online seminars; GoToAssist, for online assistance; and LastPass, for online password management.Now LogMeIn is at that point where it's an established tech player, yet small enough with around $1 billion in annual sales to generate powerful growth.Thanks in part to a 23% annual pretax profit margin and 26% annual return on equity, LogMeIn ranks No. 1 out of 56 companies in IBD's enterprise software group. ServiceNow (NOW), Paycom Software (PAYC), Blackbaud (BLKB) and Salesforce round out the top five.Within its core markets, LogMeIn is growing fastest in what is known as the identity business. LastPass, a product that offers simple and secure access to apps, devices and data, is doing especially well.In an email interview with Investor's Business Daily, LogMeIn Chief Executive Bill Wagner described his company as a leader in serving small and medium businesses. LogMeIn also counts millions of individuals among its customers, as well as the largest technology providers such as Dell Technologies (DVMT) and HP Inc. (HPQ); the world's biggest telcos like Verizon (VZ) and Australia's Telstra; and familiar Silicon Valley growth names like Evernote and Dropbox.A key market where LogMeIn sees long-term growth opportunity is a realm known as Unified Communications and Collaboration. It's one that has emerged as traditional enterprise collaboration vendors such as Microsoft and IBM (IBM), as well as traditional enterprise communication vendors like Cisco, have made inroads into each other's turfs.""Prior to the (GoTo) merger, our popular Join.me product was a high growth disrupter in the collaboration market,"" Wagner said. ""Now we have products like GoMeeting, GoToWebinar, OpenVoice and Grasshopper, which essentially bolstered our annual (communications and collaboration) sales by an order of magnitude.""JPMorgan's Auty says LogMeIn built a successful franchise in remote access, then added several related high-growth businesses around that core, such as web conferencing. Yet he sees room for even more. Auty noted that LogMeIn hit a targeted $100 million in cost synergies a year ahead of plan, and revenue synergies are already starting to kick in. For example, LogMeIn consolidated 50% of data centers and is successfully cross-selling LastPass subscriptions to GoTo customers.Beyond software applications, Auty sees a ""larger opportunity"" in providing a cloud platform for companies tied to the Internet of Things.A LogMeIn spokesperson told IBD that the company's fledgling IoT efforts are centered on customer engagement and support. That could pit it directly against Salesforce's Service Cloud as well as Oracle and Zendesk.It's all showing up in the quarterly results. During the third quarter, LogMeIn logged triple-digit earnings and revenue gains, while cash flow from operations surged to $90.5 million, a hefty 33% of revenue. The company also raised guidance for profits and free-cash-flow margins for 2017 as a whole.Shares briefly shot to an all-time high of 129.52 but now sit 7% below that peak, undercutting a 121.35 entry they cleared in October. Still, they are up about 24% year to date, while the S&P 500 has risen 16% over the same period.Auty rates LogMeIn stock as overweight and upped his price target from 140 to 145.In February, CEO Wagner hinted at ""big ambitions"" while alluding to a next generation of cloud technologies.IBD'S TAKE: Software stocks and cloud players have a strong presence in the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks, where you can find new ideas for your investing watchlist.Just a handful of months later, the company acquired the Israeli firm Nanorep. An artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning expert, Nanorep already makes chatbots and virtual agents ""more human"" for hundreds of companies across the world, including Intuit (INTU), FedEx (FDX) and Vodafone (VOD), according to LogMeIn.The acquisition accelerates LogMeIn's efforts in the rapidly growing market for digital customer service — one that it expects to balloon from 3% of all customer service interactions in 2017 to 30% by 2022.Wagner told IBD that the $45 million Nanorep deal builds on his company's history of disruptive innovation.""We were an early innovator in the 'freemium' business model, a structure we relied upon for our organic growth in the early days of the company and one that has been copied by many other successful technology companies,"" Wagner said.That model, of converting free users to paid or premium subscribers, was successfully deployed by Join.me. It offered single-click, frictionless sharing of screens, showing up older rivals like Cisco's WebEx and Citrix's GoToMeeting. GoToMeeting is now part of LogMeIn's portfolio.Launched in October 2010, Join.me was recognized as the fastest-growing web-conferencing product less than five years later.LogMeIn is now looking to harness Nanorep's AI expertise across its entire, newly expanded suite of product offerings. With GoTo under its belt, the company says it supports 25 million users and 900 million conferencing minutes every month, as well as roughly 200 million customer engagements and 5 billion voice minutes every year.But as LogMeIn targets new markets, challenges await. Patent litigation could resurface and roil the stock, experts caution. Plus, upstarts like Splashtop and TeamViewer are moving into remote access, support and monitoring.Competition in this increasingly crowded space is expected to drive down prices, with only the strongest players likely to survive.Still, analyst expectations for future growth have marched up, notwithstanding LogMeIn's formidable annual 45% earnings growth rate and 46% sales growth rate over the past three years.Consensus estimates call for annual earnings of $3.28 per share in 2017, up from $2.03 in 2016 and from $1.66 in 2015. Earnings are seen climbing to $4.10 a share in 2018, according to Zacks Investment Research.Revenue is forecast at $1.02 billion in 2017, ballooning from $336 million in 2016 and from $272 million in 2015. It is seen rising to $1.17 billion in 2018.LogMeIn's free cash flow, a key valuation metric, has especially impressed industry analysts. Its free-cash-flow margin is now expected to be 30% for the year and to expand to more than 33% in 2019, said Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets.Investors and analysts await the strategic road map that Wagner is set to discuss at an event on Dec. 19.""We think the event could be a catalyst as management updates longer-term targets,"" Hedberg wrote on Oct. 26, calling LogMeIn a ""favorite idea"" for the rest of this year. He rates LogMeIn stock an outperform and hiked his price target from 140 to 143.RELATED:Could This IBD 50 Software Stock Be The Next Cloud-Transition Star After Adobe?Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

Small caps came out better, with the Russell 2000 adding 0.2% to a monthlong advance.Volume rose compared with Tuesday's levels, based on preliminary numbers. On the NYSE, winners beat losers by 6-to-5.The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged and indicated four more rate hikes through the end of 2018. That was a more hawkish forecast than the market had expected. The Fed also announced it will start reversing its stimulus in October by letting $10 billion in principal run off per month, rather than continue to reinvest all proceeds of maturing Treasury and mortgage bonds.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 2 basis points to 2.26%, the highest since July.Although the Nasdaq lagged, winners topped losers by 3-to-2 on the composite. Some Nasdaq heavyweights such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB) fell but only Apple had sizable volume. It also had the most serious action, as shares closed slightly below the 50-day moving average.That indicated that the selling was concentrated in certain areas of the Nasdaq. Semiconductor, fiber optics, solar energy and some software industry groups rang up some of the day's worst performances.The energy sector led, as drilling, production and field services rose more than 2%.The Dow transports rallied 1.6%. Airline, ship, logistics and airfreight stocks did well. FedEx (FDX) rallied despite weak quarterly results and a reduced full-year earnings guidance. The stock broke out past the 220.09 buy point of a base on base pattern.RELATED:The Fed Doubles Down: Reverses QE, Keeps Hawkish TiltApple Falls Below Key Level In Heavy Volume, But Is It A Sell Signal Or No?FedEx Q1 Earnings Hit By TNT Cyberattack, Hurricane Harvey; Outlook Cut\

156,FDX,"Three stocks scored new highs Wednesday while delivering solid breakouts. FedEx (FDX) pegged a new high in volume about 250% above average. The move cleared a 220.09 buy point in a base-on-base pattern. The stock closed up 4.50 to 220.50. XThe base-on-base pattern involves two consecutive consolidations.

157,FDX,"The major indexes slumped in afternoon trading Wednesday as traders and fund managers digested news from the Federal Reserve on its plan to begin reducing its massive balance sheet of bonds and securities.Meanwhile, Snap (SNAP) slumped 4% to 14.13, cutting through its key 50-day moving average for the second time in nearly three weeks. Shares are now 52% below the all-time peak of 29.44, set in the Snapchat operator's second day of trading following a heavily followed IPO at 17 a share.XThe Fed said in a statement that while the fed funds target range is left unchanged at 1%-1.25%, it would now let $10 billion in principal be redeemed in maturing government bonds and agency mortgage-backed securities on a monthly basis. This means that in 12 months' time, it would see its $4.5 trillion assets drop by less than 3%.Techs led the market decline. A 2.3% drop by tech giant Apple (AAPL) helped send the Nasdaq composite nearly 0.7% lower.While Apple is now below its recent flat-base entry of 156.75, watch to see if the iPhone giant can find support near the key 50-day moving average.Shares are still sharply above the Jan. 6-9 breakout point of 118.12 in a first-stage cup with handle. Apple still remains in a long-term uptrend as well.The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, but the Dow Jones industrial average was off just 0.1%; at least four of the Dow industrials' 30 components gained 1 point or more, including Goldman Sachs (GS) and insurance giant Travelers (TRV).At 22,346, the Dow Jones industrials, which has already risen in eight straight sessions, is up 13% since Jan. 1. The small-cap Russell 2000, up 0.3%, is still lagging the large-cap indexes with a 6.5% year-to-date gain.Volume is running higher vs. the same time Tuesday on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.Oil drilling, oil and gas exploration, logistics, airfreight and airline stocks paced the upside on the back of fiscal Q1 results from FedEx (FDX) (EPS down 11%, revenue up 4%), which said that Hurricane Harvey impacted its business. The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil rose about 2% to $50.53 a barrel.FedEx at one point rose more than 3% to an intraday high of 222.71, briefly rolling past a 220.09 entry in big volume.The proper buy zone for FedEx extends up to 5% past the 220.09 entry, or 231.09.The stock's 50-day moving average has been sliding lower since early June, a negative sign. A healthy stock is one that's not only rising but also trading above its 50-day line, which is itself rising.The Fed also indicated that it still plans to raise the fed funds rate charged on overnight loans to banks an additional four times in 2018. Since the end of 2015, the central bank has pushed the fed funds rate from a target range of 0%-0.25% to 1%-1.25%.U.S. government bonds on the long end jumped, leaving the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note at 2.28%, still well below its March peak of 2.62%.Going back to Snap, while there is little doubt that the Venice, Calif., firm is enjoying superlative top-line growth, it still hasn't shown concrete signs that it can make money in the near or medium term.The company lost 16 cents a share in the second quarter, greater than a 9-cent loss in the year-ago quarter, even as revenue rose 153% to $181.7 million. Operating expenses have exploded higher.Snap has 1.18 billion diluted shares outstanding.Meanwhile, the Street estimates net losses of 64 cents a share this year and 50 cents in 2018, bigger than previously expected.While some analysts have recently issued bullish notes on the stock, fund managers have been acting in the opposite direction. Data from William O'Neil + Co. shows that the total number of mutual funds and hedge funds owning shares fell in Q2 to 259 funds vs. 305 funds in Q1.IBD'S TAKE: The recent action in Snap shows why it's so important to wait for a new IPO to establish a true trading range and set up a breakout opportunity before buying any shares.

161,FDX,"An ambitious plan by Amazon (AMZN) to procure a fleet of 40 airline freighters and lessen its dependence on FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS) could lead to $440 million in savings, says Pacific Crest Securities, which raised its price target on the e-commerce leader.“We estimate Amazon can save an average of $5.82 per shipment,” wrote Pacific Crest analyst Edward Yruma in a research note. ""On an annualized basis, and assuming 40 planes, this could drive $440 million in savings,” wrote Yruma, who raised his price target on Amazon stock to 820 from 800.Amazon stock closed Thursday at 717.51, up a fraction. Amazon hit a high of 722.45 on May 12 and is an IBD Leaderboard stock.Yruma said that Amazon is one of the most disruptive forces in retail and technology today and that it will take further market share and benefit as e-commerce continues to grow.Amazon previously announced it is leasing 20 Boeing 767 converted cargo planes from Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) and another 20 from Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW).The agreement with Air Transport Services includes the opportunity for Amazon to purchase up to 19.9% of company shares over the next five years. The agreement with Atlas Air includes the opportunity to purchase up to 20% of its shares over the next five years.Yruma said Pacific Crest had ""pinpointed seven active airliners that are already in service and mapped out the 'Air Amazon' route structure.""Amazon plans to have all 40 cargo airliners fully operational by 2018, which will enable it to bring as much as 30% of its current delivery volume in-house, according to a research report by Moody’s Investors Service analyst Jonathan Root. The report said Amazon’s fleet would be 21% the size of UPS’ and 14% the size of FedEx's. In terms of payload capacity, Amazon’s fleet would be 26% the size of UPS’ and 17% of FedEx’s, excluding their largest freighters that fly mostly long-haul routes for those companies, Root wrote.

162,FDX,"Boeing (BA) is making moves to develop a new mid-range passenger jet, according to a report Friday from the Wall Street Journal, but the idea still needs board approval.""It's coming faster than you think,"" Mike Delaney, Boeing's vice president of airplane development, said in a presentation to reporters in June, according to the Journal. ""We have all the things we sort of need to put the airplane together.""Boeing had said in February that it was surveying customers about the need for a midsize plane to replace the 757, which was last produced in 2004. United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) are still flying 757s, and FedEx (FDX) uses a cargo version of the plane.But before Boeing gets approval for the new jet, it would need to prove it could build the aircraft at whatever price carriers and leasing companies require. If the board green lights the program, the new Boeing jet could enter service in 2024 or 2025.United Airlines shares rose 0.8% in the stock market today, while those of Boeing inched lower. American shares climbed 3.6%, Delta Air 0.9% and FedEx 1.3%.The new jet would need to fly trans-Atlantic routes and Asian market routes, between 2,900 and 5,000 nautical miles. It would be a rival to Airbus' (EADSY) A321s.Airbus' U.S.-listed shares fell 1.6%.Boeing has more concepts on the drawing board as well and is looking at a new version of the single-aisle 737 Max with new engines that could seat 250. Both new planes could be put into production.For the larger market, Boeing is looking at stretching  its 777 wide-body jet to carry 450 passengers, with an extra four rows of seats vs. the 777-9. The redesign would move Boeing's plane closer to the low end of the Airbus' A380's capacity.

163,FDX,"Amazon.com (AMZN) will invest $3 billion in India this year, on top of a previous $2 billion investment, as it looks to challenge local e-commerce players such as Flipkart and Snapdeal and expand its international sales overall.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced the investment in Washington on Tuesday at a business event attended by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""We have already created some 45,000 jobs in India and continue to see huge potential in the Indian economy,"" Bezos said at the event, as reported by CNN. He said Amazon continues to see “huge potential” in India, surpassing the company’s most ambitious goals.Regulations in India prevent foreign retailers from selling directly to customers, requiring Amazon to operate as an online marketplace for third-party vendors. Amazon is also opening numerous small distribution centers around India to handle local deliveries itself. In the U.S., it is more reliant on the FedEx (FDX), UPS (UPS) and the U.S. Postal Service.Amazon's investment in India comes as it looks to boost growth in international markets. Sales overseas rose 5.6% to $35.4 billion in 2015, compared with North American sales growth of 25%, to $63.7 billion. Amazon reported an operating profit in North America of $2.75 billion but an operating loss of $91 million internationally.Amazon stock rose a fraction, to 726.64, in the stock market today.The IBD Leaderboard stock, which touched an all-time high of 731.50 on Monday, is within buy range from a 722.55 buy point out of a three-weeks-tight pattern.

164,FDX,"Target (TGT) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) raised their quarterly dividends Wednesday, following in the footsteps of FedEx (FDX), which pumped up its dividend by 60% on Tuesday.Many U.S. companies have been accumulating cash as wage inflation remains low and the economy continues a slow, steady improvement, and are now moving to increase returns to investors.Big-box discount department store operator Target hiked its dividend 7.5% to 60 cents a share after holding its dividend steady at 56 cents a share for the prior four quarters. The increase will mark the 45th straight year that Target has increased its dividend.Target stock formed a nearly seven-month-long cup-with-handle base from mid-2015 to late April when it edged above an 84.10 buy point to touch 84.14. But it failed to break out and has fallen about 18% from that point.Shares closed up 0.6% in the stock market today. UnitedHealth shares climbed 2.5%. FedEx dipped less than 0.1%.UnitedHealth, the nation's largest managed-care health insurer, lifted its dividend 25% to 62.5 cents a share, up from 50 cents, to be paid on June 28. UnitedHealth Group President and Chief Financial Officer David Wichmann said in a written statement the company is paying the dividend ""while remaining focused on costs and value.""No. 2 U.S. package delivery service FedEx late Tuesday raised its dividend to 40 cents a share from 25 cents, payable on July 1. FedEx stock has been forming a flat base for a little more than a month, with a 169.40 buy point.
"
165,FDX,"The U.K.'s surprising and historic decision to leave the European Union overshadowed all other news this week, roiling global markets and raising doubts about the European economy and post-war order.But it was a busy week for business news. In a well-timed release, the Federal Reserve said JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and other giant banks passed their ""stress test"" scenarios. Elon Musk's bid to merge Tesla Motors (TSLA) and SolarCity (SCTY) raised doubts, even among long-time devotees. Wal-Mart (WMT) and JD.com (JD) teamed up. Adobe Systems (ADBE), Red Hat (RHT) and FedEx (FDX) gave weak guidance, and the Federal Aviation Administration finalized drone regulations.Gloom overtook world markets after Britons voted to leave the EU amid a wave of nationalist sentiment. The vote will begin a long process of negotiations to determine what parts of the existing business landscape will stay or go for a range of industries that operate in the region. JPMorgan Chase, American Airlines (AAL) and their global peers were hit hard. U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said he would step down, while right-wing populists elsewhere on the Continent called for similar referendums in their nations, potentially expanding financial and cultural fissures within the bloc. The Federal Reserve said it is ""prepared to provide dollar liquidity through its existing swap lines with central banks, as necessary,"" but questions remained about how much left was in its arsenal to ward off any coming market turmoil.U.S. stocks had rallied through Thursday, in large part because polls got it wrong and predicted that the U.K. would stay in the EU. Stocks suffered huge losses Friday after the Brexit results pushing the major averages into the red. The Nasdaq lost 1.9% for the week while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials closed off 1.6%. European markets suffered deeper losses. Big losers included carriers such American Air, while Tesla Motors tumbled on its ill-received SolarCity bid. Treasury yields hit four-year lows. The dollar skyrocketed vs. the pound but tumbled vs. the yen.Tesla made a surprise offer to buy solar energy company SolarCity in a stock swap valued at roughly $2.7 billion. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is chairman of SolarCity, which is run by Musk's cousins.Analyst reviews of the deal hit a negative tone, calling it a fundamental change to Tesla's business model that could thwart its aggressive efforts to expand production of its all-electric vehicles and add to cash flow and financing concerns. Tesla shares tumbled 10.45% on Wednesday, its worst one-day loss since May 2014. Tesla  fell 10.4% for the week. SolarCity initially spiked on the deal, but closed up just 4.1% as investors doubt a deal will happen. Musk, the top shareholder of both companies, said he won't vote on any merger agreement.The Federal Reserve passed all 33 banks -- including majors JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) -- in the first round of its annual stress tests, as expected. Investors will now focus on the second round of results, set for release Wednesday, that will determine whether banks can carry out their submitted plans to return capital to shareholders. But just because banks can weather a storm doesn't mean it will be fun: Bank stocks were among the biggest losers Friday on the Brexit fallout, erasing gains from earlier in the week.Adobe reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings per share on in-line sales for its fiscal second quarter ended June 3, but investors focused on its disappointing sales guidance for Q3.The maker of digital media and marketing software earned 71 cents a share excluding items, 3 cents above views, on sales of $1.4 billion. It was Adobe's fourth straight quarter of 20% or greater sales growth and its seventh straight quarter of double-digit gains in adjusted EPS.For the current quarter, Adobe is targeting non-GAAP earnings per share of 72 cents on sales of $1.445 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance. Analysts had been modeling 71 cents, up 31%, on sales of $1.47 billion, up 21%.Adobe shares were down 3.55% for the week, undercutting a buy area.Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) announced a deal to buy an 84% stake in mobile video game company Supercell for $8.6 billion. The transaction values the Finnish game developer at $10.2 billion.Helsinki-based Supercell makes free-to-play mobile games such as ""Clash of Clans"" and ""Clash Royale."" It makes money by selling virtual goods that help players advance in its games. Supercell's games are played by more than 100 million people each day.Tencent is a leader in online games. It owns ""League of Legends"" maker Riot Games and distributes games in China for Activision (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and others.Wal-Mart (WMT) announced an alliance with China's JD.com (JD), with JD taking ownership of Wal-Mart's Yihaodian marketplace, its China e-commerce business, in return for an approximate 5% stake in JD.com in the form of newly issued shares. The move may help both Wal-Mart and JD compete against Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA).JD.com is the second-largest online retailer in China after Alibaba. Wal-Mart has struggled to build its China business.Wal-Mart rose 1.4%, hitting a 10-month high. JD closed up 2.5% for the week.Twitter (TWTR) expanded its push into machine learning with the acquisition of Magic Pony Technology, a London-based startup that specializes in visual processing.Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but the price tag was reported to be $150 million.Magic Pony's technology ranges across computer vision, machine learning, high-performance computing and computational neuroscience.Also, Twitter gave its users more room to unleash their creativity, expanding the length of its video play to 140 seconds from 30, as it battles for viewers with the likes of Facebook (FB) photo and video sharing site Instagram, which has now grown to 500 million subscribers.The Twitter change is designed to help video creators boost their audiences and make money in the process.Existing-home sales rose 1.8% in May to an annual rate of 5.53 million, the highest in nine years, the National Association of Realtors said. But new-home sales fell 6% to 551,000, the Commerce Department said. April new-home sales were revised down sharply to 586,000 from the initial reading of 619,000. Tight supply has limited purchases of new dwellings. But homebuilders Lennar (LEN) and KB Home (KBH) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings.Meanwhile, new jobless claims fell 18,000 in the week ended June 18 to 259,000, the Labor Department said. That was a bigger drop than expected, and put the total back near a 43-year low set in March. It's a good sign for the June employment report after May's surprisingly weak payrolls gain.The Transportation Department and FAA finalized regulations for the commercial use of drones, which officials say could generate more than $82 billion for the U.S. economy over the next 10 years. The rules are seen as less restrictive than expected. Under the new regulations, the unmanned aircraft must be kept within the pilot's line of sight and cannot be operated at night, but those restrictions could be lifted under a waiver. Among the publicly traded companies impacted by the new rules are Amazon (AMZN), Wal-Mart, GoPro (GPRO) and AeroVironment (AVAV).Red Hat reported fiscal Q1 revenue and billings slightly above views, as well as in-line earnings. But it forecast full-year profit that was a bit light, citing a new planned acquisition. Some analysts said larger enterprise deals were a bright spot. The open-source Linux software company increased a stock buyback program to $1 billion from its earlier $500 million authorization. Red Hat is expected to update its public cloud strategy at an investor day slated for June 30.Red Hat stock tumbled 4.8% for the week, falling below a recent buy point.FedEx reported strong fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenue growth, both topping analyst estimates. But the company forecast adjusted EPS of $11.75-$12.25 for the current fiscal year. The midpoint of $12 was below consensus of $12.05. FedEx also didn't say how its recently acquired European shipper TNT Express would affect results. Shares fell 4.5% on Wednesday, a day after it issued Q4 results. Shares are off 7.2% this week, undercutting the 200-day line.The No. 2 U.S. package shipper plans to spend about $5.1 billion this year for ongoing expansion of the FedEx Ground network, as well as for planned aircraft purchases to support the FedEx Express fleet modernization program. Rival and No. 1 shipper UPS (UPS) crept out to a 17-month high on Thursday before tumbling Friday to fall less 1% for the week amid the Brexit turmoil on the market.

The move points to declining bond prices and rising yields which, in turn, should drive up interest rates across the economy.The expectations have been a positive for banks and other credit and financial institutions, the leading beneficiaries of rising interest rates.

173,FDX,"It’s an ambitious plan by Amazon (AMZN), to procure a fleet of 40 airline freighters and lessen its dependence on FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS).The 40 aircraft that Amazon plans to have fully operational by 2018 will enable it to bring as much as 30% of its current delivery volume in-house, according to a research report Monday by Moody’s Investors Service analyst Jonathan Root.In terms of short- and medium-haul aircraft, Amazon's fleet would be 21% the size of UPS' and 14% the size of FedEx's, says Root. In terms of payload capacity, Amazon’s fleet would be 26% the size of UPS’ and 17% of FedEx’s, excluding their largest freighters that fly mostly long-haul routes for those companies, Root wrote.“As significant as that sounds, the business that UPS and FedEx will lose may not be as bad as it sounds,” Root wrote. “Revenue and average daily volumes at UPS and FedEx will be hurt, but there’s plenty of opportunity for them to replace that lost business with growing volumes from higher-yielding customers” and growth in e-commerce.Root also says that Amazon is one of the least profitable customers for UPS and FedEx, because Amazon's size enables it to negotiate considerable discounts.“The extent to which UPS and FedEx can offset volume declines from Amazon with new business from other customers will determine how beneficial or detrimental Amazon's plan will be to the companies' segment operating margins,” Root wrote.Amazon stock was down 0.9%, to 696.75 in the stock market today, after touching a record high above 722 on May 12. It's an IBD Leaderboard stock. UPS stock was down 0.4% to 101.09, while FedEx ticked up a fraction to 162.04.The threat would grow if other large retailers follow Amazon’s lead, which he says is possible.“We understand that Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) is investing to improve its e-commerce positioning by building eight e-commerce warehouses,” Root wrote.Wal-Mart already offers free shipping on orders of more than $50, and it might broadly offer an e-commerce membership that includes free shipping, as Amazon does with its Amazon Prime membership service.Still, it's not clear how deeply Amazon will dive into transportation services.“We estimate that Amazon could build a competing U.S. ground network for between $8 billion and $15 billion,"" Root wrote. ""We believe the company has the financial capacity to continue adding fulfillment centers, pickup locations and local and regional delivery operations, it if chooses to do so.”More than that, Amazon could offer its delivery services to the many third-party sellers on its site.“Such an offering would be more problematic for UPS’ and FedEx’s longer-term financial performance,” Root wrote.

174,FDX,"The first thing online clothing reseller ThredUp did after clinching a new round of funding last year? Hunt for strategic warehouse space to get the goods to its customers as fast as possible. Amazon.com (AMZN) has spoiled consumers for anything less.Within six months, ThredUp's chief executive, James Reinhart, had signed leases on two additional warehouses. The newest facility, outside Atlanta, is now being filled with inventory. The 150,000-square-foot space is ThredUp's gateway to the southeastern U.S., an operations hub where the secondhand clothes are received, inspected, sorted, stored on racks, and then packaged and shipped out the back door.The new need for speed means retailers need more warehouses in more locations. Early on, ThredUp had only one warehouse, in California. ""It took forever to get stuff to the East Coast,"" said Reinhart, 37. ""It used to suck for that customer.""Over the past year, prime warehouse rents are up 9.9% across the U.S. and up by double-digit amounts in some large urban areas, according to a recent report. In some cities, surging demand has helped set off a speculative-building boom unlike anything in recent memory. In the first three months of the year, warehouse developers in the Chicago area broke ground on more speculative projects than in any quarter during the past two decades, according to Ryan Bain, a vice president at CBRE Group (CBG). There are currently 28 warehouse users in the market for 18 million square feet of space, triple the available supply, Bain said.E-commerce alone is responsible for 20% of the current demand, according to Eric Frankel, an analyst at Green Street Advisors, helping to drive the spike in construction despite retail sales growth that has been slower than in previous economic expansions. Space close to population centers has become an especially hot commodity as startups compete for space with such shippers as FedEx (FDX) and traditional retailers like Macy’s (M) pursue the dream of same-day delivery.Much of the warehouse craze is a reaction to a single player. Amazon has built a massive network of distribution centers as the muscle behind its re-education of the American consumer. Shoppers have gotten used to short shipping times when ordering from the retail giant's vast inventory of goods, forcing traditional retailers to build out online platforms and the capability to ship to consumers directly from brick-and-mortar stores.“For the past 30 years, supply chains have been cost centers,” said Karl Siebrecht, chief executive of Flexe, a 3-year-old company that styles itself as the Airbnb of warehouse space. “Amazon came in and turned supply chains into a growth weapon. Now the whole retail industry is trying to keep up.”The dynamic has helped turn a mundane corner of real estate into a hot property.“They are boring,” said Anthony Pricco, a principal at the Chicago-based builder Bridge Development Partners, of his company’s buildings. “We do tours with our capital partners, and after the third one their eyes start to glaze over. But cash flow is sexy, and these things tend to do pretty well.”In Dallas, a handy location for reaching customers in the fourth-largest U.S. metro area, as well as for shipping to customers elsewhere in the fast-growing state, more than 14 million square feet of warehouse space is under construction on spec, according to CBRE. That number doesn’t include build-to-suit construction, in which the user of the space hires a developer to build a site to its specification. In the Kansas City area, speculative builders completed 3 million square feet of space after building just 155,000 square feet in 2012.From the beginning, ThredUp's Reinhart looked to cut down on shipping times, but it's expensive to build that kind of distribution network. Previously, retailers set up one or two large centers in the middle of the country to store and ship their products. Now they're looking for smaller spaces in more places. Reinhart's chief operating officer viewed 20 buildings in the Atlanta area before picking the one ThredUp would lease. Problems ranged from lack of internet access to a dearth of public transportation for workers.""Finding really good space is always a challenge,"" said Reinhart, who is already analyzing data in a search of his next location.Amid the growth, a new model of the modern warehouse has emerged. In decades past, when distribution centers were used to ship pallets of boxes to brick-and-mortar stores, ceilings topped out at around 24 feet. Go back further and the standard warehouse was a brick building near a seaport or railyard, the kind of structure developers are currently remodeling as startup office spaces and luxury lofts.These days, some developers are building warehouses with 40-foot clearances to accommodate tall racks of shelves from which workers can pick products to fulfill customer orders. Some new construction comes with 2,000 parking spaces, or more, to accommodate the armies of workers brought on during the holiday rush.“For 50 years, the warehouse development business was simple. You would build one exit farther out on the Interstate, and then you would just buy the next farmer’s land,” said Philip Hawkins, chief executive of DCT Industrial Trust (DCT), a Denver-based builder. Tenants were focused on price per square foot and didn’t mind driving a few extra miles, Hawkins said. Today they want to be closer to city centers, where large tracts of land can be harder to come by, driving up costs.Optimistic companies overextended themselves in the last economic cycle, leaving many in dire condition when growth screeched to a halt. In the current building boom, developers are doing a better job of matching new supply to existing demand, said Sam Chandan, president of Chandan Economics, a provider of real estate data and analysis. Still, developers now building spec projects could end up holding unwanted properties if the economy were to cool down.“A big piece of this is that there’s just more packages moving around,” Chandan said. “But if you’re starting a construction project now, you run the risk of being done at the worst possible time.”Related:Starbucks, Nike Lead IBD 50 Stocks Outsmarting Crummy Retail SpaceBrick-And-Mortar Retail Doing Solid Business, Mall Landlords SayUnder Armour's Huge New Warehouse Said To Top Amazon

175,FDX,"Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) is testing a two-day package delivery program on more than 1 million items in a bid to keep up with Amazon.com (AMZN) and boost flagging sales and profits, the company said Thursday.Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, is launching the pilot ""ShippingPass"" as a subscription service for $49 a year, shaving a dollar off its current $50-a-year, three-day service. The subscription gives users unlimited shipping of eligible items purchased on Walmart.com. It's also building a network of eight large distribution centers to coordinate storage and logistics as it speeds up its delivery system.Users would be under no minimum order requirements, and returns are free. Currently, FedEx (FDX) handles the bulk of Wal-Mart's deliveries.Amazon includes free shipping with its $99-a-year Prime membership, which also includes perks like unlimited streaming of a large library of movies and TV shows that rivals the offerings of Netflix (NFLX). It also offers same-day delivery for a fee.""Building out our fulfillment network has enabled us to offer faster and more affordable shipping,"" Wal-Mart said in a prepared statement emailed to Investor's Business Daily.Wal-Mart's revenue has shrunk 1% year over year in each of the last two quarters, and its diluted earnings per share has contracted for four quarters in a row. It's investing in technologies to stay competitive, and last year its online sales grew to $13.7 billion, reports said.Still, the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for Wal-Mart's EPS to continue shrinking on a quarterly basis for the next year.Meanwhile, Amazon continues to grow sales at a double-digit quarterly rate and posted a $1.07 per share profit last quarter, reversing from a loss of 12 cents a share during the same period in 2015.Wal-Mart shares rose 0.7% to 68.85 in the stock market today. It hit an all-time high at 90.97 in mid-January 2015 but has fallen about 27% from that point since.

176,FDX,"In 2010, Amazon.com (AMZN) had 26 fulfillment centers in North America. By 2017, it will have 88, according to Cowen analyst John Blackledge.In a research report Monday, Blackledge said Amazon's rapid and massive delivery-system expansion -- costing the company more than $10 billion in capital expenditures -- is likely to continue for the foreseeable future and will not be matched by rivals such as Wal-Mart (WMT).Doubling down on the fulfillment business has meant continuing to innovate, especially in Amazon's ""sortation"" centers, he says. These centers facilitate last-mile delivery -- a notorious problem for any logistics company -- and, in conjunction with increased United States Postal Service shipments, improvements here could drive down the cost of shipping to $1.85 per order from $4 to $5, the analyst says.Though spending big bucks has depressed earnings, generating ire among investors, the strategy is sticking close to the philosophy Jeff Bezos laid out in his 1997 letter to shareholders, that the company will put customers before profits.Amazon stock was up a fraction in afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 624. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 77, where 99 is the highest. After a low-volume breakout, Amazon is still in buy range from a 603.34 cup-with-handle buy point. Amazon is an IBD Leaderboard stock.The company, meanwhile, also is expanding its FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS)-like services. The company has acknowledged a widely circulated rumor that it was launching a fleet of jets -- which it is leasing and operating out of Wilmington, Ohio. Blackledge says this program has the potential to make every Amazon item deliverable within a day.The e-commerce leader is set to report Q1 earnings after the close Thursday. Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter wrote in a research note last week that the company will miss EPS expectations but beat sales estimates.
"
177,FDX,"Ten years ago Amazon (AMZN) launched Amazon Web Services, one of the earliest experiments with cloud computing that Chief Executive Jeff Bezos recently described as the planting of a ""tiny seed.""That seed has turned into a giant beanstalk. Sales for the unit, known as AWS, now are on pace to reach $12.5 billion for the year, based on first-quarter results.And thanks to its early entry in the business, AWS is now the leader in cloud computing, with a market share of 31%. The next closest competitor is Microsoft (MSFT) with 9%, followed by IBM (IBM), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Cloud unit, and Salesforce.com (CRM).""This year, Amazon became the fastest company ever to reach $100 billion in annual sales,"" Bezos said in his April 6 letter, reflecting on the 2015 fiscal year. ""Also this year, Amazon Web Services is reaching $10 billion in annual sales, doing so at a pace even faster than Amazon achieved that milestone.""AWS is a collection of services, including storage, networking, application services and other features businesses pay to use on an as-needed basis via the cloud. It's a business that Bezos says has been built organically without significant acquisitions.In the first quarter, the unit had sales of $2.56 billion, up 64% year over year, compared with 28% growth in total company sales. AWS comprises 15% of total sales for the period, up from 11.7% a year ago.""The reason to hold Amazon stock is AWS,"" said Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co., which owns 41,802 Amazon shares. ""AWS is the gem in the haystack.""Microsoft and Alphabet, in particular, are being aggressive with increased investments in cloud technology, said Morgan, which could create some risk of future pricing pressure. But it’s not a big concern in that Amazon has demonstrated the ability to weather price wars in times past, he said.AWS was a big reason Amazon reported its highest sales growth in nearly four years when it posted first-quarter earnings on April 28. The e-commerce powerhouse swung to a first-quarter profit of $1.07 a share, which crushed the consensus estimate of 58 cents, and swung from a loss of 12 cents a share a year earlier.Revenue jumped 28% to $29.1 billion, ahead of the $28 billion view. Amazon sees total second-quarter revenue of $28 billion to $30.5 billion, with the midpoint 26% above Wall Street forecasts of $28.3 billion.""Amazon has, in a lot of ways, become a part of everyday life,"" said David Smith, a vice president and analyst at research firm Gartner. ""It’s not just through the purchase of goods and entertainment. Even with AWS, people are in contact with Amazon in ways they don’t even know.""Amazon stock broke out April 13 and is up 10% since then, despite a selloff in the Nasdaq overall. Shares slipped in mid-April, then jumped 10% the day after Amazon reported first-quarter earnings. The stock ended Friday trading up more than 2% to 673.95 in the stock market today.Amazon received several price upgrades following the earnings report. One came from John Blackledge, a Cowen analyst, who upped his price to 830 from 750. Another was from Shebly Seyrafi, analyst at FBN Securities, who raised his price target to 800 from 685, with a research note titled ""Hitting on All Cylinders.""""This was a very strong report from Amazon,"" Seyrafi wrote, which he said was the result of strong top- and bottom-line growth, strong gains with AWS and international growth, which rose 26% to $9.6 billion. There is ""ample room ahead"" for continued growth in its core retail business, he wrote.That primary source of Amazon's revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers through its Amazon.com website, both in the U.S. and abroad. Revenue from this category, referred to in its earnings reports as electronics and other general merchandise, rose 31% in the first quarter to $20.55 billion.Growth was fueled by the increasing number of annual subscribers to Amazon Prime. Initially a free-shipping service, Prime's membership base has been a source of extensive and envious consumer loyalty for Amazon. The membership now includes access to Prime Video, a Netflix-like service, Prime Music, which provides free music streaming, and unlimited photo storage with Prime Photos.Nomura analyst Robert Drbul says Prime has helped Amazon in several ways.""We believe Amazon has established significant brand equity here in the U.S. and that its leadership position remains quite secure."" Drbul said in a research note after first-quarter earnings. ""While the size of its Prime base remains undisclosed, we believe the loyalty rivals that of the Costco Executive Membership base.""A part of Amazon’s success is its willingness to experiment in many ways with new products and services, something that Bezos says has been essential to the company's success.""To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it’s going to work, it’s not an experiment,"" Bezos wrote in the shareholder letter. ""We want to be a large company that’s also an invention machine.""Some experiments have flopped, like the Amazon Fire smartphone, while others have become unexpected hits, like the Echo, an in-home, voice-activated device that connects to WiFi. On request it plays music, read books, provides traffic and weather, helps people order pizza or request service from Uber, among many other features.Eventually, some analysts think Amazon could elect to get into the shipping business, much as it entered cloud computing services business with AWS. Like Amazon’s growing delivery capacity, AWS began out of necessity as the company built up its infrastructure to fulfill its own growing needs and expanded to serve other companies from there.There's evidence already that Amazon is on the road to compete with the likes of FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS). For one, the company has announced the purchase of a fleet of trucks to ferry goods between fulfillment centers. Plus, Amazon announced an agreement to lease up to 20 Boeing 767s from Air Transport Services Group, in an effort to expedite delivery of goods.Amazon has said the additional shipping capacity is especially helpful during peak delivery times, which other shippers are overloaded.“This gives us extra capacity and we think it's good to be able to deliver to customers,"" Phil Hardin, Amazon director of investor relations, said on the company's earnings call, ""and we think it makes sense over the long term.""

Another director, Robert Milton, disclosed the purchase of 1,000 United shares for a little over $49,000.Meanwhile, Southwest Director David Biegler disclosed Thursday the sale and options exercise of 8,000 shares for a total of nearly $376,000.Airline stocks have been under pressure recently amid signs that expansion plans are eroding unit revenue. Last week, United said that it would curb growth as industry capacity outpaces traffic.United shares plunged 9.5% vs. a week ago, and Southwest fell 5.6%.FedEx CEO Frederick Smith disclosed on Monday a sale and options exercise of 200,000 shares for a total transaction value of $33.2 million.The sale came ahead of rival UPS’ (UPS) earnings on Thursday. UPS beat views but warned that pension cuts may result in a $3.8 billion charge that could lower full-year earnings.FedEx shares dipped 0.7%, and UPS eased 0.4%.Insider transactions don’t typically have a major impact on a stock or indicate major pending news.

180,FDX,"United Parcel Service (UPS) fell after warning that it may have to take a charge of as much as $3.8 billion related to a potential pension-fund obligation.The stock dropped as much as 2.3%, the biggest intraday decline since Jan. 20. The shares later pared the loss, trading essentially flat intraday on the stock market today.The U.S. Treasury Department is considering approving benefit cuts to the Central States Pension Fund to keep the multi-employer plan solvent. UPS pulled out of the fund in 2007 but agreed to make up any losses its remaining members experienced.The Atlanta-based company may have to record a charge of $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion if the government approves the benefit cuts, executives said on a conference call after reporting earnings Thursday. UPS plans to oppose such a move by the Treasury.“The market is reacting to the size of the potential liability and concern about the unknown impact to future numbers,” said David Vernon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. “I think it’s overdone. This is an issue that’s going to be resolved in the courts regardless of what Treasury decides.”UPS reported that earnings excluding items rose to $1.27 a share, beating the $1.22 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue increased 3.2% to $14.4 billion, the Atlanta-based company said in a statement. Analysts had predicted $14.6 billion.Executives attributed the higher earnings in part to a 15% increase in operating profit in its European unit. A 6% gain in business-to-consumer shipments helped propel U.S. domestic revenue up 3.1%.UPS had fewer disruptions to its air and road network in the first quarter than in previous years that were plagued with costly storms. The company also has been partly insulated from a slowdown in U.S. freight volume because of a growing reliance on e-commerce, said Kevin Sterling, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets.UPS fared well during the peak holiday season in November and December, delivering its crush of packages ahead of Christmas.

182,FDX,"In the wake of the housing meltdown and Great Recession, many large banks that were burdened with bad loans and heavy leverage, cut back on lending. For midsize businesses that typically have no credit ratings and are frozen out of bond markets, the loss of bank credit was especially vexing.But for Chief Executive Christopher Volk and his co-founders of the real estate investment trust (REIT) Store Capital (STOR), it all added up to a prime business opportunity. Why not seek out mid-market companies that need capital, buy their real estate and then lease it back to them?A win-win, if everything is properly handled. The unrated midsize companies -- typically operating restaurants, movie theaters, health clubs and furniture stores -- would free up capital by selling real estate. And by picking solid companies that were turning a profit, Store Capital could assemble a portfolio of reliable long-term leases.Store Capital built a direct sales force to go out and find purchase and lease-back targets. It looked for companies that were operating successful locations but lacked the credit rating that would allow them to access bond markets.""These are the people that need us,"" Volk told Investor’s Business Daily.And Store Capital seeks out locations that produce profit.A FedEx (FDX) distribution center would not qualify, said Volk, because it is a ""cost center."" Store Capital wants to buy the locations that are actually bringing in cash.""Our focus is really on the unrated middle market and larger business. Just to own the profit center,"" Volk said.The strategy has been working. Last year, Store Capital acquired $1.2 billion worth of new properties, allowing it to grow revenue by roughly 50% over 2014 to just under $285 million.And the purchase and lease-back strategy has been profitable, as Store acquired properties with a yearly return on capital -- or cap rate -- of over 8%. With his long history in the business, Volk has helped Store Capital borrow money and sell equity at an average cost of capital at 4.4% last year.The difference between the return on capital and the cost of capital is known as the spread. In 2015, for Store Capital, the spread was 3.7%.""Our spread last year was the best I’ve ever had in my life,"" said Volk, who has led real estate companies for three decades.Analysts credit Store Capital‘s proactive style of seeking out investment and lease-back opportunities.""They call and create the product,"" said Wunderlich Securities analyst Craig Kucera.""They are working with tenants to show them the financial benefits of sale and lease-back,"" said Cowen & Co. analyst Michael Gorman. ""These are tenants that aren’t as well served by traditional sources of financing.""Of course, the Fed’s suppression of interest rates has greased the credit wheels for many borrowers.""Generally, when you have a long decline in interest rates, this space is one of the best performers,"" noted Kucera.And the Fed, seemingly obsessed with fear that abrupt rate hikes might puncture the equity markets it has helped to inflate, shows little stomach for sustained tightening. Store Capital should be able to survive a modest pace of tightening, Volk contends.""Even if rates go up, we should do fine,"" he said. He does allow, though, that a steep climb could pinch.""When the 10-year Treasury was 6.5% it was much more difficult,"" he recalled.Cowen analyst Gorman suggests one way that even relatively modest rate hikes would hurt. Right now, Store Capital pays a dividend of roughly 4% and is seen as a ""yield play,"" he said.  Rising rates would make other investments relatively more attractive.The bigger risk for Store Capital would be tenant default, perhaps as the result of a major economic downturn. Roughly $2.4 billion of Store Capital’s $4 billion portfolio serves as collateral for loans. So a massive wave of defaults could affect Store Capital’s revenue stream and hence, its ability to pay back loans.But that risk is offset to some degree by Store Capital’s diversified portfolio, according to Kucera. No tenant comprises more than 3% of the portfolio, he noted. For his part, Volk says Store Capital would like to increase the weighting of unencumbered properties in its portfolio.""We do plan to do that over time,"" he said.Thus far Store Capital has had access to the capital it needs. And late last year, Fitch Ratings bestowed a BBB- rating on two Store Capital private placement offerings. That’s an investment grade rating, though it is the lowest rung on the investment grade ladder.On the positive side, Fitch cited Store Capital’s ""strong management team"" along with its differentiated investment strategy and diversified portfolio.But in releasing the rating, Fitch noted that the having all those collateralized assets could give the company incentive to ""prioritize the encumbered asset pool.""For now, Store Capital seems to have discovered a market sweet spot that will continue to produce profitable opportunities. Volk says the firm has identified 70,000 potential targets that could benefit from its investment and services.Could Store Capital again realize that 3.7% spread that marks the high point of Volk’s three decades in real estate?""It’s possible to get close to that this year,"" he concluded.

184,FDX,"And the mkts have come roaring back…even the trains, planes and automobiles are joining in on the fun as the Dow Transports (Trannies) are now back in 'official' Bull mkt mode having rallied 22% off of the January lows…..Now Dow Theory tells us that the mkt is in an uptrend when ONE of its averages (the industrials or the trannies) advances above a previous important high….it should then be followed by the other Dow index…Now while the Trannies have not pierced their November highs of 8286 - they have rocketed higher over the past 8 weeks – (as noted up 22%), they have pierced the down trending 200 dma at 7856 and look like they are 'breaking out'..... and appear to be on their way to challenge the November high -Now this is important really – because the Trannies represent the transportation sector of the US economy and its companies are tied to the shipping, rail, and trucking sectors – sectors that 'move stuff around' and send signals about the health of the economy…..now recall – this index got 'clocked' in the early part of the year……after concerns about global growth and a coming US recession caused investors to shift out of this important 'barometer group' - Because slowing global growth and a US recession would negatively impact these companies. And there were some real serious concerns – as investors took some 22% out of the index since late November - but remember simple math works in strange ways....if the index (or a stock or any asset) goes down in value by 22% and then rallies back by 22% - you are still short - you have NOT gone back to 0 - in fact the index needs to rally back 30% just to stay even. So it still has work to do.......The latest move now tells us that investors have changed their minds…..Global Growth Concerns? US Recession? – Bah Humbug……Apparently investors are convinced that the worst is over and they have gone out on a buying spree – scooping up some names for a fraction of their current value. Now the Trannies are trading at about 13 times trailing earnings – or a 32% discount to their 3 yr avg of 19.2 times. So there IS value there IF the supposed improving global macro data is true. A look at some of the participants reveals where investors are placing their bets....UPS (UPS) & FedEx (FDX) - have rocketed higher, piercing their 200 dma's....while , Kansas City Southern (KSU), CSX Corp. (CSX), Kirby Corp. (KEX) are all teasing these key trend lines....Now overnight - global mkts began the week a bit mixed.....There is not a lot of macro data due out this week - so we can expect the mkts to churn and digest the latest moves in this holiday shortened week.......Japan was closed for a holiday and China surged by 2% as investors there focused on loosening margin lending requirements.....Australia came under a bit of pressure as losses in commodities weighed on that mkt.In Europe - those mkts are flat to slightly higher after a weaker opening....There was no material news out to drive the mkts either way - so they churn. FTSE -0.09%, CAC 40 -0.2%, DAX +0.4% , EUROSTOXX +0.12%, SPAIN +0.19% and ITALY +0.83%.Oil once again under pressure as the dollar stabilizes and moves a bit higher....remember - much of the oil action has been dollar driven and more unprecedented global monetary easing has created a currency war but has helped to wipe out the losses suffered since January. Now while it makes everyone feel good - the weak dynamics of the global economy still exist....and with earnings season only 2 weeks away - it will be about the fundamentals once again.....And while the central banks have all created the fire - the latest move is sure to come under some pressure if the fundamentals disappoint..... If the fundamentals do not disappoint - then the conversation returns to FED policy and interest rates. I continue to believe that June will see a small hike of 25 bps - but then nothing more.US futures are flat, the dollar is flat and oil is now down 1% as the day begins.....We only have one data point and this is Existing Home Sales - expectations are for a drop of 2.9% m/m. Atlanta FED's Dennis Lockhart is due to speak today at 12:30 pm - I would not expect him to say anything so significant - as he tends to be Dove and is on the side of the latest FED move. - So if anything - look for him to remain cautious on the outlook.....Now the S&P at 2048 is well above the 200 dma which stands at 2017. In this holiday shortened week - with little eco data to digest - it would not be surprising to see the S&P test what is now support for the mkts. After the most recent rally - the mkt is a bit ahead of itself and some back testing is in order.Take Good Care

188,FDX,"The S&P 500 index and Dow industrials set record highs through the week, until the weak payroll report ended their hot streaks, while the Nasdaq composite eked out another gain. Netflix (NFLX) broke out and set new highs, and General Motors (GM) soared on strong September sales and big plans for electric vehicles. Tesla (TSLA) stock brushed off weak Model 3 production figures, and Amazon.com (AMZN) rose on reports that it's testing a home-delivery service.XThe index reversed higher Friday to notch a ninth straight gain. The S&P 500's win streak ended at eight, its longest in four years, and its six straight record highs marked its longest such streak since 1997. The Dow had seven straight gains.

The Nasdaq finished with a 1.45% weekly gain, and the Dow outpaced them with a 1.6% rise The economy lost 33,000 jobs in September, but financial markets overlooked that temporary, hurricane-related hit and focused on the employment report's underlying strength. The jobless rate fell to 4.2%, the lowest since early 2001, while average hourly wage gains jumped to 2.9%, matching the best gain since 2009. Other data earlier in the week also pointed to an economy that seems to finally be breaking out of its eight-year run of slow growth, though some of the strength may reflect a boost from hurricane recovery efforts. The Institute for Supply Management manufacturing survey index jumped to a 13-year high of 60.8, far above the 50 neutral mark. The ISM's nonmanufacturing survey gauge also surprised on the upside, registering its fastest growth since August 2005.RELATED:Economy Sheds 33,000 Jobs, But Jobless Rate Hits 16-Year LowISM Manufacturing Index Jumps To Highest Since 2004General Motors, Ford Motor (F), Toyota (TM) and most automakers reported stronger-than-expected September U.S. sales, as demand rebounded following hurricanes. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) was an exception, but that was due to a decision to slash low-margin fleet sales. Industrywide sales hit an annual rate of 18.57 million, the best of the year.RELATED:GM, Ford Soar As U.S. Auto Sales Get Post-Hurricane SurgeGM vowed to add 20 electric and fuel-cell vehicles by 2023, though it'll largely finance the effort via profits on its gas-guzzling SUVs and trucks. Ford, which has not been as profitable as GM and has lagged in EVs, said it will slash $14 billion in costs to expand its production of electric vehicles as well as trucks and SUVs. Volvo and several other automakers have also announced plans for a rapid expansion of EV and hybrid models, despite tepid demand, as China and major European countries and cities announce plans to ban sales of gas-only vehicles in the coming decades.

Tesla delivered just 220 Model 3 cars in Q3. Overall deliveries reached 26,100, amid strong demand for the more-expensive Model S and Model X. But the Model 3 woes are a bad sign for Tesla's push to make 20,000 in December and an even-faster pace in 2018. Tesla shares fell to a two-month low, extending a recent pullback. But shares rebounded, helped by Nomura initiating Tesla at a buy with a 500 price target. The stock rallied 4.6% for the week.RELATED:Tesla Stock Falls On Model 3 Production Miss Due To BottlenecksThe streaming video leader raised monthly prices on its midrange and high-end tiers by $1 and $2, respectively, as it gets ready to sink $7 billion into content acquisition next year. The price hikes will only be in the U.S. and will start in November.

Google added a new member to its voice-activated home automation family but didn't one-up Amazon, which has sold some 15 million of its Echo speaker systems. Google rolled out a new $399 home speaker system that competes with Apple's HomePod. The 5-inch-screen Pixel 2 starts at $649 while the 6-inch-screen Pixel 2 XL starts at $849, which is about $150 less than the iPhone X but $80 more than the large-screen version of the first Pixel rolled out in 2016. Google also unveiled a new $999 Pixel-branded laptop that will compete with Apple's MacBooks.RELATED:Google Hardware Launch Takes More Shots At Apple Than AmazonLennar (LEN) reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue Tuesday.

MGM's China unit also said it would delay the opening of its new casino on the Cotai strip section of Macau to early next year, from the last half of 2017, due to damage from Typhoon Hato in August. September gambling revenue from Macau jumped 16% to $2.7 billion, but early estimates on the number of visitors to Macau during the key ""Golden Week"" holiday period were weak.Delta Air Lines (DAL) led the airline sector higher after the carrier offered a third-quarter unit-revenue forecast that, when factoring out Hurricane Irma, looked OK in the eyes of some analysts. Delta, American Airlines (AAL), JetBlue (JBLU) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) were seen as more vulnerable to the areas where the storm struck. Cowen also said that the guidance suggested ""stabilizing pricing trends for Delta"" amid a fare war between network carriers and low-cost rivals that had earlier ravaged airline stocks.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) said it would take a 38.6% stake in Pilot Flying J, a large truck-stop chain, with plans to gobble up an extra 41.4% in 2023. Buffett, in a statement, called Pilot Flying J ""a key enabler of the nation's economy."" The move boosts Buffett's transportation-related holdings and gives him a way to use some of the roughly $100 billion that his company has accumulated. Buffett also praised Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan for his efforts to turn the bank around, and the billionaire investor said he'd be a shareholder for a ""long, long, long time.""

The membership-based retailer reported that EPS grew 18% to $2.08 as revenue climbed 16% to $42.3 billion. Both topped estimates, as did results for same-store sales. Some investors worry about the Amazon effect on Costco's business, but the retailer's e-commerce sales grew 30% in September and 21% in the fourth quarter.The Yum Brands (YUM) spinoff increased its share buyback and initiated a dividend, while also naming a new CEO. But Yum China's (YUMC) quarterly results were mixed: EPS of 53 cents missed by 2 cents, and revenue of $2.04 billion topped views for $1.995 billion.

192,FDX,"Amazon.com (AMZN) kicked off its Whole Foods takeover on Aug. 28 by slashing the prices of avocados, kale and other items at the ""Whole Paycheck"" grocery chain by as much as 43%. Who could argue with that?Consumer welfare has been the foremost concern of U.S. antitrust law since the 1980s, with price hikes seen as the surest sign of monopoly power. Yet a growing chorus of critics complain that Amazon and fellow internet giants Facebook (FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are becoming too dominant, snuffing out competition, innovation and even freedom of expression.Wall Street is starting to ponder a trillion-dollar question: Could the Whole Foods buyout mark a turning point that leads to serious U.S. antitrust scrutiny for Amazon, Facebook and Google?""In the face of bona fide threats of regulatory and political opposition to Amazon, we against all odds finally may be facing 'Peak Amazon,' "" hedge fund manager Doug Kass wrote on July 11.His warning was premature. The Federal Trade Commission cleared the Whole Foods deal in barely two months.When it comes to total sales, Wal-Mart's (WMT) $486 billion towers over Amazon's $136 billion in 2016, and its nearly 4,700 U.S. stores dwarf Whole Foods' 460. However, Amazon did grab 43% of U.S. online sales in 2016, as well as 53% of the growth in the fast-moving sector, according to Slice Intelligence.Rather than unfair competition, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet's Google are the beneficiaries of the internet's winner-take-all dynamics, says Joachim Fels, managing director at Pimco. These superstars ""benefit from network effects that are especially strong in social media and software platforms, where the value of the services increases with the number of users,"" Fels wrote. ""Size begets size, which in turn begets size.""If someone wants to connect with friends or customers via social media, Facebook is the obvious choice: 85% of Americans who are online are members. Not even Google could compete with that. And if you want to shop, where else to start but Amazon.com, which lists hundreds of millions of items?But natural or not, their advantages unnerve observers from the far left to the White House and even at the pro-market University of Chicago, which spawned the big-isn't-necessarily-bad legal shift under President Reagan.Before Steve Bannon was pushed out of the White House as President Trump's senior advisor and returned to the populist, right-wing news site Breitbart, he reportedly made the case that Facebook and Google's dominance made them ""essential elements of 21st-century life (that) should be regulated as utilities."" Could that be sour grapes?  A majority of Americans now say they get their news from social media sites led by Facebook and from Google's search.XYet many conservatives and even some libertarians with traditionally hands-off inclinations toward business are growing concerned over the internet giants' power. That's intensified after Google's recent firing of an engineer for politically incorrect views on women and the high-tech workforce, and moves by Facebook and others to combat ""fake news"" and ban offensive speech.Trump raised the possibility of antitrust action against Amazon during the campaign. He still has CEO Jeff Bezos' empire in his sights, even if his real beef is with the Bezos-owned Washington Post. ""Amazon is doing great damage to taxpaying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt — many jobs being lost!"" Trump tweeted recently.Worries about Amazon's impact on retail jobs and wages also risk making it a prime target on the left. Democratic Party leaders called for an antitrust crackdown as part of their ""Better Deal"" economic platform in July. Although they singled out the cable industry, rather than the Silicon Valley and Seattle tech giants, that could change. Rep. Keith Ellison, who represents Minneapolis and serves as deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, recently retweeted a Bloomberg opinion column titled ""Should America's Tech Giants Be Broken Up?"" with a one-word response: ""YES!""Economists and technologists worry that these internet companies' dominance will snuff out innovation. Consider Snap (SNAP), which raised $3.4 billion in March in the biggest IPO in three years. Already hopes have faded that it might erode Facebook's position. Analysts say Facebook has simply copied Snapchat's popular features and left it in the dust. With Snap shares lagging below its IPO price, funding may be harder to come by for the next David to challenge a Goliath.Luigi Zingales, finance professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, is calling for a more-proactive antitrust approach that would have kept Facebook from buying up Instagram and WhatsApp. He says the antitrust action against Microsoft (MSFT) in the 1990s and early 2000s helped create a climate in which Facebook and Google could rise to the top. But he worries that the current crop of leaders are growing too powerful to cut into their advantage. ""A system where this does not change is a system that is fossilized and hurts everyone,"" he said.Current antitrust policy focuses on preventing companies from consolidating power to raise prices, harming consumers. But Lina Khan, until recently a fellow at the New America Foundation's Open Markets program, argues that a new approach is needed to address companies like Amazon that operate online platforms.""The economics of platform markets create incentives for a company to pursue growth over profits, a strategy that investors have rewarded,"" Khan wrote in the Yale Law Review. ""Under these conditions, predatory pricing becomes highly rational — even as existing doctrine treats it as irrational and therefore implausible.""Khan may have a point: While shares of Amazon are off their recent all-time highs, they are still up 33% so far this year, even as earnings are expected to sink more than 20% in 2017.Amazon Prime may have started as a loss leader to gain customer loyalty, but Amazon has made the service so broad and attractive — offering free shipping, Amazon Prime Video, various special offers and now discounts at Whole Foods — that it is creating a world in which people make purchases only via the internet giant.Already about half of U.S. households are Amazon Prime members. And 55% of all online shopping searches started on Amazon last year vs. 30% in 2012. In recent months, Nike (NKE) and Sears (SHLD) threw in the towel and agreed to begin selling their athletic shoes and Kenmore appliances on Amazon.As for Google and Facebook, proving a price monopoly is a nonstarter since their services are free to consumers.But if not by pricing control, how should a monopoly be defined?Under the Democrats' ""Better Deal"" outline, regulators would use criteria to judge whether a merger would ""reduce wages, cut jobs, lower product quality, limit access to services, stifle innovation, or hinder the ability of small businesses and entrepreneurs to compete.""Those guidelines hearken back to ""the bad old days of antitrust, when it was used to protect inefficient small businesses and to pursue confused social goals,"" wrote Elizabeth Popp Berman, associate professor of sociology at the University at Albany in New York. ""While no one thinks that low prices for consumers are the only thing worth pursuing in life, they are the appropriate goal for antitrust because they make it coherent and administrable.""That consensus is entrenched in the antitrust enforcement agencies, codified into law through court decisions and resistant to change.Still, the EU's fine of Google for abusing its dominant position in internet search could hint at future U.S. policy.In prioritizing its own comparison-shopping site in search results, the European Commission said Google ""denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate.""Online platforms, Khan noted, ""control the essential infrastructure on which their rivals depend.""In a reflection of the increasingly fragile embrace of Democrats and Big Tech, the Google-funded, left-of-center New America think tank last month cut loose the Open Markets group after it praised the European Union's fine vs. Google.While Google disputes the EU's charge, noting Amazon's lead position in shopping searches, it agreed to make changes by Sept. 28. The EU also is scrutinizing Google's bundling of its Google Play app store with its free Android app.Luther Lowe, vice president of policy at Yelp (YELP), a crowdsourced review site, called the Google fine ""the most significant enforcement event in consumer tech antitrust in nearly 20 years,"" alluding to the Microsoft case.Yet the Microsoft antitrust fight was expensive and dragged on for years, underscoring the limitations of traditional antitrust actions in a complex and fast-moving industry.Tech journalist Walt Mossberg and economist Hal Singer have promoted addressing monopolistic and discriminatory competitive practices through a ""special, permanent, nonpartisan, independent commission — or even a special, narrowly focused court — to adjudicate disputes about internet issues."" The issues could run from network neutrality violations to heavy-handed behavior by Google or Amazon.Singer notes that such a tribunal already exists to handle complaints that cable companies are giving preference to their own programming.While Google is in the EU's line of fire now, Amazon is starting to come under the microscope.Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and co-author of the report, ""Amazon's Stranglehold,"" argued at a recent Forbes forum that Amazon's anticompetitive effect stems from its inherent conflict as both a direct seller and the operator of a platform that it invites other sellers to use.Khan cites Amazon's big discounts from Federal Express (FDX) and UPS (UPS) as a high-volume customer. Amazon passes along those discounts to independent companies that use its fulfillment services.Extending its empire to 460 Whole Foods stores substantially increases Amazon's logistics footprint, facilitating in-store pickup by customers and lowering the cost of last-mile delivery. Amazon already has been taking steps to increase its own delivery capability, in part with its Uber-like delivery force of flextime workers paid $19 to $24 per hour.While customers cheer the convenience and low cost, critics argue that companies may have no choice but to use Amazon's fulfillment services if they want to get competitive shipping rates and favorable listings.""What Amazon has done is turn an open market into a privately controlled arena where it sets the terms by which other players may buy and sell,"" Mitchell said at a Forbes forum. ""That's why its platform has to be broken off from its direct retail and made to comply with common carrier rules.""Yet the idea comes across as so radical, showing how poorly antitrust law is suited to dealing with today's tech titans.""You want Amazon to look like the local power company?"" countered Geoffrey Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law and Economics.

202,FDX,"A new report from RBC Capital Markets asks the ever more pressing question about Amazon.com (AMZN) and its deliveries ambitions: Does the transportation sector have a problem?The short answer is no -- at least not yet, according to RBC analyst John Barnes.The crux of the issue for the e-commerce leader is that its shipping costs soared 32% to $11.5 billion in 2015, while sales rose about 20%. That, says Barnes, suggests that Amazon might have trouble ahead if it continues on course. As a result, Amazon has been taking more of the shipping task into its own hands.RBC emphasizes, though, that Amazon isn't anywhere near able to separate itself from shipping partners such as UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX). But the company will incrementally begin to do so, the report says, at least in certain areas.In prior years -- though not in 2015 -- both UPS and FedEx have stumbled during the critical holiday season. Packages not being delivered on time, Barnes says, is like Amazon being closed on random days without warning.Amazon's massive distribution network is as complex as it is large. It includes a growing trucking operation and the recently disclosed air transport and ocean shipping components.Ocean shipping is where Barnes suspects the company will attack first. ""We believe Amazon will take over large swaths of its ocean freight supply chain, as the move can lower its own shipping costs, drive third-party sellers to the platform and eventually turn into a profit center,"" Barnes wrote in the report, released late Monday.As IBD has reported, industry experts estimate that the ocean shipping business has the potential to be worth millions in free cash flow for Amazon, mostly from selling capacity to third parties. Analysts says that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos might not go after the free cash flow but instead drive the value back to consumers in some fashion, such as still-lower prices. But the ocean shipping industry is vast, and Barnes estimates that the Seattle-based company would grab only between $200 million and $400 million in business. It could, though, affect shippers such as Expeditors International of Washington (EXPD) as well as UPS and FedEx.The ocean shipping grab isn't without precedent, either. Wal-Mart (WMT) has been taking possession of suppliers' goods in China and doing its own shipping for years.Amazon's growing air network is one area where the company will be content to work with third parties, Barnes said. Amazon's recently announced deal with Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) to lease 20 767 jets highlights this point. As part of the deal, Amazon will be able to purchase about 20% of ATSG's common shares over a five-year period.Meanwhile, Barnes says that UPS and FedEx are both fighting Amazon's long-term onslaught. UPS now provides 30% of Amazon's parcel needs, netting $2.2 billion in revenue, and FedEx hauls in $1.5 billion, or about 20%. Those figures translate to about 8% and 10% of ground revenue, respectively, for the shipping companies.

The delivery company, along with peers such as UPS (UPS) and DHL, might feel a little pain from Amazon’s decision to operate its own fleet of jet freighters to deliver its packages.On Wednesday, Amazon confirmed a deal to lease 20 Boeing (BA) 767 jets from Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) as a way of grabbing more control over distribution and logistics amid rapid growth in its Prime service, which promises speedy delivery.FedEx shares closed down 0.1% on the stock market today. Amazon fell 0.1%, Boeing rose 0.1%, and Air Transport added 4.8%.Coca-Cola’s price target was raised to 55 from 47 by RBC Capital Markets, which maintained its outperform rating on the stock.In a Thursday morning note, RBC analyst Nik Modi said “we are at the precipice of Coca-Cola inflecting to a period of sustained outperformance, particularly among its consumer staples mega cap peers under our coverage.”Those peers include Proctor & Gamble (PG), Clorox (CL), Kimberly-Clark (KMB), PepsiCo (PEP), Altria Group (MO) and Reynolds American (RAI).Coca-Cola’s stock price touched a new stock high of 44.83 on Wednesday and moved 0.9% higher Thursday.

204,FDX,"Amazon (AMZN) doubled down on its quest for fast and reliable service -- and perhaps more -- by confirming Wednesday a deal to lease 20 Boeing (BA) 767 jets from Air Transport Services Group (ATSG).The e-commerce giant has sought more control over distribution and logistics amid rapid growth in its Prime service, which promises speedy delivery and which saw membership jump more than 50% last year.""Moving inventory from Kansas to Oklahoma -- that's probably easy to do by truck,"" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""Portland, Maine, to Portland, Ore., is harder. This is the first or second step in a very bold strategy.""Reports have been surfacing of Amazon's growing interest in building its own air cargo operation, and a 2013 document prepared for senior management, recently leaked to Bloomberg, envisioned grander ambitions.It called for the creation of a new business that eventually would allow merchants to bypass FedEx (FDX), UPS (UPS) and DHL and book cargo space directly through Amazon, which would be at the center of a global logistics operation competing against the shippers.Shares of Amazon closed down 0.1% on the stock market Wednesday. Air Transport Services Group jumped 16.7%. FedEx dipped 0.4%, and UPS slid 1%.For now, Amazon says its latest move is meant for the Prime service.""These planes provide critical capacity expansion to support the growth of Prime in the U.S.,"" Amazon representative Kelly Cheeseman told IBD via email. ""At our scale, supporting growth requires adding some of our own logistics capabilities.""The duration of the 20 leases on the Boeing planes will be five to seven years, while the contract governing the operation of the aircraft will be for five years. ATSG will fly the aircraft and will hold responsibility for gate and logistics services.The air cargo company also granted Amazon warrants to acquire up to 19.9% of ATSG's common stock over a five-year period.Amazon's push to take more control over delivery follows troubles with shippers in 2013, when FedEx and UPS struggled and sometimes failed to get packages delivered before Christmas, citing overloaded systems, poor weather and a shortened holiday shopping season.Amazon is now reducing its dependence on them. It has plans to roll out thousands of branded trucks in an effort to shuttle inventory between its facilities.The company also has a deal with the U.S. Postal Service to deliver packages on Sundays, and it is developing drones to make deliveries within an hour.They would help serve a sprawling web of merchants, warehouses and customers.Amazon has working relationships with more than 3 million businesses, including third-party sellers, advertisers and cloud computing services.Currently, Amazon has 167 distribution facilities worldwide, including 92 facilities in North America. But they're typically not located a short trek down the road from each other.""If there were any doubt before whether Amazon would compete with those (shippers), I think they’ve answered those questions today,"" said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co.

206,FDX,"Tech giant Microsoft (MSFT) and chipmaker Inphi (IPHI) plan to leave Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) in their drone dust come Q3 ... digitally speaking.Early Tuesday, the companies introduced a 100-gigabit platform capable of digitally tying multiple data centers within 80 kilometers (about 50 miles). Previously, that breakneck 100G speed was possible only in cross-country networks.Linking data centers to amass cloud size -- and speed -- will become more necessary as cloud users like Facebook (FB), Alibaba (BABA), Yahoo (YHOO) and others expand their online footprint, says Jeff Cox, Microsoft senior director of network architecture.Microsoft realized as much in 2012, but the industry's ""long-haul solution"" for cross-country information transit was too hefty for use in metropolitan areas, Cox says. It would be the travel equivalent of launching a Boeing 777 to go from John Wayne Airport near Anaheim, Calif., to Los Angeles International Airport 20 miles away.""You'd take a cab, not a 777,"" he told IBD. ""For those distances across town, we want these large quantities, but that's the wrong approach.""In 2013, Microsoft and Inphi teamed up to solve the problem. Inphi moves data in the same way FedEx (FDX) transports packages -- by trains, planes and trucks, Inphi CEO Ford Tamer told IBD. The Microsoft-Inphi solution is a 100G ""drone.""Inphi also has a 100G long-haul solution under its Coherent platform. But the Coherent platform is more power-consumptive, expensive and requires space to allow excess heat to dissipate, Cox says. He estimates the Coherent platform uses 20 times more power than the new Inphi-Microsoft platform.""Using the Coherent technology would blow your entire power budget,"" he said. ""It's fairly impractical at this scale.""Enter Colorz.Microsoft and Inphi's partnership will be borne out in the Colorz platform -- faster than the industry's current 10G drones and less costly than 100G long-hauls, Tamer says. The 100G drones are capable of moving the digital equivalent of the Library of Congress multiple times in one second.""We do not believe there is any other solution that can achieve what we've done in the power and cost envelope,"" Tamer said. ""For that type of power and that type of performance and that distance, we do believe it's an industry first.""Three years ago, Microsoft met brick walls as it sought to reach 100G inside city limits, Cox said. He referenced tech lore when, in 1981, company co-founder Bill Gates asked who would need more than 640 kilobytes, in defense of IBM's (IBM) newest PC, based on an Intel (INTC) processor.""Almost kind of like 10 years ago, when people asked, 'Who needs more than 640KB of RAM (computer memory, where 4GB is now standard)?' "" Cox said. ""Then it was, 'Who needs more than 100G in a metro?' I think it was hard for people to wrap their heads around it.""Since then, he says, bandwidth needs have multiplied. Cloud providers are leasing or buying data center spaces across the world as their needs outgrow those of traditional consumers like IT and Internet providers.Data center is the industry's new buzzword, and chipmakers especially are making a hard run for a piece of this market. Over the past year, Intel, Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Nvidia (NVDA) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) have redoubled their data center efforts in a bid to gain share.""I think now when we talk about Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook, everyone is building these infrastructures,"" Cox said. ""And the scale of these infrastructures is surprising everyone in the industry.""He added: ""There isn't so much disbelief any longer. I think we've proven we weren't kidding. In fact, I think we underestimated a little.""

The package delivery services are locked in a duel as Americans increasingly make their purchases at Amazon.com (AMZN) and other online retailers.XFedEx will, however, slap a fee for packages that are oversized or unauthorized, or require additional handling, the shipping giant said. It noted in a statement that the volume of oversized packages during the holidays has increased by approximately 240% over the past 10 years, and larger, heavier packages now account for 10% of all ground volumes.""To support our millions of loyal small business customers and consumers shipping holiday gifts at FedEx Office and FedEx Onsite locations, FedEx will not apply holiday season surcharges except for packages that are oversized, unauthorized or require additional handling,"" Patrick Fitzgerald, a senior vice president, said. The extra levies, in effect from Nov. 20 to Dec. 24, amount to $3 per package for additional handling, $25 per package for oversized packages, and $300 per package for unauthorized shipments.UPS said in June that it will charge retailers an extra fee for deliveries around Black Friday and Christmas. That surcharge is expected to offset additional costs as the delivery services shell out more for extra planes, trucks and employees during peak holiday season.Both FedEx and UPS have been investing heavily to handle more e-commerce shipments.While rising volumes and the need for ever-faster deliveries are straining the shipping services, especially around the holidays, a longer-term challenge looms in the form of one of their biggest customers, Amazon.

Rival UPS (UPS), which reports on July 27, finished down 1.1% at 109.61 but rose 1.3% late.FedEx's Q4 report follows a Monday announcement from UPS that it will charge retailers an extra fee for deliveries around Black Friday and Christmas.This surcharge will offset added costs as the delivery services shell out more for extra planes, trucks and employees during peak holiday season. But those additional efforts are needed as rising volumes and need for ever-faster deliveries strain the shipping giants, especially around the holidays.Longer term, FedEx could be challenged as Amazon.com (AMZN) expands its own delivery operations. The e-commerce giant has recently expanded its air-freight fleet via Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW).RELATED:Are Drone Deliveries And Robotic Gofers Ready To Serve You?

245,FDX,"Amazon.com (AMZN) shipping got more expensive Monday, as the company announced it was raising its free shipping minimum 40% to $49.The move, of course, only pertains to non-subscribers of its Amazon Prime loyalty program, since those subscribers get free shipping on any order. Orders that include at least $25 of books remain free-shipping eligible.Amazon's latest move is likely intended to drive more Prime subscription growth and also cut down on shipping costs.Amazon stock rose 4.6% to 559.50 on the stock market today, moving back above its 200-day moving average for the first time since plunging below that mark on Feb. 3.Rival Wal-Mart (WMT) has a $50 threshold for free shipping. E-tail startup Jet.com uses $35 as its minimum, while Target (TGT) has a $25 minimum. Wal-Mart stock rose 1.5% on Monday while Target edged up 0.2%.Amazon's shipping costs have been ballooning as the company offers increasing rapid delivery times -- including one-hour delivery in certain markets via Amazon Prime Now. Those costs rose 37% year-over-year in Q4, to $4.7 billion.Rumors continue to swirl about the firm's long-term plans for its shipping program, as investors and analysts speculate that Amazon is interested in competing with established delivery companies such as UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX).Internal documents seen by Bloomberg seemingly support that theory. And, there have been reports of Amazon getting into the ocean freight business -- which one observers said could generate upward of $100 million in free cash flow -- as well as leasing cargo jets and making a large purchase of trucks to haul packages between its fulfillment centers. The documents seen by Bloomberg suggest Amazon is gearing up to compete more with China e-com leader Alibaba (BABA).Besides delivery costs, Amazon has spent billions of dollars on its fulfillment and sortation centers, the last step in the delivery process.Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer says Amazon.com captured 51% of all retail growth in Q4 2015.Amazon's Prime loyalty program offers free two-day shipping, as well as free streaming audio and video, among other perks.Analysts in general peg Amazon's Prime customer count near 40 million, with some estimates coming in as high as 50 million. Prime members, on average, spend about twice as much on Amazon.com than regular shoppers.Prime members accounted for 57% of Amazon's North American sales in Q4, and Prime members spend about 12% more every year, according to ITG Investment Research analyst Steve Weinstein.Nemer has told IBD that Prime is the biggest reason for Amazon's growth, which during the past two quarters has exceeded 20%.

247,FDX,"A shift toward spending at online players like Amazon (AMZN) and store e-commerce sites took its toll on retail hiring during the holiday shopping season.
"
248,FDX,"That's the finding from global outplacement consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which said in a report issued Tuesday that after a strong start in October, holiday hiring among retailers slowed in November and December. Overall, seasonal employment gains slipped 1.2% from 2014, making it the second straight year in which holiday hires fell, the report said.
"
249,FDX,"Retail employment rose by 745,800 workers in the last three months of 2015, according to an analysis of non-seasonally adjusted government employment data by Challenger. The holiday hiring total for the last three months of 2015 was down from the 755,000 workers added in 2014. That was 4% lower than 2013, when nearly 787,000 seasonal workers were added to retail payrolls, the report said.
"
250,FDX,"The consultant's chief executive, John Challenger, noted several factors may have contributed to slower holiday hiring.
"
251,FDX,"""Just as in many other industries, technology is making it possible for retailers to meet higher demand with fewer workers,"" he noted. ""The other factor may be the shift in Christmas shopping from brick-and-mortar to click-and-order.""
"
252,FDX,"The continued growth in online purchases means that retailers need ""fewer bodies on the sales floor,"" Challenger added. It also means that warehouses, fulfillment centers and shipping companies such as FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS) require more workers to help manage the online order surge, he added.
"
253,FDX,"Retailers got holiday promotions off to an early start last year. They also ""appeared"" to move their hiring timing up a bit, Challenger noted.
"
254,FDX,"While the bulk of the employment gains are still recorded in November, job gains in October are on the rise, the report said. Over the last two holiday seasons, retail employment increased by an average of 190,400 in October, according to the report. From 2010 through 2013, retailers added an average of 145,600 in October.
"
255,FDX,"Even with downward adjustments in hiring figures by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the employment gains recorded among retailers in October 2015 were still the highest on record for that month, in data going back to 1939, the report noted.

Incyte (INCY), Biomarin (BMRN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) all gained more than 6%.Also at the top of the Nasdaq, CA surged 13% on news reports that the company was discussing being taken private in a deal with BMC Software. The news was unconfirmed, with Bloomberg quoting unnamed sources who said talks were in early stages.  The gain left shares at a new high, clearing the left side high of a 10-month consolidation.Oil-related stocks turned in 13 of the S&P 500's 20 worst performances of the day.  Oil prices sloughed off 2%, putting West Texas intermediate crude down 5% since Friday as oil hammers away at a fifth straight weekly decline.Caterpillar (CAT) took the worst loss among Dow industrials, down 3% in weak trade.  Nike (NKE) rose 1.8% to take the Dow's top slot, boosted by news that it planned to sell some products directly to Amazon.com (AMZN). For its part, Amazon rose 0.7% in weak trade as investors continued to monitor its rebound from support at its 10-week moving average.The Nike-Amazon news appeared to pressure Foot Locker (FL), which shed 5% in heavy trade, although it did pare back from an initial 11% dive.Earnings reports also played a strong role in Wednesday's action.

The Nasdaq jumped 0.3%,with CA (CA), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Broadcom (AVGO) leading the Nasdaq 100.Intel (INTC) staked out the weak spot among Dow stocks, down 1.6% after Bank of America downgraded the stock to neutral, from buy. Nike (NKE) jumped 1.1%, the best early move among Dow industrials,Intel may also have felt some pressure from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which surged 8% after introducing a new line of high-power, low-cost processors aimed squarely at Intel's markets. The gain hoisted AMD shares 38% above an early May low, and well up the right side of a three-month cup base.FedEx (FDX) dipped 1% after reporting its fiscal fourth-quarter results late Tuesday.Red Hat (RHT) spiked 9% as Stifel Nicolaus upgraded the stock to buy, from hold, following strong first-quarter results reported late Tuesday. A 12% earnings gain and a 19% rise in revenue neatly cleared analysts' targets, and management's second-quarter revenue and earnings forecasts were also above expectations. The move sent the open-source software innovator to new highs in heavy trade, after clearing a long, sloppy consolidation in February.CA, the former Computer Associates, spiked 15% on news reports that privately held BMC Software was exploring financing options to acquire the provider of information technology management software. CA has market capitalization of roughly $13 billion. The gap up move sent shares above a 35.09 buy point in a six-month cup base.Adobe Systems jumped 3% in early trade, after reporting better-than-expected 44% gains in earnings and a 27% rise in revenue. The company also guided third-quarter sales and earnings to above consensus views. Adobe shares spiked to a new high, leaving them extended above a rebound from support at the stock's 10-week moving average.Winnebago (WGO) rolled up a 4% gain at the open, as a 75% surge in revenue and a 134% leap in gross profit apparently outweighed a miss on its earnings per share line for its fiscal third quarter. The strong-volume gain was enough to pierce resistance at the stock's 10-week line, starting it up the right side of a six-month correction.CarMax (KMX) vaulted 5% higher on better-than-forecast first-quarter results.

263,FDX,"Unsure how potential legislative initiatives would play out in the nation's capital, jittery investors largely stood pat in June as the market barely moved. The S&P 500 edged up a modest 0.62% last month. That left the benchmark up 3.09% for the second quarter and 9.34% year to date.Reflecting those trends, U.S. diversified stock mutual funds rose a so-so 1.21% in June, leaving them with a 2.66% advance for Q2 and a 7.68% gain year to date, according to Lipper Inc. Foreign stock funds also ran out of steam in June, rising 0.48%. But they clobbered U.S. stock funds in Q2 and year to date with gains of 6.06% and 15.33%. World equity funds were led higher by China-region funds, which jumped 3.06 in June to be up 8.83% in Q2 and 21.85% year to date.""There was a massive rally in the FANG stocks,"" said Randy Gwirtzman, co-manager of $178.9 million Baron Discovery Fund (BDFIX), which was the best-performing small-cap growth mutual fund in Q2, year-to-date and the trailing 12 months, according to Morningstar Inc. He was referring to large-cap technology leaders Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL), still widely known by its former Google name.That rally ran out of steam in early June. Gwirtzman, whose focus is on smaller stocks, thinks the decline in FANG and big-cap tech stocks since early June ""is probably based more in psychology than fundamentals. These stocks had run up very dramatically in the first half of the year, and coming into earnings season it is natural for the market to be nervous due to the uncertainty of results,"" he said. The pullback was relatively small, he added.IBD'S TAKE: To keep up with news about the large-cap internet consumer names, follow IBD's FANG stock news page.Despite the big-cap tech retreat, sector funds were led in Q2 by global science/technology funds' 8.28% gain, which put them up 22.15% for the year. And U.S. diversified stock mutual funds were led by large-cap growth funds' 5.45% rise, for a 15.36% year-to-date gain.Bond mutual funds were also mostly higher in June and Q2. Taxables overall edged up 1.40% in Q2, led higher by flexible income funds' 2.72% advance. Luring yield-starved investors, tax-exempt bond funds climbed 1.63% in Q2.Stock funds' flat performance in June, Gwirtzman said, stemmed from many investors' focus on events in the near term that threatened policy initiatives that could buoy markets: infrastructure spending, health care reform and tax reform. Those include investigations by the Justice Department and several House and Senate committees into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia and of any Russian meddling in the 2016 elections.""When they looked at parts of the market (not related to FANGs),"" he said, ""investors were nervous about what's going on in Washington, the political drama, seeing how the investigations shake out, how the health care and tax reform processes turn out.""But Gwirtzman is bullish. On June 29, Q1 GDP growth was revised upward to a 1.4% annual rate. It was the slowest quarter since Q2 of 2016, but above analysts' expectations. ""And inflation is in hiding,"" he said. ""We don't see it in wage data. We don't see it in energy prices."" And the Federal Reserve is not expected to lift rates dramatically ""because the economy is not overheating,"" Gwirtzman said.Tailwinds for the market and the economy include the prospects for reductions in the regulatory environment, which could help several industries, as well as the potential for health care and tax reform, Gwirtzman said. ""There's an increase in optimism from business owners, and we're seeing an increase in investment in research and development,"" he said.Northern Trust chief investment strategist Jim McDonald says his complex — which runs 40 mutual funds, 25 FlexShare ETFs, and accounts for institutional clients and wealthy individuals — expects to find more opportunities abroad. In recommendations for institutional clients and wealthy individuals, Northern Trust has raised its weighting in international stocks to 52% from 40% at the start of the year and trimmed U.S. stocks to 48%, down from 60%, due to shifting valuations, economic momentum and political stability issues. Northern has executed that weighting shift in its $84 million Global Tactical Asset Allocation Fund (BBALX).In his small-cap space, Baron Discovery's Gwirtzman sees promising innovations mainly in health care and technology, as well as some in consumer discretionary and industrials.In health care, he likes the outlook for Foundation Medicine (FMI), which is compiling a database that notes the effectiveness of various drugs in treating diseases caused by various genetic mutations. Doctors and drug companies can access the database.Also, the company is developing a solid-tumor-based next-generation DNA sequencing test. Gwirtzman expects the Food and Drug Administration to approve the test later this year. He also expects the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services to greenlight the test for reimbursement. That would double to 67% the portion of Foundation's revenue that is eligible for reimbursement, Gwirtzman said.Like many biotech companies, Foundation is losing money. It's posted an annual loss for six straight years and is expected to make it seven in a row this year. But sales are rising and reached $117 million in 2016.The $9.8 billion Vanguard Primecap Core (VPCCX) — an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2017 Award winner, for having outperformed the S&P 500 as of Dec. 31 in the previous 12 months, three years, five years and 10 years — added Bioverativ (BIVV) in its latest disclosure. The company develops therapies for the treatment of hemophilia and other blood disorders. Shares of the Biogen spinoff climbed 34% through June 30 from February when they began trading. The stock is a newcomer to IBD's Leaderboard listing of top-performing stocks, and shares were still at the top of a buy range as of July 5.In tech, Gwirtzman likes analog semiconductor chipmaker Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI). ""This company among others is able to miniaturize laser technology to a small enough size and low enough cost to move data inside a data center, server to server, by photons instead of electrons,"" Gwirtzman said. ""For Google, for example, that means faster Web page delivery, faster number-crunching and overall some innovative new products.""Cybersecurity is another area he likes. ""Somebody breaking into your computer network can bring your business to its knees,"" he said.Varonis Systems' (VRNS) software scans clients' files for changes. Gwirtzman said, ""Once somebody is through your firewall, it's critical to see changes quickly. Varonis does that, isolates computers that are infected and helps you figure out how to fix the problem.""Varonis ranks No. 2 in IBD's Computer Software-Database industry group. In addition to six straight quarters of increasing mutual fund ownership, check out the stock's other easy-to-understand fundamental and technical strengths at IBD's Stock Checkup.Chinese social media platform YY (YY) is a top new buy of $1.8 billion Boston Partners All Cap Value (BPAIX), another IBD Best Mutual Funds 2017 Awards winner.The company's music and game revenues are still growing. The stock's earnings per share grew 30% and 97% the past two quarters. It has a highest-possible IBD SmartSelect Composite Rating of 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or better.Staley Cates, a manager of $217 million Longleaf Partners Global (LLGLX), likes Melco International, a Hong Kong-based company that provides gaming equipment and has stakes in the development, ownership and operation of casino gaming and entertainment casino resort facilities in Asia.Cates also likes CK Hutchison, another Hong Kong-based company. Most of its assets are in Europe, Cates says. It holds diverse infrastructure assets such as shipping ports, and is a global mobile telecommunications operator.Through month's end, the fund's 19.48% year-to-date gain topped 92% of its world stock peers. It was the No. 1 performer among world large-cap stock mutual funds over the trailing 12 months.FedEx (FDX) is a U.S. stock the fund holds. Cates says he is not afraid that Amazon (AMZN) will put FedEx out of business. ""Will Amazon bankrupt FedEx? That's insane,"" he said.FedEx's assets and systems for completing the proverbial last mile of each delivery are its competitive moat against competitive threats. And he likes its acquisition of Dutch-based TNT Express. ""As a three-to-five year investor, (to me) this is a home run,"" Cates said. Last month, TNT operations were disrupted by a computer virus attack.RELATED:Foreign Stocks Look Attractive To Mutual Fund Managers

321,FDX,"UPS (UPS) CEO David Abney on Tuesday said potential plans by Amazon (AMZN)  to expand its own shipping capabilities were unlikely to significantly affect the global package-deliverer's pricing, an announcement that comes as the e-commerce giant grapples with higher shipping costs to meet demand for faster service.Abney's remarks came in response to an analyst question on UPS' Q4 earnings call about what effect Amazon's reported plans to lease Boeing (BA) cargo planes would have on competitive pricing in the U.S. and European express market.""I didn’t read anything in the last quarter that we felt like is, on any kind of substantial basis, is going to affect our pricing in the market,"" Abney said.Amazon, UPS' biggest customer, has been trying to rein in shipping expenses and reduce its dependence on UPS, whose own delivery costs have risen over the years due to e-commerce growth and attempts to modernize its delivery system.The two companies have reportedly been at increasing odds with each other after 11th-hour Amazon holiday orders inundated UPS' delivery infrastructure, resulting in botched Christmas-season deliveries in 2013. UPS in 2014 placed volume caps on some retailers in 2014.While questions persist about the package deliverer's ability to handle surges in package volume, the company has expanded customers' abilities to track and reroute deliveries and choose where to pick them up. UPS' acquisition of Coyote Logistics also helped it manage transportation services and costs during the peak season.Shares of Amazon dropped after its Q4 earnings per share last week grew dramatically but missed analyst forecasts. Shipping costs rose during the quarter due as its Prime Now program, offering free two-day shipping, becomes more popular. Along with leasing jets, Amazon has taken a stake in at least one European delivery company and has begun using its own delivery trucks. And it wants, eventually, to deliver packages via drones.Still, Abney appeared to try to tamp down speculation of any tension between the companies.""Amazon's a good customer of ours, we have a mutually beneficial relationship,"" he said during the call. ""Our goal with Amazon or any other big customer is to continue to show our value though the integrated network and through our technologies and to have a value proposition that’s difficult to match. We do add capacity for large customers such as Amazon. We do it, though, when we’re sure we have the proper economic return.”And earlier in the call, he emphasized collaboration with customers and adjustments to its network to better handle holiday volume.“This year, our customers worked more closely with us than ever,"" Abney said. ""And I want to thank them for making adjustments and being flexible.”Besides, the company's fourth-quarter results were strong. EPS jumped 26% to $1.57, soundly beating estimates for $1.42. Sales edged up to $16.1 billion, slightly missing forecasts.And the company guided 2016 diluted EPS of $5.70 to $5.90, well above an outlook for $5.73. UPS also guided revenue growth of 6% to 8%, above analysts expectations for 5% growth.UPS, which some see as a bellwether for the economy, also said the outlook for the global economy remained uncertain.Abney said the U.S.' gross domestic product outlook was muted in 2016 but was expected to gain strength in the second half of the year. The company also said it expected ""slight improvements"" in Europe and Asia's GDP, but that emerging markets would still be shaky.“Although the industrial side of the economy has slowed,"" Abney said near the beginning of the call. ""The explosive growth of e-commerce continues to create great opportunity.”UPS shares rose 0.6% to 94.67  in the stock market today. Shares of rival parcel delivery service Federal Express (FDX) fell 1.6% to 130.15.

323,FDX,"Amazon.com (AMZN) shares plunged in early trading Friday, after the e-commerce leader late Thursday fell well short of earnings estimates and also came up light on revenue.Earnings per share shot up 122% vs. a year earlier to $1 a share, excluding various items. But that didn't come close to views for $1.56 among analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Sales rose 22% to $35.7 billion, ending two quarters of accelerating growth and slightly missing forecasts for $35.98 billion. Revenue would have risen 26%, excluding foreign-exchange swings.Amazon.com stock was down 9.5% after the opening bell in the stock market today, near 575.Shares had closed up 8.9% to 635.54 in the regular session. The stock more than doubled in 2015, though like much of the rest of the market, it has struggled in January. As usual -- CEO Jeff Bezos has said that he will always put the customer before profits -- Amazon is spending heavily on its business, logging a 20.5% increase in operating costs to $34.6 billion.Bezos said in the earnings statement that 2015 was the first year the firm passed $100 billion sales and 300 million customers.Memberships in Prime, Amazon’s customer loyalty program which offers free two-day shipping and free video streaming among other services, grew 51%. Prime is one of the key drivers of the company’s core e-tail business.Prime has more than 50 million members in the U.S alone, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.Compared with Amazon's fast-growing sales, eBay (EBAY), the largest U.S.e-commerce rival, posted lackluster sales growth during the holiday shopping season. EBay also offered lower-than-expected guidance for 2016. Shares plunged 12.5% on Thursday, though Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer says that the sell-off was too hasty.In Q4 2015 Amazon said that Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing division, hauled in $2.4 billion in revenue, up 69% over the year-earlier quarter. In the earnings statement, the company said AWS is now available across 12 geographic regions around the world and that it launched 722 significant new services in 2015.Several analysts have upped their price targets in recent weeks because of AWS's strong performance and potential for growth. Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju believes that the company’s capital expenditures in cloud computing are going to begin to decrease in the near future.It’s worth noting that the firm faces vigorous competition from Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), which recently hired former VMWare (VMW) CEO Diane Greene to lead the consolidated team.Microsoft shares rose in after-hours action after the software giant reported better-than-expected results, led by its Azure cloud unit. Alphabet, which reports Monday, fell 1% late.Though many analysts are bullish because of AWS, others have begun to speculate that the company is going to get into the shipping business and compete with the likes of FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS). Amazon has announced the purchase of a fleet of trucks to ferry goods between fulfillment centers. It's also rumored to be running a cargo-flight operation out of Ohio, leasing 767 jets, and it's even getting into the ocean-shipping business.The thinking, according to several analysts, is similar to how Amazon got involved in cloud computing: As a result of the firm's own needs -- holiday web traffic surges require enormous data centers -- it eventually realized that it could sell excess capacity at a substantial profit. It's possible in the future that people may be able to ""ship with Amazon.""""I would say that what we’ve found, that to properly service our customers at peak, we need to supplement our partners' services,"" CFO Brian Olsavsky said on the call. ""It’s not meant to replace them. Carriers are no longer able to handle it at peak. We’ve had to add some resources on our own.""Amazon sees Q1 sales of $26.5 billion to $29 billion, or growth of 17% to 28%. The company does not offer EPS guidance but expects operating income of $100 million to $700 million, compared with $255 million a year earlier.Wall Street has forecast Amazon will earn 77 cents a share non-GAAP on revenue of $27.7 billion.

351,FDX,"Flying drones drop Chipotle (CMG) burritos, 7-Eleven Slurpees and Amazon.com (AMZN) sundries on doorsteps while robots scoot down sidewalks to deliver Domino's (DPZ) pizzas and other meals to homes.These images might conjure thoughts that we've finally entered the age of mechanical gofers, or that we'll soon farm out a slew of summer jobs to robots. But hold on to your transformers for a bit.While companies such as Amazon are pushing the idea of delivery bots — the e-commerce giant now says it wants to start using them for commercial deliveries by the end of 2017 — widespread use of robotic couriers could be years away.Consumers in a few regions and limited test markets are the only ones seeing the benefits, and possible drawbacks, of machines that carry food, drinks and everyday goods to their door. And the tests are raising more questions than they're answering.For one, are these deliveries just publicity stunts designed to show consumer brands are on the cutting edge of technology? Or do they show a future where it might be practical for robots to routinely make home deliveries?""Is there a legitimate business model here? Is there a real need for this? Can I measure ROI (return on investment)? Those are the questions that need to be answered,"" ABI Research analyst Dan Kara told Investor's Business Daily.It's not clear right now that a robot can handle deliveries as fast or better than a human. Further, the long-term costs of developing and deploying bot couriers is unclear. Plus, companies have yet to figure out how to protect that mechanical merchandise.In other words, it could be some time before you'll see robot-delivered pizza on a grand scale. For now, delivery bots are very much an experiment, with companies and consumers in a dot-com-esque honeymoon phase. Some companies are dreaming big, and harsh reality has yet to set in.Amazon got the public excited about the idea of aerial delivery drones when it announced its Prime Air initiative in December 2013. It wasn't until this past March that it conducted its first drone delivery in the U.S., transporting a bottle of sunscreen to a resort in Palm Springs, Calif., during a tech conference.Still, Amazon is sticking to its vision, and hopes to deliver small packages of up to 5 pounds in 30 minutes or less by drones that can fly up to 50 miles per hour.Retail behemoth Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) has expressed interest in making drone deliveries as has Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). Google has a drone delivery initiative called Project Wing that is looking to develop automated aircraft to deliver everything from consumer goods to emergency medicine. Last September, Project Wing conducted a test on the Virginia Tech campus, delivering Chipotle burritos by air to students and employees.The movement has prompted delivery specialists, such as FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS), to evaluate their options. Self-driving trucks eventually are expected to deploy small robots to deliver packages to your door. But aerial drones are considered a better solution for greater distances, especially in rural and hard-to-reach places.Gartner analyst Gerald Van Hoy believes that commercial drone deliveries in the U.S. are a few years away, but within sight. Business-to-business drone deliveries might help pave the way for consumer deliveries, Van Hoy told IBD. It is easy to calculate the payback of sending a drone to deliver a tool to a worker in the field vs. sending a human driver, he said.By the same token, business uses of wheeled delivery robots could lead to consumer applications as the technology improves and the value proposition becomes clear, ABI's Kara said.Venture capital firms and corporations are funding robotic delivery initiatives on the chance that they could become a huge deal. But that might not happen, Kara said, noting that many millions of dollars were invested in corporate telepresence robots — sort of interoffice gofers — before that market fizzled.Analysts point out robotic delivery systems could help restaurants that struggle to find enough delivery workers. They also could be a hedge against rising employee costs, especially with the Fight For $15 political movement to raise the minimum wage.Ultimately, there will be questions on regulatory restrictions and finding the right business model. Tech companies and government regulators are working out how best to allow delivery robots in the public air space and on streets and walkways. The biggest questions are business-related, and whether delivery bots are economically feasible, Kara said.A raft of companies have developed robotics, including Google, Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Roomba maker iRobot (IRBT). A few private companies, however, have come to the forefront when it comes to delivery bots.They include two startups, Marble and Starship Technologies, two private robotic firms. In April, Yelp's (YELP) Eat24 food delivery service partnered with Marble to test robotic deliveries with a handful of restaurants in a couple San Francisco neighborhoods.The Eat24-branded robots are the size of a shopping cart. They navigate city sidewalks with artificial intelligence, cameras, ultrasonic sensors and light detection, or lidar, sensors. Typical deliveries are within a mile. Customers are sent a four-digit code to open the four-wheeled robot's storage compartment.Rival delivery robot firm Starship started making food deliveries in Silicon Valley in March. Starship also has conducted trials in Austin, Texas; Portland, Ore.; and Washington, D.C., as well as a dozen European countries.Starship robots are roughly the size of large picnic coolers and have six wheels. In March, Starship announced a deal with Domino's to deliver pizzas by robot within a one-mile radius around its outlets in select German and Dutch cities.While sidewalk robots are seen as the best solution for short-distance deliveries in cities, some politicians don't like the idea.In May, San Francisco Supervisor Norman Yee introduced legislation that would ban autonomous delivery robots from city sidewalks, largely for safety concerns. Those concerns range from machines getting in the way of cars and pedestrians to lawbreakers stealing or vandalizing them.On the other side of the coin, humanitarian concerns are a consideration.Last September, UPS partnered with drone maker CyPhy Works to test the use of drones to make commercial deliveries of packages to remote locations. The companies staged a mock delivery of urgently needed medicine from Beverly, Mass., to Children's Island, about three miles off the Atlantic coast. In the mock scenario, the drone successfully carried an asthma inhaler to a child at a camp on the island.Zipline International is using fixed-wing drones to deliver medical products, such as blood products and rabies treatments, to remote locations. It currently is serving 21 hospitals in Rwanda. Its drones can deliver to any site within about 47 miles, or 93 miles round-trip. As of November, Zipline had raised $43 million in funding.""The humanitarian side of drone deliveries is starting to be talked about a lot more,"" Gretchen West, co-executive director of the Commercial Drone Alliance, told IBD. ""It's delivering medicine, aid and supplies after a catastrophe or to remote locations where roads could be washed out. We're starting to see a lot more of that, not just consumer delivery.""Already, several companies are making headway deploying robots to deliver items in structured environments like hospitals and hotels, he said. Pittsburgh-based Aethon makes delivery robots for hospitals to ferry food, medicine, towels and other items. San Jose, Calif.-based Savioke makes robots for delivering items to consumers in hotels and high-rise buildings.West says drone deliveries to consumers will happen, but will take longer for the puzzle pieces to come together. Right now, commercial drones in the U.S. face strict limitations.For instance, they can't fly over people, must be operated within visual line of sight, and can't fly at night. Many of these problems will be solved by an unmanned aircraft system traffic management system under development by NASA, she said.""It will take several years,"" West said. ""None of this moves very quickly.""

But the price cuts are light, unless the items are heavy.Wal-Mart aims to reduce shipping costs and pass those savings onto customers. The ""last mile"" of shipping goods to customers is very expensive for traditional retailers, while Amazon gets bigger discounts from UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) due to its massive shipping volumes.Wal-Mart is offering varying discounts on some 10,000 items to start, with plans to expand that to 1 million. (The discounts are not available in Alaska and Hawaii.)It's using technology developed by Jet.com, sold to Wal-Mart last year for $3.3 billion. Heavy but inexpensive items will get bigger price cuts.And that's what's clear from walmart.com.Discounts are slim for electronics.But if you're willing to load up heavy or bulky goods in and out of your car, there are bigger incentives.Wal-Mart shares rose 0.2% to 74.07 in the stock market today, hitting an eight-month high intraday.

Heavy but inexpensive items will get bigger price cuts.Online shipping costs, especially the ""last mile"" of delivery to customers, are incredibly expensive. Wal-Mart and other traditional retailers have encouraged in-store pickup, waiving shipping fees.

Amazon, with its massive size, gets huge discounts from UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) over even large brick-and-mortar retailers.Now Wal-Mart is giving shoppers a clear incentive to make in-store pickups, turning their brick-and-mortar locations into a virtue.Amazon isn't oblivious to the multichannel threat. It's opened a handful of physical bookstores. It's also testing a grocery store in Seattle that features automated checkout.Amazon reportedly mulled buying Whole Foods Stores (WFM) last year, Bloomberg reported.Wal-Mart shares rose 1 cent to 73.44 in the stock market today.

Amazon is still in range from an 860.96 four-weeks-tight buy point.Wal-Mart's holiday quarter U.S. online sales surged 29%, but the retailer has been even more aggressive in 2017.Earlier this year, Wal-Mart dropped its ShippingPass subscription alternative to Amazon Prime, announcing free two-day shipping for online orders of at $35 or more. Amazon, which had raised its non-Prime free-shipping threshold to $50, brought that back to $35, but with a longer delivery span.Walmart.com shoppers can now set a pickup time to have their groceries loaded into the cars, helping to explain why Amazon is testing its own grocery stores and considering a Whole Foods takeover.Wal-Mart also has continued to make online acquisitions, including niche retailers ModCloth, Moosejaw and Shoebuy. It's also opened an online innovation center.Wal-Mart's in-store pickup discounts could show a path for Target (TGT), Macy's (M) and other traditional retailers to make an omnichannel strategy work. But it's also a threat. Target and others seeking to turn physical locations into giant online lockers may find they have to pass on the shipping savings to customers.Target and many other retailers already are being squeezed by Wal-Mart's renewed push to lower prices generally.Wal-Mart has been a reliable dividend stock, having raised the payout every year since 1974. The company just raised the quarterly payment to 51 cents a share. The annualized dividend yield is nearly 3%.

The quarter began on Dec. 1, which means it includes much of FedEx's increasingly frantic holiday shopping season.Results: Adjusted EPS of $2.35, down 6%. Revenue rose 18% to $15 billion.Outlook: FedEx sees full-year EPS of $10.80-$11.30 excluding pension accounting adjustments.

Operating margin for its Ground segment slid to 11% from a year-earlier 12.6%.Analysts in recent months have zeroed in on FedEx's margins, particularly in its ground delivery segment, as more customers shop online at Amazon.com (AMZN) and others, and come to expect prompt — and more frequent — delivery.FedEx has poured money into automating its delivery infrastructure to hasten the flow of packages through delivery hubs to their destinations. Those efforts could dent margins short-term but cut costs and help profits further out.""We are confident our strategic investments to expand our global scope and portfolio of solutions position FedEx for greater long-term profitable growth as we adapt to meet the evolving needs of our customers,"" said FedEx CEO Fred Smith.However, Barclays said Monday that margins in FedEx's Ground segment ""are likely near a trough."" Cowen said margins ""likely bottomed"" in the second quarter of the company's fiscal year, but that the strain would likely continue.Cowen analyst Helane Becker also expressed concern about how well FedEx did over the holidays.""Several customers overpromised and underdelivered in the peak shipping season and this resulted in lower volumes at FedEx,"" she wrote in a research note dated Friday. ""We believe this will result in muted volume growth in the Ground segment.""FedEx and rival UPS (UPS) also face a potential challenge from the ever-embattled U.S. Postal Service, which has more than doubled its ""competitive"" — that is, cheaper — package volumes since 2012, Barclays said recently.""Pricing has clearly been under pressure from the USPS ... which likely negatively impacted results for FedEx and UPS,"" Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski wrote in a research note on Monday.Amazon also has begun its own shipping, taking a piece of business that traditionally went to FedEx and UPS.However, FedEx's international prospects remain solid, and Oglenski said ""global trade expansion in 2017 is shaping up to be the strongest witnessed this cycle, signaling supply chain tightness and a potential for shippers to 'trade up' for premium services.""UPS closed down 0.6%, trading below its 50- and 200-day moving averages.

387,FDX,"Biotech sector funds ruled the roost last year but technology focused funds are the clear winners now.Of 217 sector funds that are 10 years or older with at least $100 million in assets, three of the five top sector funds of 2016 were focused on technology. The other two represented the financial services and transportation sectors.All five sector funds featured in the 2017 IBD Mutual Fund Awards beat the benchmark S&P 500 for the past one, three, five and 10 years. Apple or iPhone-related chip stocks were a common underlying theme among the three technology funds.Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio (FSELX) was the top-performing sector fund last year with a 32.4% return. Its three, five and 10-year average annual return is 23.3%, 22% and 10.9%, respectively. The S&P 500 rose nearly 12% last year and 9.9%, 14.7% and 7% for the same periods. Fidelity Select Semiconductors is still beating the S&P 500 so far this year with a gain of 8.58% vs. 5.09%, though it's trailing the top sector funds by about eight percentage points.The Fidelity fund, launched in July 1985, has $2.8 billion in total assets. In October, it changed its name from Fidelity Select Electronics Portfolio to better reflect its focus on chipmakers and chip designers.""Despite a subdued macro environment — semiconductor industry revenue was essentially flat for the past couple of years — semiconductor stocks performed well,"" Steve Barwikowski, who has managed the fund since 2009, told IBD. ""The biggest factor has been M&A with roughly $100 billion worth of deals in each of the last two years.""More than 99% of the fund's assets were in tech stocks, while less than a percentage point was in communications services. Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Analog Devices (ADI) and Applied Materials (AMAT), its top five holdings at the end of the year, accounted for 52% of the fund's assets.Barwikowski thinks the chip industry could benefit from the new administration's pro-growth policies in areas such as tax and trade.""I am optimistic that the chips are poised for the best growth we have seen in a few years driven by a combination of healthy supply chain inventories, a more stable personal computing market, continued secular growth in the auto and cloud markets, a strong mobile phone cycle in the second half of the year, and potentially a healthier global macro environment,"" he said. ""Strong fundamentals are somewhat balanced by higher valuations, but there are definitely good opportunities for stock picking.""Up next is RMB Mendon Financial Services (RMBKX) with a 29.7% return in 2016. The $557.4 million fund, managed by Mendon Capital Advisors founder Anton Schutz, was launched in June 1999.As of Nov. 30, the fund was 85% invested in U.S. stocks and had less than 4% in cash. The top five holdings in the 62-stock portfolio were BNC Bancorp (BNCN), Yadkin Financial (YDKN), OceanFirst Financial (OCFC), Atlantic Capital Bancshares (ACBI) and Opus Bank (OPB).""Most of the gain in the financial services sector came in the last two months of the quarter following the surprising results of the presidential election,"" Schutz wrote in the fund's Q4 commentary. ""With visibility increasing around who the decision makers will be in Washington for the next four years, it became clear this was a significant inflection point for financial services in terms of both fundamentals and valuations.""He noted tail winds including corporate tax reform, amendments to Dodd-Frank and the delay of new Department of Labor rules.Fidelity Select Transportation Fund (FSRFX), with $644.7 million in assets, returned 10.5% last year. Industrials accounted for 99.1% of assets as of Jan. 31, with consumer cyclicals and technology making up less than 1%.Its top holdings by weighting as of Dec. 31 were United Parcel Service (UPS), Union Pacific (UNP), FedEx (FDX), CSX (CSX) and American Airlines Group (AAL).""My approach centers on the concepts of value and risk,"" fund manager Matthew Moulis said on Fidelity.com. ""In particular, I look for stocks that I think represent good value, where value is related to the price paid for attributes such as expected profit growth, return on capital and conversion of free cash flow.""Red Oak Technology Select Fund (ROGSX) came in third with a 24.6% return last year. Its average annual gains for the past three, five and 10 years were 12.9%, 18.4% and 11.5%, respectively. The Red Oak fund held total assets of $412.6 million as of Dec. 31, according to fund tracker Morningstar.Technology accounted for 86% of the fund's holdings as of Dec. 31, followed by consumer cyclical, financial services and industrials, at less than 6% each. Mark Oelschlager manages the fund. The fund's top five holdings were Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC), which recently agreed to by Mobileye (MBLY). Nearly a quarter, or 23%, of the fund's assets were in these names.Red Oak Technology and Fidelity Select Semiconductors both owned Intel, which had a 20% run in Q4. The chip giant's shares have dipped 2% this year, but IBD's overall chipmaker industry group has gained 8% this year and is ranked No. 38 among the 197 tracked by IBD.Columbia Seligman Communications & Information (SLMCX) rounds out the top five with a 15.4% return in 2016. Paul Wick has managed the $4.9 billion fund for 27 years. The fund was 91% invested in technology, 3% each in financial services and consumer cyclicals, and a little over 1% in industrials.Several chip names made its top five as of Jan. 31, including Lam Research (LRCX), Broadcom and Qorvo (QRVO). The three stocks rose 12%, 23% and 26% in Q4 last year. Apple (AAPL), up 20%, was also a top holding. The iPhone maker has rallied this year — it's close to the 20% profit-taking zone from a Jan. 9 breakout past a 117.12 cup-with-handle entry.""We are generally positive about the technology sector going forward despite many of the end markets being challenged for growth, whether that be in PCs, smartphones or networking,"" the managers said in their Q4 commentary. ""We are feeling optimistic about U.S. economic prospects in the wake of the election. In particular, we are enthusiastic that a less onerous regulatory environment should lead to more robust U.S. economic growth and that repatriation of cash held overseas will benefit a huge swath of technology companies in which the portfolio is invested.""RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?

446,FDX,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: August Performance Report
"
447,FDX,"Sophomore slump? Not for Joe Fath. He took the helm of $47 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund a year and a half ago — on Jan. 16, 2014. In that first calendar year in charge, his fund's 8.83% gain topped only 35% of its large-cap growth rival mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
448,FDX,"This year — in which the broad market has imitated a bucking bronco — his fund has climbed 5.93% as of Aug. 31 , outperforming a whopping 96% of its peer investors.
"
449,FDX,"Fath is more concerned with the longer term. The broad market's rally of nearly 6-1/2 years has made it increasingly hard for him to find attractively valued growth stocks.
"
450,FDX,"The late-summer volatility has made it harder to find gainers.
"
451,FDX,"Fath, who is about to celebrate his 45th birthday, talked with IBD from his office in Baltimore about why his mutual fund is performing so much better this year than last year and about how he is searching for new market leaders.
"
452,FDX,"IBD: When you took charge of this fund, you cut the size of the overall portfolio and of its top 10 names. You initially trimmed to 100, down from 118, and more recently you're at 106 as of July 31. Is your initial retooling complete?
"
453,FDX,"Fath: I'm where I want to be. The tail end of the fund is half what it used to be. It's 10% of the fund now. The top 10 decreased a little bit. The middle is bigger.
"
454,FDX,"IBD: How does each segment differ?
"
455,FDX,"Fath: I describe my philosophy as an upside-down pyramid. The top slice is secular-growth names. That typically makes up 50% to 60% of the portfolio. Those are innovative disrupters that are the most dynamic growth companies.
"
456,FDX,"The middle section would be more cyclical opportunities. These would typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio. They're likely to be more opportunistic and have shorter holding periods in the fund than the average holding.
"
457,FDX,"The last section would be what I generally characterize as special situations. These are in three primary areas:
"
458,FDX,"First, stocks transitioning from value to growth.
"
459,FDX,"Second, companies underway in a lasting industry structural change, like what has been going on the last several years in the U.S. airline sector.
"
460,FDX,"Third, roll-ups, where strong management teams that are good capital allocators are applying discipline and efficiency in fragmented industries through acquisition.
"
461,FDX,"This bucket will typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio.
"
462,FDX,"The top 10 or 20 names are generally the most compelling secular ideas. The tail of my portfolio has the smallest holdings and are typically my farm team — earlier-stage growth names and private companies that I own.
"
463,FDX,"IBD: Give me some examples of special situations, please.
"
464,FDX,"Fath: Gilead Sciences (GILD) went through the value-to-growth transition when it bought Pharmasset and got into (treating) hep C in addition to its core HIV business.
"
465,FDX,"Airlines are in the industry structural change category, and I own American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL).
"
466,FDX,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is in the roll-up category, bringing capital allocation discipline to the pharma industry through an assertive allocation strategy.
"
467,FDX,"IBD: Name examples from your secular bucket, please.
"
468,FDX,"Fath:Amazon (AMZN) would be the poster child. Tesla (TSLA) is a bit more extreme. It's an on-the-come story. Other names include Priceline (PCLN), MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V).
"
469,FDX,"IBD: And name some from your cyclical bucket, please.
"
470,FDX,"Fath: Stuff in financials like TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to a degree, but it is also a shifting business model, looking more like a value-to-growth shift.
"
471,FDX,"In industrials, I hold names like FedEx (FDX), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Flowserve (FLS), an energy industrial for the most part.
"
472,FDX,"IBD: Why has fund performance zoomed up this year — at least until the broad sell-off?
"
473,FDX,"Fath: It was a drag last year when secular-growth names sold off. A lot of that was due to people wanting to see more transparency in big names. They wanted to see Amazon break out its core e-commerce business and Amazon Web Services. That company is becoming more disciplined on expenses and costs.
"
474,FDX,"And we're starting to see that in Google (GOOGL).
"
475,FDX,"This year I've taken up the health care weighting significantly. And I've taken down energy. Both moves paid off.
"
476,FDX,"I have a number of biotech and managed care and big-pharma names. That's played well. There's been some M&A activity in that space.
"
477,FDX,"IBD: So you have a bigger bet on growth this year, and that has paid off?
"
478,FDX,"Fath: The slowdown in growth happened prior to the sell-off in 2014.
"
479,FDX,"I was positioned for a cyclical recovery, but that didn't play out. It's been the reverse in 2015.
"
480,FDX,"We've been in a slow-growth environment. And the world has been thrown off by exogenous shocks like Greece and China, which is devaluing its currency.
"
481,FDX,"Those external factors help make growth more valuable. That bids up the valuations of companies that are delivering growth.
"
482,FDX,"But you've got to be disciplined about position sizes.
"
483,FDX,"Google, Priceline — their outlooks look good. They've gone through heavy investment cycles.
"
484,FDX,"Google has a new CFO, Ruth Porat, who came from Morgan Stanley. They're creating a new holding company called Alphabet, which will give more visibility to profitability of the core company going forward. People wanted more transparency there, and Google is starting to provide it.
"
485,FDX,"IBD: Let's talk about some of your interesting names, as of your latest disclosure. Do you share the concerns that some people have about Apple (AAPL)?
"
486,FDX,"Fath: It's done well. But I've been underweight. The stock peaked around 130. It's been sort of trading sideways. I'm guarded.
"
487,FDX,"The most constructive part is its valuation and capital structure.
"
488,FDX,"The worry has been about the company after this iPhone cycle.
"
489,FDX,"They've done well with iPhone. Now the issue is its replacement cycle. What we underestimated is how impactful the replacement cycle would be.
"
490,FDX,"I remain concerned about their ability to innovate, and does that drive enough of a replacement? They've done so well. Can they grow (as fast) off this base? It's hard to drive a higher multiple.
"
491,FDX,"We'll see where it will go. The watch doesn't look like it will be a success — or at least not move the needle enough. I do own it. I don't have it overweight.
"
492,FDX,"IBD: Why should anyone like Facebook (FB), whose earnings per share growth has slowed a lot for two quarters?
"
493,FDX,"Fath: They've done everything right. Right now things are in transition in mobile. As they get a big base (of users), revenue growth is slowing as they invest in new initiatives. And they want a lot of users before they turn on the monetization engine.
"
494,FDX,"They have 300 million users on Instagram, a lot on WhatsApp. They have 1.5 billion users on Facebook. They'll monetize over time, so profit will reaccelerate.
"
495,FDX,"IBD: What's your thesis for Facebook's Oculus, which is buying Israel's Pebbles Interfaces, which specializes in depth-sensing tools that can track hand movement?
"
496,FDX,"Fath: Oculus is a virtual reality play. It's interesting, but not a needle mover, but it's on the come. It's a green banana. It still needs to ripen. It shows (Mark) Zuckerberg is thinking multidecades.
"
497,FDX,"IBD: What's your Visa thesis?
"
498,FDX,"Fath: It ties in with durability of growth because it is at the center of online payments, the movement from cash and checks to digital and disruption.
"
499,FDX,"In the U.S., cards still use magnetic swipes, but they are moving to chips with a PIN. All cards will be reissued with chips imbedded. That makes it much harder to steal card information.
"
500,FDX,"A lot of retailers have been reluctant to make this change because they'd have to change their payment hardware at the register. But they're finally starting to change.
"
501,FDX,"Visa Europe is another potential driver for Visa. Visa's takeover looks like it's coming to fruition. Maybe there will be an announcement in October.
"
502,FDX,"IBD: You've built your stake in Celgene (CELG) for at least four quarters. What do you like?
"
503,FDX,"Fath: The biotechs I want to own are going after big markets.
"
504,FDX,"Over time, Celgene has built an arsenal where they can go after multiple things. Revlimid has been an anchor to what they do. But they've acquired companies and build their own franchise.
"
505,FDX,"Now they've got Otezla, an immunology drug, for psoriasis (and psoriatic arthritis).
"
506,FDX,"They've also got a cancer drug, Pomalyst, and chemotherapy treatment, Abraxane (acquired through Abraxis).
"
507,FDX,"Another drug they acquired is GD-301 for treatment of Crohn's disease. Early trials are promising.
"
508,FDX,"There's a patent cliff ahead for Revlimid. They'll protect it as long as possible.
"
509,FDX,"And there's their recent acquisition of Receptos, which was viewed as a pretty reasonable price relative to some other deals. It's attacked multiple indications, but the most promising appears to be in gastrointestinal (disorders like) colitis and Crohn's.
"
510,FDX,"IBD: Why have you been trimming your stake in Gilead Sciences?
"
511,FDX,"Fath: They're a victim of their own success. They turned what was a chronic disease into an acute disease that is treatable.
"
512,FDX,"Their treatment for hepatitis C is a monster drug. But its cure rate is almost 100% in eight to 12 weeks. Once someone is cured, they've got to find new patients.
"
513,FDX,"IBD: You've also pared your stake in Regeneron (REGN). What's your outlook?
"
514,FDX,"Fath: I probably shouldn't have trimmed. They've got a good core franchise in Eylea, which is used for treating wet age-related macular degeneration in the eye. Now it's also used for diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion.
"
515,FDX,"They've got a powerful pipeline.
"
516,FDX,"IBD: You've pared Starbucks (SBUX). What are your concerns?
"
517,FDX,"Fath: I still feel good about their core story. Our trims are just position-size management.
"
518,FDX,"They have a lot of presence, not just in the U.S., but globally. They've introduced nice food with their purchase of La Boulange. They're driving new traffic in the afternoon and evenings. They've got a good China story. Their menu is being broadened.
"
519,FDX,"Their next big thing is moving bodies through the line. They're rolling out a mobile order-and-pay system, where you pay through your cellphone and dictate the delivery time. Then you walk into the store and your coffee is ready.Best Mutual Funds 2015: August Performance ReportSophomore slump? Not for Joe Fath. He took the helm of $47 billion T.

They turned what was a chronic disease into an acute disease that is treatable.Their treatment for hepatitis C is a monster drug. But its cure rate is almost 100% in eight to 12 weeks. Once someone is cured, they've got to find new patients.IBD: You've also pared your stake in Regeneron (REGN). What's your outlook?Fath: I probably shouldn't have trimmed. They've got a good core franchise in Eylea, which is used for treating wet age-related macular degeneration in the eye. Now it's also used for diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion.They've got a powerful pipeline.IBD: You've pared Starbucks (SBUX). What are your concerns?Fath: I still feel good about their core story. Our trims are just position-size management.They have a lot of presence, not just in the U.S., but globally. They've introduced nice food with their purchase of La Boulange. They're driving new traffic in the afternoon and evenings. They've got a good China story. Their menu is being broadened.Their next big thing is moving bodies through the line. They're rolling out a mobile order-and-pay system, where you pay through your cellphone and dictate the delivery time. Then you walk into the store and your coffee is ready.

520,FDX,"Accounting benefits for phone companies have made some telecom investors scratch their heads, and upcoming revenue-recognition changes for software companies could be the next conundrum.The good news for technology stock investors is that the accounting changes for software companies have been ""effectively delayed until 2018,"" says a Citigroup report. The bad news is that there's a long list of companies that would be impacted.They include: Adobe Systems (ADBE), security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Splunk (SPLK).Industry ""deliberations"" over the new software revenue accounting standards will heat up in Fall, 2015, says Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard in a report. ""Proposed changes are significant and make revenue treatment less conservative,"" he said.Accounting standards bodies FASB and IASB proposed the changes in international revenue accounting in 2014.Pritchard notes that the accounting changes come just as the industry is shifting toward cloud computing's software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model and subscription-based revenue, rather than one-time licensing fees.""We see the non-SaaS subscription contracts such as those employed by Adobe, Autodesk (ADSK), CA, Guidewire Software (GWRE), Jive Software (JIVE), Microsoft and Splunk to be most at risk to change, with revenue timing accelerated.""The new accounting rules ""could provide more of an incentive for companies to change contract terms in order to accelerate revenue and achieve quarterly targets, something that current rules make more difficult. Beyond subscription revenue treatment, we also see other proposed changes that could drive more inconsistent allocation of revenue between product (license-appliances) and ratable sources (maintenance support) as well as separation of hosting arrangements from software in certain SaaS arrangements,"" Pritchard said.The accounting changes, Pritchard speculates, could ""make it difficult to compare reported revenue between native SaaS companies (like Salesforce) and flexible SaaS companies (like Oracle and SAP).""In a separate report, Morgan Stanley on Thursday said more than 50 ""pension heavy"" companies have recently changed their GAAP accounting, thereby redefining pension costs, and sometimes eliminating pension costs from adjusted earnings. They include Boeing (BA), FedEx (FDX), Honeywell (HON) and AT&T (T).Telecom companies have roiled earnings by introducing wireless financing plans for mobile phones. The EIP (equipment installment plans) pull forward earnings by booking equipment revenue on the date of sale. T-Mobile's (TMUS) aggressive Uncarrier promotions started the EIP trend, and AT&T followed. Sprint (S) more recently has introduced leasing plans that boost EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization).Follow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter: @IBD_RKrause.

537,FDX,"A good stock idea isn't much use if you don't understand what you're looking at. Is it an institutional-quality stock? Is it a cyclical play that probably will only profit from its industry cycle? Is it a turnaround story that involves the fixing of a company problem? Is it a fad stock that will run hot until people tire of the novelty?
"
538,FDX,"The strategy and target will differ for each of these situations, and it will vary by the kind of uptrend the market is in.Peg the stock wrong or the market wrong, and you will probably lose money or at least make less than you should.If an investor is going to make big money, institutional-quality stocks, operating in a strong uptrend, will most often be the investor's best choice. However, there are times when a cyclical stock, turnaround or fad stock can deliver good gains.Where can an investor find or identify great stock ideas? Your Weekly Review (YWR), also known as the 85-85 list, is a good place to look in Friday's IBD.In this screen, stocks must score an 85 in EPS Rating and in Relative Price Strength Rating. The 85 means that the stocks must be in the top 15 percentile among stocks in IBD's database. Stocks also must be within 15% of a 12-month high.Charts are listed by industry group, but charts aren't printed for every stock. Additional stocks are listed in the fine-print listing on the last page of YWR, today on A8.The big net makes the 85-85 a good place to look for stock ideas. A low-hurdle screen will pick up more cyclicals, turnarounds and fad stocks than a high-hurdle screen.Some people sneer at ""fad stocks."" They argue that such stocks are dangerous, won't last and aren't for serious investors.Well, all stocks are dangerous. While fad stocks might have a shorter life, sometimes all we're talking about is a solid company indirectly benefiting from a fad.For example, egg producer and distributor Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) rode the Atkins diet to big stock gains in 2003.In other cases, fads develop into longer-lasting trends.For instance, Deckers Outdoor (DECK) bought UGG Holdings in August 1995 and eventually turned the Ugg boots — once popular mostly with surfers — into a broader fashion trend.From October 2002 to October 2011, Deckers Outdoors shares rose 9,193%, with Uggs deserving much of the credit.How might the 85-85 be used?Let's look at the 85-85 screen that was published in IBD on Oct. 24, 2014, not long after a market low and the Oct. 21 follow-through day. A follow-through day soon after a market low is often the best time to scout for breakouts, retaking of buy points and bounces off the 10-week moving average, as seen in the minicharts.An investor could've found five institutional-quality stocks in the 85-85 that soon set valid entries: Apple (AAPL), Celgene (CELG), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Illumina (ILMN) and Skyworks (SWKS). Gains varied from 15% to 79%.Four cyclicals in the 85-85 eventually offered entries: Landstar System (LSTR), Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL), FedEx (FDX) and Lennar (LEN). Gains ran from 11% to 15%.Turnarounds and fads were scarce.The market itself was and had been choppy, which is why taking a 10% to 15% profit in Apple was prudent.

663,FDX,"Best ETFs 2015: April Performance UpdateValue stocks gained ground with ETF investors in the past month as the markets remain choppy. But growth-oriented exchange traded funds continue to lead year to date. They tend to hold more stocks that offer the promise of higher returns, while presenting greater risks. Value-oriented ETFs focus on safer, more mature stocks.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), which tracks the broad stock market, rose 2% during the last four weeks. It's up 2.2% so far in 2015.Investors' bullishness stems in part from the Federal Reserve's holding interest rates lower for longer. News of corporate acquisitions is also helping, says Russ Koesterich, BlackRock's (BLK) global chief investment strategist.""One positive side effect of the extraordinary low interest rates is a continuation, even acceleration, in merger activity,"" Koesterich wrote in an April 13 note. Low rates make money cheap and readily available for financing large deals.Last week, two multinationals announced acquisitions to expand internationally. FedEx (FDX) agreed to buy Dutch delivery service TNT for $4.8 billion. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) offered to buy BG Group for $70.2 billion.Along with M&As, initial public offerings are chugging along, albeit below last year's record pace. The 37 IPOs priced in 2015 thus far have raised $5.6 billion, according to IPO expert Renaissance Capital.Web host and domain registrar GoDaddy (GDDY), for instance, raised $460 million in its IPO March 31, hitting above expectations.Such signs of strength are helping U.S. diversified stock ETFs. First Trust U.S. IPO (FPX) grew 4.3% in the trailing one month and 8.2% year to date. The large-cap growth fund holds the 100 largest and most liquid U.S. IPOs. It has $638.4 million in assets, more than half of which are in the tech and consumer sectors currently in favor. Its top three stock holdings are Facebook (FB), AbbVie (ABBV) and Kraft Foods (KRFT).Investors bet on growth stocks across the cap-size spectrum for successful investing. PowerShares DWA SmallCap Momentum (DWAS) is up 7.8% thus far in 2015. Schwab U.S. .Mid-Cap (SCHM) gained 7%.Among sector ETFs, oil and gas producers and servicers came back strongly in the past month as commodity prices recovered. So did gold miners, for similar reasons.Some investors also consider these stocks extremely oversold and ripe for a rebound.Year to date, health care and biotech funds continue to dominate. ALPS Medical Breakthroughs (SBIO), a new ETF, beat its peers with a 28.8% gain. The ETF invests in small- and midcap stocks with at least one drug in phase two or phase three clinical trials. SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) is up 24.6%.But topping the sectors so far in 2015 are Guggenheim Solar (TAN) and iShares Global Clean Energy (ICLN). They benefited as investors took note of greater efficiencies in the subindustry as well as Apple's (AAPL) recent $848 million clean energy deal with First Solar (FSLR).Guggenheim Solar has surged 42.4% year to date; iShares Global Clean Energy advanced 30.7%.Foreign FundsEmerging markets notched huge gains among funds holding foreign stocks. They offer pockets of relative value vs. U.S. stocks.First Trust Emerging Markets AlphaDEX (FEM) spiked 15.3% in the past month. Category-leader Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), with $49.73 billion in assets, grew 11.6%.First Trust Emerging allocates 44.2% of assets to China stocks, which have been on a tear recently. Vanguard FTSE Emerging assigns 24%.Investors should be selective within emerging markets, say analysts at Emerging Global Advisors.""Look for countries with better current account management and those that are embracing reforms,"" they wrote March 16. ""Most of these countries are located in Asia.""Countries mismanaging current accounts have income flowing abroad and are racking up debt.Among foreign funds in 2015 overall, currency hedging continues to hold sway. WisdomTree Europe Hedge Equity (HEDJ) and its peers are still among the year's best performers. The ETF rose 2.5% in the past month, taking 2015 gains to 22.8%.

665,FDX,"The world's largest aerospace firm ended production of its 200- to 250-seat 757 in 2004 due to waning demand and expectations that the latest, narrow-body 737s would serve that market.

685,FDX,"But Robert Mann, head of aerospace consultant R.W. Mann, estimated that just 200 of the 757s in service are used for flights of 3,500 miles or longer. The rest can be replaced by shorter-range Boeing and Airbus planes.

716,FDX,"This week, Ma said at a conference that he's open to a partner with Apple's (AAPL) Apple Pay mobile payments service.
"
717,FDX,"Alibaba rules the world's fastest-growing and largest e-commerce market, but the company and its mercurial founder, Ma, must gain overseas to keep growing and satisfy investors. The long-term challenge Alibaba faces is similar to ones faced by U.S. counterparts such as Amazon, eBay and Priceline (PCLN), which turned to international markets to maintain high growth rates as U.S. markets matured.
"
718,FDX,"But JG Capital analyst Henry Guo doesn't see international markets, including the U.S., becoming a driver of Alibaba's growth for three to five years. ""(Alibaba's) focus now is on China's domestic market,"" Guo said.
"
719,FDX,"He says the company still needs to first build its brand awareness and user base in the U.S. before it builds its e-commerce infrastructure. ""It's going to take some time,"" Guo said.
"
720,FDX,"Alibaba might pay as much attention to new markets in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East as it does to the U.S.
"
721,FDX,"""Alibaba's expansion may not be so much in the U.S., as in the rest of the world,"" Henry S.

Tang notes ""pockets of opportunity"" in emerging markets like Indonesia, where Alibaba can capitalize on demand for phones and consumer electronics.
"
722,FDX,"Two-Thirds Unfamiliar
"
723,FDX,"One of Alibaba's biggest hurdles here is its little-known brand. A recent survey by online retail researcher Bizrate Insights found that 63% of online buyers, skewing toward younger consumers and women, aren't familiar with Alibaba's brand or website. Of the 37% that had heard of Alibaba, only 30% of them (11% overall) said they had browsed the site.
"
724,FDX,"""Alibaba has to raise its brand awareness,"" Bizrate Insights Vice President Hayley Silver told IBD.
"
725,FDX,"With no U.S.-based e-commerce operation, Silver says consumers have to order items from Alibaba's English-language Chinese website. She says shipping from China is slow and she questions how well Chinese customer service reps would handle complaints. Also, Alibaba's site features made-in-China items, a turn-off for shoppers here who prefer American-made goods.
"
726,FDX,"In one of its biggest moves in the U.S., Alibaba has taken a 39% stake in San Mateo, Calif.-based ShopRunner, a smaller, members-only rival of Amazon. Headed by former Yahoo (YHOO) CEO Scott Thompson, ShopRunner offers free shipping for online orders in a program that resembles Amazon Prime.
"
727,FDX,"ShopRunner is preparing a joint service with Alibaba that provides U.S. brands with a direct way to sell to China's consumers. When it's up and running, the 300 million-plus Chinese users of Alibaba's AliPay payments service will be able to order products directly from the U.S. websites of ShopRunner partners like Neiman Marcus (NMG) and Nine West, and have the goods delivered from the U.S. to China in 10 days.
"
728,FDX,"The joint service reportedly will launch by year-end. A ShopRunner spokesperson declined to comment. But when it does launch, the China-centric Alibaba/ShopRunner partnership likely will do little to churn up business for Alibaba with U.S. shoppers.
"
729,FDX,"Alibaba's only direct foray into U.S. e-commerce so far has more of a PR angle than scale. In June, it launched 11 Main, a small online retail website that touts distinctly U.S. goods and crafts from U.S. vendors.
"
730,FDX,"With the motivation and the money, some observes expect Alibaba will make a big acquisition in the U.S. Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria said in an Oct. 1 report that eBay's Marketplaces businesses makes it a tempting target for Alibaba. Marketplaces is second only to Amazon in e-commerce sales.
"
731,FDX,"But Carnegie Towers' Tang says Alibaba could get U.S. traction by acting as an intermediary between buyers and sellers, similar to what eBay does now and something it could do without acquiring eBay.
"
732,FDX,"Tang says Alibaba could rely on the in-house inventories of U.S. brands and makers who sell on its site. He says it could rely on the existing facilities of these sellers and shippers like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) without building a fulfillment network like Amazon.
"
733,FDX,"B2B Connection
"
734,FDX,"U.S. brand sellers could use Alibaba's platform to access millions of shoppers in markets such as China, where Amazon has a limited presence.
"
735,FDX,"Offering B2B transactions for U.S. companies is another hot area for Alibaba, according to Tang. He says Alibaba's connections with suppliers in China and other foreign markets could be useful for U.S. clients.
"
736,FDX,"Still, a big U.S. acquisition wouldn't be a surprise.
"
737,FDX,"""It's possible,"" said JG Capital's Guo, though he says eBay might be a bit large for Alibaba to digest.
"
738,FDX,"Ma isn't shy about buying big U.S. businesses. He said in 2011 that he was interested in acquiring then-troubled Yahoo. But such a high-profile purchase might face scrutiny in Congress and possibly by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. CFIUS is an inter-agency government body that reviews transactions that could give control of U.S. companies to foreigners.
"
739,FDX,"Tang says says the latest signals from Washington indicate that foreign acquisitions would be blocked only if U.S. national interests were threatened.
"
740,FDX,"That, he says, wouldn't be the case in any Alibaba acquisition.
"
741,FDX,"""Alibaba isn't trying to acquire Bell Helicopter,"" he said. ""We're talking about consumers and B2B stuff.""Alibaba will need more than a hugely successful IPO to pry open the U.S. market.Being China's dominant e-commerce company doesn't give Alibaba Group (BABA) a leg up in the U.S., where few shoppers know its brand.The Chinese company has done some U.S. M&A, but only with small companies that don't have near the heft of Amazon.com (AMZN) and other bigger e-tailers.The most direct way Alibaba can build its U.S. presence, analysts say, is through a big acquisition or two. And some analysts suggest eBay (EBAY), which recently disclosed that it will split into separate e-commerce and payments (PayPal) companies, is a possible target.While Alibaba has loads of cash from its record $25 billion U.S. IPO in September, a big acquisition could irk U.S. regulators and politicians at a time of rising tensions between Washington and Beijing.In the meantime, Alibaba has room to grow at home. Alibaba boasts 500 million registered users in China, a huge figure that nevertheless is still far less than half the country's population. But it faces mounting competition in China from rivals such as Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) and Baidu (BIDU), and Alibaba founder Jack Ma has his sights set on making Alibaba an international brand.""We hope to become a truly global company,"" Ma said at a Hong Kong investor conference on Sept. 16, during which he stressed that Alibaba is looking to the U.S. and Europe.'Only The Beginning'""This is only a beginning,"" Masayoshi Son, CEO of Japan's SoftBank, which owns a 34% stake in Alibaba, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television last month.

786,FDX,"""They've been very consistent with how they've run their network, which has allowed them to generate very high incremental margins on additional tonnage or additional price that they're giving,"" said Fowler. ""They are very focused on the cost side of the business and they continue to invest in technology, which allows them to improve efficiencies across the board.""
"
787,FDX,"Old Dominion focuses on less-than-truckload, or LTL, transport. This means that multiple shipments are usually contained on a truck, which then delivers the goods to one of its 225 service centers for distribution to clients. The firm operates in the national as well as regional markets. It also has been expanding its worldwide freight forwarding services.
"
788,FDX,"Mover In The Market
"
789,FDX,"The company's stellar business performance is reflected in its market performance. Old Dominion stock jumped 46% last year, while investors who had held on to the shares for a decade could benefit from a nearly 600% gain.
"
790,FDX,"It's the highest-rated company in IBD's Transportation-Truck industry group, which includes 20 stocks. And it's second largest by market cap, after J.B. Hunt Transport (JBHT) . Swift Transportation (SWFT) is third in size.
"
791,FDX,"Old Dominion was founded in 1934 by current CEO David Congdon's grandparents, with a single truck running between Richmond, Va., and Norfolk, Va. Congdon became president and chief operating officer in 1997. Currently, Old Dominion operates its service centers across most of the U.S. and runs more than 6,400 tractors and 19,400 trailers.
"
792,FDX,"In addition to serving national markets, Old Dominion also set a goal of operating in the regional, interregional and long-haul markets, all under one corporate office and computer system, Congdon says.
"
793,FDX,"The company has been successful in competing with small regional players as well as national carriers within the U.S. It also expanded its reach outside of the lower 48 states to Canada, Mexico, Alaska, Hawaii and the Caribbean. Partnerships in global freight forwarding have provided Old Dominion access to China and other international markets.
"
794,FDX,"Old Dominion notes that it holds a 5% to 6% market share in the LTL industry, as estimated by an independent market research firm. The company plans to double this number within the next couple of years.
"
795,FDX,"The carrier has one of the industry's lowest cargo claim ratios. ""Historically, the LTL industry has had a cargo claim ratio of 1% to 1.5% of revenue,"" Congdon told IBD. ""We have driven ours down this year to in the range of 0.3% to 0.35%.""
"
796,FDX,"Several elements contributed to low claims. Those include logistics racks in all trailers to avoid shifting of shipment within the trucks during transportation, the use of airbags between cargo, the use of straps and more.
"
797,FDX,"But the most important tool, said Congdon, is getting the employees to use these tools.
"
798,FDX,"""You can invest all you want in all the tools,"" he said. ""But until you get employees believing in what they should be doing every day, that's the biggest key to the success.""
"
799,FDX,"That said, the company has put a substantial amount of investment into its operations and infrastructure in the past decade. This trend is expected to continue in the next several years as it plans to take a larger slice of the LTL market.
"
800,FDX,"""It's going to be a combination of growth capex, investing in technology and improving their existing infrastructure for when they get to bottlenecks or points that they've outgrown the existing infrastructure that they had in place,"" said Fowler.
"
801,FDX,"What About Oil Prices?
"
802,FDX,"Old Dominion also has a track record of effectively managing the expense side of operations.
"
803,FDX,"With oil prices slashed to less than half of what they were just six months ago, analysts expect fuel-cost savings to be largely passed through to the customers.
"
804,FDX,"The trucking industry has traditionally operated with fuel price surcharges that adjust on a weekly basis, and Fowler doesn't expect to see a big tail wind or headwind for the company from the changing price of fuel.
"
805,FDX,"""What we're more focused on is the indirect impact of what's happening with changes in end markets from the standpoint that the oil and gas related to the drilling activity has consumed a lot of freight capacity,"" he said. ""If we see those end markets slow, that could free up some capacity overall in the industry.""
"
806,FDX,"However, counterbalancing it would be the benefits consumers would receive from lower fuel costs, according to Fowler.
"
807,FDX,"""Typically when we think about freight activity in general, it's probably two-thirds consumer oriented and one-third manufacturing,"" he noted.
"
808,FDX,"Net-net, Fowler expects a modest benefit from lower fuel costs on the expense side.
"
809,FDX,"Additional risks for the company include some increased competition. While the cost and barriers of entry to this business are quite steep for traditional players, the entrance of technology-based truck brokerages has created some competition by providing more favorable cost to smaller customers, explained Fowler.
"
810,FDX,"Large companies such as FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) also have their own LTL business, which gives price advantages in bundling various services.
"
811,FDX,"""One of the big industry issues is the driver shortage,"" said Congdon. ""There are fewer people growing up and saying 'Hey, I want to be a truck driver.'""
"
812,FDX,"Drivers Wanted
"
813,FDX,"Congdon estimates that today the industry is short about 50,000 to 60,000 drivers. This figure is expected to surpass 200,000 in the next decade.
"
814,FDX,"""The good news for our company is ... we have a fertile soil to grow our drivers,"" he said.
"
815,FDX,"Old Dominion offers competitive pay for people who can start working on its docks, without having to have college education. They can then transition into becoming drivers for pay topping $60,000 a year and sometimes as high as $100,000.
"
816,FDX,"The company reports its 2014 fourth-quarter and year-end results on Feb. 5, before trading opens. Analyst consensus as polled by Thomson Reuters calls for sales of $717 million and $2.78 billion for each period respectively. Earnings per share are forecast to be $0.72 and $3.02, with EPS growth of 26% for 2014. Analysts expect 19% EPS growth this year.For Old Dominion Freight Line, the less-than-truckload carrier, logistics and freight-forwarding company, 2014 turned out to be the proverbial perfect storm.Industry capacity constraints, supply disruptions, the growing economy and the company's strong execution all contributed to excellent results for the North Carolina firm, said analyst Todd Fowler of KeyBanc Capital Markets.One year of double-digit earnings and sales growth does not necessarily make a best-in-class operator, but Old Dominion's (ODFL) strength goes much further back. It has at least a decade of strong results under its belt with only one year of noticeable decline in profit and sales, as the recession's effects were being felt in 2009. Even then, it still registered a profit vs. many of its peers.""They've been very consistent with how they've run their network, which has allowed them to generate very high incremental margins on additional tonnage or additional price that they're giving,"" said Fowler.

Revenue of $11.3 billion was up 3%.By midafternoon, FedEx shares were trading slightly down in the stock market today, Monday.Last week, the company announced a quarterly cash dividend of 20 cents per share on its common stock, a 5-cent bump up.Rival and market leader UPS (UPS) reported Q1 in April, with per-share earnings falling 5.8% to 98 cents, missing views by a dime. Revenue rose 2.6% to $13.78 billion, but missed estimates. Both companies attributed the winter-quarter misses to the unforgiving weather.UPS shares were flat at 101 by midafternoon.In May, FedEx said it will increase shipping prices. Expect to see FedEx Ground begin to charge all packages by ""dimensional weight,"" starting in January 2015. This means shipments will be charged by volume and weight, and not weight alone, increasing the price for bulky items.The company currently charges by dimensional weight for shipments only 3 cubic feet or larger.FedEx Freight's fuel surcharge was hiked by 3 percentage points at the beginning of June. Including air freight, the company raised FedEx Freight shipping prices by 3.9% in March and increased FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery rates by an average of 4.9% at the start of the year.

If those with ADD/ADHD stay sharp, though, they can have extraordinary careers.Count among those with ADD/ADHD Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Kinko's (FDX) founder Paul Orfalea and David Neeleman, who launched JetBlue (JBLU).""There seems to be a consistently higher level of creativity, a higher level of intelligence among people with ADD,"" said Kevin Ross Emery, author of  ""Managing the Gift Of Your ADD/HD Child.""The world has long benefited from great leaders who, Emery says, exhibited ADD/ADHD characteristics. Try composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and car pioneer Henry Ford. ""I look at this as a gift, that, yes, has some challenges,"" Emery told IBD.Avoid this mistake: using ADD/ADHD as an excuse not to pursue dreams.""Once we relate to it as disabled, we become disabled,"" Emery said. ""We find excuses not to do things. It's easy to become lazy.""Do you have ADD/ADHD? Excel by working in a different way:• Take breathers. ""If you need to do something that is going to take a long period of time or intense concentration, start by breaking it up into smaller pieces,"" Emery said.Exercise — even a stroll around the department or block — helps.Or dig into a completely different project for a half-hour, then return to the original task.• Book it. ""By setting short, 20- to 40-minute appointments with myself to make calls, write 600-word articles or finish reports for my growth-consulting work, I'm able to get much more done,"" said Mark Faust, an executive consultant and author of ""Growth or Bust!""He was diagnosed with ADD as an adult but learned how to harness its creative benefits on the job. ""Both ADD and ADHD can be transformed into a strength,"" he said.• Move and groove. Swimming, running, walking, rowing or other repetitive physical activities can up your focus, Emery finds. He calls them moving meditations. ""You are engaging your body, but your mind goes to another place,"" he said.• Feed your brain. ""ADHD can be debilitating if you are on a bad diet,"" Emery cautioned.To still your mind and body, he recommends cutting back on caffeine, alcohol and sugar. • Find the finish line. Due dates help Faust stay on task when he's tempted to go off-track. ""Because of a deadline, I was able to write 90% of my 50,000-word book in two weeks,"" he said.• Mark it down. Checklists, notebooks and sticky notes help people with ADD/ADHD remember details and finish each step so they can accomplish their tasks.""They have so much going on in their heads that it needs to be organized,"" Emery said. ""Both ADD individuals and the people around them must learn to put things in writing.""Managers with ADD/ADHD employees and those who live with them should remember to write a list of the steps involved in accomplishing an important task the first time.""Put it on something that they have a habit of checking,"" Emery added, ""such as their computer screen, the refrigerator or the television.""

UPS blamed bad weather in the U.S. for higher costs.Weather's impact led FedEx to trim its full-year forecast to $6.55 to $6.80 per share, below the $6.89 forecast by analysts.FedEx Express' $1.6 billion profit improvement plan ""remains on track despite the near-term impact of weather,"" Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf said in the release.The company said it entered into accelerated share-buyback agreements of $2 billion in the quarter.Revenue in the company's core FedEx Express segment was down slightly from last year to $6.67 billion while FedEx Ground rose 10% to $3 billion, helped in part by higher online shipments from Cyber Week, which fell in the second quarter last year.FedEx Freight revenue was up 9% to $1.35 billion.

1056,FDX,"Shipper FedEx (FDX) will report third-quarter results Wednesday for a period that likely went through some highs and lows.The No. 2 package delivery company's December-through-February quarter included the holiday shopping season, notable for a surge in online sales. Cyber Monday fell in the first week in December instead of November.But the quarter also was marred by severe winter weather, which caused airline delays and roadway challenges in much of the country.Top shipper United Parcel Service (UPS), in its December-ending fourth-quarter report, said e-commerce shipments pushed volume up 6% worldwide but cited higher costs in the U.S. due to the bad weather. It also said higher volumes stressed its network, causing it to deploy more people and equipment. Earnings fell 5% vs. 2012's same quarter.Analysts expect FedEx, the No. 2 package delivery company after UPS, to report a 5% gain in sales vs. the earlier year to $11.45 billion.Earnings are seen growing a more robust 23% to $1.51 a share as the firm continues to execute on its profit improvement and cost reduction initiatives. FedEx also raised prices on some services, effective Jan. 6.In its second-quarter report, Memphis, Tenn.-based FedEx said its outlook assumes ""continued moderate economic growth"" and share buybacks. It raised earnings guidance for the full year to 8% to 14% growth from 7% to 13% previously.FedEx shares are down 5% this year. But UPS is down nearly 8%. IBD's Transport-Air Freight industry group is down 8% for the year. The group ranks No. 126 of IBD's 197 industry groups.

"
1073,FDX,"S&P 500 earnings will grow just 1.2% vs. a year earlier, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. That would be the 10th straight quarter of single-digit growth and the slowest pace since Q3 2012. Revenue is expected to grow a slothlike 2.7% for the first three months of 2014.About two-thirds of companies typically top forecasts, so the final figures will likely be less grim — but still well below Q4's 9.9%.""Nobody is expecting any fireworks,"" said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks Investment Research.Companies have been quick to blame bad weather in lowering expectations. There have been about six negative preannouncements for every positive one, Thomson Reuters said.Consumer discretionary firms are expected to deliver 6.1% earnings growth, down from 14.5% projected at the start of 2014.""That's one of the sectors that is really talking about the weather a lot,"" said Gregory Harrison, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters. ""People are staying home, not going out shopping.""FedEx (FDX) missed estimates last month when it reported its fiscal Q3 ended Feb. 28, saying that unusually severe winter weather ""disrupted operations, decreased shipping volume and impacted year-over-year operating income by an estimated $125 million.""Not surprisingly, utilities are expected to benefit from the bad weather, with earnings seen up 7.7% and revenue 3.9%. It is the sole S&P 500 sector that wasn't revised downward for Q1, Harrison said.Telecom is the sector expected to show the best growth at 12.8%.Technology should report a tepid 2.5% gain. Apple (AAPL) should eke out EPS growth of less than 1%, while Intel (INTC), IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT) show declines. But Facebook (FB), added to the S&P 500 in December, should double EPS.Energy and materials sectors should report earnings declines, reflecting sluggish global demand, particularly in China and emerging markets.Financial earnings should drop 2.6% with revenue off 0.8%. Banks are about finished with profit-flattering loan-loss reserve releases. Many are laying off mortgage staff and selling off their commodities units.Multibillion-dollar legal settlements involving big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) haven't helped their bottom lines either. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo (WFC) will report Q1 results on April 11.Bank Of America (BAC) EPS likely fell 75% in Q1. The Charlotte, N.C.-based giant reports April 16.""The biggest industry within the finance sector — banks — they don't really have much growth avenues right now,"" said Mian of Zacks Investment Research.Property and casual insurers are expected to take a beating — a 12% decline — likely due to inclement weather.Struggles in emerging markets such as Turkey and the ongoing political crisis in Ukraine certainly have weighed on investors, but haven't made a big impact on earnings, Mian said.""If Russia had gotten out of hand or gets out of hand going forward and comes in the way of the emerging recovery in Europe, then it's potentially a problem for earnings,"" he said.Investors will be particularly interested in companies' guidance for evidence that earnings growth will heat up in the spring.Wall Street sees 8.5% earnings growth in Q2. Revenue should rise 3.7%, just so-so, but it would be the best in two years.

"
1086,FDX,"The canal, which opened in 1914, is undergoing a $5 billion revamp to let more and much-larger ships pass through. Currently many giant vessels must unload hauls destined for the eastern half of the U.S. at West Coast ports. Now big ports on the Gulf and East Coasts are hoping to attract a flood of new business.
"
1087,FDX,"Many regional trucking companies and those hauling medium- sized shipments stand to benefit, said Rick O'Dell, CEO of Georgia-based trucking firm Saia Inc. (SAIA)

"
1098,FDX,"West Coast ports aren't sitting back. The ports of Los Angeles and nearby Long Beach — the top-two U.S. ports by volume — have multibillion-dollar infrastructure improvements underway to keep their competitive edge. They handle more than 40% of goods that come into the the U.S., most of it from Asia.
"
1099,FDX,"About half of the goods coming into those ports are moved by truck within California and adjoining states such as Nevada and Arizona. But the other half, largely discretionary goods, are taken by rail to the Midwest and points farther east, said Port of L.A. spokesman Phillip Sanfield.

1102,FDX,"Meanwhile, imports from Asia have slowed, flattening the once double-digit volume growth at the Southern California ports to 1% to 2% the last couple of years.
"
1103,FDX,"A wider canal won't ""supercharge the water,"" shortening the time it takes ships to get through, Sanfield says. Transit times from Asia would still be shorter for goods dropped off at West Coast ports and then taken overland to the East Coast than if they were to go through the Panama Canal to East Coast ports.
"
1104,FDX,"Using the canal might be cheaper, but usage fees for the new, wider lane haven't been set yet.

1105,FDX,"After the Panama Canal project is finished, shippers ""will optimize delivery to ports on the East Coast and Gulf Coast to get closer to their destinations,"" O'Dell says. That shift — getting closer to end deliveries — will have a more positive impact on truckers than rails, he added.

"
1131,FDX,"Within a few years, Good Guys was out of business, followed by Circuit City and bookseller Borders.

"
1138,FDX,"Craig Berman, VP of Global Communications, said in an email that Amazon takes ""protection of data very seriously"" and said it works every day to keep promises to customers to keep their trust.
"
1139,FDX,"Amazon's online reviews gave users the chance to rate and describe products that gave other potential customers the sense they were feeling out the product before buying it.
"
1140,FDX,"Low prices also kept customers coming back. Until recently, Amazon didn't collect sales tax, a sizable advantage over brick-and-mortar stores. Amazon also doesn't have the expense of running a physical store with limited options and quantities.
"
1141,FDX,"But building up warehouses and distribution networks isn't cheap and can't be done quickly, instead it is an ongoing process. Amazon's massive infrastructure spending — still ongoing — is a key reason why profitability took a long time and has continued to remain spotty.
"
1142,FDX,"Getting products from Amazon warehouses to its customers also has been an enormous lift to UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX). Both have seen their delivery businesses explode with Amazon and e-commerce.
"
1143,FDX,"Amazon also added third-party sellers to its site, giving smaller retailers the opportunity to reach a large audience for a fee, while allowing customers to find nearly everything imaginable under one website.

"
1152,FDX,"Amazon Web Services became part of the vanguard of the cloud-computing movement.

1156,FDX,"Making Lemonade
"
1157,FDX,"Amazon has largely given up trying to avoid collecting state and local sales taxes. But once again, it's turning lemons into lemonade. No longer minimizing physical presences to avoid tax issues, Amazon is building more distribution centers, close to big cities, as it pushes toward next-day and same-day delivery. The move still puts pressure on brick-and-mortar retailers to adapt.
"
1158,FDX,"The company is also branching out into online grocery with its AmazonFresh service, available in Southern California, San Francisco and Seattle.
"
1159,FDX,"Mahaney doesn't see a new online rival to Amazon in the next five to 10 years.
"
1160,FDX,"""Amazon is extremely hard to replicate. It would be extremely expensive to set up distribution centers and master logistics,"" he said.

1161,FDX,"Amazon introduced the Kindle e-reader in 2007, followed by full-fledged tablets.

1162,FDX,"Amazon hopes consumers fill up the devices with e-books, videos and other media from its site. And if users are buying media from Amazon, they are more likely to also buy other goods such as diapers or clothing.

"
1165,FDX,"Lumping Amazon Instant Video, a service similar to Hulu and Netflix, and free shipping into the same deal doesn't seem to make a lot of sense up front.

1167,FDX,"On April 2, it unveiled its Amazon Fire TV, a $99 streaming video set-top box. Recent reports say Amazon will launch a smartphone this summer.
"
1168,FDX,"But despite its continued long-term focus, Amazon delivered strong profit growth in 2013. And analysts expect triple-digit EPS gains over the next three years.The term creative destruction is thrown around a lot, but Amazon truly ushered in a new industry while disrupting several others. It wrote the book on e-commerce, spreading from its bookselling roots into a behemoth that brought down brick-and-mortar rivals with superior service and execution, to linking new and unlikely businesses in novel ways. Amazon (AMZN), founded in 1994 by CEO Jeff Bezos in his garage, started as an online bookseller and sold its first book in July 1995. Customers could get rare books they couldn't find anywhere else and current titles more cheaply than from rivals.The e-commerce firm expanded into electronics, toys, music and home improvement products and went public in 1997.Amazon sales exploded from well under $1 million in 1995 to $2.76 billion in 2000 and $74.5 billion last year.Shares leapt 8,526% from their 1997 low to their initial December 1999 peak.Building The BrandAmazon wasn't making money — but that was the plan. Bezos realized from the start that building the brand, infrastructure and market share was crucial, so his strategy was to forgo profits for years.""There's nothing about our model that can't be copied over time,"" Bezos told Inc. magazine in 1997. ""But you know, McDonald's got copied. And it still built a huge, multibillion-dollar company. A lot of it comes down to the brand name. Brand names are more important online than they are in the physical world.""While Bezos is hailed as a visionary now, nobody wanted to hear about money-losing Internet companies after the dot-com bust. Losses continued to mount while sales growth slowed to 13% in 2011.Shares crashed 95% from December 1999 to October 2001.In 2000, Ronald Unkefer, CEO of West Coast electronics retailer Good Guys, told IBD that he wasn't worried about Amazon, saying that Amazon and consumer electronics don't mix.But Amazon sales growth ramped back up and the company soon became profitable.Within a few years, Good Guys was out of business, followed by Circuit City and bookseller Borders.

"
1198,FDX,"Rather than finish Marshall's rise, it perpetuated it.
"
1199,FDX,"Pershing admired the young officer's boldness and brought him to headquarters. Marshall would go on to become the top Allied commander during World War II, secretary of state at the start of the Cold War, and defense secretary during the Korean War.

"
1201,FDX,"Marshall (1880-1959) grew up in rural Uniontown, Pa. His father had moved there in the 1870s, after fighting for the Union, to make a fortune in coke, a coal-derived fuel for iron smelting.

Marshall: Soldier-Statesman of the American Century,"" told IBD. ""There were 10,000 applications for 142 new second lieutenants, and Marshall had an 84.8% average largely due to his perfect scores in the heavily weighted categories of physique and moral character and background.""
"
1205,FDX,"From 1902 to 1916, Marshall served as a junior officer in overseas posts, impressing his peers and superiors on the way to becoming a captain at age 35.
"
1206,FDX,"After the Spanish-American War of 1898, the Army's infantry and cavalry school at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., became a hotbed of reform, and Marshall studied and taught classes there from 1908 to 1910.

"
1209,FDX,"Rising to colonel, Marshall played a key role in planning the American offensive in the Meuse-Argonne sector of France in September 1918. He helped direct 220,000 troops off the front line, sending in 600,000 while delivering 3,000 artillery pieces and 900,000 tons of supplies, an unprecedented logistical feat.

1211,FDX,"""However, when Pershing became Army chief of staff in 1921, Marshall had the opportunity to interact with civilian authorities and meet and learn from individuals in both military and political spheres, giving him an education unavailable in any other position,"" said Stoler. ""Pershing was often away and Marshall assumed more and more responsibilities.""
"
1212,FDX,"Toward Another War
"
1213,FDX,"By the time Pershing retired in 1924, budget cuts had brought the Army head count to 132,000 because not many people thought another war would hit America.

1214,FDX,"Marshall was one of the survivors, reverting to lieutenant colonel and becoming assistant commandant of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Ga., in 1928.
"
1215,FDX,"With 150 future generals passing through the school as students and 50 as instructors in his four years there, Marshall virtually created the World War II high command.
"
1216,FDX,"In the summer of 1938, Marshall was ordered to D.C. to head up the war plans division for Malin Craig, who had replaced Douglas MacArthur as Army chief of staff.
"
1217,FDX,"President Franklin Roosevelt saw that Marshall was unafraid to speak truth to power. A year later he promoted Marshall, by now a three-star general, over 33 more senior officers to be a four-star Army chief of staff.
"
1218,FDX,"The new military boss put his boot down hard, relieving commanders who had the wrong mindset or were incompetent, ultimately forcing out 600 before the U.S. entered World War II in 1941.
"
1219,FDX,"Otherwise, the Army was hardly ready after Pearl Harbor, with only 197,000 soldiers. Marshall oversaw a boom to 8.3 million troops in three years — doing so with directness in his dealings with Congress.
"
1220,FDX,"""Marshall's willingness to tell the unvarnished truth, even when it hurt the case he was trying to make, made him trusted by everyone,"" said Brian Shaw, president of the Marshall Foundation in Lexington, Va.

"
1230,FDX,"""Marshall's rise came at a time when the Army needed more professional management, and his lessons are applicable to business today,"" said Shaw. ""Among other traits, he was very good at analyzing current trends to be able to predict the next crisis. Everyone from FedEx (FDX) founder Fred Smith to leadership studies pioneer Warren Bennis has urged managers to emulate his example.""
"
1231,FDX,"Stoler wrote: ""Marshall's leadership qualities, self-control, sense of honor and duty, and apparent lack of personal ambition were so extraordinary that virtually every individual with whom he worked commented on them in hushed tones of veneration. His character and accomplishments were so exceptional that he is placed in the company only of George Washington when historical parallels are used.""In 1917, Gen. John Pershing reviewed troops training for World War I, berated their general for incompetence and turned to leave.""George Marshall then did something that could have cost the mere captain his promising career, laying his hand on Pershing's arm and insisting that he be heard out about the hurdles they had faced,"" wrote Thomas Ricks in ""The Generals.""Rather than finish Marshall's rise, it perpetuated it.Pershing admired the young officer's boldness and brought him to headquarters. Marshall would go on to become the top Allied commander during World War II, secretary of state at the start of the Cold War, and defense secretary during the Korean War.Rise In PennsylvaniaMarshall (1880-1959) grew up in rural Uniontown, Pa. His father had moved there in the 1870s, after fighting for the Union, to make a fortune in coke, a coal-derived fuel for iron smelting.A shy boy, George didn't like to study, so his prospects seemed limited. But to prove everyone wrong, he worked hard to qualify for entry into the Virginia Military Institute.Arriving late and weak after a bout with typhoid fever, he found he wasn't any good at drilling. Through self-discipline and practice, however, he mastered it and became the class leader.""Getting a commission was not easy, but he managed to get past numerous guards and obstacles to burst in on a meeting of both the chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee and President McKinley and eventually got his chance to take the exam,"" Mark Stoler, author of ""George C. Marshall: Soldier-Statesman of the American Century,"" told IBD. ""There were 10,000 applications for 142 new second lieutenants, and Marshall had an 84.8% average largely due to his perfect scores in the heavily weighted categories of physique and moral character and background.""From 1902 to 1916, Marshall served as a junior officer in overseas posts, impressing his peers and superiors on the way to becoming a captain at age 35.After the Spanish-American War of 1898, the Army's infantry and cavalry school at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., became a hotbed of reform, and Marshall studied and taught classes there from 1908 to 1910.He had a chance to utilize his knowledge in Europe after America entered World War I in 1917.Continental SurgeRising to colonel, Marshall played a key role in planning the American offensive in the Meuse-Argonne sector of France in September 1918. He helped direct 220,000 troops off the front line, sending in 600,000 while delivering 3,000 artillery pieces and 900,000 tons of supplies, an unprecedented logistical feat.He was so successful as Pershing's aide, he was passed over for promotions that favored officers on the battlefield.""However, when Pershing became Army chief of staff in 1921, Marshall had the opportunity to interact with civilian authorities and meet and learn from individuals in both military and political spheres, giving him an education unavailable in any other position,"" said Stoler. ""Pershing was often away and Marshall assumed more and more responsibilities.""Toward Another WarBy the time Pershing retired in 1924, budget cuts had brought the Army head count to 132,000 because not many people thought another war would hit America.Marshall was one of the survivors, reverting to lieutenant colonel and becoming assistant commandant of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Ga., in 1928.With 150 future generals passing through the school as students and 50 as instructors in his four years there, Marshall virtually created the World War II high command.In the summer of 1938, Marshall was ordered to D.C. to head up the war plans division for Malin Craig, who had replaced Douglas MacArthur as Army chief of staff.President Franklin Roosevelt saw that Marshall was unafraid to speak truth to power. A year later he promoted Marshall, by now a three-star general, over 33 more senior officers to be a four-star Army chief of staff.The new military boss put his boot down hard, relieving commanders who had the wrong mindset or were incompetent, ultimately forcing out 600 before the U.S. entered World War II in 1941.Otherwise, the Army was hardly ready after Pearl Harbor, with only 197,000 soldiers. Marshall oversaw a boom to 8.3 million troops in three years — doing so with directness in his dealings with Congress.""Marshall's willingness to tell the unvarnished truth, even when it hurt the case he was trying to make, made him trusted by everyone,"" said Brian Shaw, president of the Marshall Foundation in Lexington, Va. ""He was also always the best-prepared person at the table, knowing the issues inside and out.""Marshall's lesson is that consistent honesty builds credibility.He was the logical commander for the invasion of Normandy, which would start June 6, 1944, so Roosevelt offered him the job.""His Victorian values refused to allow him to put his self-interest above country, so he told the president to do what was right for the United States,"" said Stoler, who is editing volumes 6 and 7 of ""The Papers of George Catlett Marshall.""

"
1266,FDX,"West Coast ports aren't sitting back. The ports of Los Angeles and nearby Long Beach — the top-two U.S. ports by volume — have multibillion-dollar infrastructure improvements underway to keep their competitive edge. They handle more than 40% of goods that come into the the U.S., most of it from Asia.
"
1267,FDX,"About half of the goods coming into those ports are moved by truck within California and adjoining states such as Nevada and Arizona. But the other half, largely discretionary goods, are taken by rail to the Midwest and points farther east, said Port of L.A. spokesman Phillip Sanfield.
"
1268,FDX,"That 50% of cargo moving farther east is ""at risk"" when larger container ships can use the Panama Canal to travel to East and Gulf ports instead, he said.
"
1269,FDX,"""We take the Panama Canal widening as just another competitive threat,"" Sanfield said. He noted that Canadian and Mex ican ports are chipping away at cargo going into the L.A.-Long Beach port complex.
"
1270,FDX,"Meanwhile, imports from Asia have slowed, flattening the once double-digit volume growth at the Southern California ports to 1% to 2% the last couple of years.
"
1271,FDX,"A wider canal won't ""supercharge the water,"" shortening the time it takes ships to get through, Sanfield says. Transit times from Asia would still be shorter for goods dropped off at West Coast ports and then taken overland to the East Coast than if they were to go through the Panama Canal to East Coast ports.
"
1272,FDX,"Using the canal might be cheaper, but usage fees for the new, wider lane haven't been set yet.
"
1273,FDX,"After the Panama Canal project is finished, shippers ""will optimize delivery to ports on the East Coast and Gulf Coast to get closer to their destinations,"" O'Dell says. That shift — getting closer to end deliveries — will have a more positive impact on truckers than rails, he added.

1297,FDX,"Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal fourth-quarter 2018 results on Jun 19. Notably, the company has beaten estimates in the trailing four quarters, recording an average positive surprise of 8.49%.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered modest third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Non-GAAP earnings of 83 cents per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents. However, revenues of $9.776 billion came almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate figure of $9.771 billion. This represented 6% year-over-year growth in revenues.Expect What?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 94 cents, up 5.6% year over year. The earnings estimates have remained stable in the last 30 days. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $11.2 billion, up roughly 2.3% from the year-ago quarter.Oracle underperformed the industry in the past year. While the stock gained just 3.4%, the industry recorded growth of 38.4%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors Likely to Impact Q4 ResultsSoft outlook for the cloud business remains an overhang for Oracle. Cloud revenues including Software as a service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) are expected to grow between 19% and 23% (17-21% in constant currency), much lower than 32% (29% in constant currency)  reported in the last quarter.Further, higher investments on IaaS platform will affect gross margin expansion in the near term.Oracle recently announced the accessibility of its next-generation Oracle Cloud Platform services. The move is aimed at providing required programmability, performance and flexibility for rapid service deployment in the cloud economy. We believe, the company’s cloud platform will be one of its key revenue generating businesses in the to-be-reported quarter.The latest addition to its cloud platforms reflects Oracle’s focus on expanding cloud computing product portfolio inorganically. The strategy will enable the company to scale up its cloud operations much faster. Despite expanding its foothold in the cloud space, the presence of already established players like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Microsoft in both the PaaS and IaaS may remain a potential headwind.Going forward, the next-generation autonomous database launched by Oracle, which is supported by machine learning, is a key catalyst.Oracle is gaining traction in its cloud business as evident from its third-quarter fiscal 2018 performance, which benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud revenues (16% of total revenues compared with 13% in the year-ago quarter) advanced 32% to $1.57 billion.Moreover, total cloud and on-premise software revenues increased 8% to $7.98 billion. We believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total cloud revenues is currently pegged at $1.71 billion, while total software revenues are currently pegged at $9.27 billion, up 9.8%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Oracleis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Oracle’s Earnings ESP is -0.35%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Oracle currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) which when combined with earnings ESP of -0.35% makes surprise prediction difficult. As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.32% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1298,FDX,"FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results, after the closing bell on Jun 19.In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, earnings of $3.72 per share comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.08. The bottom-line figure also surged 58.3% on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by higher revenues.We expect this S&P 500 company to outperform earnings estimates in the quarter-to-be reported as well. Strong e-commerce growth is likely to aid results. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings moved north 3.5% over the last 30 days, reflecting investor optimism surrounding the stock.Also, FedEx’s price performance in the last three months has been impressive. While the stock has gained 6.3%, the Zacks S&P 500 composite increased 1%.Three-Month Price Comparison  Given this backdrop, let’s delve deeper to unearth the factors that are likely to influence the company’s fourth-quarter results:We expect the company to deliver solid results in the fiscal fourth quarter, courtesy of e-commerce growth. Earlier in 2018, FedEx acquired P2P to boosts its e-commerce portfolio.  In fact, growth is expected across all major divisions of the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at the FedEx Express (including TNT Express) division stands at $10,056 million, much higher than the year-ago figure of $7,180 million. For the Ground and the Freight divisions, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at a respective $5,009 million and $1,859 million above the year-ago figures of $4,678 million and $1,696 million.Volume expansion and higher base rates are likely to boost results at the Ground and the Express units. The freight unit should benefit from average daily less-than-truckload shipment growth. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, the company envisions adjusted operating margin (minus TNT Express integration expenses) at the FedEx Express segment between 9.9% and 10.4%. At FedEx’s Ground and Freight segments, the metric (on a reported basis) is estimated between 17-17.5% and 8-9%, respectively.Lower tax rates following the introduction of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act late last year, are also expected to boost the bottom line in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. However, headwinds like high costs might hurt the bottom line in the same period. We expect the company to provide a detailed guidance for fiscal 2019 on the conference call.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our quantitative model too shows that FedEx is likely to beat earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.Zacks ESP: FedEx has an Earnings ESP of +0.32% as the Most Accurate estimate exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.71 by 2 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: FedEx carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings moved north 34.4% on a year-over-year basis, mainly owing to e-commerce growth. The same for sales is projected at $17.19 billion, up 9.3% year over year.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may also consider United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) and Ryder System, Inc. (R  -  Free Report), since our model shows that all these stocks possess the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their next releases.United Continental has an Earnings ESP of +1.21% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on Jul 17.Union Pacific has an Earnings ESP of +0.80% and a Zacks Rank #3.

1299,FDX,"For most folks, an earnings season means the 4 to 6 week period at the end of each calendar quarter when earnings announcements dominate market headlines. For us, however, who have to monitor and record each and every earnings release, the definition and duration of each earnings season isn’t that simple. Take for example, the 8 S&P 500 members coming out with quarterly results this week.Since we are still a couple of weeks away from the end of the June quarter, most folks would assume that all of these reports represent the tail of the 2018 Q1 earnings season. The reality is that all of these reports get counted as part of the Q2 earnings season. For example, the Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) reports on Wednesday are for those companies’ fiscal quarters that ended in May, which will form part of our Q2 earnings tally. Looked at this way, the Q2 earnings season actually got underway with the Costco (COST  -  Free Report) and AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report) earnings releases with the tally reaching almost two dozen S&P 500 members by the time the big banks (unofficially) kick-off the earnings season on July 13th.The weekly reporting calendar (below) for the S&P 500 index clearly shows that we still have another four weeks to go before the Q2 earnings season really takes off.Expectations for Q2Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +18.2% from the same period last year on +7.9% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors. This would follow +24.3% earnings growth in 2018 Q1 on +7.2% revenues, the highest growth in almost 7 years.The chart below plots the evolution of Q2 earnings growth expectations. As you can see, the growth rate has ticked up a bit, but nowhere near the impressive positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season.A big part of the positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season reflected the direct impact of the tax law changes, which was obviously a one-off development. Had all positive revisions been a result of tax law changes, we would have seen only EPS estimates go up, with no changes to revenue estimates. But that wasn’t the case, as revenue estimates had gone up as well, which raised our hopes that the aggregate revisions trend had finally turned positive after many years being in the other direction.But as the chart above shows, we didn’t see much in positive revisions. In other words, while the overall growth picture remains very strong – there is no other way to describe +18.2% quarterly earnings growth - there is not much improvement in expectations for Q2 and beyond. The recent strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar and questions about global growth will likely serve as incremental negatives for folks like us monitoring the aggregate revisions trend.This flattish aggregate revisions trend notwithstanding, June quarter estimates have actually modestly ticked down for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors and gone up for 7 sectors. The sectors enjoying positive revisions in the aggregate include Technology, Energy, Medical, Industrial Products, Basic Materials, Business Services, and Retail. Estimates have gone up the most for the Energy sector, reflecting momentum in oil prices. Excluding the gains made in the Energy sector, the aggregate revisions picture for the S&P 500 index would be in negative territory.The table below shows the summary picture for Q2, contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q14 (please note that we have not officially closed the books on Q1 yet, as 2 index members still have to report quarterly results).The chart below compares current Q2 earnings growth expectations with what was actually achieved in the preceding 5 quarters and what is expected in the following 3 quarters.Please note that while the Q2 growth pace represents a deceleration from the preceding quarter’s impressive level, the overall level of total earnings is in record territory, as the chart below shows.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

1300,FDX,"One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report). This is because this security in the Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective.This is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board. This is arguably taking place in the Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 30 out of more than 250 industries, suggesting it is well-positioned from this perspective, especially when compared to other segments out there.Meanwhile, FedEx is actually looking pretty good on its own too. The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month, suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm’s prospects in both the short and long term.FedEx Corporation Price and Consensus FedEx Corporation Price and Consensus | FedEx Corporation QuoteIn fact, over the past month, current quarter estimates have risen from $5.52 per share to $5.71 per share, while current year estimates have risen from $14.84 per share to $15.13 per share. This has helped FDX to earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), further underscoring the company’s solid position.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So, if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry, consider FedEx. Not only is its industry currently in the top third, but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late, suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1302,FDX,"In a shareholder-friendly move, FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) announced a hike in its dividend payout. This, in turn, reflects the company’s intention to utilize free cash for enhancing shareholders’ returns.Notably, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 30% to 65 cents a share (or $2.60 annually) from 50 cents (or $2 annually). The new dividend, which has been approved by the company’s board of directors, will be paid on Jul 9, 2018 to stockholders on record as of Jun 25. The dividend yield based on the new payout and the Jul 11 closing market price is approximately 0.99%.Apart from highlighting FedEx’s commitment to create value for shareholders, this hiked dividend underscores its strong financial condition and bright prospects. Also, a look at the past records reveals this Memphis, TN-based company’s stable dividend payment history.We remind investors that FedEx’s rival, United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report), had also raised its quarterly dividend by approximately 10% in February 2018. Following the hike, the company's quarterly dividend payout stands at 91 cents per share ($3.64 on an annualized basis).As investors prefer an income generating stock, a high dividend paying one is much coveted. Needless to say, investors are always on the lookout for companies that have a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments.Shareholder-Friendly Announcement Precedes Q4 ReleaseThe timing of the dividend hike announcement at FedEx is very appropriate and comes as the company is gearing up to unveil its fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 19.We expect the company to deliver solid results in the fiscal fourth quarter driven by e-commerce growth. Also, FedEx’s Ground unit is expected to perform well backed by volume expansion and higher base rates. While releasing its fiscal third-quarter results in March, the company stated that it expects adjusted operating margin (minus TNT Express integration expenses) between 17% and 17.5% at its Ground unit.Our quantitative model too shows that FedEx is likely to beat earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise..Zacks ESP: FedEx has an Earnings ESP of +0.32% as the Most Accurate estimate exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.71 per share by 2 cents.

1303,FDX,"The following excerpt is from this week's Earnings Trends.  To see the full report, please click here.  Q4 Earnings Season Gets Underway
"
1304,FDX,"We are still a couple of weeks away from getting into the heart of 2013 Q4 earnings season. But the reporting cycle has gotten underway, with results from 18 S&P 500 companies out already. Even though these early reports from companies with fiscal quarters ending in November include a few industry leaders like Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), we can’t draw any firm conclusions from what we have seen thus far.
"
1305,FDX,"The real Q4 earnings story is not about the 18 companies that have reported already, but the remaining 482 companies. And as we have been seeing repeatedly over the past year or so, estimates have come down sharply as the quarter unfolded. The current expected Q4 total earnings growth for the S&P 500 of +6.3% is down quite a bit over the last three months, as the chart below shows
"
1306,FDX,"The actual earnings growth rate in Q4 will most certainly be higher than the +6.3% expected at this stage, a function of management’s highly refined expectations management game (more on that a little later). But even this growth rate will be the highest quarterly growth pace of 2013, as the chart below shows.
"
1307,FDX,"The chart above is a picture of accelerating growth. But looks could be deceiving, as the stronger-looking Q4 growth pace is primarily a function of easy comparisons, particularly for the Finance sector. Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) has a roughly $2 billion positive swing in its total earnings and many insurers like Chubb (CB), Travelers (TRV  -  Free Report) and others don’t have to deal with the type of catastrophic losses they suffered in the 2012 East Coast storms. Outside of Finance, total earnings growth for the S&P 500 drops to +3.5%.Key Points
"
1308,FDX,"Total earnings for the 18 S&P 500 companies that have reported results are up +3.2%, with 55.6% beating earnings expectations. Revenues for these companies are up +5.4%, with a revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 66.7%.
"
1309,FDX,"Total Q4 earnings for all S&P 500 companies, combing the 18 that have reported with the 482 still to come, are expected to be up +6.3%, which reflects +1.5% revenue growth and modest gains in margins. This compares to +5.1% earnings growth in Q3.
"
1310,FDX,"Easy comparisons, particularly for the Finance sector, account for a big part of the Q4 growth. Total earnings for the Finance sector are expected to be up +20.1%. Outside of Finance, total earnings growth drops to +3.5%.  
"
1311,FDX,"Technology sector earnings are expected to be flat from the year-earlier period, while earnings in the Energy, Medical, and Staples sectors are expected to be below the year-earlier level.
"
1312,FDX,"Earnings growth is expected to accelerate this year, with full-year 2014 earnings expected to be up +9.8% after the expected +4.6% growth in 2013. Total earnings are expected to increase a further +11% in 2015.
"
1313,FDX,"Guidance has overwhelmingly been negative in recent quarters and the trend from pre-announcements in the run up to the Q4 reporting season doesn’t appear to be much different either. It will be interesting to see if the recently quarterly trend of negative guidance will remain in place this quarter as well.To see the Full Earnings Trends PDF, please click here.

1326,FDX,"United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens.In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.54%. It reported earnings of $1.32, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30. Earnings increased 3.9% on a year-over-year basis. Notably, the results were aided by the substantial increase in operating profits at the Supply Chain and Freight unit.Moreover, revenues improved 6.2% to $15,315 million from the year-ago quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,179.5 million.Let’s see what awaits the company in the second quarter.Factors Likely to Influence this QuarterWe expect the company’s bottom line to be hurt by escalated costs in the quarter.  As of now, high package delivery costs have been hurting United Parcel for some time, and the to-be-reported quarter is likely to be no different.Moreover, United Parcel, like its rival FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report), is leaving no stone unturned to expand its presence. Though positive on such efforts, we believe that expansion related expenses might also drag down second-quarter earnings.Foreign currency-related headwinds are expected to hurt the quarter’s results too. Additionally, unfavorable product mix and weakness in industrial production might dampen the company’s performance.In fact, the negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the 1.4% decline in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings over the last three months. However,  the company’s efforts to reward shareholders consistently through buybacks and dividend payouts are impressive.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that United Parcel will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: United Parcel has an Earnings ESP of -0.69% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.45 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.46. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: United Parcel carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is, we caution you against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.United Parcel Service, Inc.

1327,FDX,"On Monday, shares are of transportation and logistics company FedEx Corp. (FDX  -  Free Report) are falling, down roughly 3% to $212.56 per share in mid-morning trading after it said the Petya cyberattack that occurred last month would negatively impact its fiscal 2018 results.In a securities filing, FedEx said that the global cyberattack known as Petya has significantly affected its TNT Express business, which operates throughout the Middle East and Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and South America. The company said TNT Express customers are still experiencing widespread service delays, but added that no data breach or data loss to third parties is known as of today.Petya was a massive ransomware attack back in June that spread rapidly through networks that used Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) Windows. The attack started in Ukraine, but wreaked havoc all over the globe, and lead to thousands of PCs and data being locked up and held for ransom.""Although we cannot currently quantify the amounts, we have experienced loss of revenue due to decreased volumes at TNT Express and incremental costs associated with the implementation of contingency plans and the remediation of affected systems,"" FedEx said in a statement.“In addition to financial consequences, the cyber-attack may materially impact our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in future periods,” the company continued.FedEx is up about 16.7% year-to-date, and remains a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank. The company reports its first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on September 19. Zacks expects FedEx to report earnings of $3.19 per share and sales of $15.4 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 9.98% and 5%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

"
1329,FDX,"With only a few earnings reports still to come, the Q1 earnings season is essentially over. The focus will shift in the coming days to the 2015 Q2 earnings season, as companies with fiscal quarters ending in May start coming out with results. We count these companies, which includes such major players like Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), as part of our Q2 tally. By the time Alcoa (AA) reports on July 8th, we will have seen Q2 results from about two dozen S&P members that have fiscal quarters ending in May.
"
1330,FDX,"Estimates for the current period have come down quite a bit since the quarter got underway.  This decrease is in-line with the trend that we have been seeing quarter after quarter for more than two years now. The chart below shows what has happened to 2015 Q2 earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies since the start of the year.
"
1331,FDX,"As was the case in Q1, the Energy sector remains the biggest drag on Q2 estimates. Total Energy sector earnings are expected to be down -65.1% from the same period last year on -40.6% lower revenues. If we exclude the Energy sector from Q2 estimates, total earnings for the S&P 500 index would be barely in the positive territory (up +0.3%). The growth picture isn’t expected to improve in any meaningful way in the coming quarters either, as the chart below shows.Q1 Scorecard (as of June 4th, 2015)
"
1332,FDX,"Total earnings for the 498 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up +2.4% on -3.3% revenues, with 62.0% beating EPS estimates and only 42.4% coming ahead of top-line expectations.
"
1333,FDX,"As we have stated repeatedly in this space since the start of the Q1 reporting cycle, this is weak performance compared to what we have seen from the same group of 498 S&P 500 members in other recent periods. (Please note that we provide the scorecard for the Russell 2000 index on page 16 of the detailed report).
"
1334,FDX,"The two side-by-side charts below give a historical context to the results thus far – by comparing the Q1 earnings & revenue growth rates (left-hand side chart) and earnings & revenue beat ratios (right-hand side chart) with what these same companies achieved in the preceding quarter as well as the 4-quarter average.
"
1335,FDX,"Three things stand out as we look at the results thus farFirst, the revenue weakness is very notable. We knew that growth will be problematic in Q1, so the weak revenue growth rate of -3.3% compared to other recent periods isn’t that surprising. But the very low proportion of companies beating revenue estimates is surprising and likely indicative that the growth backdrop has been even weaker than what was reflected in consensus estimates.Second, the earnings growth rate (+2.4%) is also weak relative to what we saw from the same group of companies in 2014 Q4 and the 4-quarter average. While the Finance sector has been a positive growth contributor, the Energy sector’s impact has been in the opposite direction. Excluding contribution of these two sectors, the Q1 growth picture still compares to unfavorably other recent periods, as the right hand-side chart below shows.  Third, as has been the norm in recent quarters, management guided lower for the current and following quarters. As a result, estimates for the current quarter, which had fallen quite a bit already in solidarity with the Q1 estimate cuts, came down even more over the last couple of months.
"
1336,FDX,"The dollar issue has added to the Energy sector’s woes and some concerns about the U.S. economic picture in bringing down this year’s estimates. Current consensus estimates show earnings growth for the S&P 500 to be in the negative for the first three quarters of the year, with the growth rate for the full-year now modestly in the negative. The expectation is that the growth picture starts improving in the last quarter of the year, with the growth pace ramping up to double-digit rates in 2016.Note: Want more articles from this author?

1348,FDX,"Shares of FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) have surged 31.9% in a year, outperforming the industry’s 21.1% increase. Reasons Behind the Price RiseStrong growth of e-commerce is a huge positive for FedEx. To this end, the company acquired P2P for £92 million in March, thereby strengthening its e-commerce portfolio.The company’s impressive performance during the holiday season is another uptick. This was attributable to expanded package volumes. Notably, the company hired more than 50,000 seasonal workers to meet the swelling demand.The new tax law, which reduces the corporate tax rate significantly, has been aiding FedEx for a while now. Moreover, the lowered tax rate was the primary reason for the company’s lifted projection for fiscal 2018 earnings. The company anticipates earnings per share (excluding TNT Express integration expenses and certain other items) in the range of $15-$15.40, higher than the previous forecast of $12.70-$13.30 in the period. Other factors responsible for this upside were foreign tax benefits from international corporate structure and a better operating performance.The company’s initiatives to reward shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks are also encouraging. In June 2017, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 25% to 50 cents a share (or $2 annually) from 40 cents (or $1.60 annually). We believe that this dividend hike not only highlights FedEx’s commitment to create value for shareholders but also stresses the company’s strong financial position and confidence in its business prospects.In the wake of the new tax law, we expect a drive in such investor-friendly activities. Huge savings from the slashed tax rate will also likely boost cash flow. Thus, the company will have more cash in hand to fund these moves.The company’s decreased capital expenditure for fiscal 2018 will further contribute to the positive scenario. This is because lesser capital expenses lead to more free cash flow (difference between operating cash flow and capital expenses). Notably, capital expenses are projected at $5.8 billion in fiscal 2018, down $100 million from the earlier guidance.Zacks Rank & Key PicksFedEx carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report), Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) and GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report). While Expeditors sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), SkyWest and GATX carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1349,FDX,"Shares of both FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) have fallen victim to the latest market-wide sell-off. However, this recent downturn isn’t likely to scare off many value investors, and it might actually make stocks like these two shipping and delivery powers look even more attractive.FedEx and UPS have long dominated the industry that they helped revolutionize, which is now set to grow based on the expansion of e-commerce and increased demand for extremely fast shipping. The companies do face competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and others, but the two legacy giants offer both stability and value, which look even more attractive amid this newly volatile market.FedEx and UPS also seem to attract similar buy-and-hold investors. With that said, these same investors likely understand the value of a diverse portfolio. This means they might only want to pick one of these two shipping stocks.So which of these stocks is the better buy right now? Let’s take a closer look.ValuationTraditional value investors love to look at the price-to-earnings ratio to determine great buying opportunities. After all, buying a stock makes one a partial owner of that company, so investors are inherently interested in profitability.Here is a look at the Forward P/E trend for FDX and UPS over the last year:One of the first things to note here is that UPS consistently traded at a premium to FDX over the last year. But this changed in early February, when investors can see FDX jump above its counterpart. This quick transition suggests that investors have reason to believe that FedEx is worthy of a premium over UPS going forward, where they previously thought UPS deserved to be the more expensive stock.Still, investors who are on the hunt for value should consider both of these stocks, as they are trading relatively in line with the “Transportation - Air Freight Market” industry’s average Forward P/E of 13.8.PerformanceValue investors should also be interested in a stock’s recent price performance. For instance, if a stock has sold off significantly, its lower valuation might speak to a greater problem that has forced investors to flee.Check out how FDX and UPS have performed since this time last year:As we can see, FedEx outpaced UPS for almost a full year. Then, in early February, we notice a huge divergence in share price, where UPS plummets while FDX dips. FedEx was also able to recover amid the recent downturn, while UPS currently rests near a 52-week low. These moves also help to explain why investors quickly became willing to pay a slight premium for FDX.Zacks RankWe demonstrated that both of FDX and UPS are relatively intriguing picks, but the best value plays are undervalued companies that also boast strong Zacks Ranks. In this case, both stocks are once again neck and neck, as FedEx and UPS are currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks.However, the proven Zacks Rank system puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions. And this seems to give the edge to FDX.Within the past 60 days, we have seen 11 revisions to FDX’s full-year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement to the upside. Meanwhile, UPS has earned five upward revisions along with seven downward revisions.With all this said, it seems that FedEx looks like the more attractive stock based on its momentum, positive analyst sentiment, and attractive valuation.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1350,FDX,"In a bid to strengthen its e-commerce portfolio, leading package delivery company FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of U.K.-based P2P Mailing Limited for £92 million. The earlier P2P offered customers unique last-mile delivery options. The company, prior to being acquired, provided parcel delivery services to more than 200 countries.P2P will operate under the FedEx Cross Border unit from now on. FedEx Cross Border operates under FedEx Trade Networks, Inc. (FTN), which has been operational since Mar 1. The decision is aimed at helping the company gain from the e-commerce boom.With e-commerce growing by leaps and bounds, it is natural that FedEx is looking to tap the opportunity. In fact, the strong growth of e-commerce is a huge positive for the company. On the back of such exponential growth, FedEx did extremely well in the holiday season. In fact, the company had left no stone unturned to cash in on the opportunity, hiring more than 50,000 seasonal workers to meet the surge in demand. FedEx’s rival United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) also saw an impressive holiday season.E-commerce Growth Drives StockShares of FedEx have done impressively well on rising e-commerce demand. The stock has gained 22.7% in a year’s time, substantially outperforming the 6.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Consequently, FedEx’s decision to boost its e-commerce portfolio through the P2P buyout seems to be a prudent one.New Tax Law — Another PositiveThe new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), which slashes the corporate tax rate significantly, is a huge positive for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold ) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The tax cut has primarily backed the company raised earnings projection for fiscal 2018. For the fiscal, the company anticipates earnings per share (excluding TNT Express integration expenses and certain other items) of $15-$15.40, higher than the previous projection of $12.70-$13.30.Apart from the significant drop in corporate tax rate, the new law now allows these companies to deduct capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of occurrence. This aspect hugely favors FedEx as it incurs substantially high capital expenditures. The company’s annual tax bill will not be significantly lower, courtesy of the higher deductions.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act might also ramp up shareholder-friendly activities (dividend payments and buybacks) at FedEx. It is encouraging to note that transportation stocks like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) have already announced dividend hikes this year.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1351,FDX,"Shares of FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) declined 5.1% to $236.27 on Mar 22, despite reporting better-than-expected revenues and earnings per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, on Mar 20. This is the biggest one-day decline for the stock since March 2013.Why the Decline?Following President Trump’s order to levy tariffs on at least $50 billion in Chinese imports, shares of this Memphis, TN-based package-delivery company declined despite reporting better-than-expected results in the fiscal third quarter due to fears of trade contracting.FedEx’s chief executive officer, Fred Smith is also not too impressed by Trump’s policy to impose tariff on Chinese imports. Smith has stated that the measures might be detrimental to the economic health of the United States.The fact that FedEx has a significant presence in China has given rise to fears of significant revenue loss due to the weakening of trade, following the tariffs. In fact, shares of its rival, United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) also declined to the tune of 3% on Mar 22.However, FedEx’s worries are greater since its exposure to Asia (including China) is greater than UPS, according to Bloomberg. We note that FedEx opened a hub in Shanghai in January 2018 to strengthen its presence in China.Apart from the trade-related fears, FedEx was also in the news after a parcel recently exploded at one of its facilities in Texas. Even though FedEx’s Ground and Freight units performed well in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, performance at its Express air-freight unit raises concerns.Zacks Rank & Key PicksFedEx carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Transportation sector are American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1352,FDX,"Market indexes are blossoming over the past week or so, even as global uncertainties begin to pile up regarding trade tensions with China and other important commerce partners, leadership issues in the U.K. ahead of tomorrow’s NATO meeting in Brussels, and elsewhere. But there is a bright, shining beacon markets appear to be attracted to currently: Q2 earnings season.Q2 may be among the strongest we’ve seen in our entire multi-year economic recovery (though Q1’s +24.6% year over year earnings growth will be tough to surmount), with a possible 4-handle on GDP for the quarter expected by a plurality of analysts later this month. Results from companies on the S&P 500 have already begun to start off this earnings season with a bang — companies like Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) outperformed estimates in past weeks — and expectations are big coming into the heart of Q2 reporting.We see at the end of this week some of the biggest banks in the country reporting, including JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report). And, while year over year growth is expected to be substantial for these and companies like them, the Finance sector overall is underperforming the overall market. This has more to do with interest rate level questions and concerns about the yield spread between the 2-year and 10-year bond than the machinations of the companies themselves.For a comprehensive view of banks’ performance and what to look for in Q2, check out Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian’s latest Earnings Preview: What’s Keeping Bank Stocks Down?Ahead of today’s opening bell, Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) put out a mixed earnings report, beating on the bottom line by a dime to $1.61 per share — up 7% in constant currency terms year over year. Revenues came in a smidge beneath expectations at $16.1 billion for the quarter, but shares are currently up about 2 1/2% in today’s pre-market.

This company, over the past two quarters has averaged a positive earnings surprise over 450%. Tomorrow, we look for results on Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), Fastenal (FAST  -  Free Report) and AngioDynamics (ANGO  -  Free Report).

1353,FDX,"Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Brazilian aerospace conglomerate Embraer S.A. (ERJ  -  Free Report) announced on Thursday that the two companies are set to enter an agreement that will see Boeing own the controlling stake of a new multibillion-dollar venture. Speculation surrounding a deal had circulated for months, so now let’s take a look at how it might benefit Boeing in its fight against Airbus (EADSY  -  Free Report) and evaluate BA stock to see if it is worth buying at the moment.The Deal  Boeing and Embraer are forming a $4.75 billion joint venture, with Boeing owning 80% and Embraer holding  20%, of a partnership controlling the Brazilian company’s commercial aircraft and services business. The non-binding agreement is expected to close by late 2019 following the necessary regulatory approval process and is projected to be accretive to Boeing's earnings per share starting in 2020.The deal is expected to help Boeing bolster its smaller jetliner business after Airbus finalized its deal with Bombardier Inc. to take over its C Series class earlier this year. Boeing and Airbus have effectively become a duopoly in the market for planes with more than 150 seats. Now, the Chicago-headquartered company is ready to dive further into single-aisle jetliners and expand its offerings of 100-seat planes.Embraer is known for its regional passenger planes that seat between 70 and 100 people and is one of Bombardier’s main competitors. “The agreement with Boeing will create the most important strategic partnership in the aerospace industry, strengthening both companies’ leadership in the global market,"" Embraer CEO Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva said in a joint statement.Boeing’s Embraer deal will help the company continue to compete against its only real rival on a new battlefront, while also preparing Boeing to fight off new threats emerging from China, Japan, and Russia.Shares of Embraer sunk over 10% through morning trading on Thursday as investors vented their frustration that the company was unable to grab a larger deal from Boeing after talks began last year. Meanwhile, Boeing stock fluctuated after the deal and was up marginally at mid-day.Price Movement & ValuationWith the highlights of Boeing’s partnership to bolster its smaller jetliner business covered, let’s move onto the company’s recent price movement and current valuation picture to help investors understand where the giant, valued at over $193 billion, stands at the moment. Shares of Boeing have surged over 215% during the last five years, which tops the S&P 500’s roughly 70% climb. Much of this strong growth has come over the last few years, with BA up 161% since July 2016—outpacing Airbus’112% surge. BA stock is also up 65% over the last year. However, shares of Boeing have gained only 12% in 2018 on the back of trade war speculation that has pushed its shares down 10% in the last month to rest roughly 12% below their 52-week high.The recent downturn has made Boeing’s valuation picture look even more solid. Boeing is currently trading at 21X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a premium to the S&P’s 16.7X and Airbus’ 19.2X. With that said, BA has traded as high as 30.6X over the last year, with a one-year median of 23.5X. Investors will also see that Boeing stock is currently trading almost directly in line with its year-long low of 20.5X. Furthermore, Boeing has traded at a premium compared to the index and Airbus for years, but BA also looks rather attractive at its current levels.Growth Outlook Looking ahead, Boeing has an order backlog of about 6,000 jets valued at more than $400 billion. The company’s backlog is made up of over of 4,600 737 airplanes. The company also noted that FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) has placed firm orders for 100 767s.Boeing is projected to see its Q2 revenues climb by 3.3% to touch $23.49 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Looking ahead to the full-year, Boeing’s revenues are expected to climb by 5.2% to touch $98.2 billion.Moving onto the other end of the income statement, Boeing’s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to pop by 33.7% to reach $3.41 per share, while its full-year EPS figure is expected to expand by 21.8%.Bottom LineBoeing is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and boasts an “A” for Growth in our Style Scores system. On top of that, BA has earned two upward earnings estimate revisions against zero downgrades for both its current full-year and the following year, all within the last 60 days.Investors can also buy Boeing stock at a bit of a discount at the moment compared to where it was just a few months ago. And let’s not forget the company is a dividend payer, with a yield of 2.05%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

1354,FDX,"Jobs in Focus as Q4 Earnings Reports Trickle In
"
1355,FDX,"The focus this week is justifiably on the labor market data, particularly the government jobs report coming out on Friday. The overall tone of recent U.S. economic data has been favorable, prompting positive revisions to Q4 GDP growth. Given this underlying momentum, it is perhaps reasonable to look for a positive surprise to the expected 190K ‘headline’ jobs reading on Friday. Also of interest in the economic docket will be minutes of the Fed’s December that resulted in the ‘Taper’ announcement.
"
1356,FDX,"The labor market will no doubt be the big subject this week, but the drumbeat for the start of the 2013 Q4 earnings season will also get underway this week. We only have 6 S&P 500 companies reporting results this week, including Alcoa (AA), Monsanto (MON), and Family Dollar (FDO), with the full list of companies reporting in the week totaling about 40. The Q4 earnings season will get in the spotlight the following week when J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) will report results.
"
1357,FDX,"The 6 S&P 500 companies reporting this week aren’t (officially) the first Q4 earning releases. Companies with fiscal quarters ending in November start reporting in mid-December and get counted as part of the Q4 earnings season. By this definition, we already have seen reports from 18 S&P 500 members, including such industry bellwethers as FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report).
"
1358,FDX,"Here is the Scorecard for the 18 S&P 500 companies that have already reported Q4 results, as of Friday, January 3, 2014. Total earnings for these 18 companies (not EPS, median or otherwise) are up +3.2% from the same period last year, with a ‘beat ratio’ of 55.6% and a median surprise of +1.5%. Total revenues are up +5.4%, with an impressive revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 66.7% and a median surprise of +1.3%.
"
1359,FDX,"In comparative terms, the earnings growth for these 18 companies is below what these same companies reported in recent quarters, while performance on the revenue front compares favorably to the recent past.
"
1360,FDX,"But the Q4 earnings season’s story isn’t about the few companies that have reported, but rather about the still-to-come reports. To that point, the ‘composite’ picture for Q4, where we combine the results from the 18 companies that have reported already with the 488 still to come, is for growth rate of +6.3%. As has been the case at the start of recent quarterly earnings cycles, the current +6.3% growth rate for Q4 represents a sharp drop over the last three months, as the chart below shows. 
"
1361,FDX,"This negative revisions behavior is hardly unusual as we have been repeatedly seeing this pattern play out in recent quarters. Companies have been overwhelmingly guiding lower, prompting analysts to cut estimates for the following quarter. The revisions behavior ahead of the Q3 earnings season was no different and most of the same sectors have experienced negative revisions this time around as well. The ‘regulars’ on the negative estimate revisions beat include Technology, Industrials, and Energy. Construction and Aerospace suffered negative revisions as well, while estimates for Basic Materials went up.
"
1362,FDX,"The earnings growth expected in Q4 at this stage of the reporting cycle is the highest that we have seen in any of the last few quarters. A big reason for that is easy comparisons, as 2012 Q4 represented the lowest quarterly earnings total for the S&P 500 in the last six quarters, with the comps particularly easy for the Finance sector, helping produce the sector’s impressive +20.1% growth rate.
"
1363,FDX,"Within the Finance sector, the comparisons are particularly easy for the insurance industry – the industry alone accounts for more than a quarter of the sector’s total earnings – given the impact on the industry’s profitability from the East Coast storms in late 2012. Total earnings for the insurance industry are expected to be up more than +40% in Q4, with all the major industry players like Chubb (CB) and Travelers (TRV  -  Free Report) producing strong growth rates.   
"
1364,FDX,"While easy comparisons are driving the year over year growth rate in Q4, there hasn’t been much growth lately despite very high level overall total earnings. Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 reached an all-time record at $262.5 billion, surpassing the previous record reached the quarter before. Current estimates for Q4 work out to a modestly lower total for the quarter. But when all is said and done about Q4, we will likely have seen another quarterly record.
"
1365,FDX,"But of more interest than Q4 growth will be management guidance for 2014. Companies typically provide guidance only for the following quarter, but they do tend to discuss their outlook their outlook for the coming year on the Q4 earnings calls. It will be interesting to see if management teams see any material improvement in the earnings picture this year along the lines of current consensus earnings expectations for 2014. Total earnings are expected to be up +9.8% in 2014, up from +4.6% growth in 2013, with most of the growth coming in the back half of the year.Monday-1/6

1375,FDX,"Fed in Focus as Q4 Earnings Reports Trickle In
"
1376,FDX,"The market’s focus is justifiably on the Fed this week, given expectations that the FOMC will start ‘Tapering’ its bond-purchase program. Also of interest, will be the FOMC members’ updated economic forecasts, and Bernanke’s last press conference as the Fed Chairman, where he will try to explain FOMC’s ‘Taper’ decision, or lack thereof.
"
1377,FDX,"Many in the market continue to hope that the Fed will hold off on the ‘Taper’ decision this week. A Wall Street Journal poll of 46 economists shows that only a quarter of the respondents expect this week’s FOMC meeting to result in the Taper announcement, while over a third of the total see the Fed holding off through the March 2014 meeting.   
"
1378,FDX,"The Fed will no doubt be the big subject this week, but the 2013 Q4 earnings reports start trickling in as well. We still have a couple of more weeks to go before the (calendar) quarter ends, but we count all companies with fiscal quarters ending in November as part of our Q4 tally. And by that definition, the Q4 earnings season got underway with the earning release from Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report) after the close on Thursday. We have a number of industry leaders reporting results this week, including FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and others.

1394,FDX,"Shutdown & the Q3 Earnings Season
"
1395,FDX,"We didn’t get the September jobs report thanks to the government shutdown and the impasse promises to steal the limelight from the 2013 Q3 earnings season. With the October 17th debt-ceiling deadline fast approaching, we can only hope that we move past these hurdles without further damage.  
"
1396,FDX,"The Q3 reports have been trickling in, with results from 21 S&P 500 companies out already. All of the reports thus far are from companies with fiscal quarters ending in August, which we count as part of the Q3 reporting cycle. Most of the companies reporting going forward, including Alcoa (AA) that reports October 8th after the close, are on the calendar quarter. In total, we have 33 companies reporting results this week, including 10 S&P 500 members. J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report), and Yum Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) are some of the notable companies reporting results this week.   
"
1397,FDX,"We have had a few strong earnings reports already, particularly from Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), and AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report), but the overall trend at this admittedly very early stage is mixed. The earnings and revenue growth rates for the 21 companies are tracking better than what these same companies in Q2 and the 4-quarter average, though the beat ratios (percentage of companies coming ahead of expectations) are a bit weaker.
"
1398,FDX,"This week’s results will provide better color on underlying trends, with results from companies like Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Yum Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), Family Dollar (FDO) and Safeway (SWY) giving us a sense of the consumer economy. Results from the big banks aren’t arriving till Friday, but they will set the stage for the rest of the group the following week. Finance was instrumental in keeping last quarter’s aggregate earnings growth in the positive column and is playing a similar, though less pronounced, role this quarter as well.
"
1399,FDX,"J.P. Morgan has been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons, though the company has an impressive track record of positive earnings surprises, having beat expectations in the last 6 quarters. This report could have noisy parts related to the company’s recent litigation and regulatory troubles, but core earnings should still remain best in class. The mortgage business will likely be less of a contributor this time around, both for JPM as well Wells Fargo.Low Expectations for Q3
"
1400,FDX,"As has been the case at the start of recent quarterly earnings cycles, expectations for the Q3 earnings season have fallen sharply over the last three months. Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are now expected to be up only +1.1% from the same period last year, down from +5.1% at the start of the quarter in early July, as the chart below shows.
"
1401,FDX,"This negative revisions behavior is hardly unusual as we have been repeatedly seeing this pattern play out in recent quarters. Companies have been overwhelmingly guiding lower, prompting analysts to cut estimates for the following quarter. The revisions behavior ahead of the Q2 earnings season was no different, as the chart below shows.
"
1402,FDX,"Most of the same sectors have experienced negative revisions this time around as was the case in Q2. The ‘regulars’ on the negative estimate revisions front include Technology, Basic Materials, and Industrials. But in addition to those sectors, Retail and Consumer Staples have played some roles in bringing down expectations for Q3 as well.
"
1403,FDX,"The chart below compares the Q3 total earnings growth expected for these five sectors at the start of the quarter and where those expectations stand at present
"
1404,FDX,"Estimates for other sectors have come down as well, with even the Finance sector earnings expected to be up +5.9% today, vs. +6.2% last week and +8.1% in early July. Energy, Utilities, Conglomerates and even Construction have suffered negative revisions in varying degrees.High Expectations for Q4
"
1405,FDX,"While estimates for Q3 have come down, the same for Q4 and the following quarters have held up fairly well, as the chart below shows.
"
1406,FDX,"Part of the strong Q4 growth is a function of easier comparisons, as 2012 Q4 represents the lowest quarterly earnings total for the S&P 500 in the last six quarters, with the comps particularly easy for the Finance sector. But it’s not all due to easy comparisons, as the expected earnings totals for Q4 represent a new all-time quarterly record. Total earnings for the S&P 500 reached a new record at $258.6 billion in Q2, surpassing Q1’s $253.6 billion record. But they are expected to reach $265.7 billion in 2013 Q4, with total earnings growth outside of Finance expected at +5.3%.
"
1407,FDX,"The evolving outlook for Q4 is perhaps the most important aspect of the Q3 earnings season, more so than Q3 earnings/revenue growth rates and beat ratios. While the overall level of aggregate earnings is in record territory, there isn’t much growth. The longstanding hope in the market has been for earnings growth to eventually ramp up. But the starting point of this expected growth ramp-up keeps getting delayed quarter after quarter. The hope currently is that Q4 will be the starting point of such growth.
"
1408,FDX,"Guidance has overwhelmingly been negative over the last few quarters. But if current Q4 expectations have to hold, then we will need to see a change on the guidance front; we need to see more companies either guide higher or reaffirm current consensus expectations.
"
1409,FDX,"Anything short of that will result in a replay of the by-now familiar negative estimate revisions trend that we have been seeing in recent quarters. The market didn’t care much as estimates came down in the last few quarters, hoping for better times ahead. Will it do the same this time as well, pushing its hopes of earnings ramp up into 2014? We will find out the answer to that question over the next two months.

Micron has Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Earnings ESP of +4.4%, while Zacks #2 Ranked Safeway has Earnings ESP of +26.7%.

"
1423,FDX,"Aluminum giant Alcoa (AA) typically gets the credit for kick-starting the earnings season even though its earnings release after the close on Wednesday April 8th wouldn’t technically be the first this reporting cycle (or any earnings season for that matter). We already have Q1 reports from 20 S&P 500 members, with many of them like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report) and other real bellwethers in their respective spaces and far more representative of the U.S. economy and Corporate America.
"
1424,FDX,"We should be mindful, however, that all of these early reporters have been releasing results for their fiscal quarters ending in February, which gets counted as part of the Q1 tally. In fairness to the aluminum giant, they are the first S&P 500 member on the calendar quarter to release results this week. Alcoa’s earnings report isn’t totally irrelevant to the broader earnings season either, particularly since the company’s operations have become more downstream oriented and the automotive and aerospace industries have steadily become major end-markets.
"
1425,FDX,"Alcoa is expected to earn 25 cents this quarter, down 4 cents since early January, but up materially from the 9 cents it earned in the year-earlier quarter. The strong growth this quarter is a function of higher aluminum price realizations and the absence of some of the issues that held down year-earlier profitability. But more important than earnings growth, market participants will be looking for management’s commentary about the state of global aluminum demand, which will be seen as a proxy for the health of the global economy.Sharp Revisions to Q1 Estimates
"
1426,FDX,"Unlike the 4-cent negative revision to the Q1 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for Alcoa over the last three months (from $0.29 to $0.25), estimates for the S&P 500 index came down far more sharply in that time period. Negative revisions to Q1 estimates were hardly unusual - this has been the trend for quite some time and has become particularly notable over the last couple of years as management teams have been consistently providing weak guidance.
"
1427,FDX,"One could cite a variety of reasons for why this has been the norm lately, but the most logical though cynical explanation is that management teams have a big incentive to manage expectations. After all, it pays to under-promise and over-deliver.
"
1428,FDX,"The chart below shows this trend clearly. The dark green columns show the earnings growth expected at the start of each quarter; the orange column shows the growth rate expected by the time the earnings season gets underway and the shaded green column shows the actual growth achieved that quarter. For 2015 Q1, we started at +4% in early January, which has effectively flipped by now. But if history is any guide, then the actual growth rate will likely be in the vicinity of where we started out in January. Other than 2014 Q4, this has been the pattern repeatedly in recent quarters.  
"
1429,FDX,"Keep in mind however that while the trend of negative revisions is no different from other recent periods, the magnitude of negative revisions for 2015 Q1 exceeds any other recent quarter by a big margin.
"
1430,FDX,"The chart below shows the magnitude of negative revisions for each quarter since 2013 Q2. As you can see, 2015 Q1 estimates have fallen -8% since January 1st, the most of any other recent quarter in the comparable period. Please note that the ‘average’ represents the average for the 7-quarter period through 2014 Q4.Chart 1: The Magnitude of 2015 Q1 Earnings Revisions Compared
"
1431,FDX,"The Energy sector’s travails resulting from the sharp drop in oil prices are well known; we saw that in the sector’s performance in the last earnings season as well when total earnings for the Energy sector were down -17.3% on -13.5% lower revenues. The Energy sector is an even bigger drag this time around, with total earnings for the sector expected to be down -62.7% on -36.2% lower revenues.
"
1432,FDX,"But it would be wrong to blame the Energy sector alone for the outsized negative revision to Q1 estimates that chart 1 above shows. The magnitude of negative revisions to Q1 estimates is still the highest of any other recent quarter after we isolate and exclude the Energy sector from the aggregate picture. We show that in chart 2 below which compares the magnitude of Q1 estimate revisions on an ex-Energy basis.Chart 2: Magnitude of Q1 Revisions outside of the Energy Sector
"
1433,FDX,"Chart 3 below looks at the same revisions trend from another angle. Instead of the magnitude of revisions in total earnings over the quarter, here we are showing how the estimates of total earnings growth have evolved over this time period. We show the evolving aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index as a whole (green bars), as well as on an ex-Energy sector basis (grey bars). The shaded bars at the end show what is expected today, with and without the Energy sector.Chart 3: Evolution of 2015 Q1 Growth Estimates
"
1434,FDX,"Chart 4 below shows the major sectors that have suffered the biggest negative revisions since the start of the quarter. Please note that each of the 16 Zacks sectors has suffered negative revisions; the Utilities sector has the lowest negative revision, but has nevertheless gone down.Chart 4: Major Sectors with Big Negative Revisions
"
1435,FDX,"As you can see in chart 4, even the Technology sector has suffered negative revisions, with earnings for the sector now expected to be up only +1.2% from the same period last year vs. expectations of +9.1% growth at the start of the quarter. But even this positive growth is thanks only Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report). Exclude Apple from the Tech sector and the sector’s growth rate falls into negative territory.Are Q1 Estimates Too Low?
"
1436,FDX,"The pronounced downshift in Q1 estimates has prompted some on Wall Street to start claiming that the revisions trend may have a gone bit too much; meaning that estimates have likely become too low. Hard to find a basis for such a claim in real time, particularly given the ongoing global growth woes and still-high U.S dollar.
"
1437,FDX,"The market’s reaction to the results from the 20 S&P 500 members that have already reported Q1 results (all of these companies have reported fiscal February quarter results that get counted as part of the Q1 tally) doesn’t support the claim that estimates may be too low. While it may be premature to draw any firm conclusions from the 20 results thus far, but we nevertheless don’t get the impression that that estimates may have been too low.
"
1438,FDX,"Here is the scorecard for the 20 S&P 500 members that have already reported 2015 Q1 results (all of these companies have fiscal quarters ending in February)
"
1439,FDX,"As you can see, total earnings for these 20 companies are up +4.9% from the same period last year on +1.9% higher revenues, with 80% beating earnings estimates and 45% beating revenue estimates.
"
1440,FDX,"Comparing the results from these 20 S&P 500 members with what we have been seeing from the same companies in other recent quarters shows that:
"
1441,FDX,"The earnings and revenue growth rates are below what we have been seeing in other recent quarters.
"
1442,FDX,"The earnings beat ratios are in-line with the preceding quarter (2014 Q4), but better than the 4-quarter average.
"
1443,FDX,"The revenue beat ratios are below what these same companies reported in the preceding as well as 4-quarter average.
"
1444,FDX,"The chart below shows the comparison of the results thus far with what we have been seeing from the same group of companies in other recent quarters.
"
1445,FDX,"The table below presents the summary picture for Q1 contrasted with what companies actually reported in the 2014 Q4 earnings season.
"
1446,FDX,"As you can see in the above summary table, total Q1 earnings are expected to be down -3.3% from the same period last on -4.5% lower revenues, with Energy as the biggest drag on the growth rate. Excluding Energy, total earnings for the remainder of the S&P 500 index would be up a decent enough +4.7% on +0.7% higher revenues.  Among the major sectors, Finance and Medical are big growth contributors this quarter, with Finance earnings expected to be up +9.2% and Medical earnings up +11.7%. We should keep in mind however that a small number of companies are accounting for most of the growth for these two sectors – Finance growth is solely due to easy comparisons for Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and the Medical growth is due to the strong growth at Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) and Actavis (ACT). Exclude these three companies from the ex-Energy growth rate for the index, we are not left with much.Will Q1 be the Low Point for the Year?
"
1447,FDX,"We haven’t had much earnings growth lately and the growth rate for Q1 is expected to turn negative. Not only is the growth rate for Q1 so low, but the overall level of total earnings for the S&P 500 index are also expected to be the lowest in two years. This will be a material change from the last two quarters when aggregate earnings for the index reached all-time record levels.
"
1448,FDX,"The chart below shows the earnings totals for 2015 Q1 (shaded orange bar - $250.5 billion) contrasted with the actual earnings for the preceding four quarters as well estimates for the following three quarters. The hopes are that Q1 will be the low point for the year, with aggregate earnings moving back into record territory towards the end of the year. Recent history tells otherwise. If history is our guide, then the likely result will be revisions to those lofty estimates in the coming days.This Week’s Reporting Calendar

1452,FDX,"Markets gained traction on Tuesday, supported by a rally in energy shares after oil prices settled at their highest level for the month. The major benchmarks ended in the green for the day. Meanwhile, investors closely followed the FOMC’s two-day policy meeting, speculating that a rate hike would be announced at its conlcusion. Shares of Facebook continued to decline after Federal Trade Commission decided to probe into the data debacle which has taken markets by the storm.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.5% to close at 24,730. The S&P 500 gained 0.2% to close at 2,717. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,364, increasing 0.3%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 4.3% to close at 18.20. A total of 6.26 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.17 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.28-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.26-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow gained 119 points on Tuesday to end in positive territory a day after sinking more than 300 points earlier in the session. The day’s gains for the blue-chip index were buoyed by a surge in the shares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), which gained 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 advanced 4 points to also end in the green. Of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500, six ended in the green, with energy shares leading the advancers. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) surged 0.9% on Tuesday.Gains for the S&P 500 were buoyed by a renewed strength in energy stocks after oil prices hit their highest level for this month. Growing tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia related to oil production as well as expectations of reduction in crude production in Venezuela led to speculations of a supply shock. This led to a surge in oil prices.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq ticked up 20 points to end in the positive territory. Gains for the tech-laden index were rather broad-based. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of Facebook Continue to DeclineShares of Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) declined 6.8% in a single session on Monday to post its worst dip in a day since March 26, 2014. Shares of the tech behemoth nosedived following reports that political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica was able to easily gather information from over 50 million user profiles without their consent. Such an incident raises questions over Facebook’s data management and protection from unauthorized third party access which is a direct breach of privacy.The declining trend continued on Tuesday following Federal Trade Commission’s decision to probe into the matter. The body would be investigating into whether Facebook violated any laws by ‘transferring’ personal data of its 50 million users to the analytics firm. What further led the stock lower was news that the company’s security chief would soon step down from his post.However, an official from Facebook revealed that they had not been intimated of any formal investigation by the FTC and that they are expecting to at least receive a letter from the commission regarding the probe. Such news weighed on the investors’ sentiments.Possibility of a Rate Hike keeps Investors on TenterhooksMarket watchers also kept a close watch on the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting which began Tuesday afternoon. The CME Fed Watch Tool has predicted that the odds of a rate hike by 0.25 percentage points on Mar 21 are around 94.4%. This has kept investors worried as they expect a more hawkish approach from the Fed toward raising interest rates as well as unwinding its humungous balance sheet.This would be Jerome Powell’s first conference after taking charge as the Fed Chair. A spike in interest rates shifts investors’ focus from stocks to bonds as the latter becomes more appealing. Speculations of this nature also weighed on the investors’ sentiments.U.S. to impose $60 Billion in Annual Tariffs on ChinaAccording to a report by The Washington Post, President Trump is ready to impose $60 billion in annual tariffs on China. The report also stated that this was actually double the amount which was initially proposed. Further, tariffs would be applicable on than a 100 products which were made using “stolen American intellectual property.”Stocks That Made HeadlinesFedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) Beats on Q3 Earnings, Raises Fiscal 2018 OutlookFedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended Feb 28, 2018), driven by higher base rates, increased volumes at the Ground and Freight segments and a favorable impact from fuel.

1453,FDX,"FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended May 31, 2018), driven by e-commerce growth and a buoyant U.S. economy.The company’s earnings (excluding $1.76 from non-recurring items) of $5.91 per share comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.72. Furthermore, the bottom line soared substantially on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by higher revenues.Quarterly revenues increased 10.1% year over year to $17,314 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17,186 million. Growth was witnessed across all major divisions of the company.Operating income (on an adjusted basis) climbed 14.9% year over year to $2 billion in the reported quarter. Also, operating margin expanded to 11.5% from 11.1% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.FedEx Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  FedEx Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | FedEx Corporation QuoteSegmental PerformanceQuarterly revenues at FedEx Express (including TNT Express) improved 9% to $9.60 billion on the back of better yields across the global portfolio of package and freight services besides higher freight pounds.Operating income (adjusted, excluding TNT Express integration expenses) came in at $1.10 billion, up 13% year over year while operating margin increased to 11.5% year over year from 11% in the year-ago quarter.FedEx Ground revenues increased 12% year over year to $4.80 billion in the period under consideration. A 6% rise in average daily package volume and higher base rates aided this segmental performance. Operating income came in at $832 million, up 18% while operating margin inched up 90 basis points (bps) to 17.3%.FedEx Freight revenues jumped 16% year over year to $1.86 billion. Segmental revenues were benefited by 8% increase, each in revenue per shipment as well as average daily shipment. Also, the segment’s operating income surged 35% to $175 million. Plus, the operating margin expanded 130 bps to 9.4%.Top & Bottom-Line Performance in Fiscal 2018In fiscal 2018, the company reported earnings (on an adjusted basis) of $15.31 per share, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.13. The bottom line also improved significantly from the prior-year figure, courtesy of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Notably, the company received a benefit of $1.6 billion from the new tax law. Revenues rose 8.6% to $65.5 billion, outpacing the consensus mark of $65.4 billion.During fiscal 2018, the company bought back 4.3 million shares for approximately $1 billion.Bullish Fiscal 2019 OutlookThe company anticipates earnings per share (excluding pension adjustments  and TNT Express integration expenses) of $17-$17.60 in fiscal 2019. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the same stands at $17.18. Additionally, the company projects approximately 9% increase in revenues while operating margin (excluding TNT Express integration expenses) is anticipated at around 8.5% (the recast fiscal 2018 operating margin is 7.8% excluding TNT Express integration expenses and certain other items). Further, the company expects effective tax rate of around 25% while capital expenses are estimated to be $5.6 billion, lower than $5.7 billion incurred in fiscal 2018.FedEx’s fiscal 2019 results are likely to benefit from higher revenues as well as synergies drawn from the progress in TNT Express and FedEx Express integration. The company continues to focus on improving operating income by $1.2 to $1.5 billion at the FedEx Express segment in fiscal 2020 compared with that in fiscal 2017.However, the mounting fears pertaining to a trade war are concerning and may hamper the free flow of goods between countries.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksFedEx holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector include GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report), SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report).  While GATX and SkyWest carry a Zacks Rank of 2, Expeditors sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In the past six months, shares of GATX and Expeditors have rallied more than 17% and 19%, respectively, while SkyWest stock has gained above 4%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1454,FDX,"Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’sEarnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:•    Total Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +18.3% from the same period last year on +8% higher revenues, with 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have double-digit earnings growth.•    Earnings growth in the last earnings season (20018 Q1) reached its highest level in more than 7 years at +24.3% on +7.2% revenue gains.•    Q2 estimates moved up modestly since the quarter got underway, but the aggregate positive revision was primarily because of the Energy sector. Excluding the Energy sector, estimates for the quarter would be modestly down in the last 10 weeks.•    Estimates went up for the Energy, Technology and Retail sectors and went down for the Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Autos, and Finance sectors.•    Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +22.7% on +10.5% higher revenues, which would follow +31.1% earnings growth on +13.1% revenue growth in Q1.•    Finance sector earnings are expected to be up +18.2% from the same period last year on +3.4% higher revenues.  •    Earnings growth is expected to be in double-digit territory for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with Autos and Conglomerates as the only sectors expected to have lower Q2 earnings compared to the year-earlier level.•    For the small-cap S&P 600 index, total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +30.5% on +10.7% higher revenues, which would follow +20.5% earnings growth on +7.6% revenue growth in 2018 Q1.•    For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +19.9% on +6.1% higher revenues. For full-years 2019 and 2020, earnings are expected to be up +9.8% and +9.6%, respectively. Revenues for the index are expected to be increase by +4.6% in 2019, and +4.4% in 2020.•    The implied ‘EPS’ for the index, calculated using current 2018 P/E of 17.6X and index close, as of June 19th, is $156.86. Using the same methodology, the index ‘EPS’ works out to $172.26 for 2019 (P/E of 16X) and $188.82 for 2020 (P/E of 14.6X). The multiples for 2018, 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index’s total market cap and aggregate bottom-up earnings for each year.   Q2 earnings season ExpectationsWe still have a few weeks to go before the Q2 earnings season takes center stage; that will happen with the JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) earnings releases on July 13th. Taking nothing away from the big bank results, but the Q2 earnings season has actually gotten underway already, with the recent Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) reports part of the 5 S&P 500 members that have reported results already.All of these early results are from companies with fiscal quarters ending in May, but they form part of our June-quarter tally. We will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in May by the time the big banks come out with results.Total Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +18.3% from the same period last year on +8% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Finance and Technology. This would be the 3rd quarter in a row of double-digit earnings growth for the index, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year as well.Energy sector earnings are expected to more than double from the year-earlier level, up +134.3%. Excluding the Energy sector, Total Q2 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +15%.  Estimates for the quarter have modestly moved up since the quarter got underway, as the chart below shows.This revisions trend is in contrast to the very positive trend we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season. A big part of the positive revisions we saw at the start of the year was directly tied to the impact of tax cuts. But estimates had actually been moving favorably since the second half of 2017 and we expected some of that to show up in estimates for Q2 as well. This didn’t happen, as the above chart shows.While estimates for Q2 as a whole haven’t moved much, they haven’t been that static at the sector level, with estimates for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors going down and estimates for 7 sectors going up. On the negative revisions side, estimates for the Conglomerates, Autos, Construction, Consumer Staples, Finance, Aerospace, and Consumer Discretionary sectors have been cut.On the positive side, the Energy sector really stands out, but estimates for the Technology and Retail sectors have gone up as well. Excluding the positive revisions to the Energy sector’s Q2 earnings estimates, aggregate estimates for the index would be modestly down since early March.Expectations Beyond Q1The chart below contrasts the expected Q2 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming two periods.As you can see, the growth picture remains very strong, even though it is expected to decelerate from Q1’s lofty level. The worrying part isn’t the seeming deceleration, but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond. This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

1455,FDX,"When it comes to value investing, the name that comes to the forefront is none other than Warren Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha’s fortune trail can be solely attributed to value investment. His success story, which started 60 years back, clearly underscores how value investment has helped him to transform less than $10,000 into a net worth of $91.1 billion till February 2018 (data per a CNBC article).Traditionally, the simplest method to decide whether a stock is overvalued or discounted is to determine its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and compare it with the P/E of the market or peer group. If you find the stock’s P/E is higher than that of the market, you can conclude that it is an expensive bid and vice versa.However, the problem arises when a stock apparently with an attractively lower P/E faces a dearth of catalysts to propel future growth. In such a case, if you buy the stock depending solely on its lower P/E, you might still end up paying more on the risk that the stock may falter soon. To avoid such value traps, Warren Buffett advises investors to focus on the earnings growth potential of a stock while judging the intrinsic value. And here lies the importance of a not-so-popular value investing metric, the PEG ratio.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateA low PEG ratio is always better for value investors.While P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps to find the intrinsic value of a stock.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors’ limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are some of the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry Median(P/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose.)Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) (whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000 (A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.)Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5% (Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.)Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 #2 or #3 offer the best upside potential. Here are five out of 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (JAZZ  -  Free Report): This is an international biopharmaceutical company focused on improving patients' lives by identifying, developing and commercializing meaningful products that address unmet medical needs. The stock can be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of B. Apart from a discounted PEG and P/E, the stock also has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 16.7%.Nutrisystem, Inc. (NTRI  -  Free Report): The company is a prominent name in the field of weight-loss industry. The company offers weight-loss programs that consist primarily of a pre-packaged food program, digital tools, and counseling. Apart from a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A, the company also has an impressive growth rate of 17.5% for the next five years.ACCO Brands Corporation (ACCO  -  Free Report): This is one of the world's largest designers, marketers and manufacturers of branded academic, consumer and business products. The company has an impressive current-year growth rate of 14.3%. The stock has a Value Score of A and a Zacks Rank #2.

1456,FDX,"The following is an excerpt from this week's Earnings Trends article.  To see the full article, please click here. Uninspiring Start to Q1 Earnings Season
"
1457,FDX,"The first quarter comes to an end in a few days, but the 2014 Q1 earnings season has already gotten underway. By April 1st, we will have seen results from almost 15 S&P 500 members (companies with fiscal quarters ending in February get counted as part of the Q1 tally).
"
1458,FDX,"Many of these early reporters aren’t obscure players as the list of companies that have reported results already include industry leaders like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Walgreens (WAG) and others. These initial reports don’t inspire much confidence and appear to be pointing towards another underwhelming reporting season ahead. But it’s perhaps premature to draw any firm conclusions based on such an unrepresentative sample of reports.
"
1459,FDX,"Expectations for the Q1 earnings season as whole remain low, with total earnings expected to be down -1.8% from the same period last year on +0.9% higher revenues and modestly lower margins.  As  has  been  the  trend  for  more  than  a  year  now, estimates for Q1 came down sharply as the quarter unfolded. The current -1.8% decline in total earnings in Q1 is down from +2.1% growth expected at the start of the quarter in January.
"
1460,FDX,"The -2.4% decline to total S&P 500 earnings since the start of Q1 in January is greater than what we witnessed in the comparable period in 2013 Q4, but is broadly in-line with the magnitude of the 4-quarter average of negative revision.
"
1461,FDX,"The chart below shows the magnitude of negative earnings revision for 2014 Q1 and each of the preceding four quarters over the course of each quarter.
"
1462,FDX,"Estimates for Q1 have fallen across the board, but the trend is particularly notable for the Retail, Basic Materials, Autos, Consumer Staples, and the Energy sectors, as the chart below shows.
"
1463,FDX,"With two-thirds of S&P 500 members typically beating earnings estimates in any reporting cycle, actual Q1 results will almost certainly be better than these pre-season expectations. But Q1 is unlikely to repeat the performance of the last few quarters when we would witness new all-time records for total earnings each quarter.
"
1464,FDX,"Guidance has been overwhelmingly weak for more than a year now, keeping the revisions trend firmly in the negative direction. Odds are that we wouldn’t see any change on that front this earnings season either, bringing down estimates for the rest of the year. Investors haven’t cared about negative estimate revisions thus far, but it will be interesting that behavior will remain in place going forward as well.

But Q1 is unlikely to repeat the performance of the last few quarters when we would witness new all-time records for total earnings each quarter.
"
1474,FDX,"Guidance has been overwhelmingly weak for more than a year now, keeping the revisions trend firmly in the negative direction. Odds are that we wouldn’t see any change on that front this earnings season either, bringing down estimates for the rest of the year. Investors haven’t cared about negative estimate revisions thus far, but it will be interesting that behavior will remain in place going forward as well.

1476,FDX,"Q1 Earnings Season Gets Underway
"
1477,FDX,"We will start counting Tuesday’s earnings announcements from Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) as part of 2014 Q1 reporting cycle, though we are still a few weeks away from the earnings season taking the spotlight.
"
1478,FDX,"The market has plenty of domestic economic data to digest this week in a backdrop of developments in Ukraine and renewed questions about China’s growth outlook. On the docket this week are a host of housing, inflation, and manufacturing sector reports, but the focus will be on the FOMC meeting, particularly Fed Chairwoman Yellen’s first press conference.
"
1479,FDX,"The Fed isn’t expected to spring any surprises on the market. But with the unemployment rate not too far from the Fed’s 6.5% target, they will need to move past explicit thresholds without roiling the markets. This isn’t easy to do, as too vague a threshold leaves open the risk that the market gets ahead of the Fed in pricing the eventual monetary tightening. The FOMC could address this issue in its official statement on Wednesday, but the issue is bound to come in Janet Yellen’s press event that afternoon.
"
1480,FDX,"Beyond the Fed and economic data, we have a number of corporate bellwethers coming out with 2014 Q1 results (companies with fiscal quarters ending in February and reporting in March get counted as part of Q1 tally), which includes besides Oracle, Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report).
"
1481,FDX,"These Q1 earnings reports aside, we are in the transition phase between two earnings seasons when the last one hasn’t completely ended even as the new one is upon us. Of this week’s 80 earnings announcements, there are only 18 companies with fiscal quarters ending in February and getting counted towards the Q1 tally; the rest belong the 2013 Q4 reporting cycle (we have Q4 earnings reports from 497 S&P 500 companies, as of Friday, March 14th).Expectations for 2014 Q1
"
1482,FDX,"Estimates for 2014 Q1 started coming down at an accelerated pace as companies predominantly guided lower on the 2013 Q4 earnings calls, consistent with the trend we have been seeing for more than a year now. Total Q1 earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are currently expected to be down -1.5% from the same period last year, a material decline from the +2.1% growth expected in early January 2014.
"
1483,FDX,"The negative revision trend is widespread, but is particularly notable for the Retail, Basic Materials, Autos, Consumer Staples, and the Energy sectors, as the chart below shows.
"
1484,FDX,"With roughly two-thirds of S&P 500 companies beating earnings expectations in any reporting cycle, actual Q1 results will almost certainly be better than these pre-season expectations. But Q1 is unlikely to repeat the performance of the last few quarters where we would witness a new all-time earnings total record each quarter. Total earnings for the S&P 500 are on track to reach $269.4 billion in 2013 Q4 (we still have 3 more companies to report results before ‘closing the books’ on that quarter). This is a new all-time quarterly record for total earnings, surpassing the previous record set in 2013 Q3 at $262.7 billion. Current estimates for 2014 Q1 aggregate to a quarterly total of $252.4 billion, but the expectation is for a strong ramp up from Q2 onwards.Scorecard for 2013 Q4 (as of Friday, March 14th)
"
1485,FDX,"With respect to the ‘scorecard’ for 2013 Q4, we are still waiting for results from 3 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for the 497 S&P 500 members that have reported results  are up +9.2% from the same period last year, with a ‘beat ratio’ of 64.2% and a median surprise of +2.4%. Total revenues are barely in the positive column, up only +0.7%, with a revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 55.9% and a median surprise of +0.6%. While the revenue growth rate in Q4 was held down by tough comparisons in the Finance sector, the overall earnings growth rate in the quarter was the highest of 2013.
"
1486,FDX,"A big contributor to the strong Q4 earnings growth is easy comparisons for three companies – Bank of America (BAC), Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), and Travelers (TRV). Exclude these three companies and total earnings growth for the S&P 500 companies that have reported drops to +5.5% from the ‘headline’ +9.2%, which is about where growth has been in recent quarters.

1498,FDX,"After the closing bell yesterday, transport bellwether FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) reported robust 2018 third-quarter earnings results. The courier company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the top and bottom lines and lifted its full-year earnings guidance.Earnings per share came in at $3.72, way above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.08 and up from the year-ago earnings of $2.30. Revenues rose 10% year over year to $16.53 billion and edged past the estimate of $16.18 billion. Solid results were driven by record traffic between Thanksgiving and Christmas because of the increase in delivery for online shoppers.FedEx raised its fiscal 2018 earnings per share guidance to $15.00-$15.40 from $12.70-$13.30 driven by foreign tax benefits from the international corporate structure, the benefits of the U.S. tax reform and improved operating performance. The new range is much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.51.Following the solid results, FDX shares rose nearly 4% in aftermarket hours on elevated volume. FedEx carries a Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A. It falls under a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 37%), suggesting its continued outperformance (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).ETFs in FocusThe solid FedEx report is expected to benefit transport ETFs iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report), SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report) and First Trust Nasdaq Transportation ETF (FTXR  -  Free Report). All these funds have a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold).IYTThe ETF tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to the small basket of 20 securities. Out of these, FedEx occupies the top position in the basket with 14.6% of the assets. Within the transportation sector, air freight and logistics takes the top spot with 29.9% share in the basket while railroads (24.7%), trucking (19.5%) and airlines (19.4%) round off the next three. The fund has accumulated nearly $865.9 million in AUM while it sees a good trading volume of around 234,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in fees per year and has gained 0.9% in the year-to-date time frame (read: Will Infrastructure ETFs Get a Boost from Trump's Plan?).XTNThis fund follows the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index and uses almost an equal weight methodology for each security. Holding 42 stocks with AUM of $240.5 million, FedEx accounts for 2.5% share in the basket. The product is heavily exposed to trucking, which accounts for 32.3% of total assets while airlines and air freight & logistics also make up for 25.1% and 24.1%, share, respectively. The fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a light volume of about 36,000 shares a day. XTN is up 0.08% so far in the year.FTXRThis fund offers exposure to the 30 most-liquid U.S. transportation securities based on volatility, value and growth by tracking the Nasdaq US Smart Transportation Index.

1499,FDX,"The following excerpt is from this week's Earnings Trends.  To see the full report, please click here.Q3 Earnings Season Gets Underway
"
1500,FDX,"We are still a couple of weeks away from getting into the heart of 2013 Q3 earnings season. But the reporting cycle has gotten underway, with results from 21 S&P 500 companies out already.
"
1501,FDX,"Even though these early reports from companies with fiscal quarters ending in August include a few industry leaders like Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), we can’t draw any firm conclusions from what we have seen thus far. That said, the Q3 growth numbers for these 21 companies compare favorably to what these companies reported in Q2 and the last few quarters. The beat ratios, however, look a bit on the weak side.  
"
1502,FDX,"The real Q3 earnings story is not about the 21 companies that have reported already, but the remaining 479 companies. And as we have been seeing repeatedly over the past year or so, estimates have come down sharply as the quarter unfolded. The current expected Q3 total earnings growth for the S&P 500 of +1.1% is down from +5.1% in early July, with estimates for the Technology, Retail, Consumer Discretionary, and Basic Materials sectors revised down.
"
1503,FDX,"The chart below shows the downtrend in Q3 estimates.
"
1504,FDX,"Unlike the downtrend in Q3 estimates over the recent past, expectations for Q4 and beyond have held up fairly well and represent a material acceleration in the growth pace. Total earnings growth is expected to ramp up to +8.9% from the roughly +2.6% growth in the first half of the year and the current expected +1.1% growth in Q3. More than half of this Q4 growth is expected to come from sectors outside of Finance. But given what we saw from these sectors in Q2 and in the run up to the current reporting cycle, it seems like a tall order to achieve this level of growth. My sense is that Q4 estimates need to come down materially.
"
1505,FDX,"The market hasn’t cared much in the recent past about negative revisions as aggregate earnings estimates have been coming down for over a year now. But if we are entering a post-QE world, as I believe we are, then it will likely be difficult to overlook negative earnings estimate revisions going forward. How the market responds to negative guidance and the resulting negative revisions will tell us a lot about what to expect going forward.Key Points
"
1506,FDX,"The 2013 Q3 earnings season has started, with results from 21 S&P 500 companies already out. Total earnings for these 21 companies are up +8.8%, with 57.1% beating earnings expectations. Revenues for these companies are up +7.4%, with a revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 52.4%.  
"
1507,FDX,"The total earnings and revenue growth rates for these 21 companies are better than what we saw from the same companies in Q2 and the 4-quarter average, though the beat ratios are a bit weaker.
"
1508,FDX,"Total Q3 earnings for all S&P 500 companies are expected to be up +1.1%, which reflects +0.5% revenue growth and modest gains in margins. Estimates have come down sharply over the last few months, with the current +1.1% expected growth down from +5.1% in early July.
"
1509,FDX,"The Finance sector is less of a driver in Q3, with total earnings for the sector are expected to be up +5.7%, which follows the sector’s positive 29.6% growth performance in Q2. Excluding Finance, total earnings growth for the S&P 500 would be flat (up +0.0%) in Q3, which is better than Q2’s ex-Finance growth of -2.6%.  
"
1510,FDX,"Technology earnings remain weak, but the sector’s growth is expected to improve in Q3 relative to what we saw in the preceding quarter. Total earnings for the sector are expected to be down -1.3% in Q3 after the -9.6% earnings decline in Q2. Margins have been under pressure across the board in the sector.
"
1511,FDX,"Guidance has been overwhelmingly negative over the last few quarters and the trend from the initial Q3 reports isn’t much different. The quality and tone of company guidance will be key to where estimates for Q4 settle down, which currently remain fairly elevated.
"
1512,FDX,"While there is not much growth, the overall level of total earnings is quite high, with total earnings in Q3 not a lot lower from Q2’s all-time quarterly record. Earnings for the S&P 500 companies are expected to total $251.4 billion in Q3, down from Q2’s record of $258.6 billion.

"
1530,FDX,"Developments in Washington DC are in the spotlight, stealing the limelight from a host of top-tier economic data and a steady trickle of 2013 Q3 earnings reports. Reporting season has gotten underway and 17 S&P 500 companies already come out with results, as of Friday September 27, 2013. This week brings earnings reports from 20 companies, including 4 S&P 500 members. Walgreens (WAG), Monsanto (MON), and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) are some of the notable companies reporting results this week.   
"
1531,FDX,"We have had a few strong earnings reports already, particularly from Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), and AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report), but the overall trend at this admittedly very early stage is mixed. The market isn’t paying much attention to the Q3 earnings season at this stage as all the focus is on handicapping the odds of a government shutdown and, more importantly, the debt ceiling issue. The day of reckoning on the budget/shutdown issue is upon us, though we still likely have a couple of more weeks before the debt ceiling will positively need to be raised. Needless to say that this DC spotlight isn’t market friendly as it heightens the real or perceived risks to the economy.Low Expectations for Q3
"
1532,FDX,"As has been the case at the start of recent quarterly earnings cycles, expectations for the Q3 earnings season have fallen sharply over the last three months. Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are now expected to be up only +1.1% from the same period last year, down from +1.2% last week and +5.1% at the start of the quarter in early July, as the chart below shows.
"
1533,FDX,"This negative revisions behavior is hardly unusual as we have been repeatedly seeing this pattern play out in recent quarters. Companies have been overwhelmingly guiding lower, prompting analysts to cut estimates for the following quarter. The revisions behavior ahead of the Q2 earnings season was no different and most of the same sectors have experienced negative revisions this time around as well. The ‘regulars’ on the negative estimate revisions beat include Technology, Basic Materials, and Industrials. But in addition to those sectors, Retail and Consumer Discretionary have played material roles in bringing down expectations for Q3 as well.
"
1534,FDX,"The chart below compares the Q3 total earnings growth expected for these five sectors at the start of the quarter and where those expectations stand at present
"
1535,FDX,"Estimates for other sectors have come down as well, with even the Finance sector earnings expected to be up +6.2% now vs. the +8.1% that was expected in early July. Energy, Utilities, Conglomerates and even Construction have suffered negative revisions in varying degrees.High Expectations for Q4
"
1536,FDX,"While estimates for Q3 have come down, the same for Q4 and the following quarters have held up fairly well, as the chart below shows.
"
1537,FDX,"Part of the extremely strong growth expected in Q4 is a function of easier comparisons, as 2012 Q4 represents the lowest quarterly earnings total for the S&P 500 in the last six quarters, with the comps particularly easy for the Finance sector. But it’s not all due to easy comparisons, as the expected earnings totals for Q4 represent a new all-time quarterly record. Total earnings for the S&P 500 reached a new record at $256.5 billion in Q2, surpassing Q1’s $254.1 billion record. But they are expected to reach $273.5 billion in 2013 Q4, with total earnings growth outside of Finance expected at +8.5%.
"
1538,FDX,"Judging by what has happened over the past year or so, these Q4 estimates will come down as companies share their outlooks on the Q3 earnings calls. The market didn’t care much as estimates came down in the last few quarters, hoping for better times ahead. Will it do the same this time as well, pushing its hopes of earnings ramp up into 2014? We will find out the answer to that question over the next two months.The Washington Drama
"
1539,FDX,"Headlines from Washington DC will be all the rage this week, but we have a full docket of top-tier economic data coming out this week as well. Most of recent economic data, like Jobless Claims, New Home sales, and Personal Income/Spending has been good enough to allow the Fed to start the Taper process. But perhaps the Fed was justifiably wary of going that route in the last meeting given the coming budget/debt ceiling battles in Congress.
"
1540,FDX,"The most important report coming out this week is the September non-farm payroll report coming out on Friday. We will also get the two ISM surveys, the private sector jobs tally from ADP and other economic readings this week.
"
1541,FDX,"Monday - 9/30
"
1542,FDX,"The Chicago PMI coming out after the market opens will give us a preview of the national manufacturing ISM survey on Tuesday. The expectation is for the Chicago PMI to modestly lose ground from August’s 55.7 reading.
"
1543,FDX,"Paychex (PAYX  -  Free Report) is the only notable earnings release today, coming out after the close.
"
1544,FDX,"Tuesday - 10/1
"
1545,FDX,"We will get the September manufacturing ISM index, August Construction Spending, and September motor vehicle sales numbers coming out.
"
1546,FDX,"The expectation is for the ISM reading to modestly pullback from August’s 55.7 level, while Construction Spending is expected to show a +0.6% increase after July’s similar gain.
"
1547,FDX,"Walgreen’s (WAG) is the key earnings report in the morning, while Global Payments (GPN  -  Free Report) will report after the close.

"
1560,FDX,"Economic data was in the forefront last week, and it overwhelmingly came out short of expectations. The focus this week shifts to the first quarter earnings season, which has been underway for the last few weeks but gets into high gear next week.  
"
1561,FDX,"It has been mixed bag thus far, with negative surprises from the likes of Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report). But it would be premature to extrapolate the performance of the 22 Q1 results onto the entire earnings season.  
"
1562,FDX,"Growth expectations remain weak, a reflection of touch comparisons and underwhelming management guidance – the first quarter of 2012 remains the high point of total quarterly earnings since the current earnings cycle got underway in 2009. These tough comparisons are particularly pronounced in the Finance sector, which is expected to experience an earnings decline after many quarters of double-digit growth. The outlook for Tech is even weaker and fairly widespread, which comes after the sector’s underwhelming performance in the previous quarter.  
"
1563,FDX,"But lack of growth in the first quarter is not much of a concern for the market, as investors are looking ahead to period of robust growth later in the year, particularly in the back half of 2013 and all of 2014. The expectation is that the +0.7% earnings growth in the first half of 2013 will be followed by double-digit earnings growth in the second half of the year and into next year. Driving these optimistic growth expectations are strong revenue gains and further expansion in margins which are already in record territory.   
"
1564,FDX,"Revenue growth is a function of economic growth. And while GDP growth has been fairly erratic in recent quarters, the expectation is for a sustained period of growth starting in the second half of the year. Hard to tell how reasonable the revenue growth expectations are since they are so closely tied to the uncertain economic backdrop.  
"
1565,FDX,"But margins are a different story. Expecting margins to continue expanding after they have crossed the prior cyclical peak does not seem reasonable or plausible.Key Points:
"
1566,FDX,"The first-quarter 2013 reporting season has gotten underway. The 22 companies that have reported results present a mixed picture, with a few high-profile negative surprises.
"
1567,FDX,"Total Q1 earnings are expected to be down -2.6% from the same period last year, which reflects -0.9% drop in revenues and a modest contraction in margins.
"
1568,FDX,"Tough comparisons and weak management guidance account for the weak earnings growth picture. Total earnings reached their highest quarterly total in the first quarter of 2012 and have yet to get back to that level.
"
1569,FDX,"Unlike the last many quarters, Finance will be a drag on growth this quarter. Tough comparisons for Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and AIG (AIG  -  Free Report) account for most of the earnings weakness.
"
1570,FDX,"Tech earnings were weak last quarter and they are expected to be even weaker this time around. The sector’s earnings weakness is broad-based and not solely due to the negative comparisons for Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report).
"
1571,FDX,"There hasn’t been much earnings growth in recent quarters, but the absolute level of quarterly earnings is expected to have bottomed in 2012 Q4 and start going up from 2013 Q2 onwards. 
"
1572,FDX,"Total earnings in the first half of 2013 are expected to increase by +0.7%, but ramp up to a +10.9% growth pace in the back half of the year and a further +11.7% in 2014. A combination of revenue gains and margin expansion reflect the positive outlook for the back half of the year.
"
1573,FDX,"Net margins modestly contract in the first quarter, but start expanding from the second quarter onwards. For the full year 2013, net margins are expected to top the 2006 peak and expand even more in 2014.
"
1574,FDX,"Total earnings are expected to increase by +6.8% in 2013 and +11.7% in 2014. In dollar terms, earnings are expected to total $1.03 trillion in 2013 and $1.15 trillion in 2014, up from the 2012 total of $965 billion.
"
1575,FDX,"The bottom-up ‘EPS’ for the S&P 500 for 2013 and 2014 currently stands at $109.75 and $122.60, respectively. The top-down ‘EPS’ estimates for 2013 and 2014 currently stand at $107.83 and $114.80. It seems that Wall Street strategists are a bit less enthusiastic about the earnings picture than the analysts.READ THE FULL EARNINGS TRENDS REPORT by clicking here: Q1 Earnings Season Takes the Spotlight RELATED ARTICLESWhat to Look for This Earnings SeasonBuy or Sell: Intel (INTC  -  Free Report)Market Eyes Up Earnings Season (VIDEO)
"
1576,FDX,"Earnings season is set to unofficially begin next week with the release of Alcoa’s earnings on Monday the 8th. Several S&P 500 stocks have already begun reporting with initial reports from the likes of Oracle (ORCL  -  Analyst Report ) and FedEx ( FDX  -  Analyst Report )  already disappointing investors.
"
1577,FDX,"Of course it’s too early to tell how this season will shape up, but it’s important to note that growth expectations remain weak, a reflection of underwhelming management guidance and tough comparisons -- the first quarter of 2012 remains the high point of quarterly earnings since the economy has been “expanding” since 2009.
"
1578,FDX,"The financial sector is expected to experience an earnings decline after many quarters of double-digit growth. The outlook for Tech is even weaker and fairly widespread, which would come after the sector’s underwhelming results in the previous quarter.
"
1579,FDX,"Revenue growth will be closely monitored as many companies have reached their peak margin levels. Even with low expectations, it will be a challenge to target companies that exceed analysts’ estimates. The Zacks Earnings ESP can be a useful tool in your search; here are a few companies with positive ESPs and a Zacks Rank of 3 or less (Hold to Strong Buy).About Zacks Earnings ESP
"
1580,FDX,"Earnings ESP is Zacks’ proprietary methodology for determining which stocks have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. The Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Consensus. The Zacks ESP helps predict earnings surprises to the upside and downside; the greater the ESP (positive or negative) the greater the likelihood for a surprise. I use ESP to help quantify the conviction of the analysts for a surprise and stack the odds in my favor when I combine it with other measurements and statistics.The Accuracy of ESP
"
1581,FDX,"Of course, some ESP numbers are better than others. In our testing, over the last 10 years, we have found that stocks with a positive ESP and with a Zacks Rank of 1, 2 or 3 (Strong Buy, Buy or Hold), produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.
"
1582,FDX,"(The other 9% of the time, they reported in line with expectations, with a negative surprise occurring only 21% of the time.)Bullish ESP StocksProgressive Insurance ( PGR  -  Analyst Report ) is a Zacks Rank #1 stock with a positive earnings ESP of 4.65% for the current quarter. The company is expected to make 43 cents a share, but our ESP readings are looking for a profit of 45 cents.
"
1583,FDX,"Progressive is unique in that it’s one of the only companies that reports earnings monthly. While this may diminish volatility, it allows investors to keep a more constant eye on the company’s health.
"
1584,FDX,"Progressive is trading at 17 times forward earnings, but has been delivering solid growth even with super storm Sandy. Strength in their last report was primarily driven by 9% year over year growth in net premiums and 111% escalation in net realized investment gains. Expectations are for the company to grow earnings at roughly 7% year over year.
"
1585,FDX,"– Progressive reports earnings on April 10th.JB Hunt Transport ( JBHT  -  Analyst Report ) is a Zacks Rank #2 stock with a positive earnings ESP of 4.69% for the current quarter; the Zacks Consensus is for a per share profit of $0.64.
"
1586,FDX,"Intermodal transport (diversified) accounted for 61% or $821 million of JBHT’s revenue in Q42012, up 13% compared to Q42011. Their Total revenue was up 11% in that same time frame. What makes that more remarkable is that shipments were basically flat in that same time frame, while expenditures were down according to the Cass Freight Index.
"
1587,FDX,"Analysts also seem to be getting slightly more bullish on the stock as ESPs are all positive for the coming reporting periods. Shares trade at 24 times forward earnings and JBHT will have to deliver on its 16% growth in 2013 to keep investors happy.– JB Hunt reports earnings on April 11th.JP Morgan Chase ( JPM  -  Analyst Report ) is a Zacks Rank #2 stock with a positive earnings ESP of 6.62% for the current quarter. The Zacks consensus estimate is for Q4 EPS of $1.36, with the most accurate estimate at $1.45.
"
1588,FDX,"JP Morgan has managed to beat the Zacks Consensus estimate for the last 4 quarters in a row with an average beat of 24.66%.
"
1589,FDX,"When you clear out all the headlines, you have a stock trading at just 8.8 times forward earnings with expected earnings growth of 7.12%, giving this bank a PEG ratio of just 1.26.
"
1590,FDX,"JPMorgan Chase & Co recently won the dismissal of the vast majority of a lawsuit accusing it of misleading Belgian-French bank Dexia SA into buying more than $1.6 billion of troubled mortgage debt.
"
1591,FDX,"– JP Morgan Chase reports earnings on April 12th.ESP Earnings Results
"
1592,FDX,"Now that you know which groups of stocks to focus on to increase your chances of a positive surprise, let’s look at the size of the ESP that has historically generated the best results.
"
1593,FDX,"First, just having a positive ESP produces market beating results. Over the last 10 years, using a 1 week holding period (stocks were held for no more than one week after they reported), the average annual return was 23.5%. This is in stark contrast to stocks with a negative ESP which produced a -9.20% return.
"
1594,FDX,"Now apply the Zacks Rank of 1, 2 or 3 to that list and the returns jump to 28.3%.
"
1595,FDX,"If you require your stocks to have an ESP of greater than 1%, we found it increased performance to 29.6%. An ESP of greater than 2% bumps performance up to 31.6%. While an ESP of greater than 3%, produces an average annual return of 37.2%.
"
1596,FDX,"Note: there’s no need to hold out for stocks with significantly higher ESP’s than 3%. While some stocks with higher ESP’s will do fantastic, there’s no aggregate increase in performance by ratcheting it up beyond d the 3% threshold. And as the above stats illustrate, simply having a positive ESP (i.e., the Most Accurate Estimate is above the Consensus) still produces stellar results with a high probability of success.Start Using Zacks ESP in Your Own Trading Today
"
1597,FDX,"The next time your stock is about to report or a stock on your watch list is getting closer to their earnings date, be sure to look at its Zacks ESP and see what your stock’s probabilities are of producing a positive surprise.

"
1599,FDX,"Today's market action will likely see a reversal of Monday’s modest pullback that had some people start thinking of the long-awaited ‘correction’. Monday’s action was likely nothing more than the market’s typical tentativeness ahead of key economic data – with Friday’s March jobs report being the key data point this week.  
"
1600,FDX,"The market's impressive run from the November lows has remained in place despite doubts from many, myself included. And this will likely continue till uncertainty increases on two related fronts – the economy and earnings. 
"
1601,FDX,"Monday's underwhelming manufacturing ISM report notwithstanding, recent economic data has been positive for the most part. The sum total of these reassuring economic readings has helped raise expectations for the current and coming quarters.  
"
1602,FDX,"As a result, GDP growth expectations for the first quarter are almost double what they were at the start of the period. This growth momentum is expected to accelerate further in the second half and carry into 2014. But our history of the last three years shows a pronounced seasonal tendency for the economy to lose steam in the Spring/Summer months. There is no evidence of such a Spring Swoon at this stage, but there is no shortage of potential catalysts that could trigger such weakness.  
"
1603,FDX,"Related to the economic question is the outlook for corporate earnings. We haven't had much earnings growth lately. In fact, earnings have been essentially flat in the second half of 2012. This flat (or non-existent) earnings growth trend is expected to persist through the first half of 2013 and then shift gears in the back half to a double-digit growth pace. The acceleration carries into 2014, giving us another double-digit growth rate that year. We will test these expectations as the first quarter earnings season gets going from next week onwards. The initial reports from companies like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) have been less than inspiring. But we will have to wait and see if current expectations for the coming quarters, particularly the second half of the year, will hold up.
"
1604,FDX,"Many factors could come in the way of this market rally – from changing expectations about the Fed’s QE program to other ‘known unknowns’. But it’s hard to envision the prevailing optimism remaining in place in the absence of current economic and earnings outlook.

1607,FDX,"It looks like Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is unraveling a new card every day to sharpen its competitive flair against Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). The officially omni-channel retailer, which has become overtly popular for undertaking constant e-commerce strategies, is also trying all means to give consumers new reasons to visit its stores. Evidently, sources revealed that the company inked a deal with FedEx’s (FDX  -  Free Report) subsidiary, FedEx Office – which will add about 500 new FedEx Office locations inside certain Walmart stores over the next two years.The agreement, which was unveiled at yesterday’s ShopTalk conference, followed the successful conclusion of a pilot program undertaken by both companies. Incidentally, Walmart and FedEx Office already tested this setup across six states that covered 47 locations such as North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Colorado, among others.Per media reports, the pilot program was quite impressive, as many customers visiting FedEx Offices within Walmart also ended up shopping from the latter – thus boosting the big box retailer’s store sales. Hence, we believe that this deal is likely to augment Walmart’s business by easing consumers’ shopping even further. By adding services like packaging, printing and shipping to its already wide range of products and services, Walmart is likely to emerge even stronger as a one-stop-shop for customers.Notably, the inclusion of FedEx Office stores within Walmart will also allow customers to process returns in a convenient way. Customers can send their packages to be kept at any Walmart-based FedEx Office store for up to five working days – either directly or through FedEx Delivery Manager. While Walmart and FedEx were already allies for shipping, this store within store expansion is likely to mitigate certain pressures associated with last mile deliveries, which has become a raging issue among retailers. Walmart Well Placed in the Retail GameIncidentally, major bellwethers like Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), among others are also making incessant efforts in the delivery space, to stay firm in an Amazon-dominated world. This is partly clear from Target’s buyout of Shipt and Kroger’s contract with Instacart, to support seamless deliveries. Moving back to Walmart, the company is leaving no stone unturned to expand in the delivery and e-commerce space.In order to facilitate delivery, Walmart acquired a delivery startup Parcel, Inc., which is a last-mile delivery service and specializes in same-day delivery for perishable and non-perishable products. Other than this, the company’s Walmart Pickup program enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up at a store for free. In other developments, Walmart also partnered with ride hailing services Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. Further, the company continues to test same-day and next-day delivery to enhance its services further.While these factors and Walmart’s numerous acquisitions and alliances tell the tale of its e-commerce development, the company is also committed toward its stores business. In fact, earlier this week itself, there was a lot of buzz about the expansion of Walmart’s alliance with household services provider – Handy. Well, sources revealed that Walmart is extending its agreement with Handy, which will let customers hire helpers at about 2,000 Walmart stores to install or assemble their purchases of television and furniture.   Such strategies have been driving this supermarket giant, which has surged nearly 28.2% in a year, surpassing the industry’s rise of 21.2%. We believe that with such robust endeavors rolled up in its sleeve, Walmart is likely to keep its stellar record intact. Also, with strength across both stores and e-commerce, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is likely to remain well-placed against Amazon. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks (Strong Buy) here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.

1608,FDX,"FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended Feb 28, 2018), driven by higher base rates, increased volumes at the Ground and Freight segments and a favorable impact from fuel.The company’s earnings (excluding $3.87 from non-recurring items) of $3.72 per share comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.08. Furthermore, the bottom line soared 58.3% on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by higher revenues.Quarterly revenues increased 10.2% year over year to $16,526 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16,179.7 million. Growth was witnessed across all major divisions of the company.Operating income (on an adjusted basis) inched up 0.9% year over year to $1.11 billion in the reported quarter. However, operating margin contracted to 6.7% from 7.4% in third-quarter fiscal 2017.FedEx Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  FedEx Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | FedEx Corporation QuoteSegmental PerformanceQuarterly revenues at FedEx Express (including TNT Express) improved 9.3% to $9.37 billion, on the back of hiked base rates, higher fuel surcharges as well as favorable exchange rates.Operating income (adjusted, excluding TNT Express integration expenses) came in at $510 million, down 16.4% year over year while operating margin decreased to 5.4% year over year from 7.1% in the year-ago quarter. Total package volume slipped 1% while average daily freight pounds rose 3%.FedEx Ground revenues grew 11% year over year to $5.22 billion in the period under review. Volume expansion and higher base rates aided the segmental performance. Average daily volume climbed 6% whereas operating income came in at $634 million, up 23%. Operating margin expanded 110 basis points (bps) to 12.1%.FedEx Freight revenues jumped 14% year over year to $1.69 billion. Segmental revenues were benefited by less-than-truckload (LTL) revenues per shipment growth of 8% average daily LTL shipment growth of 6%. Also, the segment’s operating income surged 34% to $55 million. Plus, the operating margin expanded 50 bps to 3.2%.Q4 Fiscal 2018 OutlookFedEx has issued guidance for operating income and margin for the fiscal fourth quarter. Additionally, it has provided an outlook for segmental operating margin. Each forecast assumes moderate economic growth.The company estimates fourth-quarter consolidated operating income excluding TNT Express integration expenses and certain other items, in the range of $1.95-$2.05 billion. While operating margin excluding TNT Express integration expenses and certain other items, is projected at 11-11.8%.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, the company forecasts adjusted operating margin (minus TNT Express integration expenses) at the FedEx Express segment between 9.9% and 10.4%. While at FedEx Ground and Freight segments, the metric (on a reported basis) is estimated between 17-17.5% and 8-9%, respectively.The segmental margin predictions indicate the recent realignment of the company’s specialty logistics and e-commerce solutions with a new organizational structure within the FedEx Express segment.Bullish Fiscal 2018 ProjectionThe company has raised its view for fiscal 2018 owing to foreign tax benefits from international corporate structure, better operating performance and gains from the tax reform. The company has also reiterated its commitment to increase operating income by $1.2-$1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 compared with the tally registered in fiscal 2017.For fiscal 2018, the company anticipates earnings per share (excluding TNT Express integration expenses and certain other items) in the range of $15-$15.40, higher than the previous projection of $12.70-$13.30. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at $13.51.Moreover, capital expenses are expected at $5.8 billion, down $100 million from the earlier guidance.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksFedEx carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1610,FDX,"Fed in Focus as 2013 Q3 Earnings Season Gets Underway
"
1611,FDX,"The market’s focus is justifiably on the Fed this week, given expectations that the FOMC will start ‘Tapering’ its bond-purchase program. Also of interest will be the FOMC members’ updated economic forecasts and the Bernanke press conference where the outgoing Fed Chairman will try to explain their ‘Taper’ decision, or lack thereof.
"
1612,FDX,"Some in the market continue to hope that the Fed will hold off on the ‘Taper’ decision this week given the still-tepid economic picture and the potentially destabilizing upcoming budget and debt-ceiling debates in Congress. With the Syria debate now moving to the background, Congress’s attention will be shifting to these divisive topics in the coming days, not to mention a potentially noisy Senate confirmation battle for Larry Summers as the next Fed Chairman, should he get the nod as many speculations seem to suggest.
"
1613,FDX,"Please check out the very informative post by Nick Kalivas on the evolving monetary policy picture and the issues facing the Fed. Click here.
"
1614,FDX,"The Fed will no doubt be the big subject this week, but we are getting close to the start of the 2013 Q3 earnings season as well. In fact, the Q3 earnings season will actually get underway this week with the earning release from Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report) after the close on Tuesday, followed by reports from such bellwethers as FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) on Wednesday.
"
1615,FDX,"Alcoa (AA) typically gets credited for kick-starting each earnings season, but since we count all companies with quarters ending in August as part of our Q3 tally, the Q3 earnings season will have gotten underway weeks before Alcoa reports on October 8th. It will be interesting to see how much attention the aluminum giant’s earnings report will get this earnings season since it will have lost its position in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In total, we have 20 companies reporting Q3 results this week, including 5 S&P 500 members.
"
1616,FDX,"As has been the case at the start of recent quarterly earnings cycles, expectations for the Q3 earnings season have fallen sharply over the last three months. Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are now expected to be up only +1.3% from the same period last year. This is down materially from what was expected at the start of the quarter in early July, as the chart below shows. 
"
1617,FDX,"This negative revisions behavior is hardly unusual as we have been repeatedly seeing this pattern play out in recent quarters. Companies have been overwhelmingly guiding lower, prompting analysts to cut estimates for the following quarter. The revisions behavior ahead of the Q2 earnings season was no different and most of the same sectors have experienced negative revisions this time around as well. The ‘regulars’ on the negative estimate revisions beat include Technology, Basic Materials, and Industrials. But Retail and Consumer Discretionary have played material roles in bringing down expectations for Q3.
"
1618,FDX,"The chart below compares the Q3 total earnings growth expected for these five sectors at the start of the quarter and where those expectations stand at present
"
1619,FDX,"Estimates for other sectors have come down as well, with even the Finance sector earnings expected to be up +7% now vs. the +8.1% that was expected in early July. Energy, Utilities, Conglomerates and even Construction have suffered negative revisions in varying degrees.
"
1620,FDX,"While estimates for Q3 have come down, the same for Q4 and the following quarters have held up fairly well, as the chart below shows.   
"
1621,FDX,"Part of the extremely strong growth expected in Q4 is a function of easier comparisons, as 2012 Q4 represents the lowest quarterly earnings total for the S&P 500 in the last six quarters, with the comps particularly easy for the Finance sector. But it’s not all due to easy comparisons, as the expected earnings totals for Q4 represent a new all-time quarterly record. Total earnings for the S&P 500 reached a new record at $255.9 billion in Q2, surpassing Q1’s $253.9 billion record. But they are expected to reach $273.6 billion in 2013 Q4, with total earnings growth outside of Finance expected at +8.5%.
"
1622,FDX,"Judging by what has happened over the past year or so, these Q4 estimates will come down as companies share their outlooks on the Q3 earnings calls. The market didn’t care much as estimates came down in the last few quarters, hoping for better times ahead. Will it do the same this time as well, pushing its hopes of earnings ramp up into 2014? We will find out the answer to that question over the next two months.Monday-9/16
"
1623,FDX,"We will get the August Industrial Production index and capacity utilization numbers in the morning. The expectation is for +0.4% increase in IP and an uptick in utilization.
"
1624,FDX,"We will also get the September Empire State manufacturing index, with consensus expectations of a modest improvement from August’s 8.2 reading.Tuesday -9/17
"
1625,FDX,"The Fed’s two-day meeting gets underway today.
"
1626,FDX,"August CPI and September homebuilder sentiment index will be coming out in the morning. The CPI reading is expected to remain benign and the homebuilder index is expected to remain unchanged from the prior month’s 59 reading. The recent spike in interest rates is a net negative for the housing sector and could show up in this reading.
"
1627,FDX,"The Q3 earnings season gets underway today, with earnings reports from FactSet Research (FDS  -  Free Report) in the morning and Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report) after the close.Wednesday-9/18
"
1628,FDX,"The big news of the day is whether the FOMC meeting will result in the ‘Taper’ announcement or not. Economic projections of FOMC members and the Bernanke press conference will be other key events of the day. But the Fed activities will take place in the afternoon.
"
1629,FDX,"In the morning, we will get the August Housing Starts and Permits numbers, with expectations of gains on the Starts and a decline on the Permits fronts.
"
1630,FDX,"FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and Cracker Barrel (CBRL  -  Free Report) will be the key Q3 earnings reports in the morning, while Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) will report after the close.Thursday -9/19
"
1631,FDX,"Jobless Claims, Existing Home sales, Philly Fed and Leading Indicators round out a busy economic docket.
"
1632,FDX,"ConAgra (CAG  -  Free Report), Pier 1 Imports (PIR  -  Free Report) and Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) will report results in the morning.Friday-9/20

"
1635,FDX,"The June jobs report has put the spotlight back on the Fed and what it will do to the QE program in the coming months. But hopefully the Q2 earnings season will provide enough of a distraction to not let the Fed become a full-time fixation for the market.
"
1636,FDX,"Given how low expectations have come down over the last few months, the Q2 reporting season may not carry many surprises. In fact, it may be reasonable to expect this earnings season to be no different from what we have become accustomed to seeing over the last few quarters. But two aspects of this coming earnings season need paying special attention to – revenues and guidance.
"
1637,FDX,"Management teams are typically very good at under-promising and over-delivering. That’s why roughly two-thirds of the companies end up beating earnings expectations. But an unusually big proportion of the companies came short of revenue expectations in the previous quarter. The situation has not been much different from the 23 S&P 500 companies that have reported results already, which includes companies like Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Walgreen (WAG) and others. As such, more than earnings surprises, it will be interesting to keep an eye on revenue surprises.
"
1638,FDX,"But even more significant than growth rates and surprises will be guidance. Guidance is always important, but it has assumed even more significance this time around given the elevated expectations for the second half of the year, as the chart below shows.
"
1639,FDX," Source: Zacks Data
"
1640,FDX,"We may not see much earnings growth in the first half of 2013, but consensus expectations are for a material growth ramp up in the back half of the year – from +2.7% in the first half to +9.2% in the second half.
"
1641,FDX,"Importantly, the growth expectations for the second half of the year are not due to easy comparisons – the level of total earnings expected in 2013 Q3 and Q4 represent new all-time high quarterly records, as shown by the chart below of total bottom-up consensus earnings estimates.
"
1642,FDX," Source: Zacks Data
"
1643,FDX,"My sense is that estimates need to come down in a big way. The market hasn’t cared much in the recent past about negative revisions as aggregate earnings estimates have been coming down for over a year now. But if we are entering a post-QE world, as I believe we are, then it will likely be difficult to overlook negative earnings estimate revisions going forward. How the market responds to negative guidance over and the resulting negative revisions will tell us a lot about what to expect going forward.Key Points
"
1644,FDX,"Total earnings for the 23 S&P 500 companies that have reported results already are up +8.1%, with 60.9% of this small sample beating earnings expectations. Revenues for these companies are up +5.3%, with a revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 43.5%.  
"
1645,FDX,"Overall expectations remain low, with total earnings for the S&P companies as a whole expected to be up +0.4% from the same period last year, reflecting -0.8% lower revenues and modestly higher margins. This follows +2.6% earnings growth in Q1 on -1.3% lower revenues.
"
1646,FDX,"Estimates for Q2 have come down materially since the quarter got underway, with the current +0.4% growth down from +3.9% in early April.
"
1647,FDX,"Finance is the only major sector with a strong growth profile, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +18.6% in Q2. This follows +7.6% earnings growth in Q1 and many quarters of double-digit gains for the sector. Excluding Finance, total earnings would be down -3.2% in Q2.
"
1648,FDX,"Finance reclaims its leadership role in the S&P 500, contributing more earnings to the index’s total than Technology this year for the first time since the 2008 crisis. The sector is expected to account for 19.2% of total S&P 500 earnings in 2013 compared to Technology’s 18%.   
"
1649,FDX,"Technology earnings were weak in Q1 and they are even weaker this time around, with total earnings for the sector expected to decline -8.3% in Q2 after declining -4.2% in Q1. Weakness in hardware and semi-conductor industries more than offset the modest growth in software earnings. Excluding Technology, total earnings for the S&P 500 would be up +2.4% in Q2.
"
1650,FDX,"Estimate revisions remain in neutral territory at present, though Finance continues to experience strong positive revisions, while revisions for Basic Materials, Industrials, Staples, and Business Services predominantly to the downside.
"
1651,FDX,"Estimates for the second half of the year still reflect strong growth, with total earnings in the second half expected to increase by +9.2% after the +2.7% increase in the first half. Total earnings are expected to be up 6.4% in 2013 and +11.5% in 2014.
"
1652,FDX,"While there is not much growth, the overall level of total earnings is quite high. Total earnings were an all-time record at $252.6 billion in Q1 and are expected to total $250.3 billion in Q2. For the full year, earnings are expected total $1.03 trillion in 2013 and $1.15 trillion in 2014.   
"
1653,FDX,"Net margins are expected to be up 20 basis points in Q2 as a whole and stay flat outside of the Finance sector. But expectations are for net margins to start expanding materially from the third quarter onwards. For the full year 2013, net margins are expected to top the 2006 peak and expand even further in 2014.
"
1654,FDX,"The bottom-up ‘EPS’ for the S&P 500 for 2013 and 2014 currently stands at $109.18 and $121.72, respectively. The top-down ‘EPS’ estimates for 2013 and 2014 currently stand at $107.83 and $114.80. (Note: All the data in this report is based on bottom-up estimates).

"
1677,FDX,"Market anxieties about the future of the Fed’s QE program have eased a bit after clarifications from Fed officials that no imminent tapering decision was in the cards. Bernanke was fairly explicit in his guidance on the issue, but the bond market’s reaction appears to have forced the Fed into retreat. At least that’s how some of us are seeing the pronouncements from Fed officials in recent days. Did the Bond Market Stare Down the Fed?
"
1678,FDX,"The Fed will remain in the spotlight this holiday-shortened week, with investors evaluating each of the week’s top-tier economic reports from the Fed’s perspective. The most important report doesn’t arrive till after the July 4th holiday, when June non-farm payrolls come out on Friday. Other major reports include the two ISM surveys, the ADP jobs report, motor vehicle sales, and construction spending.
"
1679,FDX,"Earnings wouldn’t be the focus this week, with Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) as the notable report coming out. But the earnings reporting cycle is about to take the spotlight with Alcoa’s (AA) release on July 8th. The Q2 earnings season has already gotten underway, with results from Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), Accenture (ACN), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and others.
"
1680,FDX,"Accenture’s weak guidance reconfirms what we saw in the recent Oracle report about macro issues weighing on corporate spending outlook. Importantly, it puts us on notice about what to expect from IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) and others in the coming days.
"
1681,FDX,"As has become customary at the start of recent quarterly earnings cycles, expectations for the Q2 earnings season remain quite low. A major driver of these low expectations is company guidance during the Q1 earnings season, which was overwhelmingly on the negative side. Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be down -0.3% from the same period last year on -0.5% lower revenues and almost flat margins. This is sharply down from +3.9% growth expected in the quarter in early April.
"
1682,FDX,"Nine of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to show negative earnings growth in Q2. But the growth picture in Q2 is even more underwhelming when Finance is excluded from the data. Outside of Finance, total earnings for the S&P 500 would be down -4.3%. Total earnings were up +2.4% in Q1, but growth was expected to be in negative territory at this stage before that reporting season.Finance to the Rescue
"
1683,FDX,"Finance wasn’t a big driver of aggregate earnings growth for the S&P 500 in Q1, but takes back the lead role in Q2, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +19.5% and estimates for the group are steadily going up. Earnings for the sector were up +7.7% in Q1, which came after many quarters of double-digit growth.
"
1684,FDX,"All the industries within the Finance sector like the major banks, regional banks, brokers and insurers are expected to have positive growth. But the growth picture is particularly notable for the brokerage and investment management industry players like Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), with total earnings for the group expected to be up +38.7% in Q2 after the +2.6% gain in Q1.
"
1685,FDX,"Unlike Finance, the earnings picture for the Technology sector remains fairly weak. Total earnings for the sector are expected to be down -11.8% from the same period last year, which follows the -4.4% earnings decline in Q1. Earnings estimates for the sector have been steadily coming down as the quarter progressed, with the current -11.8% decline down from the expected decline of -3.1% in mid-April.
"
1686,FDX,"The weakest group within the Technology sector is the PC makers, with total earnings for the Computers and Office Equipment industry expected to be down -16.1% in Q2 after the -14.1% decline in Q1. Semiconductors and electronics are other Tech industries with negative earnings growth in the quarter, while the software group is expected to show modest positive growth.High Expectations for Second Half & Next Year
"
1687,FDX,"Expectations for total earnings in 2013 have come down as estimates for Q2 were revised lower, though estimates for the second half of the year and full-year 2014 have held up fairly well. The +6% growth in total earnings this year, down from +6.8% in early April, reflects a material ramp up in the second half of the year that is then expected to carry into 2014.

1688,FDX,"Combining the actual results for Q1 with estimates for Q2 gives us +1.1% year-over-year growth in total earnings in the first half of 2013. But total earnings are expected to be up +9.6% in the second half of the year and a further +11.5% in full-year 2014.
"
1689,FDX,"Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 in Q2 are expected to remain below Q1’s record level. By our calculation, aggregate bottom-up earnings in Q2 will total $246.6 billion, compared to $247.4 billion in 2012 Q2 and 2013 Q1’s record of $253 billion. The Finance sector will generate $48.9 billion or 19.8% of the S&P 500’s total Q2 earnings, while the Tech sector is expected to generate $41.2 billion or 16.7% of the index’s total earnings.
"
1690,FDX,"Finance is reclaiming its dominant earnings position in the index which was taken over by the Tech sector following the 2008 crash. Tech remained the biggest earnings producer for the S&P 500 from 2008 through 2012, but the leadership role moves back to Finance this year.
"
1691,FDX,"Finance is on track to produce $198.5 billion in 2013 (19.3% of the total), up from $173.6 billion in 2012 (17.9% of the total), while Tech is expected to produce $183 billion this year (17.8% of the total), up from $182.9 billion in 2012 (18.9% of the total).
"
1692,FDX,"For more details about the Q2 earnings expectations, please read our Earnings Trends: Q2 Earnings Expectations Remain LowTrends in Estimate Revisions
"
1693,FDX,"The revisions trend appears to have lost some ground in the last few weeks, though it still remains in neutral territory as the charts below show. The key metric in all the charts is the ‘revisions ratio’, which is the ratio of total number of upward revisions over the preceding four weeks to the total number of revisions (positive and negative) over that same period.
"
1694,FDX,"We have two charts each for 2013 and 2014. The bar charts show the current state of the ‘revisions ratio’ (as of 6/21/13), while the line charts plot the ratio’s trajectory over the preceding 24 months. As you can see below, the revisions ratio for 2013 dropped to 46% from the prior week’s 49% level, while the same for 2014 dropped to 49% from 51% the week before.
"
1695,FDX,"The ratio doesn’t tell you the ‘magnitude’ of the revisions, only the direction. The ‘50%’ level (the dark line) is the dividing line between positive and negative trends, with readings above 50% implying more positive than negative revisions. That said, our analysis shows that readings between 45% and 55% don’t offer material insights into the magnitude of revisions. It is only readings above 55% and below 45% that offer bullish and bearish signals about the magnitude of earnings revisions.
"
1696,FDX,"As you can see in the charts above, the revisions trend for the S&P 500 as a whole is still in neutral territory, the current level (46% for 2013) is down from three weeks back (56% at the end of May). Finance has been in bullish trend for weeks now, but the revisions trend for the Tech sector also seems to be moving in that direction now.
"
1697,FDX,"Hard to tell how sustainable the trend will prove to be, but the sector’s revisions ratio for 2013 currently (as of 6/21) stands at 56.8%, down from the prior week’s level, but still the highest level in over 12 months. Some of the stand-out revisions in the sector were industry players like Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report). Salesforce.com (CRM) is the only Tech sector firm that has suffered material negative revisions lately.  
"
1698,FDX,"Finance continues to be in bullish territory for both this year and next (the blue line) even though the revisions ratio has come down lately. The sector’s revisions ratio currently (as of 6/21) stands at 69% for 2013 (down from 72% the week before) and 73% for 2014 (down from 74%), signaling good times ahead for the sector.
"
1699,FDX,"The trend makes perfect sense as higher interest rates may be a hindrance for other industries, but they are beneficial for the Finance sector’s earnings. Flat net-interest margins have been a permanent feature of the sector’s, particularly banking’s, earnings picture in recent quarters. The Finance sector’s positive earnings outlook is a function of the rising trend in interest rates.
"
1700,FDX,"On the negative side, the revisions trend is decidedly in bearish territory for Industrials and Basic Materials both for this year and next. Peabody Energy (BTU), U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report), Joy Global (JOY), Freeport-McMoran (FCX  -  Free Report) have all suffered significant negative estimate revisions lately.
"
1701,FDX,"The market is full time on Fed watch at present, trying to handicap the future of the QE program. This mood is likely to continue through the summer months, though the start of the 2013 Q2 earnings season in a few days could potentially spotlight another source of vulnerability of the market. Expectations for earnings growth have been coming down as the quarter has progressed and currently remain fairly low.
"
1702,FDX,"The growth picture is even more underwhelming when Finance is excluded from the aggregate growth tally. Given these low expectations, it wouldn’t take much for companies to beat them. But positive earnings surprises may not mean much anymore, since roughly two-thirds of them beat earnings expectations anyway. We have seen that play out with the handful of results from the likes of Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report) and others already. More than earnings surprises, we will be looking for top-line surprises in Q2, particularly after the unusually weak revenue results in Q1.
"
1703,FDX,"Guidance is always important, but it has assumed even more significance this time around given the elevated expectations for the second half of the year. Earnings growth was barely above +1% in the first half of 2013, but it is expected to jump to +9.7% in the back half of the year. Importantly, the growth expectations for the second half of the year are not due to easy comparisons – the level of total earnings in the 2013 Q3 and Q4 each represent new all-time high records.
"
1704,FDX,"My sense is that estimates need to come down in a big way. The market hasn’t cared much in the recent past about negative revisions as aggregate earnings estimates have been coming down for over a year now. But if we are entering a post-QE world, as I believe we are, then it would be difficult to overlook negative earnings estimate revisions.Key Points
"
1705,FDX,"Expectations remain low, with total earnings for the S&P companies expected to be down -0.3% from the same period last year, reflecting -0.5% lower revenues and flat margins. This follows +2.4% earnings growth in Q1 on +0.5% revenue growth.
"
1706,FDX,"Estimates for Q2 have come down materially since the quarter got underway, with the current -0.3% decline down from +3.9% growth in total earnings in early April.
"
1707,FDX,"Finance is the only major sector with a strong growth profile, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +19.6% in Q2. This follows +7.7% earnings growth in Q1 and many quarters of double-digit gains for the sector.
"
1708,FDX,"Finance reclaims its leadership role in the S&P 500, contributing more earnings to the index’s total than Technology this year for the first time since the 2008 crisis. The sector is expected to account for 19.3% of total S&P 500 earnings in 2013 compared to Technology’s 17.8%.   
"
1709,FDX,"Technology earnings were weak in Q1 and they are even weaker this time around, with total earnings for the sector expected to decline -11.8% in Q2 after declining -4.4% in Q1. Weakness in hardware and semi-conductor industries more than offset the modest growth in software earnings.
"
1710,FDX,"Estimates for the second half of the year still reflect strong growth, with total earnings in the second half of the year expected to increase by +9.7% after the +1.1% increase in the first half. Total earnings are expected to be up 6% in 2013 and +11.6% in 2014.
"
1711,FDX,"While there is not much growth, the overall level of total earnings is quite high. Total earnings were an all-time record at $253 billion in Q1 and are expected to total $246.8 billion in Q2. For the full year, earnings are expected total $1.03 trillion in 2013 and $1.15 trillion in 2014.   
"
1712,FDX,"Net margins are expected to be essentially flat in Q2, but start expanding from the third quarter onwards. For the full year 2013, net margins are expected to top the 2006 peak and expand even more in 2014.
"
1713,FDX,"The bottom-up ‘EPS’ for the S&P 500 for 2013 and 2014 currently stands at $109.18 and $121.72, respectively. The top-down ‘EPS’ estimates for 2013 and 2014 currently stand at $107.83 and $114.80. It seems that Wall Street strategists are a bit less enthusiastic about the earnings picture than the analysts.Q2 Earnings Expectations Remain Low

"
1721,FDX,"Growth expectations remain weak, a reflection of underwhelming management guidance and tough comparisons -- the first quarter of 2012 remains the high point of quarterly earnings since the current earnings cycle got underway in 2009. These tough comparisons are particularly pronounced in the Finance sector, which is expected to experience an earnings decline after many quarters of double-digit growth. The outlook for Tech is even weaker and fairly widespread, which would come after the sector’s underwhelming results in the previous quarter. 
"
1722,FDX,"But the lack of growth in the first quarter is not much of a concern for the market, as investors are looking ahead to period of robust growth later in the year, particularly in the back half of 2013 and all of 2014. The expectation is that the +0.9% earnings growth in the first half of 2013 will be followed by double-digit earnings growth in the second half of the year and into next year. Driving these optimistic growth expectations are strong revenue gains and further expansion in margins which are already in record territory.  
"
1723,FDX,"Revenue growth is a function of economic growth.

"
1760,FDX,"While Cyprus continues to provide some background noise, the focus today is on the Fed which concludes its two-day meeting this afternoon. In addition to the post-meeting statement, we will also be getting the economic forecasts of individual FOMC members and hear from Bernanke himself in the press conference. The issue at hand is the future of the Fed’s $85 billion a month bond-purchase program which has done more than anything else in pushing stocks to the current all-time high levels. As such, it’s more than just an academic exercise among economists.  
"
1761,FDX,"Recent economic data has broadly been favorable. The housing momentum remains in place, as confirmed by Tuesday’s strong February Housing Starts and Permits numbers. The labor market seems to be improving as well, with the weekly Jobless Claims numbers now under the 350K level, and even the factory sector seems to be showing signs of life again. In fact, the gains in household buying power as a result of the improving labor market and wealth effect from stock market and housing strength is helping offset the negative impact from higher taxes and gasoline prices. Last week’s better than expected February Retail Sales data prompted many analysts to raise their estimates for GDP growth in the current and coming quarters. This improving GDP growth backdrop has put the spotlight firmly on the Fed’s QE program.  
"
1762,FDX,"The Fed is unlikely to announce any changes to the QE program today, but they will likely acknowledge the improving economic scene in the post-meeting statement as well as in the individual forecasts. We know from the minutes of the last two FOMC meetings that a strong group of the committee members are in favor of at least ending the open-ended nature of the current QE program, to give itself more flexibility to respond to changing economic conditions. We wouldn’t see any evidence of those discussions in today’s statement, but they will come out next month in this meeting’s minutes.  
"
1763,FDX,"For now, the core of QE supporters within the FOMC, comprised of Bernanke, Yellen, and Dudley, will hold their ground and continue with the program. Given the expected drag on economic growth from the budget sequester and other fiscal austerity measures, they will be looking for at least a couple of more quarters of steady economic growth before making changes to the program. But even then, they are unlikely to outright stop the program. They will most likely curtail the program at first, say from $85 billion a month to $40 billion a month, sometime in the back half of the year, before looking at ending it in the first half of 2014. All of this is contingent on the current favorable economic momentum continuing in the coming months and quarters. But as we saw in each of the last three years when the economy lost steam in the Spring/Summer months after positive starts earlier on, current expectations of the economy may not pan out.  
"
1764,FDX,"Bernanke aside, we are getting ready for the start of the first quarter 2013 earnings season. The FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report)) report this morning doesn’t inspire much confidence in what may be in store this earnings season, but expectations have fallen enough that we will likely see another good enough earnings season. It’s not hard to draw that conclusion from the Adobe ((ADBE  -  Free Report)) and Lennar ((LEN  -  Free Report)) positive surprises this morning. Overall, total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be down -3.9% from the same period last year, which will compare to the +2% final growth tally in the preceding quarter.  
"
1765,FDX,"The expectation is that earnings growth bottoms in the current period, starts rebounding in the second quarter, and then growth accelerates in the back half of the year. This translates to a +6.7% earnings growth in 2013 and an impressive +11.7% growth next year. These positive earnings growth expectations reflect favorable outlook for the U.S. and global economy this year and next. The Fed appears to be skeptical of this optimistic view – why else would they continue with the enormous $85 billion a month bond purchase program. Perhaps we should be skeptical as well.

While we are a bit light on the data front today, but the rest of this week brings a number of top-tier economic and earnings reports. But the focus will remain on the ‘Fiscal Cliff’ question.
"
1769,FDX,"Housing is a major component of this week’s data, with Tuesday bringing the December homebuilder sentiment index, Wednesday the November Housing Starts numbers, and Existing Home sales data on Thursday. The expectation is for Housing Starts to pullback modestly from the prior month’s level, while the homebuilder sentiment index is expected to be essentially unchanged from the month earlier level.
"
1770,FDX,"Other major reports this week include the November Personal Income & Outlays and Durable Goods reports on Friday and the final read on third quarter GDP on Thursday. Expectations for GDP growth in the fourth quarter have been steadily coming down in recent weeks and currently stand a little under 1.5%, with the growth pace not much better in the first quarter of 2013 either.
"
1771,FDX,"Expectations for the back half of 2013 are for much higher growth pace, though it’s hard to envision how the momentum will shift. A Wall Street Journal report today quoting a Dow Jones Newswires survey shows major Wall Street firms expecting treasury bond yields to rise in 2013. Most prominent among these major brokerage firms are the 21 primary dealers, who underwrite treasury bond sales and deal directly with the Fed.
"
1772,FDX,"The median 10-year Treasury bond yield forecast for the primary dealers is for a roughly 50 basis point rise by the end of 2013 – from the roughly 1.71% as of Friday’s close 2.25% by the end of the year. Yield on the same security was at 1.88% at the end of 2011.
"
1773,FDX,"This makes perfect sense, for two reasons. First, yields have been so low for so long that the only direction they should be moving going forward is – higher. Second, if anyone in the market has a good understanding of the Treasury bond market, it is most likely the firms that underwrite the securities – meaning the primary dealers.
"
1774,FDX,"The only problem is that the primary dealers had come out with similar forecasts in 2011 and 2010, but unfortunately things turned out differently. Maybe the third time is the charm. But it’s not easy for anyone, even the primary dealers, to ‘fight the Fed.’ With the Fed committed to adding more than a $1 trillion worth of treasury and mortgage bonds to its balance sheet in 2013, it is perhaps reasonable to be skeptical of Wall Street’s treasury yield forecast for 2013 as well.
"
1775,FDX,"These economic growth questions have a direct bearing on the corporate earnings outlook for 2013 as well. The fourth quarter earnings season gets underway this week with Oracle’s (ORCL  -  Free Report) quarterly report after the close on Tuesday, though we are still a few weeks away from the ‘unofficial’ start of the earnings cycle with Alcoa’s (AA) release on January 8th. Other major reports this week include FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Discover Financial (DFS  -  Free Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report).
"
1776,FDX,"Earnings expectations for the fourth quarter have been steadily coming down over the last three months, with total earnings expected to be up 1.2% from the same period last year. This is a sharp drop from the roughly 7% earnings growth expected just three months ago. But even as expectations for the fourth quarter have come down, we haven’t seen much downward adjustment to expectations for 2013, which still shows earnings growth rate of more than 10%.
"
1777,FDX,"The same thinking that is looking for the economy and Treasury yields to start rising in the second half of 2013 appear to also at play in looking for 10%-plus earnings growth. Maybe it’s just me, but I find it hard to buy into these expectations.RELATED ARTICLESWill December Mirror November Sales?Defensive Sector ETFs for the Fiscal Cliff4 Best New ETFs of 2012

1780,FDX,"What's nice to see here is that this index has already recovered its 50-day moving average. It still needs to ""own"" it by dipping below and coming back hard above. And for a general indication that the bullish trend is still intact, you need look no further than the rising 100 and 200-day moving averages.
"
1781,FDX,"Next up is the Dow Transports, which include stocks like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and other trucking/shipping companies, as well as the airlines and rails. Even if you don't follow Dow Theory, you've probably heard that this index has had trouble confirming the rise in the industrial average as ""companies that move stuff"" have struggled all year in a choppy sideways grind lower between 4850 and 5250 since the June lows.
"
1782,FDX,"Some say this is an out-of-date theory in the age of the semiconductor, but it's still worth looking at in this 3-year weekly chart because if the Trannies can break that downward trend line, it could be confirming lots of broad strength for the indexes and the economy.
"
1783,FDX,"Our third chart is a look at the small-caps via the Russell 2000 index. This baby was obviously the leader going down since the September highs, as investors couldn't shed growth-sensitive small caps fast enough going into the election.
"
1784,FDX,"What is a little troublesome here is all the gaps on the way up since the November 16 low. The ""RUT"" has been following the lead of the S&P and playing catch-up as well. It probably has to digest some of these gains and work off the afterburner fumes. Finding support at its sideways 100 and 200-day moving averages would be constructive.
"
1785,FDX,"Number four is a look across the pond. Surprisingly, many European stocks and indexes are looking better than they have in over a year. This surprised me anyway because I expected that we haven't seen the bottom in the European recession and that their stocks would reflect this.
"
1786,FDX,"Is this optimism for European stocks all about the ECB getting some degree of QE religion? Not sure, but it doesn't hurt the outlook for global risk appetite, so I'll take it!
"
1787,FDX,"Finally, let's look at the Dow. I rarely look at the Dow for any reason because it is an out-dated price-weighted index. I couldn't tell you where it closed on any given day. (I make up for that ignorance by focusing on every twitch in the S&P 500.)
"
1788,FDX,"What stands out here is that the Dow has recovered its 200-day very nicely, which happens to be right around the 13,000 round mark. And the 50 and 100-day MAs should be magnets to attract it higher soon, hopefully.
"
1789,FDX,"I say ""hopefully"" because the 50-day is sloping down fast and the 100-day is flat-lining. Either the mighty Dow can ramp up through them, or it's going to spend Christmas below 13,000.
"
1790,FDX,"What Do You See in These Charts?
"
1791,FDX,"So that's the view from the charts. I didn't promise you all good news, but the overall picture is pretty healthy. If Washington gets its act together in the next few weeks, we could see an extension of the rally especially as a short squeeze kicks in.
"
1792,FDX,"Will we see new highs in 2012? That bet is not looking so promising anymore. I'd settle for a run to S&P 1450 and I think we can buy dips to 1375. A break of 1370 would have me seriously rethinking my bullish thesis.
"
1793,FDX,"But every chart can have multiple interpretations, depending on what matters to you most (other indicators perhaps) and what your timeframe is. The ETF swing trader sees dramatically different things than the investor with a 1-year horizon.
"
1794,FDX,"Tell me what you see and what you think in the comments section below.
"
1795,FDX,"And next week, I'll look at charts for specific sectors to get a gauge on risk appetite in cyclical areas like Technology, Financials, and Industrials. If I'm still bullish in these areas (highly likely), I'll be answering this question...

1798,FDX,"A lot of the weakness in the ongoing third quarter earnings season is attributable to problems in the Chinese economy. Europe obviously is also an issue, but it’s the loss of growth momentum in China that is showing up in a range of industries this earnings season.
"
1799,FDX,"We have heard the China growth issue mentioned on earnings calls from companies as diverse as FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) to Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report), Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) and Coach (COH). The domestic economic picture is not that pretty either, but it is in far better shape compared to what is going on beyond the U.S. shores.
"
1800,FDX,"Given this China fixation, it would make sense for the market to feel some ease on the sign that the country’s manufacturing sector may be improving. This morning’s preliminary October PMI by the HSBC Bank (HBC) shows the measure improving to a three-month high, though it still remains below the ‘50’ level.
"
1801,FDX,"This comes after other key measures of economic activity, particularly export growth and industrial production, also showed signs that the economy may have bottomed already and will start stabilizing in the coming quarters. Conclusive evidence on that front should offset the earnings deterioration trend currently in play. But we will likely have to wait a bit longer for that evidence to emerge.
"
1802,FDX,"On the earnings front, the positive looking numbers from Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) are not enough to change the overall weak tone of this reporting season. In terms of a running scorecard, we have third quarter results from 179 companies in the S&P 500 as of this morning (Wednesday, October 24th).
"
1803,FDX,"Total earnings for these 179 companies are down 2.9% from the same period last year, with only 57% of the companies beating earnings expectations. On the revenue side, the growth rate is a bit better, though only 33% of the 179 companies have come ahead of revenue expectations.
"
1804,FDX,"This is a materially weaker performance than what these same companies did in recent quarters. Importantly, the tone and substance of guidance has been on the weaker side, which means that we will likely see an acceleration in negative estimate revisions over the coming days and weeks.RELATED ARTICLESHow Do You Invest For The Housing Recovery?Apple's New Gadgets Thrill and DisappointIs The Uptrend Intact?

1805,FDX,"In a customer-friendly move, United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) has broadened the reach of its UPS WorldWide Express Service. Following the expansion, the service can be availed in 124 countries and territories across the globe. The measure aims to facilitate the delivery of urgent shipments in markets offering high-growth potential.In fact, UPS seems to be constantly expanding the scope of this service as it is highly favored by companies for global shipments that are time-sensitive by nature. Depending on the destination, customers availing of this service are guaranteed delivery within 1-3 business days by 10:30 a.m., noon, or 2 p.m.Last year, the UPS Express Service was added to 7,000 postal codes in 57 countries and territories, including the likes of India, Brazil and South Korea.European Union Sued by UPS Over TNT Acquisition BlockadeApart from the above expansionary measure, UPS was in the news when it reportedly sued the European Union to the tune of approximately 1.7 billion euros ($2.1 billion) plus interest and taxes. UPS is asking for the amount to compensate it for wrongly blocking its attempts to take over Dutch delivery firm TNT Express. We remind the investors that UPS’ efforts to acquire TNT Express were thwarted by European regulators in 2013.The regulators had blocked deal citing UPS’ massive European presence. They were of the opinion that the materialization of the deal  would lead to limited competition in the European delivery market.In the previous year, an EU court had stated that it was wrong on the part of European Commission to block the deal from materializing, per a Reuters report. In fact, UPS’ decision to sue the EU was natural after the submission by the EU court. Following UPS’ failure to close the deal, rival FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) acquired TNT Express in 2016, for approximately €4.4 billion, thereby boosting its European presence.Now with UPS seeking compensation from the EU over blocking its attempts to buy TNT express, we expect investor focus to remain on this burning issue. Additionally, in the event of UPS eventually receiving the hefty amount claimed, its already strong balance sheet is expected to be strengthened further.UPS’ sound financial position can be made out from the fact that its board of directors cleared an approximately 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to 91 cents per share ($3.64 annually) on Feb 8. Apart from UPS, other transportation companies like Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report) have raised their dividend payouts recently.(NOTE: We are reissuing this article to correct an error.

1807,FDX,"FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Dec 19.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 20.8%. Earnings (excluding 32 cents from non-recurring items) of $2.51 per share significantly fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.17. Furthermore, the bottom line declined 13.5% on a year-over-year basis due to higher costs.Quarterly revenues increased 4.3% year over year to $15,297 million, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,368.7 million. The top line was hurt primarily due to the TNT Express cyberattack.Things do not look up for the FedEx stock this quarter either. Let’s look into the factors responsible for such a bleak outlook.Factors Likely at PlayFedEx's operations have been hurt by the TNT Express cyberattack in June. The effects of the attack are expected to hamper results in the second quarter too. Additionally, rising costs might affect the company’s bottom line growth. Moreover, expenses related to the integration process of TNT Express and the increased investments at its Ground unit are also likely to negatively impact the bottom line in the quarter to be reported.The company’s efforts to meet the surging demand in the peak holiday season are increasing delivery costs with potential to further hit the quarterly earnings performance.The company’s high-debt levels further add to its woes.However, strong growth of e-commerce is anticipated to boost the top line in the quarter. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at the FedEx Express (including TNT Express) division stands at $8,911 million, higher than $6,743 million a year ago. For Ground and Freight revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4,793 million and $1,685 million, respectively, greater than the year-ago figures of $4,419 and $1,597 million, respectively.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that FedEx is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: FedEx has an Earnings ESP of -0.59%.

1808,FDX,"Shares of the major transportation companies surged on Dec 4. The uptick was primarily due to the Senate’s approval of the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in three decades by a 51-49 vote in the early hours of Dec 2.Consequently, the Dow Jones Transportation Average — a price-weighted average of 20 U.S. transportation securities — ended the day 1.8% higher, thereby closing at 10,368.58. The Index includes railroads, truckers, marine transportation, delivery services and logistics companies, apart from the airlines. Hence, the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index can easily be considered as a true representative of the U.S. transportation division.With the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index performing exceptionally well, it was no surprise that most participants had a field day. In fact, stocks like FedEx Corp. (FDX  -  Free Report) and United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) that dominate and define the Zacks Air Freight and Cargo Industry gained 3.6% and 2.8% on the day, thereby hitting their respective 52-week highs of $239.05 and $123.02.Other notable gainers from railroads include — Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) (up 4.4%) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) (up 1.7%) — and from airlines — Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) (up 3.5%), JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) (up 3.1%) and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) (up 2.1%).All the above-mentioned stocks with the exception of FedEx and Alaska Air Group carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Tax BillWith the Senate clearing its version of the tax reform bill, President Donald Trump has secured his first major legislative win after more than 10 months in office. We note that the House had passed its version of the tax bill in mid-November. The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package is expected to be enacted into law by year-end, following resolution of the differences in the two versions.As various market watchers seem to debate over the pros and cons of the tax reform bill, we expect transportation stocks in the United States to be a major beneficiary. The optimism was reflected by the buoyant performance of the sector participants in the stock market on Dec 4.Both versions propose to reduce corporate taxes from the current 35% to 20%. On materialization, this huge reduction will naturally benefit transportation stocks in the United States. Most sector participants book a significant part of their revenues, domestically. Therefore, the 15-point cut in corporate tax rate should boost cash flow, which in turn will aid their bottom lines.The proposal aims to provide incentives to companies to repatriate accumulated profits from overseas with an even lower tax rate than they otherwise would’ve shelled out. Currently, if foreign income is repatriated, it is taxed at 35% with a full credit of the local levies.Capital ExpendituresTransportation stocks — mainly railroads and airlines — invest significantly for capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. For example, Union Pacific has announced a $3.1 billion capital plan this year, which is in line with its efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity.In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. Consequently, U.S. companies need to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately, as per the provisions of the tax reform bill. Naturally, this aspect of the bill hugely favors transports and if it materializes companies in the space would be huge gainers.In the event of companies being able to deduct capital expenses in the year of their occurrence, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases among others.Picture for AirlinesApart from railroads and package delivery companies, stocks belonging to the airline space also are expected to be huge benefactors from the U.S. tax overhaul. The capital-intensive nature of the industry implies that the above-mentioned benefits pertaining to capital expenses should aid carriers as well.Since most airline companies are almost entirely exposed to the statutory corporate tax rate, the massive tax cut is expected to help them save a considerable amount in tax payment in the United States.In fact, most market watchers believe that the tax cut would benefit low-cost carriers like Alaska Air and JetBlue Airways more than the legacy carriers. This is because the likes of Delta had emerged from bankruptcy a few years ago. Consequently, their current incomes are still being offset by prior losses. Naturally, they do not stand to be benefitted immediately (tangibly) by the tax cuts. However, their smaller rivals like JetBlue are immediate gainers from the tax cuts as they were paying higher taxes till now.Price PerformanceFollowing the recovery from the negative effects of the back-to-back natural calamities stocks in transportation space have been performing well recently. Additionally, an  improving economy, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have been a blessing for the sector participants. Also, consumer confidence remains strong resulting in more Americans going on vacations.The fact that things are looking up for transports can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Transportation industry has outperformed the S&P 500 Index over the last month. While the industry rallied 4.4%, the S&P 500 Index has gained 2% in the same period. With the corporate tax cut likely to become a reality, transports are expected to gain further in the coming days. Naturally, investors will keenly wait for further updates on this burning issue.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1809,FDX,"FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, after the closing bell on Mar 20.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 10.8%. It reported better-than-expected results owing to increased package volumes during the peak holiday season. Both the top as well as the bottom line increased 9.3% and 13.6%, respectively, in the second quarter.Let’s see how things are shape up for this announcement.    Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that FedEx is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the perfect combination of the following two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: FedEx has an Earnings ESP of +2.20%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $3.13 per share and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, pegged lower at $3.06. A favourable Zacks ESP is indicative of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: FedEx carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that the stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates. Together with a positive ESP, the combination makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.FedEx Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  FedEx Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | FedEx Corporation QuoteWhat is Driving Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Strong growth of e-commerce is likely to boost results in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at the FedEx Express (including TNT Express) division stands at $9,127 million, much above the year-ago reported figure of $6,779 million. For Ground and Freight revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $5,170 million and $1,612 million, respectively, greater than the year-ago figures of $4,688 million and $1,492 million.The new tax law, which reduces corporate tax rate significantly, is a huge positive for transportation stocks and FedEx is no exception. With decreased corporate taxes, the company’s bottom line is likely to get a boost in the to-be-reported quarter.Additionally, the company has hiked shipping rates since January 2018. Notably, FedEx Express, Ground, Freight and Home Delivery shipping rates in the United States have been increased by an average of 4.9%. This move is in turn anticipated to aid the company’s top line in the period to be reported.However, high costs are likely to hurt the company’s bottom line in the third quarter. Significant investments at the company's Ground unit have been pushing up costs. Moreover, the company’s high debt-levels are a cause for worry.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may also consider the following stocks, which have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat in the upcoming releases:American Airlines Group Inc.

1810,FDX,"Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (HTZ  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 27. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 3.4%.In fact, Hertz missed the Zacks Consensus Estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 130.2%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to ExpectThe question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Hertz will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a loss of 58 cents per share, which reflects an improvement from a loss of 71 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.04 billion, up 1.4% from the year-ago quarter.Hertz Global Holdings, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Hertz Global Holdings, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hertz Global Holdings, Inc QuoteFurthermore, we note that the stock has outperformed the broader industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have surged 13.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 6.4%.Factors at PlayWhile Hertz’s performance remained disappointing in the last few quarters, the company remains on track with the execution of its turnaround plan that is focused on growth through enhanced fleet, service, brands and technology. In the most recent quarter, the company gained from persistent enhancement of fleet offerings, expansion of the Ultimate Choice program and a strategic focus on optimizing revenue management. The company remains dedicated to positioning Hertz as a leader in the global rental car market by strengthening the business to drive predictable and sustainable long-term growth.However, the company believes, there is a lot of work left before it fully turns around its results. Moreover, structural issues with the car rental model remain a concern. The company describes the fourth quarter as a period of seasonally lower demand. At the same time, the company remains keen on continuing its investments for long-term growth. This suggests that expenses will be higher throughout 2018. These factors make us slightly cautious about the upcoming results.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hertz is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1811,FDX,"The U.S. equity market has been on a roller-coaster of late. In fact, Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1,033 points or 4.2%  on Feb 8. Other major bourses – the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq — also finished in the red on the same day.In fact, this was the second time in a week that the Dow shed over 1,000 points in a day after the 1,175 points decline on Feb 5. Following the latest U.S. sell-off, both the Dow as well as the S&P 500 are officially into the correction territory, down more than 10% from the recent all-time high reached in January.The steep sell-off was due to the stronger-than-expected job addition along with fastest wage growth in more than eight years. These factors, in turn, triggered fears of inflation and bolstered expectations that the Fed could take a more aggressive stance in hiking rates than previously expected.Furthermore, heightened volatility on the back of a significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) — Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge — which currently is more than 30 (near the highest level since August 2015) indicates bearish market prospects. Notably, any reading above the 20 mark indicates bearish outlook in the equity market.Given this backdrop, investing in companies that not only pay consistent dividends but also raise the same seem to prudent. This is because such companies are financially stable and mature, and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions.Transportation Stocks Riding HighA sector that boasts well-paying stocks in terms of dividends, is the one having transportation stocks. Transports have been having a good time lately after being laid low for most of 2017, due to various headwinds like back-to-back hurricanes, increased costs to name a few.Also, the string of outperformances (in terms of earnings as well as revenues) by the key sector participants like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) in fourth-quarter 2017 bears testimony to the improved scenario surrounding the highly-diversified Zacks Transportation sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).Factors Behind the ResurgenceRailroads are one of the most important sub-groups in the transportation sector. After facing multiple challenges over the past few years due to coal-related winds, stocks in the space seem to have bounced back on improvements in the coal scenario.Particularly with Donald Trump’s presidency, the coal industry is witnessing better days. In fact, Trump is aiming to revive the industry by relaxing regulations, which were hurting its prospects. Apart from coal, the scenario pertaining to another key source of revenues for railroads — intermodal — has improved by leaps and bounds lately.Airlines — another important sub-group in the broader sector – are also seeing good times now, courtesy of the improved demand for air travel. For 2018, the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) predicts global net profit of $38.4 billion for the industry. This is much higher than the profitability forecast of $34.5 billion for the current year.Moreover, package delivery companies like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) performed well on the back of e-commerce growth in the most recent holiday season. This further highlights the optimism surrounding transports.Trump’s Tax Overhaul — A BoonOn Dec 22, 2017, Trump signed the much-anticipated tax bill into law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). Under the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package, corporate tax rates have been slashed to 21% from 35%. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to boost cash flow, which in turn will aid earnings of transportation stocks.Apart from the significant drop in corporate tax rate, the new law allows these companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of their occurrence, which was not allowed earlier. This aspect hugely favors transportation stocks as they invest substantially toward capital expenditures. As a result, their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions.For example, Delta, which expects revenues in 2018 to increase between 4% and 6% on a year-over-year basis lifted its earnings per share guidance anticipating the new tax law to boost its results. The company now expects earnings per share in the range of $6.35 to $6.70 (previous outlook: $5.35 to $5.70).Shareholder-Friendly Activities Likely to Pick Up PaceAs noted above, many stocks in the transportation space reward shareholders through dividend payments and buybacks. For example, United Continental Holdings — a key transportation player — announced a new buyback program late last year. Moreover, the likes of Delta and Kansas City Southern hiked their quarterly dividend payouts in 2017.Following the new tax law, we expect an increase in these shareholder-friendly activities from various transportation companies. Due to the significant reduction in their tax bills, more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others.Dividend Paying Transports — A Prudent ChoiceIn view of the above-mentioned tailwinds, we believe that stocks from the transportation space should be in one’s portfolio. Moreover, picking dividend stocks seems prudent during uncertain times like the current scenario.Consequently, we have zeroed in on five stocks in this high flying space, which have a strong dividend paying history. Also, these companies have raised their dividend payouts recently. All the chosen stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our first choice is, UPS, the world's largest express carrier. Markedly, UPS provides specialized transportation and logistics services in the United States and internationally. UPS’ board of directors cleared an approximately 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to 91 cents per share ($3.64 annually) on Feb 8. The first installment of the new dividend will be paid on Mar 7, 2018 to the stockholders of record on Feb 20.The raised dividend highlights UPS’ commitment to create value for shareholders and underscores the company’s strong financial condition as well as bright prospects, going forward.Also, it has an impressive record with respect to dividends. The company has been rewarding shareholders with cash dividends regularly since 1969 and has more than quadrupled its dividend payout since it went public in 1999.Furthermore, the company’s Momentum Score of A highlights its short-term attractiveness. Notably, the Zacks Momentum Style Score indicates when the timing is right to grab a stock and make the most of its momentum.Our next choice is Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report), which provides rail transportation services across 23 states in the United States through its principal operating company, Union Pacific Railroad Company.On Feb 8, this railroad operator’s board of directors a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 73 cents per share (annualized $2.92 per share). The first installment of the raised dividend will be paid on Mar 30, 2018 to shareholders as of Feb 28.In fact, this is the company’s second dividend hike in three months.  In November 2017, the company had announced a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 66.5 cents per share. We believe that two dividend hikes in such a short span reflect the increased financial prosperity following the introduction of the new tax law.Additionally, the company has an impressive dividend history having rewarded shareholders through dividends for 119 consecutive years.The next member in our list is also a railroad operator — Norfolk Southern.  Last month, the company's board of directors increased its quarterly dividend to 72 cents per share (annualized $2.88 per share) from 61 cents per share (annualized $2.44 per share). The first instalment of the new dividend is payable Mar 10, 2018 to shareholders of record on Feb 2.Moreover, it has an impressive record with respect to dividends. The company has paid dividends for 142 consecutive quarters, since inception in 1982.GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report) is our next choice. This leading global railcar lessor specializes in railcar and locomotive operating leasing, aircraft operating leasing, information technology leasing, and venture finance for customers in diverse industrial sectors worldwide.On Jan 26, 2018, the company’s board of directors cleared a 5% hike in its quarterly dividend to 44 cents per share ($1.76 annually). The first instalment of the new dividend is payable Mar 31, 2018 to shareholders of record on Mar 5.Also, it has an impressive record with respect to dividends. It has been paying dividends regularly since 1919. Furthermore, the company’s Momentum Score of B highlights its short-term attractiveness.The final member in our list is trucking company J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT  -  Free Report). On Jan 24, 2018, the company’s board of directors cleared an approximately 4.3% hike in its quarterly dividend to 24 cents per share (96 cents annually). The first installment of the new dividend is payable  Feb 23, 2018 to shareholders of record on Feb 9.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1812,FDX,"FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) has been in the headlines recently as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) spends money on warehouses, planes, and much more in an effort to conquer the shipping industry. Nevertheless, FedEx remains seemingly unfazed and looks poised to grow both its top and bottom lines.While some causal onlookers might hear that FedEx is doomed, its investors haven’t left. In fact, shares of FedEx have climbed nearly 28% over the last year and hit a new all-time high in mid January. The company also has plans to bolster its business through investments in order to better compete going forward.FedEx announced on Wednesday that it will invest more than $1 billion to modernize and expand its Tennessee hub in order to make it more efficient and reliable. This move comes after the shipping power made similar renovation plans earlier this year regarding its FedEx Express hub in Indianapolis.These investments in the future likely won’t pay off for some time, but in the near term, the company is still expected to see its sales and earnings surge.For the soon-to-be-reported quarter, FedEx is expected to see its sales jump by nearly 8% to hit $16.18 billion. The company is also projected to see its quarterly earnings hit $3.06 per share, which would mark 30.2% growth from the year-ago period. Still, investors need to consider a few more metrics to understand if FedEx is poised to beat this estimate.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.FedEx currently has an Earnings ESP of 2.2%, which means earnings estimates have been higher directly ahead of FDX’s Q3 results. When paired with the company’s current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) standing, investors should consider the stock as one that seems ready to top estimates.Investors should also note that FedEx topped its earnings estimate by 10.8% last quarter.FedEx is set to report its fiscal third quarter 2018 earnings results after market close on Tuesday, March 20.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1813,FDX,"In a customer-friendly move, United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) has broadened the reach of its UPS WorldWide Express Service. Following the expansion, the service can be availed in 124 countries and territories across the globe. The measure aims to facilitate the delivery of urgent shipments in markets offering high-growth potential.In fact, UPS seems to be constantly expanding the scope of this service as it is highly favored by companies for global shipments that are time-sensitive by nature. Depending on the destination, customers availing of this service are guaranteed delivery within 1-3 business days by 10:30 a.m., noon, or 2 p.m.Last year, the UPS Express Service was added to 7,000 postal codes in 57 countries and territories, including the likes of India, Brazil and South Korea.European Union Sued by UPS Over TNT Acquisition BlockadeApart from the above expansionary measure, UPS was in the news when it reportedly sued the European Union to the tune of approximately 1.7 billion euros ($2.1 billion) plus interest and taxes. UPS is asking for the amount to compensate it for wrongly blocking its attempts to take over Dutch delivery firm TNT Express. We remind the investors that UPS’ efforts to acquire TNT Express were thwarted by European regulators in 2013.The regulators had blocked deal citing UPS’ massive European presence. They were of the opinion that the materialization of the deal  would lead to limited competition in the European delivery market.In the previous year, an EU court had stated that it was wrong on the part of European Commission to block the deal from materializing, per a Reuters report. In fact, UPS’ decision to sue the EU was natural after the submission by the EU court. Following UPS’ failure to close the deal, rival FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) acquired TNT Express in 2016, for approximately €4.4 billion, thereby boosting its European presence.Now with UPS seeking compensation from the EU over blocking its attempts to buy TNT express, we expect investor focus to remain on this burning issue. Additionally, in the event of UPS eventually receiving the hefty amount claimed, its already strong balance sheet is expected to be strengthened further.UPS’ sound financial position can be made out from the fact that its board of directors cleared an approximately 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to 91 cents per share ($3.64 annually) on Feb 8. Apart from UPS, other transportation companies like Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report) have raised their dividend payouts recently.(NOTE: We are reissuing this article to correct an error.

1814,FDX,"The market was looking for clarity from the Fed about the future of the QE program. But it didn’t like the surprisingly explicit timeline from Chairman Bernanke, and has been in a somewhat downbeat mood ever since.
"
1815,FDX,"The after-effects of the Bernanke announcement and the resultant impact on benchmark interest rates will no doubt remain the big issues for the market this week as well, but we are also getting close to the start of the Q2 earnings season. In fact, the Q2 earnings season actually got underway last week with the earning releases from FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Adobe (ADBE), Darden (DRI  -  Free Report) and others.
"
1816,FDX,"It hasn’t been a very inspiring start thus far, but all of these companies have been grappling with lingering issues affecting their businesses for awhile and their Q2 reports didn’t indicate that they had finally turned the corner. We will see if this week’s reports from the likes of Walgreen (WAG), ConAgra (CAG  -  Free Report), Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report), Paychex (PAYX  -  Free Report) and others will show a more promising side of the earnings picture. But we will likely have to wait a bit longer for the reporting season to get really high gear -- Alcoa’s (AA) report is coming on July 8th.
"
1817,FDX,"As has become customary at the start of recent quarterly earnings cycles, expectations for the Q2 earnings season remain quite low. A major driver of these low expectations is company guidance during the Q1 earnings season, which was overwhelmingly on the negative side. Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be up only +0.5% from the same period last year.
"
1818,FDX,"This is sharply down from +3.9% growth expected in the quarter in early April. Total earnings were up +2.3% in Q1, but growth was expected to be in negative territory at this stage before that reporting season.
"
1819,FDX,"Finance wasn’t a big driver of aggregate earnings growth for the S&P 500 in Q1, but takes back the lead role in Q2, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +19.6% and estimates for the group are steadily going up. Earnings for the sector were up +7.7% in Q1, which came after many quarters of double-digit growth.
"
1820,FDX,"All the industries within the Finance sector -- major banks, regional banks, brokers and insurers -- are expected to have positive growth. But the growth picture is particularly notable for the brokerage and investment management industry players like Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), with total earnings for the group expected to be up +39.6% in Q2 after the +2.6% gain in Q1.
"
1821,FDX,"Unlike Finance, the earnings picture for the Technology sector remains fairly weak. Total earnings for the sector are expected to be down -8.7% from the same period last year, which follows the -3.8% earnings decline in Q1. Earnings estimates for the sector have been steadily coming down over recent weeks, with the current -8.7% decline down from expected decline of -3.1% in mid-April.
"
1822,FDX,"The weakest group within the Technology sector is the PC makers, with total earnings for the Computers and Office Equipment industry expected to be down -16.1% in Q2 after the -14.1% decline in Q1. Semiconductors and electronics are other Tech industries with negative earnings growth in the quarter.
"
1823,FDX,"Expectations for full-years 2013 and 2014 have come down far less than what we have seen for Q2 estimates. In fact, it is reasonable to assume that given the improving outlook for the Finance sector, aggregate estimates will start rising after a very long time in the coming weeks.
"
1824,FDX,"The +6.1% growth in total earnings this year, down from +6.8% in early April, reflects a material ramp up in the second half of the year that is then expected to carry into 2014. Combining the actual results for Q1 with estimates for Q2 gives us +1.5% year-over-year growth in total earnings in the first half of 2013. But total earnings are expected to be up +9.4% in the second half of the year and a further +11.5% in full-year 2014.
"
1825,FDX,"Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 in Q2 are expected to remain to below Q1’s record level. By our calculation, aggregate bottom-up earnings in Q2 will total $246.8 billion, compared to $245.6 billion in 2012 Q2 and 2013 Q1’s record of $253.9 billion. The Finance sector will generate $49 billion or 19.8% of the S&P 500’s total Q2 earnings, while the Tech sector is expected to generate $41.5 billion or 16.7% of the index’s total earnings.
"
1826,FDX,"Finance is reclaiming its dominant earnings position in the index which was taken over by the Tech sector following the 2008 crash. Tech remained the biggest earnings producer for the S&P 500 from 2008 through 2012, but the leadership role moves back to Finance this year. Finance is on track to produce $198.5 billion in 2013 (19.3% of the total), up from $173.6 billion in 2012 (17.9% of the total), while Tech is expected to produce $183.1 billion this year (17.8% of the total), up from $182.9 billion in 2012 (18.9% of the total).Trends in Estimate Revisions
"
1827,FDX,"The revisions trend appears to have lost some ground in the last few weeks, though the overall trend still remains in the positive-to-neutral territory, as the charts below show. The key metric in all the charts is the ‘revisions ratio,’ which is the ratio of total number of upward revisions over the preceding four weeks to the total number of revisions (positive and negative) over that same period.
"
1828,FDX,"We have two charts each for 2013 and 2014. The bar charts show the current state of the ‘revisions ratio’ (as of 6/14/13), while the line charts plot the ratio’s trajectory over the preceding 24 months.
"
1829,FDX,"The ratio doesn’t tell you the ‘magnitude’ of the revisions, only the direction. The ‘50%’ level (the dark line) is the dividing line between positive and negative trends, with readings above 50% implying more positive than negative revisions. That said, our analysis shows that readings between 45% and 55% don’t offer material insights into the magnitude of revisions. It is only readings above 55% and below 45% that offer bullish and bearish signals about the magnitude of earnings revisions.
"
1830,FDX,"As you can see in the charts above, the revisions trend for the S&P 500 as a whole is still in neutral territory, the current level (49% for 2013) is down from three weeks back (56% at the end of May). Finance has been in bullish trend for weeks now, but the estimate revisions trend for the Tech sector also seems to be moving in that direction now.
"
1831,FDX,"Hard to tell how sustainable the trend will prove to be, but the sector’s revisions ratio for 2013 currently (as of 6/14) stands at 59.6%, the highest level in over 12 months. Some of the stand-out revisions in the sector were industry players like Motorola Solutions (MSI  -  Free Report), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and NetApp (NTAP).
"
1832,FDX,"Finance continues to be in bullish territory for both this year and next (the blue line). The sector’s revisions ratio currently (as of 6/14) stands at 72% for 2013 and 74% for 2014, signaling good times ahead for the sector. The trend makes perfect sense as higher interest rates may be a hindrance for other industries, but it’s beneficial for the Finance sector’s earnings.
"
1833,FDX,"Flat net-interest margins have been a permanent feature of the sector’s, particularly banking’s, earnings picture in recent quarters. The Finance sector’s positive earnings outlook is a function of the rising trend in interest rates.
"
1834,FDX,"On the negative side, the revisions trend is decidedly in bearish territory for Industrials and Basic Materials both for this year and next. Peabody Energy (BTU), U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report), Joy Global (JOY), Freeport-McMoran (FCX  -  Free Report) have all suffered significant negative estimate revisions lately.
"
1835,FDX,"Fed aside, we have a bunch of housing related data on deck this week, including Housing Starts and Existing Home Sales data. We will also have the Empire State and Philly Fed regional manufacturing surveys and the May CPI numbers this week. But everyone will be looking ahead to the Bernanke press conference on Wednesday afternoon.
"
1836,FDX,"On Nov 27, we issued an updated research report on FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report). The stock has been downgraded to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) from a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Going by the Zacks proven model, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) are likely to underperform the broader market over the next one-three months.Reasons Behind the DowngradeFedEx’s operations have been severely hurt by the Jun 27 cyberattack on its subsidiary, TNT Express. The attack caused large-scale service delays on its TNT Express unit. Evidently, the company’s top line in first-quarter fiscal 2018 was affected, primarily due to decreased volumes at TNT Express. First-quarter results were also hampered by Hurricane Harvey. In fact, the company incurred costs of approximately $300 million during the quarter due to the catastrophe.What is even worse is that the situation is not likely to reverse in the near future. As a result, the company has lowered its guidance for fiscal 2018. It now expects earnings in the band of $11.05-$11.85 per share, excluding year-end MTM pension accounting adjustments. Previous outlook had called for a rise of $13.20-$14 in the metric.Additionally, high costs pertaining to investments in the company’s Ground unit may also limit the bottom-line growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Results of the same period are expected to be out on Dec 19. Moreover, the company’s efforts to meet growing customer demand during the holiday season are further escalating costs. FedEx’s high-leverage ratio is another cause for concern.Further, recent reports of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) testing new waters with a business-to-consumer delivery service are another challenge to the company. With Amazon starting its own delivery service, competition for the company is likely to intensify.Negative sentiments surrounding the stock can also be gauged from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of fiscal second quarter being revised 0.7% downward in the last 30 days.FedEx Corporation Price and Consensus  FedEx Corporation Price and Consensus | FedEx Corporation Quote Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A.

1837,FDX,"In the choice between ‘bad’ and ‘worse’ available to the Greeks in Sunday’s election, they made the ‘right’ call and opted for the ‘bad’ option. This is a big sigh of relief for Europe and the global financial system.
"
1838,FDX,"But don’t look for a relief rally today as the market’s attention shifts promptly from Greece to Spain, where yields on government bonds are rising and reaching unsustainable levels, requiring some sort of intervention. As such, the positive aspect of today’s trading action is that we were able to avoid a major or catastrophic negative.
"
1839,FDX,"Spanish government bond yields are up above the dangerous 7% level today, which effectively means a very restrictive capital market access for the government. Greece, Ireland, and Portugal needed outside intervention when they reached these levels. Spain’s banking bailout a few days back obviously wasn’t enough and the G-20 summit getting underway in Mexico today has limited room for doing anything good.
"
1840,FDX,"A major intervention from the European Central Bank (ECB) in the form of another round of long-term refinancing operation (LTRO) will most certainly break the negative momentum in Spanish (and Italian) government bond markets. But the ECB believes that doing more LTRO will relieve the pressure on Euro-zone political leaders to take the tough decisions needed to ‘fix’ the problem, such as moving towards a banking or fiscal union. The question is whether Spain has the ability to sustain these above-7% yields while it waits for Euro-zone leaders to make the right decisions in the summit meeting later this month.
"
1841,FDX,"The ECB is not the only central bank in the spotlight this week. The Federal Reserve is in focus as we get the official post-meeting statement from the FOMC on Wednesday followed by Bernanke’s press conference that afternoon. Market participants are looking for the Fed to do ‘something’ on Wednesday.
"
1842,FDX,"But what and how effective that ‘something’ will be is up in the air at this stage. They could extend ‘Operation Twist,’ which ends at the end of this month, extend their interest rate ‘guidance,’ or announce a new round of quantitative easing or bond purchases. I don’t think ‘doing nothing’ is one of the options, given how high expectations are some sort of new Fed action. But we will have to wait till Wednesday to find out.
"
1843,FDX,"Europe and the Fed aside, we have a number of major housing industry reports coming out this week, including the homebuilder sentiment index this morning, Housing Starts on Tuesday, and Existing Home sales on Thursday. We will also start keeping tabs on second quarter earnings reports this week, with results from companies like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) coming out.
"
1844,FDX,"The financial press typically associates the start of the earnings season with Alcoa’s (AA) report  each quarter. But in reality, the earnings season gets underway before that, as many companies have fiscal quarters that end at different months than the end of the calendar quarter. For example, Alcoa will release its second quarter 2012 results in July, while a number of major companies whose fiscal quarters end in May will report before that. We will be counting results from all the companies with May quarter ends, like Oracle and FedEx, as part of the second quarter of 2012.
"
1845,FDX,"Current expectations are for second quarter 2012 earnings to be up 2.1% from the same period last year, reflecting a modest 0.6% revenue increase and a 13 basis point expansion in margins. This compares to earnings growth of 7.9% in the first quarter, which reflected gains of 4.7% on the top-line and margin expansion of 21 basis points.
"
1846,FDX,"Pretty much all of the second quarter earnings growth is coming from the Finance sector. Excluding Finance, total earnings in the second quarter will be down 4% from the same period last year. We will be getting ‘second quarter’ results from 12 companies in the S&P 500 this week.RELATED ARTICLESBernanke to Follow Eurozone VoteGaming GrexitSpain's Bailout Pessimism vs. S&P Chart Optimism

1847,FDX,"This morning’s economic data is giving investors the clearest possible evidence of divergence in global economic growth outlook, with the U.S. economy decoupling from Europe and China. We have another better-than-expected read on Initial Jobless Claims in the U.S., while readings of the manufacturing sector in China and Europe show contraction.
"
1848,FDX,"The surprise factor in the European slowdown is limited since that region is widely believed to be already in a recession, but I suspect that today’s soft Chinese manufacturing data will remain front and center and trump the favorable domestic labor market report.
"
1849,FDX,"The preliminary Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for March created by HSBC Bank (HBC) shows a slippage from last month’s level. The index dropped to 48.1 in March from February’s 49.6, both below the critical 50 level indicating manufacturing contraction.
"
1850,FDX,"China's official PMI data has been a bit stronger than the HSBC readings in the last few months, but the overall softening trend is nevertheless there. A number of other measures about China, such as export and bank lending numbers, have also been pointing in that direction. While the slowdown is becoming fairly obvious, we should keep in mind that the country’s fiscal and monetary firepower provide it with the flexibility to not let the softening trend become anything more than speed bump.
"
1851,FDX,"On the home front, initial Jobless Claims came in better than expected last week – down 5K to 348K from 353K. The prior week’s tally modestly revised up from the originally reported 351K level to 353K. The four-week average, which smoothes out the week-to-week fluctuation, dropped by 1250 to 355K.
"
1852,FDX,"The strong Jobless Claims showing is consistent with the labor market recovery that we witnessed in the February non-farm payroll report. We should continue to see 200K+ monthly jobs numbers in the coming months as long as this trend continues, which is a huge positive for the U.S. economy. 
"
1853,FDX,"In corporate news, FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) came out with better than expected earnings on broadly in-line top-line results this morning. The package delivery giant guided towards current quarter earnings that are a bit on the weaker side. The company’s EPS guidance for the May quarter is for a range of $1.75 to $2, which compares to the current Zacks Consensus of $1.98.

"
1871,FDX,"cents, up roughly 25% year over year in late April; the results fell 11.1%
"
1872,FDX,"short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 45 cents.Revenue in the quarter grew 18.3% year over year, primarily
"
1873,FDX,"due to healthy performance in the Industrial segment. The impact of revenue
"
1874,FDX,"increase was, to a large extent, negated by 10.8% and 61.2% increase in cost of
"
1875,FDX,"sales and selling and administrative expenses, respectively. Operating income
"
1876,FDX,"grew a mere 1.4% while operating margin fell 150 basis points. Of bigger concern was Barnes’ anticipation of recording

"
1878,FDX,"company’s cash flows are expected to be negatively impacted by $13 million

"

"
1881,FDX,"Most of the analysts that cover moved estimates lower since their
"
1882,FDX,"last earnings report, with the current quarter’s results dropping from 54 cents
"
1883,FDX,"to the current 46 cents.  FY2013 estimates
"
1884,FDX,"also came down 11.2% from $2.14 per share to $1.90.Barnes is expected sales to decrease 1.42% for FY2013, but
"
1885,FDX,"for earnings to increase 12% on cost cuts and efficiency.  Given their tax situation, margin issues and
"
1886,FDX,"declining economic conditions, I wonder if they will be able to meet those
"
1887,FDX,"expectations.  Barnes has missed earnings expectations 3 of the last 4 quarters

"
1912,FDX,"The market’s focus is justifiably on the Fed this week given the buzz surrounding the ‘Taper’ talk. I don’t expect a categorical statement out of the FOMC on Wednesday, but it would not be unreasonable to expect Bernanke to provide more clarity on his thinking on the QE question in the post-meeting press conference that day.
"
1913,FDX,"The Fed will no doubt be the big subject this week, but we are getting close to the start of the Q2 earnings season as well. In fact, Q2 earnings season will actually get underway this week with the earning release from such bellwethers as FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) on Wednesday and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) on Thursday.Alcoa (AA) typically gets credited for kicking off each earnings season, but we don’t count Alcoa’s report as the ‘official’ start. In fairness to Alcoa, investors start taking notice of the earnings season only with their release, which for Q2 will happen on July 8th.
"
1914,FDX,"As has been the case at the start of recent quarterly earnings cycles, expectations for Q2 earnings season remain quite low. Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be up only +0.6% from the same period last year. This is down from +3.9% growth expected in the quarter in early April. Total earnings were up +2.3% in Q1, but the expectation ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season was for earnings growth to be in the negative territory.
"
1915,FDX,"Finance wasn’t a big driver of aggregate earnings growth for the S&P 500 in Q1, but takes back the lead role in Q2, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +19.4% and estimates steadily going up. Earnings for the sector were up +7.7% in Q1, which came after many quarters of double-digit growth.
"
1916,FDX,"All industries within the Finance sector like the major banks, regional banks, brokers and insurers are expected to have positive growth. But the growth picture is particularly notable for the brokerage and investment management industry such as Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), with total earnings for the group expected to be up +39.6% in Q2 after the +2.6% gain in Q1.
"
1917,FDX,"Unlike Finance, the earnings picture for the Technology sector, the largest sector in the S&P 500, remains fairly weak. Total earnings for the sector are expected to be down -8.7% from the same period last year, which follows the -3.8% earnings decline in Q1.
"
1918,FDX,"Earnings estimates for the sector have been steadily coming down over recent weeks, with the current -8.7% decline down from expected decline of -3.1% in mid-April. The weakest group within the Technology sector is the PC makers, with total earnings for the Computers and Office Equipment industry expected to be down -16.1% in Q2 after the -14.1% decline in Q1. Semiconductors and electronics are other Tech industries with negative earnings growth in the quarter.  
"
1919,FDX,"Expectations for full-years 2013 and 2014 have come down far less than what we have seen for Q2 estimates. In fact, it is reasonable to assume that given the improving outlook for the Finance sector, aggregate estimates will start rising after a very long time in the coming weeks.
"
1920,FDX,"The +6.1% growth in total earnings this year, down from +6.8% in early April, reflects a material ramp up in the second half of the year that is then expected to carry into 2014. Combining the actual results for Q1 with estimates for Q2 gives us +1.5% year-over-year growth in total earnings in the first half of 2013. But total earnings are expected to be up +9.4% in the second half of the year and a further +11.5% in full-year 2014.Trends in Estimate Revisions
"
1921,FDX,"The revisions trend appears to have lost some ground in the last two weeks, though the overall trend still remains in the positive-to-neutral territory. The charts below show trends in earnings estimate revisions. The key metric in all the charts is the ‘revisions ratio,’ which is the ratio of total number of upward revisions over the preceding four weeks to the total number of revisions (positive and negative) over that same period.
"
1922,FDX,"We have two charts each 2013 and 2014. The bar charts show the current state of the ‘revisions ratio’ (as of 6/7/13), while the line charts plot the ratio’s trajectory over the preceding 24 months.
"
1923,FDX,"The ratio doesn’t tell you the ‘magnitude’ of the revisions, only the direction. The level (the dark line) is the dividing line between positive and negative trends, with readings above 50% implying more positive than negative revisions. Our analysis shows that readings between 45% and 55% don’t offer material insights into the magnitude of revisions. It is only readings above 55% and below 45% that offer bullish and bearish signals about the magnitude of earnings revisions.
"
1924,FDX,"As you can see in the charts above, the revisions trend for the S&P 500 as a whole is still in neutral territory, the current level (52% for 2013) is down from two weeks back (56% at the end of May). But the trend in the Finance sector continues to be in bullish territory for both this year and next (the blue line). The sector’s revisions ratio currently (as of 6/7) stands at 69% for 2013 and 73% for 2014, modestly down from two weeks back, but nevertheless signaling good times ahead for the sector.
"
1925,FDX,"The trend makes perfect sense as higher interest rates may be a hindrance for other industries, but it’s beneficial for the Finance sector’s earnings. Flat net-interest margins have been a permanent feature of the sector’s, particularly banking’s, earnings picture in recent quarters. The charts also show the trend in the Technology sector, the largest in the S&P 500, to spotlight Finance’s improving outlook.
"
1926,FDX,"The Finance sector’s positive earnings outlook is a function of the rising trend in interest rates. But whether that trend continues or reverses course in the coming days will depend to a large extent on what the Fed does this week. The consensus view is that the Fed may not do anything material in this week’s statement, but Bernanke may shed more light on the prevailing mood within the FOMC at his post-meeting press event.
"
1927,FDX,"Fed aside, we have a bunch of housing-related data on deck this week, including Housing Starts and Existing Home Sales data. We will also have the Empire State and Philly Fed regional manufacturing surveys and the May CPI numbers this week. But everyone will be looking ahead to the Bernanke press conference on Wednesday afternoon.

2094,FDX,"A minor cottage industry of sorts springs into action around this time every quarter to prove that Alcoa’s (AA) results tell us something about how other companies’ results will be in the earnings season. Take all of those comments with a spoonful of salt. Yes, demand for aluminum products now comes from a variety of industries like automotives and aerospace and other. But to claim that Alcoa’s fortunes carry any relevance beyond the mining or even basic materials space is simply misleading.  
"
2095,FDX,"As such, Alcoa’s strong earnings beat after the close yesterday is relevant only to itself and its own industry – it doesn’t tell us much beyond that. If anything, the earnings reports from FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) that came out before Alcoa carry a lot more informational value about broader earnings picture.  
"
2096,FDX,"So what should we be looking for this earnings season?  
"
2097,FDX,"Expectations for Q1 remain low. Total earnings are expected to be down -2.6% from the same period last year. Tough comparisons and weak guidance account for the mediocre growth expectations (2012 Q1 produced the highest quarterly earnings total since the current earnings cycle started in 2009). But since roughly two-thirds of the companies typically beat expectations in a typical quarter, the final earnings growth tall will likely be better than current expectations. My sense is that if Q1 is like any other quarter, then we will see a growth rate close to the flat line – meaning essentially no growth.  
"
2098,FDX,"What would matter much more than the proportion and level of ‘beats’ will be guidance. And the reason for that is that expectations for the coming quarters, particularly the second half of the year, remain high. Current consensus expectations are for total earnings to be up +2.3% in the second quarter and up +10.9% in the second half of the year. Guidance will determine whether those expectations will hold up or not. My sense is that they wouldn’t hold up and estimates for Q2 will start coming down as the Q1 earnings season gets into high gear.  
"
2099,FDX,"With economic data already showing signs of renewed weakness, it will be hard for the market to hold its ground in such an earnings background. This is pointing to tougher times for the market in the Spring/Summer day.

2102,FDX,"Tuesday, July 10, 2018Market indexes are blossoming over the past week or so, even as global uncertainties begin to pile up regarding trade tensions with China and other important commerce partners, leadership issues in the U.K. ahead of tomorrow’s NATO meeting in Brussels, and elsewhere. But there is a bright, shining beacon markets appear to be attracted to currently: Q2 earnings season.Q2 may be among the strongest we’ve seen in our entire multi-year economic recovery (though Q1’s +24.6% year over year earnings growth will be tough to surmount), with a possible 4-handle on GDP for the quarter expected by a plurality of analysts later this month. Results from companies on the S&P 500 have already begun to start off this earnings season with a bang — companies like Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) outperformed estimates in past weeks — and expectations are big coming into the heart of Q2 reporting.We see at the end of this week some of the biggest banks in the country reporting, including JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report). And, while year over year growth is expected to be substantial for these and companies like them, the Finance sector overall is underperforming the overall market. This has more to do with interest rate level questions and concerns about the yield spread between the 2-year and 10-year bond than the machinations of the companies themselves.For a comprehensive view of banks’ performance and what to look for in Q2, check out Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian’s latest Earnings Preview: What’s Keeping Bank Stocks Down?Ahead of today’s opening bell, Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) put out a mixed earnings report, beating on the bottom line by a dime to $1.61 per share — up 7% in constant currency terms year over year. Revenues came in a smidge beneath expectations at $16.1 billion for the quarter, but shares are currently up about 2 1/2% in today’s pre-market.

2103,FDX,"Now a literal household name, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) has experienced meteoric growth since its May 1997 IPO, since which its stock price has soared an astounding 111,260%. This represents about hundred times more growth than any of its industry competitors over that same time frame. This year alone, Amazon is up nearly 43% compared to an industry average of 9.2%.With this much growth already baked into its stock price, many investors may feel that Amazon stock is too expensive and that they have missed their chance to cash in. Is this truly the case? Let’s take a look.An Ever-Expanding Sphere of InfluenceOur team reported on Thursday that shares of pharmacy giants CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report), and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) plummeted on news that Amazon would purchase online pharmacy delivery startup PillPack. The move is part of the firm’s push into the $400 billion industry. While specific details have not yet been released, the idea is that the firm would sell prescription medicines online.This isn’t Amazon’s first foray into healthcare. The company announced in January that it, alongside Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), would begin “partnering on ways to address healthcare for their U.S. employees, with the aim of improving employee satisfaction and reducing costs.” The partnership will see the formation of an independent company, at which a top-level executive from each respective firm will take lead.Amazon also announced Delivery Service Partners on Thursday, a new program that is designed to let local entrepreneurs manage and operate delivery networks with up to 40 vans within their respective regions. The move puts firms like UPS (UPS  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) directly in their crosshairs. It said that the move would involve “hundreds” of small businesses and ultimately result in the hiring of “tens of thousands” of delivery drivers across the country.This week, Amazon began rolling out special deals for its Prime members to Whole Foods, which it acquired in August of last year. According to RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney, this could double Whole Foods’ customer base. Amazon is also expanding Go, its cashier-free convenience store initiative which made its public debut in January of last year.Amazon’s sphere of influence is only continuing to expand. It is difficult to fathom that the same firm which at one point only sold books, now has a presence in retail, logistics, media production, artificial intelligence and cloud computing, just to name a few of its numerous ventures. What makes the company interesting is the fact that it continues to invest and expand into new territory, just as its recent news announcements have shown us.By the NumbersAmazon had a stellar earnings report in April, delivering first-quarter 2018 earnings of $3.27 per share, crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $2.05 (168%) and representing 121% year-over-year growth. The company also reported $51.04 billion in revenue, beating our Consensus Estimate by almost a billion dollars and representing 43% in year-over-year growth.Product sales, which account for 61.9% of Amazon’s overall sales, increased 33.2% year-over-year to $31.61 billion, while service sales (which account for the other 38.1%) rose 62.2% year-over-year to $19.44 billion. This was driven largely by Amazon’s physical store presence through Whole Foods and Amazon Go. Physical store sales accounted for $7.46 billion in revenue compared to our $4.35 billion Consensus Estimate.The strong earnings report was also guided in part by strong performance in Amazon’s Web Services division (AWS), which saw revenues climb 48.6% year-over-year to $5.44 billion. The change was primarily driven by an expanding customer base, which included the addition of enterprise customers such as LG Electronics and Shutterfly (SFLY  -  Free Report). AWS now accounts for ~11% of Amazon’s total revenue and ~73% of its operating income, and holds a third of the global cloud computing services market.Investors should take note of Amazon’s 12-Month Forward P/E ratio of 101x, which is notably lower than its F1 2018 ratio of 130.4x. The ratio shifted dramatically in April, as analysts significantly raised their estimates on the back of the firm’s extremely strong earnings report.Investors may also notice that the aforementioned 12-Month Forward P/E of 101x still appears to hold a significant premium to the industry average of 23.7x. The reason why this is the case however, is because Amazon sacrifices profits in the short-term to fund its many different initiatives. This reduces earnings and thus inflates the ratio. This aggressive investment strategy is what has allowed Amazon to grow in such an explosive fashion. One good example is AWS, which was not immediately profitable as the firm created its infrastructure, but now represents one of its most lucrative divisions.The effects of Amazon’s investment strategy become clear when we look at the last five years of Amazon’s earnings estimate history, represented by the green line:Note that although earnings estimates for F1 2018 sat at $8.69 per share before April’s report, they currently sit at $12.74 per share. That Amazon’s estimates have continuously increased is a testament to analyst confidence that its various initiatives have not only already brought in results but will continue to do so.Here is another point that investors may find interesting:Although Amazon is burning through cash to fuel their operations, it has been increasing its margins consistently for the last six years. This is important because it tells us that Amazon is becoming more efficient at converting sales into actual profit. Once Amazon’s newer investments turn profitable, it will mean that Amazon can potentially continue to pull off earnings surprises as significant as last quarter’s 168% beat.OutlookAlthough investors may feel hesitant about Amazon’s current stock price, various signs point to it being warranted rather than overhyped. With a perpetually growing product portfolio, aggressive operations investment, and increasing margins, Amazon is positioning itself to dominate multiple industries at once for years to come.While nothing is certain, investors should remain aware of the possibility that should they attempt to wait for a better entry point to invest, it may never come. Regardless of if investors choose to purchase Amazon stock, they should continue to monitor its performance. As its various divisions continue to grow, an increasing number of firms will see their business models threatened.Amazon currently sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

2104,FDX,"Shares of FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) declined 6.2% to $241.77 post the earnings release on Jun 19, despite reporting better-than-expected revenues and earnings per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.Reasons Behind the Stock’s PlungeThe escalating fears of a trade war hampering the free flow of goods between countries are the main reasons behind the stock’s dismal performance.  In fact, on the fourth quarter conference call, FedEx’s CEO Fredrick Smith expressed his concerns on the same.The fact that FedEx has a significant presence in China has given rise to worries over substantial revenue loss due to the weakening of trade following the tariffs. We note that FedEx opened a hub in Shanghai in January 2018 to strengthen its foothold in China.Last week, the White House announced plans to impose 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of imports. President Donald Trump is expected to start taxing products worth $34 billion as early as Jul 6 while he will levy tariff on the additional goods of $16 billion later. Beijing said it will counter the move, imposing tariffs on U.S. soybeans and other farm products.However, Trump will attack the Chinese retaliation by imposing tariff on yet another $200-billion worth of Chinese goods. Also, it will levy tax on further $200 billion of Chinese products in case China still refuses to withdraw.These mounting trade tensions certainly do not bode well for FedEx and might further impact the stock.FedEx Corporation Price  FedEx Corporation Price | FedEx Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Key PicksFedEx carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report), SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

2105,FDX,"United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 1, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted earnings of f $1.45 that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.44 per share. The bottom line also inched up 0.7% on a year-over-year basis. However, results were hurt by the hurricanes.Revenues improved 7% to $15,978 million from the year-ago quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,605.5 million. The upside was driven by growth across all the key segments of the company.Things seem to be looking up for the company ahead of the fourth-quarter earnings release as well. The bullishness can be gauged from the fact that the UPS stock has outperformed its industry over the last month.  Shares of the company have gained 11.4% compared with the industry’s 9.9% rally in the period. Factors Likely to Influence Q4 ResultsE-commerce growth is likely to aid the company’s results in the soon to-be-reported quarter. Revenues from the company’s U.S. Domestic Package unit are also likely to benefit from increased package volumes on the back of e-commerce growth. Ground products are likely to drive growth in the segment. In fact, UPS like its rival FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) had a highly successful holiday season buoyed by strong e-commerce growth, per a Reuters report. To meet the surge in demand during the holiday season, UPS hired around 95,000 seasonal workers.At the U.S. domestic package division, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $11,578 million, higher than $9,649 million reported in the previous quarter. The projection justifies our bullish stance on the segment.Furthermore, the company’s international package division is to perform well in the fourth quarter on the back of robust growth in export volumes. At this segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $3,607 million, lower than the $3,364 million in the third quarter of 2017.However, we expect the company’s bottom line to be hurt by escalated costs in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, high package delivery costs have been hurting UPS for some time and the fourth quarter is likely to be no different. Moreover, UPS is working hard to expand its presence. Though positive on such efforts, we believe that expansion related expenses might drag down fourth-quarter earnings.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that UPS is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Zacks Rank: UPS carries a Zacks Rank #3.Zacks ESP: UPS has Earnings ESP of +0.10%. A positive ESP combined with the company's Zacks Rank #3, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.

(EXPD  -  Free Report), which is  scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Feb 20, has a Zacks Rank #1 and an Earnings ESP of +1.30%.Allegiant (ALGT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.09% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

2106,FDX,"These days, executive transitions often appease shareholders, especially during tough times—even if it means axing the company’s founder. On top of that, CEOs jump from company to company, making it increasingly rare to see a founder successfully lead their startup into a publicly traded giant and keep the top gig.Yet there are many notable cases where this does happen. Nearly every casual investor knows that Mark Zuckerberg took Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) from a Harvard side project into a worldwide super power. Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Jeff Bezos has quickly risen to become the richest man in the world. And Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) founder Elon Musk has become a household name as CEO based, in part, on his bold vision of the future.With that said, let’s take a look at some other big-name companies that are still run by their founder that might also be worth investing in at the moment.1.      FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report)Frederick W. Smith founded FedEx in 1971 with the bold idea of using airplanes in the logistics industry. The company is often credited as the founder of the express door-to-door delivery business, which the likes of Amazon and many others have co-opted. Smith still acts as FedEx’s Chairman and CEO and now oversees a company with a market cap of over $70 billion.FedEx is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).2.       iRobot Corporation (IRBT  -  Free Report)Colin Angle and two other MIT roboticists founded iRobot in 1990. Now, nearly 30 years later, Angle still helms the robotics company that has led the way in the automated home cleaning industry. The chairman and chief executive has helped the company sell over 20 million robot vacuums, mops, and pool cleaners worldwide. This robotics industry pioneer has helped his company transform into a multibillion-dollar firm that has seen its stock price climb nearly 50% in the last year alone.iRobot is currently Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).3.       Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) Jack Dorsey founded the social media power over a decade ago in San Francisco and, after some time away from the CEO position, heads the firm today. At the moment, Twitter’s importance in terms of breaking news is nearly incalculable. And Twitter’s up to the second worldwide dissemination capabilities are likely to become more important as the use of mobile devices increases around the world. Dorsey’s company now claims a market cap of over $16 billion and boasts 330 million monthly active users.Twitter is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).4.       Square, Inc. (SQ  -  Free Report) After founding a massively successful social media company, Dorsey went on to launch this mobile payment and point of sale startup. Since then, Square has helped change the way many small businesses operate. With offices all around the world, Dorsey’s other company now boasts a larger market cap than Twitter and has the potential to expand with a shake up of the traditional banking industry, which Square hopes to be a large part of, on the horizon.Square is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).5.      Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) After founding Pure Software in 1991—which was acquired two years later—Reed Hastings co-founded Netflix in 1997. Few could have predicted the company’s rise from upstart DVD rental concept to global media power that is helping reshape the entertainment landscape, but Hastings has been at the wheel the whole way. The CEO plans to remain the leader as Netflix continues to blow past its own lofty subscriber growth predictions.Netflix is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2107,FDX,"There is a long list of popular averages and ranges that investors like to use while looking at stocks, and that includes the 52-week low and 52-week high metrics. It’s great to find stocks right before they surge towards new highs, but it can be difficult for some to establish a new and consistent range.With that said, investors typically become interested in stocks as they breach 52-week highs because that momentum can oftentimes continue until a new range is established. If a stock is strong in a variety of key categories, it certainly can keep climbing well above that old 52-week high, and we can find those strong stocks using our Zacks methods.Here at Zacks, we place an emphasis on earnings-related data, especially earnings estimate revision activity, and this can definitely be applied to stocks approaching their 52-week highs. One way to ensure continued upward momentum is solid earnings momentum, so we can use the proven Zacks Rank system to identify companies that are impressing in this regard.Using this strategy, we have found five stocks that are seeing positive estimate revision activity and are hovering near their 52-week highs. Check them out now:1.       Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $77.90 / 52-Week High: $77.91After surpassing earnings estimates by five cents in its most recent quarter, Target witnessed several positive estimate revisions for its upcoming quarters. In fact, our consensus estimate for its upcoming fiscal year has gained more than $1.00 over the past 60 days. Meanwhile, shares have climbed roughly 25% in just 12 weeks. The stock is taking off like a rocket on the back of an improved outlook, and investors will not want to miss the gains that could come if Target can post another strong quarter. 2.       Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $62.22 / 52-Week High: $62.79Food distribution giant Sysco is experiencing strong momentum in the wake of its tenth-consecutive quarter or matching or surpassing earnings estimates. Shares of the company have soared about 14% over the past 12 weeks, lifting the stock toward the 52-week high it is hovering at today. But earnings estimates are improving for the current quarter and next quarter, so shares should keep climbing as Sysco’s outlook improves. Our consensus estimates are calling for the company’s bottom line to improve by 12% and 22%, respectively, over the next two quarters. 3.       CBOE Holdings, Inc. (CBOE  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $132.91 / 52-Week High: $133.31Earnings estimates are moving higher for both the current and next fiscal year for CBOE, an options exchange based in Chicago. This revision activity has been a driving force for the stock, which has now gained more than 20% over the last 12 weeks. Still, impressive top and bottom line growth in the current quarter should inspire even stronger momentum, and a rising rate environment over the next few years should help that momentum continue into the long term. 4.       Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $112.90 / 52-Week High: $115.89Much has been made about the death of brick-and-mortar retail, but times have perhaps never been better for discount retailers like Dollar Tree. The company is riding high after two solid earnings beats, and the stock has moved more than 23% over the past 12 weeks. Meanwhile, our consensus estimate for Dollar Tree’s upcoming fiscal year earnings has gained a whopping 60 cents within the past 60 days. The company’s bottom line outlook is improving significantly, and investors will hope that this improvement inspires continued momentum. 5.       FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $272.25 / 52-Week High: $273.16Shipping behemoth FedEx is bouncing back strongly after a concerning down period. The company beat our consensus earnings estimate by more than 10% in the most recent quarter, and shares have soared more than 20% within the past 12 weeks. That surge has lifted FedEx to these 52-week high levels, but the stock should break higher soon on the back of its improved earnings outlook. Our consensus estimates are soaring thanks to a tidal wave of positive revisions, so investors should be able to capitalize soon. Bottom LineAll of these stocks are quickly approaching their 52-week highs, and that means they should be on your radar. Each stock is also sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) based on its strong earnings-related data, including recent positive estimate revisions. While there are no guarantees on the stock market, these five companies definitely appear to be well-equipped to establish new ranges soon.Want more analysis from this author?

2108,FDX,"A higher number of Americans are gearing up for Thanksgiving travel by road or air this time encouraged by a healthier economy, rising income, higher consumer confidence and cheap fuel. The frenzy for trips during the Thanksgiving weekend is far more than the other years. Orlando, FL is expected to be the top destination, followed by Anaheim, CA and New York City, NY.According to travel service provider American Automobile Association (AAA), Thanksgiving holiday travel is expected to hit levels not seen in 12 years. As many as 50.9 million Americans will travel this Thanksgiving holiday period (Nov 22-Nov 26), up 3.3% from last year. Of them, 45.5 million will go on a road trip with a 3.2% rise in automobile travel, 3.95 million will fly, and the rest will travel by trains and other modes (including buses and cruises) (read: 5 Sector ETFs for Revenue Growth Play).Though the road trip is expected to rise 3.2% over last year, drivers are expected to pay the highest gas prices since 2014. This year, national average price is $2.54, which is 37 cents more than last Nov 1-14.Another report from the U.S. airlines group Airlines for America (A4A) shows that a record 28.5 million passengers will fly over the 12-day Thanksgiving holiday travel period (Nov 17-Nov 28), up 3% from last year. Travelers taking to the skies will pay the lowest average in five years for a round-trip flight for the top 40 domestic routes, per AAA’s Leisure Travel Index. Airfares are likely to drop 23% year over year to $57 on average.In order to accommodate an increased number of passengers, U.S. airlines will increase the number of seats. A4A expects airlines to offer 86,000 more seats, 3.2% higher than the last Thanksgiving (read: Will Airline ETF Crash on Subdued Q3 or Take Off on Value?).Huge travel demand should boost revenues and profitability for airlines and railroads, thereby leading to higher share prices.

2109,FDX,"United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.In the last quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.58 surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.46 per share. The top-line also increased 11% on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by higher revenues.Revenues improved 7.7% to $15,750 million from the year-ago quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,477.3 million. The upside was driven by growth across all the key segments of the company.Factors Likely to Influence This Quarter We expect the company’s bottom line to be hurt by escalated costs in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, high package delivery costs have been hurting UPS for some time and the third quarter is likely to be no different. Moreover, UPS is working hard to expand its presence. Though positive on such efforts, we believe that expansion related expenses might also drag down third-quarter earnings.Additionally, foreign currency-related headwinds are expected to hurt the quarter’s results as well. The third-quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues — international package — is pegged at $3,076 million, lower than the $3,163 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Moreover, unfavorable product mix and weakness in industrial production might dampen the company’s performance.We are, however, impressed by the company’s efforts to reward shareholders consistently through buybacks and dividends. An update on the subject will be awaited on the conference call. Also, UPS is leaving no stone unturned to perform well in the upcoming holiday season like its rival FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report). The company expects to benefit from growth in ecommerce. We expect a detailed commentary on the issue on the third-quarter conference call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that UPS will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks Rank: UPS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: UPS has an Earnings ESP of -0.06%, which acts as a spoiler.

2110,FDX,"About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 3.7% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.First Quarter EarningsFedEx’s earnings (excluding 32 cents from non-recurring items) of $2.51 per share significantly fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.17. Furthermore, the bottom line declined 13.5% on a year-over-year basis due to higher costs.Quarterly revenues increased 4.3% year over year to $15,297 million, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,368.7 million. The top line was hurt primarily due to the TNT Express cyberattack.Operating income (on an adjusted basis) decreased 6.8% year over year to $1.24 billion in the quarter primarily due to the cyberattack. Also, operating margin contracted to 8.1% during the quarter from 9.1% in first-quarter fiscal 2017.Segmental PerformanceQuarterly revenues at FedEx Express (including TNT Express) improved 2.2% to $8.65 billion, driven by hiked base rates and higher package volume. Operating income came in at $521 million, down 20.1% year over year, while operating margin reduced to 6% year over year. Operating results were hampered by the cyberattack.FedEx Ground revenues gained 8% year over year to $4.64 billion in the fiscal first quarter. In fact, volume expansion and higher base rates aided the segmental performance during the reviewed quarter. Average daily volume rose 4% in the fiscal first quarter. Operating income came in at $626 million, up 3%. Operating margin declined 70 basis points (bps) to 13.5%.FedEx Freight revenues rose 6% year over year to $1.75 billion. Segmental revenues were benefited by increased base rates and fuel surcharges. Also, the segment’s operating income surged 30% to $176 million. Plus, operating margin expanded 190 bps to 10%.Bleak Fiscal 2018 ViewThe company has lowered guidance for fiscal 2018 due to concerning effect fromTNT Express cyberattack. It now expects earnings in the band of $11.05-$11.85 per share, excluding year-end MTM pension accounting adjustments.Previous outlook had called for a rise in the metric of $13.20-$14 per share. Notably, the guidance assumes moderate economic growth and recovery from the cyberattack. Capital expenses are still projected at $5.9 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been seven revisions lower for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted lower by 7.5% due to these changes.FedEx Corporation Price and Consensus  FedEx Corporation Price and Consensus | FedEx Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, FedEx's stock has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for value investors than growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise that the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect below average returns from the stock in the next few months.

2111,FDX,"In quarters past, we in the world of finance reporting would be sounding the trumpets for the ushering in of a new Earnings Season, which was to commence with aluminum giant Alcoa’s (AA  -  Free Report) report after the closing bell with Monday or Tuesday of a week just like this. But really, this was always just a convenient formality that didn’t have much integral meaning to earnings season as a whole nor the general domestic and global economies they help illustrate. If you want to get an early foothold on the global marketplace, for instance, you’d do better to focus on FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) numbers (which happened to miss consensus estimates by 20% in its fiscal Q1 2018 report a few weeks ago).That said, if you are interested in the lion’s share of data related to quarterly gains from the finance sector, then you have indeed found the right week. By this time Thursday morning, we will have seen Q3 earnings results from JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report). By the opening bell this Friday, we’ll also see Q3 reports from Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and PNC (PNC  -  Free Report). Major banks represent nearly half the total earnings for the finance sector, which is why we can make informed projections about whether or not we’re looking at a strong quarter or not just by tracking these large U.S. banks.Bank stocks did not impress the market in Q2. Yet in the past month — the direct run-up to Q3 earnings season — banks are up 8%, according to Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian. Anticipation of a generous tax reform (tax cut) policy, plus a strong likelihood of a December interest rate hike from the Fed, helped bolster stock prices. But would disappointing earnings and revenue results start a pullback from record highs, not just among companies in the finance sector but across the board? After all, what industries can claim they have no involvement with the biggest Wall Street banks?Consider also that Q3 reports for the banks will not have any actualized data related to tax policy or a higher interest rate, thus they will not appear on the books this quarter. The good news is yearly comps should be beatable, so expectations of a lousy quarter are not warranted at this stage. For a comprehensive report on this week’s coming earnings reports, please read Sheraz’s latest Earnings Preview: Are Bank Stock Gains Sustainable?Aside from the big banks, we also look for earnings data Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) on Wednesday morning and Domino’s Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report) on Thursday. So while the frequency of new reports will be milder than we will see in the coming next few weeks, we will hear from several heavy hitters representing different sectors.In the meantime, will stock indexes keep their brave chin pointed forward to new record highs? If this week’s reporting companies all beat estimates and raise guidance, how much higher can we expect markets to rise?It should be fun. Futures this Monday morning are all up a half-hour before regular-day trading begins.

2112,FDX,"One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report). This is because this security in the Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity, and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective.This is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board. This is arguably taking place in the Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 52 out of more than 250 industries, suggesting it is well-positioned from this perspective, especially when compared to other segments out there.Meanwhile, FedEx is actually looking pretty good on its own too. The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month, suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm’s prospects in both the short and long term.FedEx Corporation Price and Consensus FedEx Corporation price-consensus-chart | FedEx Corporation QuoteIn fact, over the past month, current quarter estimates have increased from $2.78 per share to $2.92 per share, while current year estimates have also increased from $12.47 per share to $13.13 per share. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Buy), which is also a favorable signal. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So, if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry, consider FedEx. Not only is its industry currently in the top third, but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late, suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>
"
2113,FDX,"A surprisingly strong Jobless Claims report and growing optimism about Spain will likely be the key drivers of today's market action, distracting market participants from earnings-related worries.
"
2114,FDX,"The market appears to be seeing a silver lining to the debt rating downgrade of Spain to one notch above the junk category in the hope that the move will force the Spanish government’s hand in asking for a bailout. It is far from clear at this stage whether this expectation will pan out, but it is nevertheless adding to market optimism on the European front. 
"
2115,FDX,"Europe aside, we got an unusually sharp drop in weekly Jobless Claims data this morning, which will likely add to the growing optimism on the U.S. labor market front. The jobless claims report showed the big drop in initial claims to 339K, taking this key measure of unemployment to its lowest level in almost four years. The four-week average, which tends to reduce volatility in the weekly measure, dropped by 11.6K to 364K, the lowest level in six months. The Jobless Claims report adds to the strong gains in the unemployment rate in last week’s September non-farm payroll report that brought the jobless rate to less than 8% for the first time since 2009. 
"
2116,FDX,"Offsetting these favorable reports about the domestic and European scene is the uncertain corporate earnings picture coming out of the third quarter reporting season. While the reporting season has gotten off to a weaker start relative to the previous quarter, the final tally of companies beating third quarter earnings expectations will likely be not much different from what we have been seeing in recent quarters. This is a testament to management teams’ impressive track record of under-promising and over-delivering.
"
2117,FDX,"But more important than what proportion of companies beat third quarter expectations will be the quality of guidance of fourth quarter and beyond, as this will determine how much earnings estimates for the coming quarters need to come down. Given what we have heard from Alcoa (AA), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) on their earnings calls thus far and pre-announcements from the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Cummins (CMI  -  Free Report), the overall trend on the guidance front will likely be to the downside. We will know more in the coming days as the earnings season unfolds.RELATED ARTICLESWhat's More Important, Earnings Beats or Good Guidance?Is Housing Recovery Finally Gaining Momentum?Banking ETFs 101
"
2118,FDX,"The market may start the first trading session of the final quarter of the year on a positive note today. But sustaining the favorable open would depend on how the manufacturing ISM survey for September pans out.
"
2119,FDX,"This key gauge of the nation’s manufacturing sector has been in contractionary territory in recent months, raising doubts about the health of the thus-far robust industrial sector. But the manufacturing softness shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone given the almost synchronized worldwide slowdown, reconfirmed by the September PMI surveys for China, the Euro-zone, and other regions of the world.
"
2120,FDX,"China’s official manufacturing PMI reading for September came in at 49.8, above August’s 49.2 level, but below the expected 50.2 reading. The competing private-sector measure of the same put together by the HSBC Bank (HBC) also showed a modest improvement from the August level, but still showed an under-50 reading. We saw a similar trend play out in the Euro-zone region this morning, where the September PMI reading  edged up a bit from the prior month’s level but stayed in contractionary territory for the 14th month in a row.
"
2121,FDX,"The U.S. economy is admittedly less trade dependent than some of the more export-centric economies like China and Germany. But export growth was a standout factor in this economic recovery and that prop may no longer be available going forward given the emerging decelerating trend in global trade volumes.
"
2122,FDX,"The World Trade Organization is projecting that global goods trading volumes will grow at roughly half the rate of the preceding year’s 5% pace, which itself was down from 14% growth in 2010. The recent soft freight outlook from FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) was confirmation of this key emerging  trend.
"
2123,FDX,"We will get more clarity on this soft international backdrop in the coming days as the third quarter reporting season gets underway. Expectations are for earnings to decline in the quarter, but ramp up strongly in the fourth quarter and beyond. My sense is that these fourth quarter growth expectations will get a reality check as management teams provide more visibility about business outlook.

2126,FDX,"“Seller Flex” is reportedly Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) new delivery service where the company itself will pick up packages from third-party merchant warehouses and deliver them to customers, a function currently handled by its long-time partners United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report).It sounds like a new service but the retail giant started testing it two years back in India and this year in West Coast states, per a Bloomberg report. A broader rollout is expected in 2018.We observe that Amazon shares have gained 30.8% year to date, underperforming the 51.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.The couriers could still be in use but Amazon will take the final decision regarding how a package is sent rather than leaving it up to the seller.So basically, the company is increasing its own control and reducing reliance on courier partners and third-party merchants in the process of delivering products.But Why?It appears that Amazon is seeking greater flexibility and tighter control over its inventory management and supply chain. This will help it reduce congestion of its own warehouses (by avoiding merchandise of outside sellers), make deliveries quicker and impress shoppers by better managing last mile deliveries and last-minute holiday orders.So, shoppers can expect more items qualifying for the two-day shipping program and far more growth for Amazon.Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteShould its Courier Partners Hit the Panic Button?Well, we believe yes, supposing that they have read the company they have partnered with for so long. Amazon has never hesitated in doing what it believes could bring more customers under its umbrella and giving them reasons to stay. That’s part of its long-term plan and a huge cash balance and technological prowess back its implementation.While Amazon may not immediately do away with its courier partners, it is certainly reducing reliance on them and building alternatives/supplements by developing its own global logistics.And What’s Beyond That?Just as what Amazon did with its online retail platform and AWS that is offering the same platforms it built to handle its own business as a service.We all know that Amazon has been pushing its own logistics in recent years through investments in fulfillment centers, trucks and containers and its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) service has been doing well. It has also bought some planes and self-designed drones that are in the works.So, if on a fine day, Amazon starts offering its logistics to outside parties, it should not come as a surprise.Zacks Rank and a Better PickAmazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A better pick from the broader technology space would be Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2127,FDX,"It wouldn’t be the retail rivalry of the 21st century if e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) didn’t announce a new initiative soon after brick-and-mortar titan Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) made headlines of their own (see: Jet.com’s New Private Label Grocery Brand and Walmart Buys NYC Startup Parcel).According to a new report from Bloomberg, Amazon is testing a program dubbed “Seller Flex” that would both allow more items from third-party merchants to be listed under the Prime umbrella, and provide delivery services for those sellers on its platform.Amazon would also take care of picking up packages from its third-party merchants, as well as delivering these items to customers’ homes, potentially eliminating the need for its major delivery partners like UPS (UPS  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report).While the company won’t completely stop using UPS and FedEx—these carriers will still be used for some delivery situations—Seller Flex demonstrates the growing desire by Amazon to control more aspects of its delivery logistics division; the program would also take delivery decisions out of the hands of third-party sellers.More control would give Amazon “greater flexibility…over the last mile to shoppers’ doorsteps, [letting] it save money through volume discounts, and [helping it] avoid congestion in its own warehouses by keeping merchandise in the outside sellers’ own facilities,” writes Bloomberg.Seller Flex builds on Amazon’s previous delivery improvements. Fulfillment by Amazon lets merchants ship goods to Amazon warehouses around the U.S. in order to be stored, packed, and shipped out, while Seller Fulfilled Prime is a program introduced last year that allows sellers to list their products under Prime even if they aren’t stored in Amazon warehouses.The new delivery service was originally rolled out in India two years ago, and over time, Amazon has been marketing the service to its U.S.-based merchants in order to prep for national expansion; Seller Flex was piloted earlier this year on the West Coast, and the company hopes to increase it in 2018, notes Bloomberg.Potential ImpactsMonday saw shares of both UPS and FedEx slip in the wake of the report, and the companies fell about 1.48% and 0.50%, respectively, in late-morning trading.The threat of disruption caused by Amazon has no doubt been on the minds of these two delivery carriers, but neither have seemed too concerned about the online retailer’s encroachment over the past year. Granted, both of UPS and FedEx’s networks are vast and intricate, but Amazon is one of the most widely-used online shopping sites in the U.S.; not having as solid of a relationship with the company could be hurtful.It will be interesting to see if UPS or FedEx takes any steps to counteract these measures, especially if Seller Flex is rolled out nationwide. Perhaps one of the carriers will develop a closer relationship with Jet.com or other online retailers that are looking to expand delivery services.One should also consider the timing of this report. The holiday shopping season is fast approaching, and Bloomberg points out that online holiday spending will reach $129 billion in the U.S. this year. Consumers become dependent on companies like Amazon, UPS, and FedEx to send and receive gifts on time, and a busy holiday season is the perfect time to test and showcase a new delivery service, demonstrating that it can operate successfully on its own.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax Hack Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

2130,FDX,"Benchmarks closed higher on Tuesday as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) two day meeting kicked off.

Investors had a keen eye for the Fed meeting as they expected the central bank to finally begin unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. However, the market watchers do not expect any rate hikes from the Fed as the inflation rates have persistently remained below the target of 2%.Moreover, economists commented that the unwinding would be slow as any reaction by the market to such an unprecedented event would be unknown. In the backdrop of excellent import data, the CME FedWatch probability of a rate hike in December is around 58.3%. The U.S. import prices have surged 0.6% in the last month, buoyed by an increase in the petroleum costs, registering its biggest increase in the past seven months.The Dow added 39.45 points to close in the positive territory, marking its eighth straight session of gains and 41st record for 2017.

"
2131,FDX,"A decidedly weak set of domestic economic data and concerns about budgetary developments in Spain provide the backdrop for today’s trading action. While market sentiment ahead of the open was on the positive side, it may be hard to sustain the gains given this uncertain news flow.
"
2132,FDX,"The trading action of the last few days suggests that Investors are stepping back from these day-to-day developments to get a sense of the big picture. Next week’s economic releases promise to provide useful clues about that big picture, but it will most likely be the coming third quarter earnings season that will provide the definitive directional nudge to this market.
"
2133,FDX,"We will find later today how decisive and determined the Spanish authorities are in tackling the country’s fiscal situation in the face of widespread public protests. A credible budget plan coupled with decisive structural reforms will likely be reassuring enough for the Euro-zone authorities to back-stop the country’s finances. Watch for comments from the Euro-zone officials about the details that Spain announces today.
"
2134,FDX,"The overall tone of economic releases on the home front was decidedly weak this morning, with the final read on the second quarter GDP and monthly Durable Goods coming in weaker than expected, while the weekly initial Jobless Claims data coming in better than expected. The GDP revision may not carry that much punch as it was the third look on that reading, but the Durable Goods drop is definitely something to worry about as it raises doubts about the outlook for corporate capital spending.
"
2135,FDX,"Granted the headline drop pertained primarily to lower aircraft deliveries from Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), but even the ‘core’ measure that strips out the transportation components fell for the third straight month.
"
2136,FDX,"What this tells us that even though consumer confidence may be improving lately as shown by the Conference Board and University of Michigan measures, business confidence seems to be waning. Hard to tell whether it reflects the advance effects of the looming ‘Fiscal Cliff’ or something else, but it’s definitely something to keep an eye on. We will get the first look at the third quarter GDP report in about a month, though next week’s data on jobs and the ISM indexes will set the tone for the broader economic discussion.
"
2137,FDX,"On the earnings front, we got a better-than-expected report from Discover Financial (DFS). Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Research In Motion (RIMM), the maker of the BlackBerry, will report after the close today.RELATED ARTICLESEarnings Expectations: Too Low or Too High?GDP, Durables, Claims All DiveHow to Find a Successful Investment Opportunity by Tracking an Industry Trend
"
2138,FDX,"Today’s heavy economic schedule will likely keep the markets focused on domestic matters. The good start provided by the positive Initial Jobless Claims report and the Empire State manufacturing survey should help reverse the downtrend of the last three trading sessions. Other key economic reports on deck include the November Industrial Production report and the Philly Fed regional manufacturing survey for December.
"
2139,FDX,"Of the pre-market releases, the most favorable reading was on the Initial Jobless Claims front, which continued the positive momentum from last week by falling to the lowest level in more than three years. Contrary to expectations of some sort of a give-back following last week’s big drop in initial claims, we got another big 19K drop, taking the weekly initial claims level further down to 366K. The four-week average is now at 388K.
"
2140,FDX,"It is reassuring to see that this key series has again started moving in the right direction, which is in-line with other labor market readings. The wholesale inflation reading was tad hotter than expected, but broadly in-line with expectations.
"
2141,FDX,"In corporate news, we have better-than-expected results from FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) this morning. The package delivery giant also reaffirmed its outlook for the year, bucking recent trend of profit warnings from a number of major firms. In other news, Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), a maker of semiconductor equipment, plans to buy Novellus Systems (NVLS) in an all-stock deal valued at $3.3 billion.RELATED ARTICLESIndustrial Production Falls in NovemberJobless Claims Plunge for Best Reading in YearsStill Waiting on Europe

"
2146,FDX,"This $4.2 billion company has a forward P/E multiple of under 10 times and is projected to grow earnings at 20%. In the last four quarters, they have delivered an earnings surprise with an average 42.5% beat. As a solid, growing company making equipment for the global agricultural megatrend, this one may offer opportunities as an alternative to Deere (DE  -  Free Report) and CNH Global (CNH).

It provides aircraft, engines and engine parts; airframe and accessories products; overhaul, repair and maintenance services and company-manufactured products to customers in all segments of this industry, including the world's largest commercial airlines and air cargo operators.
"
2148,FDX,"AAR has a market cap below $800 million and with expected earnings growth of 15%, sales growth of 11%, and forward multiple of just under 10 times, this is a small cap value worth looking at.
"
2149,FDX,"FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) needs no introduction, but it is worth noting that since they offer customers a one-stop source for global shipping, logistics and supply chain solutions, they are just as much an information-technology company as IBM (IBM), Visa (V), or Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).
"
2150,FDX,"The $26 billion enterprise is trading at 13 times forward earnings, which are expected to grow at 15%. Their growth, as one of the top two shipping companies in the world, will likely continue as the developing world finds more need for their services.

2153,FDX,"The Dow traversed a difficult week, declining over every single trading session. These losses were primarily attributable to an escalation in the trade conflict between the United States and China. President Trump expressed his intention to impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods. Toward the end of the week, tech stocks managed to recover from trade tensions. But industrials continued to be weighed down by the looming trade war.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow declined 0.3% or 4.83 points, after having shed as much as 280 points at one time as investors somewhat shed worries of a United States-China trade war. These fears were triggered by President Trump’s announcement that tariffs would be imposed on Chinese goods worth $50 billion.The new tariffs come into effect from Jul 6. Moreover, Trump said that the United States would impose more import duties if China decides to retaliate by imposing tariffs on U.S. products. Shares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) declined 1.3% and 2%, respectively.The index lost 0.9% over last week.

Shares of Boeing and Caterpillar declined 3.8% and 3.6%, respectively.The index lost 0.2% on Wednesday, registering its seventh straight daily loss. Large cap tech companies bounced back with shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) gaining 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. This was a consequence of The Walt Disney Company’s (DIS  -  Free Report) revised bid for Twenty-First Century Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) film and television assets.The Dow lost 0.8% on Thursday, declining for the eighth successive session. This is the longest losing streak since Mar 2017. Concerns surrounding a prospective trade war continued to dampen investor sentiment.

Tech stocks have managed to recover somewhat as investors feel they will come out largely unscathed from this crisis. But industrials are feeling the heat and may continue to decline.On the whole, stocks across the board are bearing the brunt of trade tensions to a greater or lesser degree.

2154,FDX,"Welcome to the latest episode of Full-Court Finance, the podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week’s episode, Zacks producer and avid golfer Daniel MacPherson joins the show to discuss the current state of golf and the big business surrounding the PGA Tour as the 2018 season swings into full gear.The golf world is abuzz with the possibility of a 2018 PGA Tour season that could see the long-awaited return to success for Tiger Woods, as his presence alone often substantially boosts television ratings and overall interest in the sport. With millions of dollars invested in television coverage, the likes of NBC (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) and ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) are all actively rooting for Woods—who missed a majority of the last few seasons due to injuries—to remain healthy.Still, no matter if Woods makes a real comeback or not, the PGA Tour is still a big draw for sponsors as the likes of AT&T (T  -  Free Report), FedEx FDX, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Dell Technologies (DVMT  -  Free Report) and many other major companies are all heavily involved in golf through sponsorships and more.On top of that, despite Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) exiting the golf equipment business and Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) selling TaylorMade, the two sportswear powers are still major players in golf apparel even as struggling Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) grows its golf segment. What’s more, other golf-focused companies including Titleist and Footjoy owner Acushnet Holdings (GOLF  -  Free Report) and Callaway Golf (ELY  -  Free Report) have done well.Lastly, despite gloomy attitudes about golf’s future, the game and business of golf are far from doomed, as amateur interest continues to be spurred by the rise of fun and recreational golf outlets such as Topgolf.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

2155,FDX,"The biggest overhaul in U.S. tax code in 30 years has been a boon for package delivery giants like FedEx Corp. (FDX  -  Free Report) and United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report). The $1.5 trillion package, converted into law (Tax Cut and Jobs Act) on Dec 22, reduces corporate taxes from 35% to 21%. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to aid the above-mentioned companies. We note that the effective tax rate at FedEx was 35.4% in the first half of fiscal 2018.Riding on this momentum, shares of FedEx and UPS that dominate and define the Zacks Air Freight and Cargo Industry, hit their respective 52-week high levels on Jan 3, 2018. While FedEx shares scaled a 52-week high of $261.57 during the trading session, the UPS stock touched its highest point of $126.69.Apart from the significant drop in corporate tax rate, the new law allows these companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of their occurrence, which was not allowed earlier. This aspect hugely favors companies like FedEx and UPS as they invest substantially toward capital expenditure.Naturally, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This, in turn, will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others.Holiday Season – Another CatalystThe holiday season every year presents a big opportunity to companies like FedEx and UPS to boost their revenues. It is normally considered a busy period for such companies as shipping volumes tend to surge.As is the case every year, the companies left no stone unturned to shine brightly in the most recent holiday season. To meet the surge in demand, FedEx hired more than 50,000 seasonal workers this time. Meanwhile, UPS hired around 95,000 seasonal workers.In fact, according to Reuters report both these Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) companies had a highly successful holiday season buoyed by strong e-commerce growth. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Dividends/Buybacks Attest Solid Financial HealthFinancial prosperity of FedEx and UPS is reflected in the fact that both the companies have hiked their respective dividend payouts in 2017. In February, UPS raised its quarterly dividend by 6.4% to 83 cents per share ($3.32 on an annualized basis).During the first nine months of the year, the company paid approximately $2.1 billion as dividend to shareholders. It also bought back bought back 12.3 million shares for about $1.4 billion in the same period.FedEx hiked its quarterly dividend by 25% to 50 cents a share (or $2 annually) in June. Needless to say, as investors prefer an income generating stock, a high dividend paying one is much coveted. To this end, investors are always on the lookout for companies that have a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments.Price PerformanceShares of both UPS and FedEx have outperformed the S&P 500 Index in the last six months. While, UPS has gained 14.3%, FedEx has rallied 20%. The S&P 500 Index has gained only 8% in the same period. Will the Rally Continue in 2018?With the tax-bill becoming a law in the final month of 2017, stocks like FedEx and UPS are likely to be huge beneficiaries in 2018. The new tax law is likely to boost their share prices further in the current year.FedEx has already stated that the new tax regime is expected to boost fiscal 2018 (ending May 31, 2018) earnings per share in the range of $4.40 to $5.50 (before mark-to-market year end pension accounting adjustments, primarily due to the revaluation of the company’s net deferred tax liabilities).Furthermore, FedEx and UPS are likely to continue with their shareholder-friendly activities in 2018 due to the new tax law. Therefore, a hike in dividends from both the companies can be anticipated in the year.   In fact, the new tax regime is a positive for not only these two companies but the other transportation players as well. Evidently, Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) and American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) announced bonuses worth $1,000 per employee, following the tax overhaul.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

Revenues rose 10% year over year to $17.3 billion and edged past the estimate of $17.19 billion. Solid results were driven by an e-commerce boom, which boosted package deliveries and a rebound in manufacturing, which fuels growth in fright business (read: Solid Data Fuels Trade of Momentum ETFs & Stocks).FedEx foresees 2019 revenue growth of about 9%, which is much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6.02% growth. It also expects earnings per share in the range of $17.00-$17.60; the midpoint of which is much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.18.Following the solid results, FDX shares rose less than 1% in aftermarket hours as rising tension over trade between the United States and China left investors edgy.

2157,FDX,"Markets ended sharply lower on Tuesday, as trade war fears escalated once again after President Donald Trump threatened to impose additional tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods, and China said that it would retaliate. This saw all three major indexes closing in the red. The Dow gave up all of its gains for the year, posting its sixth-day losing streak.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) declined 1.2%, to close at 24,700.21. The S&P 500 declined 0.4% to close at 2,762.57. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,725.59, declining 0.3%. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) hit almost a three-week high of 14.68 points before easing to 13.35. A total of 7.12 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.95 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.41-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.34-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.How did the Benchmark Perform?The Dow lost 287.26 points, with shares of trade-sensitive industrial stocks suffering the most. Shares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) declined 3.8% and 3.6%, respectively. The sixth consecutive decline for Dow is the longest such decline since Mar 2017. Caterpillar has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Tuesday was also an eventful day, as General Electric Co (GE  -  Free Report) lost its spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after more than a century.

The Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI) declined 2.1%, while the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) declined 1.8%. The tech heavy Nasdaq lost 21.44 points.Fears of Trade War EscalateFears of a trade war between the United States and China once gain made investors jittery. On Monday, President Donald Trump ordered United States Trade Representative to identify Chinese goods worth $200 billion for additional tariffs of 10%. Trump also threatened China that the United States would impose tariffs on additional $200 billion goods if China tried to retaliate.Consequently, China too said that it would have to take comprehensive measures to counter United States’ trade moves. This once again dented investors’ confidence and rattled markets. Shares of chipmakers, which heavily depend on China for a large portion of their revenues, tumbled on the news. Shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) declined 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively. Shares of Broadcom Inc.

2158,FDX,"Shares of FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) have gained 34%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 14.2% in 2017. In fact, the company has also outperformed its rival United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) that gained only 3.9% in the same period.Reasons for FedEx’s OutperformanceThe strong e-commerce growth bodes well for FedEx. Moreover, the company reportedly experienced a highly successful holiday season which is a huge positive. In fact, FedEx outperformed in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended Nov 30, 2017) as well. The outperformance was driven by increased package volumes during the peak holiday season. Also, growth was witnessed across all the major segments of the company — FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight.Furthermore, we are impressed with the company's decision to reward shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks. In June 2017, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 25% to 50 cents a share (or $2 annually) from 40 cents (or $1.60 annually). The  dividend hike not only highlights FedEx’s commitment to create value for shareholders but also underscores the company’s strong financial condition and confidence in its business prospects. Additionally, a look at past records reveals FedEx’s stable dividend payment history.The hike in shipping rates announced in September 2017 is expected to boost revenues. FedEx's efforts to modernize its aircraft fleet are also encouraging.New Tax Regime is a PositiveOn Dec 22, President Trump signed the much-anticipated tax bill into law (Tax Cut and Jobs Act). The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package reduces corporate taxes from 35% to 21%. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to aid FedEx, for which the effective tax rate was 35.4% in the first half of fiscal 2018.Moreover, companies like FedEx spend significantly for capital expenditures. In the new regime, these companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately, which was not allowed earlier. As a result, their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly owing to higher deductions. This, in turn, will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, among others.The new tax regime is expected to boost fiscal 2018 earnings per share in the range of $4.40 to $5.50 (before mark-to-market year end pension accounting adjustments, primarily due to the revaluation of the company’s net deferred tax liabilities).Estimate Revisions & Style ScoreUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock’s prospects. FedEx scores impressively on this front as well. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings being revised 2.5% and 3.3% upward, respectively, over the last 30 days.Additionally, the stock has an attractive VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Attractive Valuation & Zacks RankFedEx is attractively valued. Going by the EV by EBITDA ratio, the stock doesn’t look expensive at this point.  The measure for the stock is 9.4, which is favorable compared with the S&P 500's 11.9. The stock’s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly signals more upside.Taking into account the above-mentioned tailwinds and the favorable readings, we believe that the current price represents an attractive entry point for investors. The company’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) also supports our view.

2159,FDX,"It is a well-established fact that the widely-diversified transportation sector including airline companies, railroads, truckers, shippers to name a few, has struggled for the better part of 2017. Sector participants have been plagued by a number of headwinds like disruptions from back-to-back hurricanes, the devastating earthquake in Mexico, declining automotive volumes, issues related to customer dissatisfaction and high costs (labor as well as fuel).The lackluster performance of the sector in the first nine months of the year can be seen from the graph below. The chart clearly indicates that the sector has climbed only 8.8%, underperforming the S&P 500 Index, which appreciated 12.6% over the same period.Uptrend Over the Last Few MonthsHowever, matters have been changing for the better over the past few months on the back of several tailwinds. We are optimistic about the fact that the sector has outperformed the S&P 500 index in a month. It has gained 6.8% compared with the S&P 500 index that advanced 3.5% over the same time frame.Railroads Poised for a Great 2018Railroads have been benefiting since the beginning of 2017 after struggling for the past couple of years. The prime factors contributing to this improved scenario are increased coal and intermodal revenues.Particularly with President Donald Trump’s presidency, the coal industry is seeing better days. The President is aiming to revive the industry by relaxing regulations, which were hurting its prospects.The rise in natural gas prices is also favorable to boosting demand for coal. Moreover, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), coal production in the United States will increase in 2018. Since revenues from coal contribute significantly to the railroads’ top line, any positive development for the commodity means good news for the sector.Apart from coal, the scenario pertaining to another key source of revenues for railroads and intermodal, has improved by leaps and bounds this year. In fact, intermodal shipments are expected to grow 4.2% in 2018. This in turn will drive the top line for railroads.Moreover, railroads like Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) have hiked their quarterly dividend payouts this year, indicating their financial prosperity. The solid financial status of these companies bodes well for 2018.Recovery of the U.S. economy is also likely to pave the way for railroads. Notably, U.S. GDP is expected to increase by 2.4% in 2018, higher than what was achieved in the last two years. Generally, a buoyant domestic economy results in an uptick in rail shipments of goods across the United States.The improved economic scenario is evident from the fact that in the third quarter of 2017, the domestic economy expanded at an impressive annual rate of 3%, per the latest report from the Commerce Department. The reading was above the consensus estimate of 2.6%.Trump’s Tax Overhaul — A BoonThe biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years is a positive for the transport companies and should propel the sector’s growth in 2018. Corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% as a result of this move.Transportation stocks — mainly railroads and airlines — invest significantly for capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. Consequently, U.S. companies need to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from the taxable income immediately, per the U.S. tax overhaul. Naturally, this aspect hugely favors transports.As and when the companies are able to reduce capital expenses in the year of their occurrence, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This will in fact leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases among others.Notably, FedEx Corp. (FDX  -  Free Report) has already indicated that it will increase spending on its various logistics and delivery businesses with the windfall payout the tax cut will grant. Apart from railroads and package delivery companies, stocks belonging to the airline space  are also expected to be huge benefactors from the U.S. tax overhaul. The capital-intensive nature of the industry implies that the above-mentioned benefits pertaining to capital expenses should assist the carriers as well.Since most airline companies are almost entirely exposed to the statutory corporate tax rate, the massive tax cut is expected to help them save a considerable amount in tax payment in the United States.Airlines’ Profitability to Rise in 2018The International Air Transport Association unveiled a rosy view for carriers with respect to the profitability level for 2018. The research firm predicts global net profit of $38.4 billion for the industry. This is much higher than the 2017 profitability forecast of $34.5 billion (increased from the $31.4 billion predicted in June). This bright projection despite increased costs can be attributed to the strong demand for air travel.The top line is predicted to come in at $824 billion next year compared with $754 billion, forecast in the current year. Cargo revenues are likely to increase to $59.2 billion for 2018 (estimated revenues for 2017 are $54.5 billion).Per the forecast, 6% air travel growth is expected in 2018 compared with 7.5% rise in 2017. This estimated figure for 2018 is however, above the average growth of 5.5% in the last 10-20 years.The research firm has also predicted that the average net profit per departing passenger would be $8.90 in 2018 compared with $8.45 in 2017.Declining air fares have been hurting the top lines of carriers. Although low airfare brings good news for flyers, it is a bane to the airline companies. However, air fares are expected to rise in 2018, thanks to the likely oil price surge of 10.7% to $60/barrel for Brent Crude. High air fares will boost the top lines of carriers.Moreover, the bullish unit revenue forecasts projected by several carriers in the recent times reflect their easing revenue related woes. Notably, in December, JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) provided a raised guidance for the fourth quarter. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company now expects RASM in the range of down 0.5% to up 1.5% (on a year-over-year basis). The revised view reflects an improvement from the prior outlook of a decline of 3% to flat year over year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) now anticipates operating revenues per available seat miles (RASM: a key measure of unit revenues) for the fourth quarter of 2017 to increase 1-2%, higher than the previous guidance of a slight rise of up to 1.5%.  The progress in the condition of the sector is highlighted by the upgrade in the Zacks Industry Ranks of most components in the transportation space. For instance, the Transportation-Airline division carries a bullish Zacks Industry Rank of 72 (out of 250 plus groups). This favorable rank places the companies within the top 28% of the Zacks industries.With things looking up for the transportation sector, we have zeroed in on four stocks with potential to outperform in the upcoming year.4 Prominent PicksGiven the vast size of the sector, it is no mean task to zoom in on the likely outperformers for the coming year. This is where the Zacks Rank, justifying a company’s strong fundamentals, can come in really handy. In addition to a favorable Zacks Rank, the stocks have a sound VGM Score. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows you to streamline your search and eliminate the negative aspects of the stocks to select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. Our research shows that stocks with an impressive  VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Apart from a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM score, the stocks also possess large market capitalizations to their credit.  This is because focusing on such stocks is considered safe. Their large market capitalizations provide the requisite cushion to combat economic downturns and stringent credit conditions.Deutsche Lufthansa AG , commonly known as Lufthansa is one of the largest German airlines and is headquartered in Cologne, Germany. The company carries a Zacks Rank of 2 and has a market capitalization of $16.59 billion. It has a solid VGM Score of A. The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the current financial year (F1) is 8.3, lower than the industry average of 11.1.The stock has returned more than 100% so far this year, outperforming the Transportation sector’s gain of 11.8%.

This Zacks #2 Ranked player has an encouraging expected earnings growth rate (next 3-5 years) of 12.8%, higher than the industry’s 11% growth. The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the current financial year (F1) is 20.1, lower than the industry average of 26.5.The company has a market capitalization of $63.95 billion and a strong VGM Score of A. Additionally, the stock has returned 34.4% on a year-to-date basis.Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report) is a low-cost, low-fare Latin American airline, headquartered in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The company has a market capitalization of $1.43 billion and is a #1 Ranked player. It has a commendable VGM score of A. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 being revised 23.3% upward over the last 30 days.The company has returned more than 100% so far this year.SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) is the holding company for two scheduled passenger airline operations and an aircraft leasing company.

It has a  VGM score of A.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 1.5% upward over the last 60 days.

"
2160,FDX,"I would say a little bit of both – earnings will likely turn out on the lower side in the third quarter, but are most likely on the higher side for the fourth quarter and beyond. Expectations for the third quarter seem fair. But given management’s track record of under-promising and over-delivering and sell-side analysts’ gullibility to go along with it, we will likely see the expected decline of 3.4% to be on the low side.
"
2161,FDX,"The third quarter earnings decline is broad-based, with half of the 16 Zacks sectors showing negative year-over-year comparisons, though the weakness is particularly significant in Energy (-24.9%), Basic Materials (-22.3%), and Autos (-21.9%). Among the positive growers, Finance earnings are expected to be up 15.5%, while the Construction sector will see a 42.3% earnings gain. Excluding Finance, total earnings would be down 6.7%.
"
2162,FDX,"But even more striking that the negative third quarter growth rate is the expectation for the following quarter – the fourth quarter of 2012. Unlike what we saw in the second quarter (+4%) and is expected in the third quarter (-3.4%), the fourth quarter is expected to bring earnings growth of 7.9%. Easy comps account for part of this fourth quarter growth projection. But the biggest driver seems to be this expectation that the relatively soft economic backdrop of the last few quarters is a temporary phenomenon and ‘normal’ growth resumes from the fourth quarter onwards.
"
2163,FDX,"Maybe the sell-side research analysts whose projections these bottom-up aggregate growth rates reflect are onto something that the rest of us don’t know yet. But given what we heard from FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) - Analyst Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) - Analyst Report) and Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) - Analyst Report) recently, the odds are high that we will see the fourth quarter growth expectations come down significantly as the third quarter reporting season gets underway. That’s perhaps what will happen to expectations for next year, which is currently projected to have earnings growth of 12%.Key Points
"
2164,FDX,"Getting ready for the start of the third-quarter 2012 reporting season, with total earnings expected to decline 3.4% in the quarter from the same period last year. This growth expectation reflects 1.4% drop in total revenues and a 16-basis point contraction in net margins. Total earnings were up 4% in the second quarter.
"
2165,FDX,"Third quarter earnings would be even weaker had it not been for the 15.5% growth expected in the Finance sector -- one of only two sectors to have double-digit positive earnings growth (Construction is the other).
"
2166,FDX,"Excluding Finance, total S&P 500 earnings would be down 6.7% in the third quarter, which compares to ex-Finance growth of negative of 1.4% in the second quarter. Easy comps at AIG (AIG  -  Free Report) - Analyst Report) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) - Analyst Report) account for most of the Finance earnings growth.
"
2167,FDX,"Energy and Basic Materials have the weakest growth profiles, with Energy earnings expected to be down 24.9% and Basic Materials earnings down 22.3%. Both of these sectors were the weakest in the second quarter as well.
"
2168,FDX,"Tech sector earnings are expected to be flat from the same period last year (up only 0.4%). This compares to growth rates of 7.4% in the second quarter and 15.5% in the first quarter of 2012. Excluding Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) - Analyst Report), Tech sector earnings are expected to be down 4.6% in the third quarter.
"
2169,FDX,"Unlike expectations for the third quarter, estimate for the following quarter remain quite strong, with total earnings expected to be up 7.9% in the fourth quarter. Of the 8 sectors that are projected to have negative year-over-year comparisons in the third quarter, six are expected to turn positive, with Basic Materials and Autos as the most prominent. Energy becomes far less of a drag in the fourth quarter.
"
2170,FDX,"Net margins are expected to be down in the third quarter, both year over year as well as sequentially. Ten of the 16 sectors are expected to see margins contract in the third quarter, including Tech. But margins are expected to improve back up in the fourth quarter.
"
2171,FDX,"Total earnings for the full years 2012 and 2013 are expected to be up 6.7% and 12%, respectively. Revenues are expected to be essentially flat this year (up only 0.2%), but up 3.9% in 2013.
"
2172,FDX,"The bottom-up ‘EPS’ estimates for 2012 and 2013 -- reflecting projections of analysts at brokerage firms covering individual companies -- currently stand at $102.95 and $114.91, respectively. The top-down estimates -- reflecting the projections of strategists at brokerage firms -- currently stand at $101.96 and $108.58 for 2012 and 2013, respectively.READ THE FULL EARNINGS TRENDS REPORT by clicking here: Earnings Expectations: Too Low or Too High?RELATED ARTICLESMixed Econ Data, Spain Gets TenseGDP, Durables, Claims All DiveHow to Find a Successful Investment Opportunity by Tracking an Industry Trend

2173,FDX,"After the closing bell yesterday, the transport bellwether FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) reported weak fiscal 2018 first-quarter earnings results. The courier company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the top and bottom lines and provided bleak earnings guidance. A cyberattack and Hurricane Harvey took a toll on the company’s business (read: Hurricane Harvey Puts These ETF Areas in Focus).Earnings per share came in at $2.51, far below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.17 and down from the year-ago earnings of $2.82. Revenues rose 4.1% year over year to $15.30 billion but fell shy of our estimate of $15.37 billion.A cyberattack on Jun 29 crippled the company’s Ukraine business, TNT Express, and slashed 79 cents per share from its profits while Hurricane Harvey, which wreaked havoc in southeastern Texas in late August, wiped out 2 cents per share. The headwinds compelled the company to reduce its fiscal 2018 earnings per share guidance from $13.20-$14.00 to $12.00-$12.80. The midpoint is well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.63 (read: Petya Malice Spilling Over: Buy Cybersecurity Stocks & ETFs).However, the second-largest U.S. package delivery company is confident of the long-term growth prospect and reaffirmed its commitment to improve operating income at the FedEx Express segment by $1.2-$1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2017.Following the results, FDX shares plunged as much as 4% in aftermarket hours on elevated volume. Currently, FedEx has a Rank #4 (Sell) and a dismal Industry Rank in the bottom 18%, suggesting some rough trading at least in the near term. However, the stock has strengthening fundamentals with a solid Value, Growth and Momentum Style score of B, A and A, respectively.ETFs in FocusThe disappointing FedEx report is expected to hurt transport ETFs – iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report),SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report) and First Trust Nasdaq Transportation ETF (FTXR  -  Free Report). All these funds have an unfavorable Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell) (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).IYTThe ETF tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to the small basket of 20 securities. Out of these, FedEx occupies the top position in the basket with 13.7% of the assets. Within the transportation sector, air freight and logistics takes the top spot with 29.9% share in the basket while railroads (25.7%), trucking (19.2%) and airlines (19.1%) round off the next three. The fund has accumulated nearly $849.5 million in AUM while it sees a good trading volume of around 315,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in fees per year from investors and has gained 6% in the year-to-date time frame.XTNThis fund follows the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index and uses almost an equal weight methodology for each security. Holding 45 stocks with AUM of $178.5 million, FedEx accounts for 2.7% share in the basket. The product is heavily exposed to trucking, which accounts for 31.5% of total assets while airlines and air freight & logistics also make up for 26.3% and 22%, share, respectively. The fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a light volume of about 29,000 shares a day. XTN is up 7.1% so far in the year (read: Hurricane Irma: ETF Winners & Losers).FTXRThis fund offers exposure to the 30 most-liquid U.S. transportation securities based on volatility, value and growth by tracking the Nasdaq US Smart Transportation Index. FedEx occupies the fifth position in the basket with 7.7% share. FTXR has accumulated $3.5 million in its asset base and charges 60 bps in annual fees. Average trading volume is meager at 1,000 shares. The ETF has added 4.6% in the year-to-date time frame.Our ViewDespite weak FedEx results and a sluggish outlook, investors shouldn’t completely write off transportation ETFs from their holdings. This is because these funds have spread out exposure to a number of firms in various types of industries like railroads, airlines and low-cost trucking suggesting that the space can easily counter shocks from some of the industry’s biggest components.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

2174,FDX,"FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) reported disappointing results in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended Aug 31, 2017).

2175,FDX,"Although we’re not in a traditionally busy earnings period, there are several key reports to look forward to next week. Q2 earnings season was strong across the board, as broad-based growth reached the double digit levels for the second quarter in a row. These first reports could set the trend for the upcoming Q3 season, so investors will want to keep a close eye on the companies reporting soon.With that said, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.And today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week and selected the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of September 18.1.       Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report)San Jose-based Adobe System is one of the largest software companies in the world. Adobe is a leading provider in the digital marketing and digital media spaces, and its Creative Cloud studio is an industry standard. The company is set to report its fiscal third-quarter earnings after the market closes on September 19.According to our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, Adobe is expected to report earnings of $1.00 per share and revenues of $1.81 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 34% and 24%, respectively. Adobe also has a positive Earnings ESP of 1.04%, which implies that analyst sentiment has warmed as we’ve approached its report date. However, since the stock is also a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), the predictive power of this figure is nullified. 2.       FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report)FedEx is one of just a few notable names in the global delivery services industry, and the company has actually underperformed its rivals recently. In fact, over the past three months, the industry as a whole has gained 9.5% on average, and United Parcel Service (UPS) has gained about 10.5%. FedEx, however, is lagging behind with just a 7.9% gain over the time.FedEx will report its fiscal first-quarter earnings after the closing bell on September 19. The company recently committed to modernizing its fleet, but that has led to subdued fiscal 2018 guidance. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for earnings growth of just 9%, and FDX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). 3.       The Finish Line, INc. Athletic apparel and footwear retailer Finish Line is scheduled to release its second-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the market opens on September 22. Finish Line shares are down about 44% year-to-date, and the company has struggled to adapt to a changing retail environment that has punished mall-based chains like itself.Heading into its report date, Finish Line is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), and our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for profits to slump by over 75% year-over-year. Still, Finish Line is sporting an “A” grade for Value and an overall VGM grade of “A.” Want more stock market analysis from this author?

The bottom line also expanded 28.8% on a year-over-year basis.Quarterly revenues climbed 21.2% year over year to $15,728 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,563.8 million. Results were aided by strong sales across all divisions at FedEx.Let’s see how things shape up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlayHigh costs are likely to hurt the company’s results in the first quarter. Costs related to integration process of TNT express are expected to hamper the bottom line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. In fact, FedEx mentioned that the TNT Express integration process will take three years more to reach full completion.Per the company’s claims, the cyber attack on Jun 28, which has disrupted operations at its TNT Express division, is anticipated to hit results in the quarter to-be-reported.In view of the rapid e-commerce growth, FedEx intends to spend heavily to ensure a record-breaking 2017 peak season. The company will also spend a significant amount on fleet modernization. This high capital expenditure further adds to the company’s woes and raises concerns for first-quarter results.However, the company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks are impressive. In June, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 25% to 50 cents a share (or $2 annually) from 40 cents (or $1.60 annually). Shares of FedEx have been struggling of late. The stock has inched up a mere 1.9%, significantly underperforming the industry’s 5.1% gain in the last three months.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that FedEx is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: FedEx has an Earnings ESP of -5.05%.

2177,FDX,"Although the greatest fears of those closely watching Hurricane Irma as it approached the Florida coast — the West coast, Gulf of Mexico side, as opposed to a direct hit on Miami Beach and complete engulfment of the entire state — were better than anticipated, we’ll still be looking at massive rescue and clean-up efforts that will face enormous risk of human life and other sacrifices over the coming weeks.

"
2179,FDX,"Optimists likely call it a consolidation phase, but the reality is that the market appears to be having second thoughts about the QE3-inspired gains. The gains started in the summer and pushed stocks to their highest level after the announcement.
"
2180,FDX,"The market pause of the last few trading sessions may just be a sign of tentativeness and nervousness ahead of next week’s key economic data and the start of the third quarter reporting season. But the tentativeness is completely justified. The return today of Spain and Eurozone-centric concerns will add to the nervousness.
"
2181,FDX,"I have been skeptical of the sustainability of Fed-inspired gains for awhile and continue to believe that Bernanke’s open-ended bond purchase program is largely irrelevant to the broader issues facing the U.S. economy. Lack of economic growth, both in the U.S. as well as worldwide, is steadily emerging as a far bigger drag on corporate profitability than many in the market realize at this stage. We have seen this show up in earnings projections for the third quarter, which are expected to be down 3.4% from the same period last year.
"
2182,FDX,"But expectations remain high for the fourth quarter and beyond in the hope that the economic growth issues in the U.S. and China will prove to be temporary. It is useful to be somewhat skeptical of that view at this stage and view the recent profit warnings from companies like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) as a sign of things to come.
"
2183,FDX,"My sense is that the third quarter reporting season will provide this market a reality check, helping bring down earnings and overall growth expectations for the out quarters. This may not trigger a precipitous market sell-off, but it will most likely cause the market to give back some, if not all, of its recent gains.RELATED ARTICLESWhen Do You Sell Apple?Can Mexico Become the ""New China""?The Q3 Earnings Effect on the Market (VIDEO)
"
2184,FDX,"I would say a little bit of both – earnings will likely turn out on the lower side in the third quarter, but are most likely on the higher side for the fourth quarter and beyond. Expectations for the third quarter seem fair. But given management’s track record of under-promising and over-delivering and sell-side analysts’ gullibility to go along with it, we will likely see the expected decline of 3.4% to be on the low side.
"
2185,FDX,"The third quarter earnings decline is broad-based, with half of the 16 Zacks sectors showing negative year-over-year comparisons, though the weakness is particularly significant in Energy (-24.9%), Basic Materials (-22.3%), and Autos (-21.9%). Among the positive growers, Finance earnings are expected to be up 15.5%, while the Construction sector will see a 42.3% earnings gain. Excluding Finance, total earnings would be down 6.7%.
"
2186,FDX,"But even more striking that the negative third quarter growth rate is the expectation for the following quarter – the fourth quarter of 2012. Unlike what we saw in the second quarter (+4%) and is expected in the third quarter (-3.4%), the fourth quarter is expected to bring earnings growth of 7.9%. Easy comps account for part of this fourth quarter growth projection. But the biggest driver seems to be this expectation that the relatively soft economic backdrop of the last few quarters is a temporary phenomenon and ‘normal’ growth resumes from the fourth quarter onwards.
"
2187,FDX,"Maybe the sell-side research analysts whose projections these bottom-up aggregate growth rates reflect are onto something that the rest of us don’t know yet. But given what we heard from FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) recently, the odds are high that we will see the fourth quarter growth expectations come down significantly as the third quarter reporting season gets underway. That’s perhaps what will happen to expectations for next year, which is currently projected to have earnings growth of 12%.Key Points
"
2188,FDX,"Getting ready for the start of the third-quarter 2012 reporting season, with total earnings expected to decline 3.4% in the quarter from the same period last year. This growth expectation reflects 1.4% drop in total revenues and a 16-basis point contraction in net margins. Total earnings were up 4% in the second quarter.
"
2189,FDX,"Third quarter earnings would be even weaker had it not been for the 15.5% growth expected in the Finance sector -- one of only two sectors to have double-digit positive earnings growth (Construction is the other).
"
2190,FDX,"Excluding Finance, total S&P 500 earnings would be down 6.7% in the third quarter, which compares to ex-Finance growth of negative of 1.4% in the second quarter. Easy comps at AIG (AIG  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) account for most of the Finance earnings growth.
"
2191,FDX,"Energy and Basic Materials have the weakest growth profiles, with Energy earnings expected to be down 24.9% and Basic Materials earnings down 22.3%. Both of these sectors were the weakest in the second quarter as well.
"
2192,FDX,"Tech sector earnings are expected to be flat from the same period last year (up only 0.4%). This compares to growth rates of 7.4% in the second quarter and 15.5% in the first quarter of 2012. Excluding Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Tech sector earnings are expected to be down 4.6% in the third quarter.
"
2193,FDX,"Unlike expectations for the third quarter, estimate for the following quarter remain quite strong, with total earnings expected to be up 7.9% in the fourth quarter. Of the 8 sectors that are projected to have negative year-over-year comparisons in the third quarter, six are expected to turn positive, with Basic Materials and Autos as the most prominent. Energy becomes far less of a drag in the fourth quarter.
"
2194,FDX,"Net margins are expected to be down in the third quarter, both year over year as well as sequentially. Ten of the 16 sectors are expected to see margins contract in the third quarter, including Tech. But margins are expected to improve back up in the fourth quarter.
"
2195,FDX,"Total earnings for the full years 2012 and 2013 are expected to be up 6.7% and 12%, respectively. Revenues are expected to be essentially flat this year (up only 0.2%), but up 3.9% in 2013.
"
2196,FDX,"The bottom-up ‘EPS’ estimates for 2012 and 2013 -- reflecting projections of analysts at brokerage firms covering individual companies -- currently stand at $102.95 and $114.91, respectively. The top-down estimates -- reflecting the projections of strategists at brokerage firms -- currently stand at $101.96 and $108.58 for 2012 and 2013, respectively.READ THE FULL EARNINGS TRENDS REPORT by clicking here: Earnings Expectations: Too Low or Too High?
"
2197,FDX,"The earnings report from FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) this morning puts the spotlight back on the global growth worries that were drowned out by the hoopla surrounding the QE3 announcement.
"
2198,FDX,"Investors seem to think of QE3 as the panacea that Bernanke was at pains to point out it was not. The Fed’s new program hasn’t had much chance to do its magic on the economy yet, but one can reasonably assume that it is largely irrelevant to the type of issues facing global bellwether operators like FedEx.
"
2199,FDX,"FedEx came ahead of the lowered guidance it provided two weeks back. But whatever that positive surprise is worth, it is more than offset by lowered guidance for the current quarter and full fiscal year. The company’s eCommerce-centric package delivery business seems to be doing fine and would likely get a further lift in the current period from strong demand for Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhone 5.
"
2200,FDX,"It is the international air freight business, accounting for more than 60% of the firm’s revenue, which is facing weakening demand as a result of the worldwide economic slowdown.
"
2201,FDX,"We will likely hear more about this theme of weak economic backdrop weighing on corporate profitability as the third quarter earnings season gets underway. Estimates are for earnings to drop 3.9% in the third quarter from the same period last year, which reflects a roughly equivalent drop in revenues and flat margins.
"
2202,FDX,"This is the weakest earnings growth outlook at the start of a reporting season that we have seen since late 2009. Expectations are for a turnaround in the fourth quarter, with earnings expected to increase a solid 7.9%. For next year, the consensus expectation is for growth of about 10%, on top of the high single digits growth this year.
"
2203,FDX,"Count me as skeptical of these forecasts. With growth a problem all over the world, these growth expectations may not be much different than ‘hoping for the best.'
"
2204,FDX,"Technically speaking, the third quarter reporting season started today with the FedEx report, though the market starts paying attention only after Alcoa’s (AA) results next month. We still have some time to go before then. But I would be surprised if the market can build on its recent gains in this time period.
"
2205,FDX,"And hardly anyone would find the key take-away from the actual reporting season to be reassuring enough to sustain the gains made in recent days. Bottom line, this fall may not be that kind to the stock market.RELATED ARTICLESShaky Fundamentals for the BullWeighing In On QE3 (VIDEO)Dow 30 Shakeup: Did They Make the Right Pick?
"
2206,FDX,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, FedEx has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16.55. This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 comes in at about 20.09.If we focus on the long-term trend of the stock the current level puts FedEx’s current PE near its median (which stands at 17x) over the observed period. Notably, the current level is much below the highs experienced for the stock over the period, suggesting some level of undervalued trading in light of its own historical trend. Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the air freight industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.18. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that FedEx has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 15.13 – which is lower than the current level. So, it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for FedEx stock in the near term too.PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, FedEx has a P/S ratio of about 0.91. This is much lower than the air freight industry average, which comes in at 1.4x right now. As we can see, the stock is trading at its median value for the time period from a P/S metric. This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, FedEx currently has a Value Score of ‘A’, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes FedEx a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the EV/EBITDA multiple for FedEx is just 8.19, a level that is lower than the industry average of 9.75. The EV/EBITDA multiple (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) is capital structure-neutral, as it takes into account the level of debt on a company’s balance sheet, not just its equity.Clearly, FDX is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though FedEx might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘A’ and a Momentum score of ‘D’. This gives FDX a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘A’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower, while the full year estimate has seen four upward revisions and five downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased 1.6% over the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up 0.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:FedEx Corporation Price and Consensus FedEx Corporation Price and Consensus | FedEx Corporation QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineFedEx is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 46% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock.We are also impressed by the company’s efforts to reward shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. In June this year, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.50 a share (or $2 annually) from $0.40 (or $1.60 annually). We believe that the dividend hike not only highlights FedEx’s commitment to create value for shareholders but also underscores the company’s strong financial condition and confidence in its business prospects. Moreover, a look at past records reveals FedEx’s stable dividend payment history.So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

"
2207,FDX,"The powerful stock market reversal and rally that began last week doesn't appear tired yet. Last Wednesday, I wrote about the strength of the reversal and why I was going long through leveraged ETFs like UPRO and TNA, targeting S&P 1,200 at the minimum.  
"
2208,FDX,"And I also recapped a theme about which catalyst matters more: European debt woes or US economic fundamentals. I proposed that Europe's daily headline knee-jerk would begin to matter less than earnings and leading indicators.  
"
2209,FDX,"Today's price action might lead one to say, ""Hey Kevin, you've got this one completely wrong!"" But let's look at what's going on here. The headlines say that the leaders of Germany and France, Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy, had a little summit over the weekend and emerged with fresh proposals and confidence to stem the crisis. The Daily European Head-Fake 
"
2210,FDX,"Did we get specific plans and agreements about Eurozone financial crisis remedies? Nope. We got verbal commitments about recapitalizing banks before the end of the month and the next G-20 summit.  
"
2211,FDX,"That bodes for a 3% rally in US equities? I don't think so. I think money managers are continuing the same theme as last week -- and the last few months, for that matter -- that the ""probable recession"" has been well-discounted and the economy and earnings may fare much better than most were expecting.  
"
2212,FDX,"Since a mild recession was nearly priced-in, what happens to valuations when earnings projections don't fall as much as expected and stocks are on sale? They get really juicy to fund managers, that's what.  The Slow-Growth Overreaction 
"
2213,FDX,"Yes, the bailout of Belgian bank Dexia was a boost to confidence showing that European financial leaders can actually take action during crisis. I have been saying since mid-August that Europe's implosion (i.e., a systemic banking crisis) would be the tipping point that sent the US into recession. But I guess I have always believed they would do what was necessary, even though they appear to be taking their sweet time.  
"
2214,FDX,"And, yes, US corporate earnings estimates can still fall below $90 EPS on the S&P 500 this year. But those earnings still put a 13 times P/E multiple on the broad market at an index level of 1,200.  
"
2215,FDX,"This morning, Zacks Director of Research, Sheraz Mian, offered this evidence of the much-brighter outlook for the US: In an absolute sense, all recent economic readings have been soft and weak. But relative to fears of a recession, they are pointing towards a non-recessionary outlook. Bottom line: the U.S. economy remains weak, but it does not appear to be double dipping.  
"
2216,FDX,"Some early evidence of this non-recessionary tone of recent economic reports has started showing up in estimates for third quarter GDP growth rates. On Friday, Macroeconomic Advisors raised their estimate for third quarter GDP growth from 2% to 2.5%, citing the positive economic reports, particularly the construction data, retail sales and payrolls data. I would expect this trend in positive estimate revisions to gain pace in the coming days.
"
2217,FDX,"I would add to this that the stage is also set for very positive reactions to earnings and guidance. Not that official expectations are so low, but that mental ones are. Analysts and portfolio managers are ""wary of the warnings."" 
"
2218,FDX,"If we don't get them, and we continue to hear ""steady as she goes"" language from CEOs like we got last week from corporate heads at FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), and ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) at a summit in Colombus, Ohio, then stocks will sustain their current forward estimates. The View from the Chart 
"
2219,FDX,"The one piece of evidence that still makes me doubt we'll see S&P 1,300 again this year is the chart. Yes, everyone will be cheerleading the fact we made it back through the 50-day moving average, currently sloping down at 1,175.  
"
2220,FDX,"But I predicted this back in early August as just a natural part of bear market rallies. Now we haven't ""officially"" entered a bear market since the index barely closed 20% off the peak (19.7% by my rough calculation using 1,370 and 1,100).  
"
2221,FDX,"Still, the chart doesn't look exactly bullish. It looks like a lot of sideways bull vs. bear energy needs to be exhausted before we can recover the 200-day moving average. That battle and its data digestion could take another four to six months.  
"
2222,FDX,"And that's with no recession. Just slow growth, especially as China engineers a soft landing. As always, the best investing and trading opportunities will be in playing earnings and technical momentum in quality companies.  
"
2223,FDX,"Even though energy, materials, and industrials are the most sensitive to the global slowdown, catching the swings in names like CVR Energy , Freeport McMoRan (FCX  -  Free Report), Potash (POT), and Cummins (CMI  -  Free Report) has paid off recently. These all will likely test their lows again before long and offer another opportunity.

"
2224,FDX,"The Fed came through as expected, but the markets seemed unimpressed. In fact, the markets appear to have been spooked by the Fed's action. Overnight reports about manufacturing weakness in China and Europe add to concerns about the U.S. growth outlook from the Fed statement.
"
2225,FDX,"The fear is that all the major global economies are slowing down in a synchronized fashion. Having spent pretty much all of its firepower already, there is little that the Fed could do in the face of such a development.
"
2226,FDX,"The Fed action turned out to be somewhat more aggressive than was expected, though many were skeptical of its effectiveness to begin with. The announcement of $400 billion in long-term treasury bond purchases over the next 9 months was bigger than what I wrote about the day before. These purchases will extend the duration of the Fed holdings by almost 2 years to 8 years.
"
2227,FDX,"They also came out with more support for the mortgage market than was expected. The Fed came across sanguine on the inflation question, but its discussion of the growth outlook appeared to show a further downgrade from the last time around. 
"
2228,FDX,"And it is this growth question that has the U.S. and global markets worried. The fact that we have weak reports about China and Europe today doesn't help the picture at all. China's September purchasing-mangers index (PMI), comparable to the U.S. manufacturing ISM report, fell below the prior month's level to 49.4. We also got a sub-50 PMI reading from the Euro-zone for the first time in almost two years.
"
2229,FDX,"In the U.S., we got a sub-par outlook from economic bellwether FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and kind of an inline Jobless Claims reading. Weekly Jobless Claims dropped by a greater than expected 9K for the week to 423K 428K. The prior-week's tally was revised upwards to 432K from 428K. The relatively more stable 4-week average increased by 0.5K last week to 421K.
"
2230,FDX,"The Jobless Claims numbers were not bad. But I don't think the market will be able to read anything into them. The focus will remain on the global economic slowdown, which gets an unhelpful helping hand from this morning's FedEx earnings report. FedEx met earnings expectations on a modest top-line beat, but provided weak guidance, citing slowing global economic growth.

2233,FDX,"The second quarter earnings season is over. Now we are starting to see a few companies report their third-quarter results (period ending in August September or October). Just a trickle so far, but those might provide some clues as to how well the rest of the market will fare in the upcoming earnings season.
"
2234,FDX,"There will be just 36 firms reporting, but 14 of those are in the S&P 500, including Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report), AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report), Carnival Cruise (CCL  -  Free Report), Discover Financial (DFS  -  Free Report), Federal Express (FDX  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report). That is an interesting cross-section of the market which may well provide some interesting insights.
"
2235,FDX,"It will be a light week for economic data. The main focus of the official numbers will be on Housing, starting with the home builders index, followed by housing starts and building permits and finally existing home sales. The Fed is holding a meeting, but there will be no change in the Fed Funds rate. The language of their statement might provide clues about the potential for further unconventional easing steps that they might take.
"
2236,FDX,"With few earnings and little data outside of housing, the focus of the market will likely continue to be on the other side of the Atlantic and the ongoing Greek drama....MondayThe National Association of Homebuilders Index is likely to remain unchanged at 15, which is a simply abysmal reading. This is a magic 50 index, so any reading below 50 indicates a poor outlook for the homebuilders.TuesdayThe Data on Housing Starts and Building Permits will provide the reason for the pessimism among the homebuilders. In July, housing starts were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of just 604,000. They are expected to decline still further to just 592,000 (I’ll take the under on that one). That is down from over 2.2 million at the height of the bubble. It used to be a rarity for housing starts to be below 1 million, but August will mark the 33rd consecutive month where starts have been below 1 million.The best leading indicator for housing starts is building permits. They ran at 597,000 in July and are also expected to be effectively unchanged rising to 598,000 (I’ll also take the under). The bubble peak was also over 2.2 million. Traditionally homebuilding has been the sector that has led us out of recessions. That locomotive is derailed and does not appear likely to get back on track anytime soon.WednesdayAll eyes will be on the Federal Reserve Board, even though everyone knows that the Fed Funds rate will remain in the 0 to 0.25% range it has been stuck in since December 2008. The Fed has pledged to keep it there until the middle of 2013. The Fed is deeply divided on if they should do more to try to support the economy by taking unconventional steps to further ease monetary policy, and the meeting was expanded to two days so they can hash things out. The language of the statement will be carefully parsed to see it they have come to any agreement. Last time there was a highly unusual three dissents to the statement. Watch to see if that changes.Existing home sales were running at an annual pace of 4.67 million in July. Very little change is expected, with the consensus looking for a slight increase to a 4.70 million rate. Since the sale of an existing home is simply the transfer of an existing asset, it generates very little economic activity (aside from realtor’s commissions). However, since people do tend to redecorate “new for them homes there is some activity that is generated. Still, the impact pales in comparison to new home sales, even though new home sales are just a small fraction of used home sales. The important thing in the report is the level of sales relative to inventory, or the months of supply on the market. That gives a very good clue as to the future direction of existing home prices. Housing equity is (or at least used to be) a vital repository of the wealth of the middle class. Since housing tends to be a very leveraged asset, relatively small changes in price can have a big impact on wealth. Also, being “underwater on a mortgage is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a foreclosure to happen. Six months supply is considered normal, and during the bubble, four months was the norm. In July it climbed to 9.4 months from 8.2 months in June, indicating continued downward pressure on housing prices.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They had a very nice decline early in they year, but have been recently in a trading range above 400,000. Last week they increased by 11,000 to 428,000. I would expect a small decline this week, but nothing big enough to really change the story of very weak job growth. The consensus is looking for 417,000. The 400,000 level is important psychologically in that it has historically been the inflection point, below which we tend to create enough jobs to bring down the unemployment rate. The four-week moving average will stay above the 400,000 level, and might top 420,000. The week-to-week numbers can be very volatile, so the four-week average is the thing to focus on. The sharp rise in initial claims were an early warning of the weak jobs report for June. Keep an eye on the prior week’s revision as well as the change from the revised number.Continuing claims have in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 12,000 to 3.726 million. That is down 765,000 from a year ago. I would expect a small decline this week. The consensus is looking for 3.730 million, a very small increase.  Some (most?) of the longer-term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. Those, however, don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims rose by 10,000 last week to 3.608 million, but are down 1.352 million over the last year. Even extended benefits don’t last forever. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 7.144 million, which is down 25,000 from last week (there are some timing issues so the change in continuing and existing claims does not match the change in the total). The total number of people getting benefits is now 2.066 million below year-ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity -- finding a new job -- and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Unless the program is renewed (unlikely given the current Congress) then all extended benefits will end in January. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.FridayNothing of particular significance.Earnings CalendarCompany Ticker Qtr End EPS Est Year Ago EPS Last EPS Surprise % Next EPS Report Date Time Daily PriceACCURAY INC     ARAY       201106 ($0.41) $0.08  -75 20110919 AMC $5.26 LENNAR CORP -A  LEN        201108 $0.11  $0.16  75 20110919 BTO $13.85 ADOBE SYSTEMS   ADBE       201108 $0.44  $0.44  -4.76 20110920 AMC $26.12 ANALOGIC CORP   ALOG       201107 $0.44  $0.56  -9.3 20110920 AMC $45.98 AUTOZONE INC    AZO        201108 $6.97  $5.66  9.91 20110920 BTO $325.77 CARNIVAL CORP   CCL        201108 $1.63  $1.65  18.18 20110920 BTO $33.32 CARNIVAL PLC    CUK        201108 $1.62  $1.65  18.18 20110920 BTO $33.17 CONAGRA FOODS   CAG        201108 $0.31  $0.34  -2.08 20110920 BTO $23.63 FACTSET RESH    FDS        201108 $0.95  $0.82  0 20110920 BTO $87.64 FULL CIRCLE CAP FULL       201106 $0.21  $0.24  0 20110920 AMC $6.96 GENTIUM SPA-ADR GENT       201106 $0.14  $0.21  7.14 20110920 BTO $6.52 JEFFERIES GP-NW JEF        201108 $0.23  $999.00  -4.88 20110920 BTO $14.91 ORACLE CORP     ORCL       201108 $0.44  $0.39  5.8 20110920 AMC $28.95 AMER SUPERCON   AMSC       201106 ($0.08) $0.28  22.22 20110921 BTO $6.01 BED BATH&BEYOND BBBY       201108 $0.84  $0.70  16.13 20110921 AMC $59.36 COPART INC      CPRT       201107 $0.59  $0.43  1.43 20110921 AMC $41.23 FULLER(HB) CO   FUL        201108 $0.47  $0.38  8.7 20110921 AMC $21.03 GENL MILLS      GIS        201108 $0.62  $0.64  0 20110921 BTO $37.80 HERMAN MILLER   MLHR       201108 $0.33  $0.23  15.38 20110921 AMC $18.11 IHS INC-A       IHS        201108 $0.55  $0.62  1.59 20110921 BTO $79.37 RED HAT INC     RHT        201108 $0.19  $0.14  6.25 20110921 AMC $41.24 STEELCASE INC   SCS        201108 $0.17  $0.08  100 20110921 AMC $7.56 TEXAS INDS      TXI        201108 ($0.26) ($0.20) -119.23 20110921 AMC $38.77 CARMAX GP (CC)  KMX        201108 $0.51  $0.48  17.02 20110922 BTO $28.54 CINTAS CORP     CTAS       201108 $0.47  $0.40  11.36 20110922 AMC $31.59 COMTECH TELECOM CMTL       201107 $0.36  $0.73  20.51 20110922 AMC $28.17 DISCOVER FIN SV DFS        201108 $0.87  $0.47  51.39 20110922 BTO $26.19 FEDEX CORP      FDX        201108 $1.48  $1.20  1.74 20110922 BTO $77.08 FINISH LINE-CLA FINL       201108 $0.38  $0.31  0 20110922 AMC $20.50 NIKE INC-B      NKE        201108 $1.21  $1.14  6.9 20110922 AMC $88.04 RITE AID CORP   RAD        201108 ($0.18) ($0.18) 50 20110922 BTO $1.10 SCHOLASTIC CORP SCHL       201108 ($1.03) ($0.95) 17.11 20110922 BTO $27.08 SYNTHESIS ENRGY SYMX       201106 ($0.04) ($0.08) 36.36 20110922 BTO $1.60 TIBCO SOFTWARE  TIBX       201108 $0.16  $0.14  7.69 20110922 AMC $22.30 VAIL RESORTS    MTN        201107 ($1.50) ($1.16) 3.69 20110922 BTO $38.31 KB HOME         KBH        201108 ($0.17) ($0.02) -75 20110923 BTO $6.27

2237,FDX,"Earnings Preview 6/17/11
"
2238,FDX,"Earnings season is over for the first quarter, and we are starting to see the early second quarter firms report, those with May fiscal periods.  Its still very light, with a total of just 36 firms are due to report, however, that includes 14 from the S&P 500.
"
2239,FDX,"The firms reporting this week include:  Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report), Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY  -  Free Report), Conagra (CAG  -  Free Report), Discover (DFS  -  Free Report), Federal Express (FDX  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL) and Walgreens (WAG).  That is a nice cross section of industry, and should provide some nice clues as to how the overall second quarter earnings season will go. 
"
2240,FDX,"It will also be a relatively light one for economic data.  The focus will be on housing with both new and existing home sales due out.  Of the two, New home sales are much more important to economic growth.  The level of inventories relative to sales is the key thing to look at with existing home sales since those give a good clue to the direction of existing home prices, which are extremely important.  We also get data on new orders for durable goods, and the final look at first quarter GDP, a very important measure, but very stale at this point.  Along the way the Fed is meeting and will probably do nothing with regard to either the Fed Funds rate or additional quantitative easing.  Analysts will however parse the statement closely, looking for any changes from the last one.
"
2241,FDX,"MondayNothing of significance.
"
2242,FDX,"TuesdayExisting Home Sales are expected to fall to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.78 million from 5.05 million in April.  What is more significant will be the level of inventories, and if the April months of supply rate of 9.2 months will continue to trend up.  While down from last summer, the level is still extremely high and has been rising again in recent months (it was 8.3 in March) and indicates strong downward pressure on home prices.  That really is what to watch in the existing home sales numbers, since the amount of economic activity generated by an existing home changing hands is not really that big a deal.   Home prices are a very big deal.  Unfortunately it looks like they are falling again. 
"
2243,FDX,"WednesdayThe Federal Reserve is universally expected to keep the Fed Funds rate in the 0 to 0.25% range it has been in since December 2008.  Of more interest will be the commentary at the end of the meeting and how it has changed since the last meeting.  I would expect that it will make more references to economic softness than the prior statement, but that it will continue to see the weakness as temporary.  They will also probably continue to reinvest the proceeds of the securities they have bought in the first two rounds of quantitative easing, but are unlikely to embark on a third round.  Essentially the Fed is going to be on hold for some time, at least through the end of the year if not longer.
"
2244,FDX,"ThursdayWeekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out.  They had a very nice decline early in they year, but then had a very rough month or so in April and May.  Last week they fell by 16,000 to 418,000.   A slight increase is expected next week, rising to 418,000.     The four week moving average will probably stay well above the 400,000 level, where it has been for the last eight weeks (and weekly claims have been above the level for 10 weeks now).  The sharp rise in initial claims were an early warning of the weak jobs report for May.  Robust job expansion is generally associated with initial claims below the 400,000 level.
"
2245,FDX,"Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 21,000 to 3.675 million.  That is down 910,000 from a year ago. I would expect a small decline this week.  The consensus is looking for a level of 3.680 million, a slight increase.   Some of the longer term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks.  Those however, dont last forever either.  Federally paid extended claims fell by 115,000 to 3.885 million, and are down by 1.410 million over the last year.    Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake.  They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 7.401 million, which is down 209,000 from last week (there are some timing issues so the change in continuing and existing claims does not exactly match the change in the total).  The total number of people getting benefits is now 2.200 million below year ago levels.  What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity, finding a new job, and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits.  Given the differential between job growth and the decline in total people getting benefits, it looks like about 1 million people have simply run out of benefits, and have not found new work.  Make sure to look at both sets of numbers!  Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.New Home Sales are expected to fall to a 305,000 rate from 323,000 in April. That is simply a pathetic level, even if it is slightly off the record low set in January. The records go back to the Kennedy administration.  If we do come in at 305,000, that is still lower than any month prior to 2010.  Unlike used home sales, each new home sold represents a lot of economic activity.  Thus this is a very important report.  Normally, new home sales are what leads the economy out of recessions, but they have been a huge drag this time around.
"
2246,FDX,"FridayNew Orders for Durable Goods are expected to rise by 1.0% after falling 3.6% in April.  Previous months are often revised significantly for this data, and those revisions can be just as important as the current months data.   Much of the strength expected comes from the highly volatile transportation equipment segment (which was also a big factor in last months decline).  Since they are so high priced, a few orders for jetliners can really push around the total number, but the orders tend to be lumpy.  Excluding transportation equipment, new orders are expected to rise 0.6% partially reversing a 1.5% decline last month.
"
2247,FDX,"The third (and final) look at GDP growth in the first quarter is released.  Both of the earlier reads were a disappointing growth rate of just 1.8%, down from growth of 3.1% in the fourth quarter. The consensus is looking for no change in the number this time around.  That is an anemic rate, particularly coming out of a deep recession.  The composition of the growth rate is just as important as the overall growth rate itself.  Growth that comes from the build up of inventories for example is of much lower quality than business investment in new equipment and software.  We will provide a complete breakdown of which parts of the economy are adding to growth, and which are serving as brakes on economic growth, and how the contributions have changes since the first look at the numbers last month.
"
2248,FDX,"Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
2249,FDX,"Historically the best indicators of firms which are likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises.  Similarly a recent history of earnings disappointments, cuts in the average estimate for the quarter in the month before the report is due and a poor Zacks rank (4 or 5) are often red flags pointing to a potential disappointing earnings report.  Given the small number of firms reporting this week, there are not many candidates for potential positive or negative surprises, and so I will omit this section.  In the Earnings calendar below, $999.00 should be read as N.A.

2251,FDX,"While a rise in interest rates might diminish the attractiveness of dividend stocks, these will still be in demand on optimism surrounding the biggest tax overhaul in decades. This is because lower corporate taxes will boost companies’ profits leading to handsome dividends and in turn lead to outperformance of stocks with a history of year-over-year dividend growth.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model, a long track record of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields. All these make dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe. Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform peers in all types of market environment.Growth Style Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 15 stocks that fit the bill:Louisiana-based H&E Equipment Services Inc.

2252,FDX,"It is a well-documented fact that the widely-diversified transportation sector, which includes airline companies, railroads, truckers and shippers to name a few, has had a turbulent time in 2017 due to multiple headwinds. Issues ranging from customer dissatisfaction, high fuel costs, driver shortages, technological glitches and service disruptions due to hurricanes have let sector participants down at various times of the year.Lets have a deeper look into the major headwinds that have hampered this sector.Probably, the most infamous incident to have plagued the sector in 2017 was the David Dao incident at United Airlines, the wholly owned subsidiary of United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report), on Apr 9. The passenger dragging episode drew flak from across the globe, resulting in multiple apologies from the company. Apart from United Airlines, customer dissatisfaction issues have also hurt other airline operators like Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report).The rise in fuel prices also do not bode well for transportation stocks as expenses related to the commodity are one of the largest input costs for any sector participant. In fact, oil prices have increased more than 37% in the last three months, hitting a more than two-year high of around $59 recently.Additionally, the recent hurricanes disrupted operations of major sector participants. Consequently, airline operators like United Continental had to cancel multiple flights causing significant loss of revenues.Hurricanes also hurt operations of major railroads like Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) by damaging important rail lines. Freight costs skyrocketed following the natural disasters. Railroads have also been negatively impacted this year by weakness in the automotive sector due to sluggish vehicle production in the United States.In 2017, technological glitches have hurt sector participants as well. Operations at FedEx Corp.’s (FDX  -  Free Report) subsidiary, TNT Express, were crippled by a cyberattack in June. The attack caused large-scale service delays.Due the above-mentioned headwinds, the Zacks transportation sector is currently placed at the bottom among the 16 Zacks Classified sectors.S&P 500 Going from Strength to StrengthWith the domestic economy on a solid footing, it is of little surprise that U.S. stock markets are hitting all-time highs on a fairly regular basis. The S&P 500 also maintained its upward journey for 13 straight months through November. The benchmark index, in fact, hasn’t seen a drop of at least 3% since Nov 7, 2016, the longest stretch on record. The index had rallied more than 19% so far this year and is on track to record its best year since 2013.In fact, strong economic growth has been responsible for this upsurge in the S&P 500 Index. Bullish domestic data released recently are indicative of the healthy position of the U.S. economy.Per the Commerce Department’s second estimate, the U.S. economy expanded at a 3.3% pace in the third quarter. This represents an improvement from the annualized growth rate of 3.1% in the April to June period and the strongest performance since the third quarter of 2014. Meanwhile, President Trump’s proposals to overhaul the tax law and make it business friendly, have added to the already buoyant scenario.Transports Lag the S&P 500 IndexWhile the S&P 500 equity index has been on an uptrend, it has been a turbulent 2017 for the transportation stocks as enumerated above. Given this contrasting scenario, it is of little wonder that the sector has lagged the coveted S&P 500 Index.The recent optimism surrounding the tax bill, which on becoming a law is expected to aid transports significantly, is primarily responsible for the sector giving positive returns to investors this year.  Despite this, it has not been a great year for the sector participants due to the headwinds mentioned above.The Zacks transportation sector rallied 10.9% year to date compared with the broader S&P 500's gain of 20.3%.5 Sector Outperformers in 2017Despite the headwinds to have plagued sector participants, there are a few stocks in the sector which have given higher returns than the sector.However, given the widely diversified transportation sector, it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at such outperformers. To aid their search procedure, we have zeroed in on five such stocks.The stocks, apart from having solid fundamentals, have large market capitalizations.  This is because, focusing on such stocks is considered to be safe. Their large market capitalizations provide the requisite cushion to combat economic downturns and stringent credit conditions.Our first choice is FedEx Corporation. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company offers customers a one-stop source for global shipping, logistics and supply chain solutions. The company has an impressive expected earnings growth rate (next 3 to 5 years) of 12.8%. which is higher than the industry’s 11%.The company has a market capitalization of $63.95 billion and a VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. Additionally, the stock has returned 34.9% year to date. Impressive performance during the current holiday season will boost the stock further. (Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Our next choice is Union Pacific Corporation. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) railroad operator is based in Omaha, NE. As the largest railroad in North America, Union Pacific connects the Pacific and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and eastern United States gateways.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings being revised 2% and 0.7% upward, respectively, over the last 60 days. Additionally, the stock has returned 29.9% year to date. The company has a market capitalization of $101.68 billion.Moreover, railroads including Union Pacific are seeing good times under President Trump due to his pro-coal stance. Trump is aiming to revive the coal industry by relaxing regulations which were hurting its prospects. As fortunes of railroads are tied to coal, any positive development pertaining to the commodity is a boost for railroad operators.Additionally, railroads invest significantly for capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. For example, Union Pacific has announced a $3.1 billion capital plan this year, which is in line with its efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity.In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately as per the provisions of the tax reform bill. Naturally, this aspect hugely favors railroads and if it materializes companies in the space would be huge gainers. Our next choice is also a railroad operator — Norfolk Southern Corporation. This Zacks Rank #3 company is based in Norfolk, VA. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings being revised 2% and 1.7% upward, respectively, over the last 60 days. Additionally, the stock has returned 34% year to date. The company has a market capitalization of $40.31 billion.We are impressed by Norfolk Southern’s focus on rewarding shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The company's cost-cutting efforts to drive the bottom-line are also encouraging. The company expects earnings per share to grow in double digits (compound annual growth rate) by 2020. Airline behemoth Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) has also outperformed the transportation sector this year despite the headwinds. This Zacks Rank #3 company, based in Atlanta, GA, is a leading provider of scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the United States and around the world.The company has a decent record with respect to earnings per share, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters. The average beat is 1.6%. Moreover, the stock has an impressive dividend paying history.The stock has returned 14.3% year to date. Delta has a market capitalization of $39.39 billion. Moreover, the tax reform bill, on becoming a law is expected to aid airline stocks just like railroads. Our list of sector outperformers in 2017 is rounded off by American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report). The company, headquartered in Fort Worth, TX, operates more than 6,700 daily flights to over 330 destinations in more than 50 nations across the globe. This Zacks Rank #3 company has an impressive record with respect to earnings per share, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters. The average beat is 3%.Additionally, the stock has returned 11.2% year to date, outperforming the sector despite the difficult year. The company has a market capitalization of $24.03 billion.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

2253,FDX,"Benchmarks ended in negative territory on Wednesday as investors remained indifferent even as Congress passed the much-awaited Republican tax Bill. During the day, all the three key U.S. indexes reached record high levels initially, but finished lower following a pullback. Markets have already traded higher in the last few sessions on optimism over the passage of the tax cut Bill and witnessed a sell-off after both the Houses actually passed the Bill on Wednesday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) decreased 0.1%, to close at 24,726.65. The S&P 500 Index (INX) fell 0.1% to close at 2,679.25. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,960.96, losing 2.39 points. A total of 6.17 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.84 billion shares. However, advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues. The CBOE VIX decreased 4.4% to close at 9.59.Congress Finally Pass Republican Tax BillOn Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed the Republican tax overhaul Bill. Although, the House passed the tax Bill, it violated Senate rules during this process. The three provisions which were included in the Bill did not fulfill the Byrd Rule. These include criteria used to determine whether private university grants are subject to excise taxes, allowing families to utilize 529 plans to bear home-schooling costs and the name of the Bill itself.The Senate Republicans passed the tax overhaul Bill early Wednesday, excluding the provisions. The Senate voted 51-48 in favor of the Bill, with majority of the Republicans present in the Senate supporting the new tax code. The Bill permanently slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%. Further, companies will be allowed to pay a 5% tax on reinvested earnings and 10% tax on deferred cash earnings. After the Senate passed the tax Bill, the House of Representatives re-voted 224-201 in favor of the Bill, complying with the Senate rules.Optimism regarding lower corporate tax rates has already boosted sentiment for the last few sessions. However, markets witnessed a slight pullback on Wednesday as investors had already priced in the impact of the legislation, which in turn weighed on all the three key U.S. indexes.In the of S&P 500, out of its 10 key sectors, seven of them declined yesterday with both real estate and utilities sectors being key decliners. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) fell 1.1%, becoming the worst performer among the S&P 500 sector. Some of its key holdings including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and Public Storage (PSA  -  Free Report) decreased 2.6% and 1.5%, respectively.Additionally, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) fell 0.8%, becoming the second biggest declining sector among the S&P 500. Some of its key components including Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) and Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) decreased 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively. While, Exelon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Xcel Energy possess a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.FedEx Boosts Dow TransportsMeanwhile, key transportation index, Dow Jones Transportation Average rose 0.9% on Wednesday following gain in shares of FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report). FedEx’s shares increased 3.5% on the back of strong fiscal second quarter earnings results. The company’s earnings (excluding 33 cents from non-recurring items) of $3.18 per share comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.87.Its quarterly revenues increased 9.3% year over year to $16,313 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,672.4 million.FedEx also gave a bullish outlook for fiscal 2018 owing to higher revenues and strong demand.

2254,FDX,"Ahead of today’s opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is trading up another 100 points as the market expects Congress’ massive tax bill to pass both houses and wind up on President Trump’s desk today. This “pricing in” of the tax cut passage seems to haver no end in sight: the Dow has risen nearly 5000 points in the past year, roughly 7000 points since Trump was elected.The question for 2018 is: How high can market indexes like the Dow be expected to rise? After all, the effects of the massive corporate tax cut from 35% to 21% have yet to be implemented — all this “pricing in” remains speculative until action is taken.Clearly, this major legislation will boost growth, and whether it does so because companies put their tax cut windfalls to work to grow their businesses or merely turn them over to shareholders via buybacks and dividend payments, either way it’s good for the stock market. But how much will growth be boosted, and for how long? That’s the issue analysts are grappling with here at the end of calendar 2017.A company like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) — trading up in today’s pre-market following yesterday afternoon’s Q2 earnings and sales beat — has already indicated it will increase spending on its various logistics and delivery businesses with the windfall payout the tax cut will grant. This, in turn, could bolster fortunes for goods and services companies who supply FedEx. Longer-term, this would point toward growth not only on FedEx’s bottom line, but in GDP overall.Other companies, like Coca Cola (KO  -  Free Report) for instance, have already indicated it will simply reward shareholders with what it reaps from the coming tax cuts. At first glance this makes Congress’ efforts on this bill look fairly inessential — after all, corporate profits have been enjoying record earnings quarters for a while now; there was no real need to prime the pump like this.But, whether or not you believe in supply-side economics, the “wealth effect” investors will feel from these increased dividends and share-price backstops will likely increase consumption, drive up retail prices and generate GDP growth all by itself. It may not be a “rising tide lifts all boats” scenario, but stock market participants necessarily see this tax bill as a win-win.

2256,FDX,"After the closing bell yesterday, the transport bellwether FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) reported robust 2018 second-quarter earnings results. The courier company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the top and bottom lines and lifted its full-year earnings guidance.Earnings per share came in at $3.18, far above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.87 and up from the year-ago earnings of $2.77. Revenues rose 9.3% year over year to $16.30 billion and edged past the estimate of $15.67 billion.The company is on track for another record holiday-shipping season. It expects solid demand trends and a rebound from a June cyberattack at its TNT Express unit in Europe to boost its earnings. As such, FedEx raised its fiscal 2018 earnings per share guidance to $12.70-$13.30 from $12.00-$12.80. The new range is much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.47.Should tax reform come into effect, earnings per share could increase by an estimated $4.40- $5.50 for the fiscal year primarily due to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities and a lower tax rate on fiscal 2018 earnings (read: ETFs to Bet on the Final Tax Bill: What Hot, What's Not).Following the results, FDX shares rose more than 2% in aftermarket hours on elevated volume. Currently, FedEx has a Rank #3 (Hold) and a VGM Score of B. However, it has a dismal Industry Rank in the bottom 9%.ETFs in FocusThe solid FedEx report is expected to benefit transport ETFs iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report), SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report) and First Trust Nasdaq Transportation ETF (FTXR  -  Free Report). All these funds have an unfavorable Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell) (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).IYTThe ETF tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to the small basket of 20 securities. Out of these, FedEx occupies the top position in the basket with 14.2% of the assets. Within the transportation sector, air freight and logistics takes the top spot with 30.6% share in the basket while railroads (24.7%), airlines (19.9%) and trucking (18.8%) round off the next three. The fund has accumulated nearly $855.4 million in AUM while it sees a good trading volume of around 230,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in fees per year and has gained 17.6% in the year-to-date time frame.XTNThis fund follows the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index and uses almost an equal weight methodology for each security. Holding 43 stocks with AUM of $213.8 million, FedEx accounts for 2.5% share in the basket. The product is heavily exposed to trucking, which accounts for 32.7% of total assets while airlines and air freight & logistics also make up for 25.7% and 22.9%, share, respectively. The fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a light volume of about 24,000 shares a day.

2257,FDX,"Benchmarks finished in the red on Tuesday after optimism over the passage of the Republican tax Bill was outweighed by its impact on future monetary policy stimulus.

2259,FDX,"Set aside from the plethora of quarterly earnings data during what's known as ""earnings season,"" these past few trading days ahead of the Christmas holiday have shown some significant earnings results from some important companies in different industries, and today is no different. An infotech services major and a global logistics titan both put out fiscal Q2 2018 earnings results this afternoon, with somewhat different results.Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) soundly beat fiscal Q1 2018 estimates on both top and bottom lines after Tuesday's closing bell: $2.45 per share easily outpaced the $2.20 in the Zacks consensus, and quarterly revenues of $6.80 billion was far ahead of the $6.39 billion expected, up 71% year over year. Gross margins rose 55.1%, topping the 50% last quarter.The Zacks Rank #2-ranked memory and storage solutions leader also posted massive upward revisions to guidance: for next quarter a range of $2.51-2.64 per share is well beyond the $1.95 Zacks consensus, with revenue guidance looking for $6.8-7.2 billion in fiscal Q2, well above the $6.08 billion we had expected earlier. For more info on MU's earnings results, click here.Global delivery and logistics giant FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) outperfortmed expectations on its bottom line as well, but offered lower full-year earnings guidance than was previously expected. Earnings of $3.18 per share beat both the $2.87 Zacks consensus as well as the year-ago's $2.77 per share. Revenues in the quarter of $16.3 billion topped the $15.67 billion our analysts were expecting, but full-year guidance of $11.45 - 12.05 per share is well behind the Zacks consensus estimate of $12.47, which we now expect will be revised downward.This marks only the 2nd positive earnings surprise for FedEx in the last 5 quarters.

2260,FDX,"Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’sEarnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:•    Total Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +18.3% from the same period last year on +8% higher revenues, with 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have double-digit earnings growth.•    Earnings growth in the last earnings season (20018 Q1) reached its highest level in more than 7 years at +24.3% on +7.2% revenue gains.•    Q2 estimates moved up modestly since the quarter got underway, but the aggregate positive revision was primarily because of the Energy sector. Excluding the Energy sector, estimates for the quarter would be modestly down in the last 10 weeks.•    Estimates went up for the Energy, Technology and Retail sectors and went down for the Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Autos, and Finance sectors.•    Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +22.7% on +10.5% higher revenues, which would follow +31.1% earnings growth on +13.1% revenue growth in Q1.•    Finance sector earnings are expected to be up +18.2% from the same period last year on +3.4% higher revenues.  •    Earnings growth is expected to be in double-digit territory for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with Autos and Conglomerates as the only sectors expected to have lower Q2 earnings compared to the year-earlier level.•    For the small-cap S&P 600 index, total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +30.5% on +10.7% higher revenues, which would follow +20.5% earnings growth on +7.6% revenue growth in 2018 Q1.•    For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +19.9% on +6.1% higher revenues. For full-years 2019 and 2020, earnings are expected to be up +9.8% and +9.6%, respectively. Revenues for the index are expected to be increase by +4.6% in 2019, and +4.4% in 2020.•    The implied ‘EPS’ for the index, calculated using current 2018 P/E of 17.6X and index close, as of June 19th, is $156.86. Using the same methodology, the index ‘EPS’ works out to $172.26 for 2019 (P/E of 16X) and $188.82 for 2020 (P/E of 14.6X). The multiples for 2018, 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index’s total market cap and aggregate bottom-up earnings for each year.   Q2 earnings season ExpectationsWe still have a few weeks to go before the Q2 earnings season takes center stage; that will happen with the JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) earnings releases on July 13th. Taking nothing away from the big bank results, but the Q2 earnings season has actually gotten underway already, with the recent Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) reports part of the 5 S&P 500 members that have reported results already.All of these early results are from companies with fiscal quarters ending in May, but they form part of our June-quarter tally. We will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in May by the time the big banks come out with results.Total Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +18.3% from the same period last year on +8% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Finance and Technology. This would be the 3rd quarter in a row of double-digit earnings growth for the index, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year as well.Energy sector earnings are expected to more than double from the year-earlier level, up +134.3%. Excluding the Energy sector, Total Q2 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +15%.  Estimates for the quarter have modestly moved up since the quarter got underway, as the chart below shows.This revisions trend is in contrast to the very positive trend we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season. A big part of the positive revisions we saw at the start of the year was directly tied to the impact of tax cuts. But estimates had actually been moving favorably since the second half of 2017 and we expected some of that to show up in estimates for Q2 as well. This didn’t happen, as the above chart shows.While estimates for Q2 as a whole haven’t moved much, they haven’t been that static at the sector level, with estimates for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors going down and estimates for 7 sectors going up. On the negative revisions side, estimates for the Conglomerates, Autos, Construction, Consumer Staples, Finance, Aerospace, and Consumer Discretionary sectors have been cut.On the positive side, the Energy sector really stands out, but estimates for the Technology and Retail sectors have gone up as well. Excluding the positive revisions to the Energy sector’s Q2 earnings estimates, aggregate estimates for the index would be modestly down since early March.Expectations Beyond Q1The chart below contrasts the expected Q2 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming two periods.As you can see, the growth picture remains very strong, even though it is expected to decelerate from Q1’s lofty level. The worrying part isn’t the seeming deceleration, but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond. This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

2261,FDX,"Two market leaders in their respective industries -- software and cloud services giant Oracle Corp. (ORCL  -  Free Report) and transportation logistics major FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) -- also reported fiscal Q4 2018 earnings results after the bell today. Keeping in mind we're coming off a regular trading day rife with worry over a possible trade war brewing between China and the U.S., which may have some impact on stock price results even after earnings results are released.Initially upon releasing fiscal Q4 results, Oracle shares had shot up 4%, though over the past several minutes the stock has begun to sell off from that point. Quarterly numbers were quite favorable, however: earnings of 99 cents beat the Zacks consensus estimate by 5 cents, and beat the year-ago number by 11.2%. Revenues also topped expectations to $11.29 billion from the $11.19 billion analysts had been looking for.Cloud services brought favorable year-over-year comps of 8% to $6.8 billion, which is good because Oracle had found itself slipping behind cloud-based services competitors of late. And following a robust surge in stock prices early this year, Oracle is still attempting to claw back. Guidance on the upcoming conference call ought to bring clear sentiment, especially regarding cloud-based expectations, but for now market reaction is fairly muted. For more on ORCL earnings, click here.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated FedEx also outperformed expectations on the headlines: $5.91 per share vs. the $5.72 expected on $17.3 billion in sales vs. the $17.19 billion estimated were favorable for the global delivery firm. Earnings results, year over year, climbed roughly 40%, while operating margins grew 3.6%. This marks the third straight earnings beat for FedEx.Due to adjustments being made on the company's retirement plan accounting, initial full-year 2019 guidance numbers were not released with the earnings data today. Also, with the shadow of a potential trade war creeping in, FedEx may be one of those companies most deeply affected by a major rift between shipping U.S. and Chinese goods. Shares are up moderately following the results, but, like Oracle, FedEx still has a ways to go to reach its 52-week highs realized in January of this year.

2264,FDX,"Investors focused on the Transportation space have likely heard of FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers? By taking a look at the stock's year-to-date performance in comparison to its Transportation peers, we might be able to answer that question.FedEx is one of 145 companies in the Transportation group. The Transportation group currently sits at #13 within the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different groups, measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the sector to gauge the strength of each group.The Zacks Rank is a successful stock-picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions. The system highlights a number of different stocks that could be poised to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months. FDX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FDX's full-year earnings has moved 2.14% higher. This signals that analyst sentiment is improving and the stock's earnings outlook is more positive.According to our latest data, FDX has moved about 6.02% on a year-to-date basis. Meanwhile, stocks in the Transportation group have gained about 2.43% on average. This means that FedEx is outperforming the sector as a whole this year.Looking more specifically, FDX belongs to the Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, which includes 6 individual stocks and currently sits at #62 in the Zacks Industry Rank. On average, this group has gained an average of 2.30% so far this year, meaning that FDX is performing better in terms of year-to-date returns.Going forward, investors interested in Transportation stocks should continue to pay close attention to FDX as it looks to continue its solid performance.

2265,FDX,"Markets opened lower on Friday after President Donald Trump and his administration announced that it will impose $50 billion worth of tariffs on goods from China. With trade war fears between the world’s two largest economies heightened once again, investors will want to pay close attention to companies reporting their quarterly earnings results next week.The official White House statement said it would implement a 25% tariff on $50 billion of Chinese goods “that contain industrially significant technologies.” China then responded in kind, noting that the country will roll out its own tariffs on American goods in “equal scale and equal strength.”The latest trade war concerns will likely put even more pressure on companies and stocks, which means investors need to know what to expect.

2266,FDX,"The major indexes are sitting, apparently comfortably, just below highs not seen in over 4 years, since before the market meltdown of 2008.
"
2267,FDX,"But one sector index has some investors and traders worried: the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA). Proponents of ""Dow Theory"" believe that bull markets are confirmed by the ""Transports"" showing strength at the same time as the Industrials, for reasons concerning both economic fundamentals and technical price analysis. Below is a chart showing this weakness.
"
2268,FDX,"Dow Theorists say this is a dire warning and can cite ""numerous times over the past 5 years where Dow Theory Non-Confirmations showed us that the market was in a danger zone of topping,"" says Chad Karnes writing for ETF Guide. ""Every single time this signal occurred the broader market soon fell.""
"
2269,FDX,"Given this concern, it's a good idea to take a look at the ""trannies"" in terms of the economy and price. Below is a list of the top holdings of an ETF which tracks the DJTA, iShares IYT. The DJTA index includes 20 companies, but as you can see, these top ten make up nearly 70% of the weighting.
"
2270,FDX,"It's probably not hard to guess who has been dragging on the Transports: the air-freight shippers like UPS and FedEx, who combined comprise 16% of the index, and the airlines which make up only 11% in total. United Parcel Service (UPS) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) both have given subdued outlooks this year about their business, domestic and global.
"
2271,FDX,"But there is also some underlying strength which must be looked at before one rushes out (or to their PC, rather) to sell stocks.
"
2272,FDX,"Railroad businesses and trucking companies have been doing well and this is showing up in the Zacks Rank. With rising revenues and profits, earnings surprises, and the consequent earnings estimate revisions (EER, the bread and butter of the Zacks Rank), these industries seem to speak of healthy economic activity which has only been somewhat reflected in equity prices.
"
2273,FDX,"Below is a table with a focus on companies involved with rail transport. I've included UPS and FDX as well to highlight the importance of the Zacks Industry Rank.
"
2274,FDX,"With over 260 separate industries in the Zacks classification universe, the cumulative Rank of stocks within each group create a very handy aggregate ranking of industry performance. Generally, industry groups in the upper third signify healthy growth.
"
2275,FDX,"One thing to note regarding price is that Union Pacific (UNP) and Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) are 20% of the DJTA and these stocks have done well since the June lows. If it weren't for them, the Transport Index would be stuck in a very low gear.
"
2276,FDX,"Will the Transports find their footing and rally with the Dow? Or are they a harbinger of a broad market decline around the bend? 
"
2277,FDX,"Regardless of the indicator value of the Transports, it pays to look at some of the industries and stocks doing well within it anyway. Rails seem to be signaling something positive about the economy that isn't always obvious. It could be energy related, or it could be rail improvement projects, or both.
"
2278,FDX,"The next step in finding out should be looking at the Zacks company reports and earnings estimate trends for the 3 equipment and leasing companies in particular, Wabtec Corporation (WAB  -  Free Report), Trinity Industries (TRN  -  Free Report), and American Railcar Industries (ARII).

2280,FDX,"Summary
"
2281,FDX,"We have results from only 32 S&P 500 companies at this stage, but what we have seen thus far -- in terms of the actual reports as well as the pre-announcements -- do not inspire much confidence about the rest of the earnings season. If the trend set by these companies holds through the rest of the season, then we probably have a very weak earnings season on our hands.
"
2282,FDX,"Expectations were low to begin with, but growing global growth concerns have been pushing them down even further. By the end of next week, we will have a much more representative sample to judge the quality of this earnings season, as by then we will have seen results from almost a quarter of all S&P 500 results.Key Points
"
2283,FDX,"The second-quarter 2012  reporting season has gotten underway, but reports from the 32 S&P 500 companies that are already out do not inspire much confidence. With results from 90 companies in the index reporting next week, including bellwethers like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) - Analyst Report), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) - Analyst Report), Google (GOOG - Analyst Report) and Coca Cola (KO  -  Free Report) - Analyst Report), we will have a representative-enough sample to judge the quality of this earnings season.
"
2284,FDX,"Of the 30 that have reported results already, only 17 have come out with positive surprises, with a very weak median surprise of 1.1%, down from the 3.6% median surprise for these same companies in the first quarter.
"
2285,FDX,"Total earnings for these 32 companies are flat from the same period last year (up only 0.1%), while these same companies had positive 4.9% growth in the first quarter. This reflects revenue gains of 4% being offset by margin declines of 30 basis points from the same period last year.
"
2286,FDX,"On the earnings calls and pre-announcements, we are starting to hear a lot more about global growth uncertainties than was the case last quarter. We saw this with the earnings results from FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) - Analyst Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) - Analyst Report), and pre-announcements from operators like Cummins (CMI  -  Free Report) - Analyst Report), Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) - Analyst Report), Ford (F  -  Free Report) - Analyst Report) and others.
"
2287,FDX,"Notwithstanding the weak start to the reporting cycle, it is still quite early to write off the earnings season, with 96% of the companies still to report results. Total earnings for these companies are expected to be up 1.4% in the second quarter, reflecting flat revenues and margin gains of 13 basis points.
"
2288,FDX,"Half of the sixteen Zacks sectors are expected to show negative year-over-year earnings comparisons in the second quarter. The Finance sector  has the best year-over-year growth numbers, largely reflecting the group’s sub-par results in the second quarter of 2011 due to weak results at Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) - Analyst Report). Despite the massive hit to J.P. Morgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) - Analyst Report) results, Finance earnings increase 35.9% year over year. However, Excluding Bank of America, Finance barely ekes out with positive growth.
"
2289,FDX,"Tech earnings are expected to increase by up 6% in the second quarter -- a sharp deceleration from the persistent double-digit quarterly growth trend of recent quarters. This compares to growth of 17.7% growth in the first quarter. Even this modest growth disappears once Apple is excluded from the group.
"
2290,FDX,"Full-year earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to increase 9.3% this year and 9% next year. Nine of the sixteen Zacks sectors will have double-digit earnings growth in 2012, with Finance, Tech and Construction showing strong gains, while Utilities and Energy in the negative. Earnings expectations for next year had held up even as the same 2012 were steadily coming down. But we are starting to see estimates for next year come down in recent days.
"
2291,FDX,"Total revenues are expected to increase 3.2% in 2012 and 4.9% in 2013, after gains of 9% and 8.1% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Construction is the only sector with double-digit revenue growth this year, with Industrial Products and Medical in the high single digits.
"
2292,FDX,"The best of the margin expansion trend is now firmly behind us, with second quarter margins expected to be down by 33 basis points sequentially. However, margins are expected to expand by 13 basis points in the second quarter from the same quarter last year. Keep in mind, however, that only 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors will have positive year-over-year margin comparisons, with Finance as the biggest positive driver. Excluding Finance, the year-over-year margin comparison turns negative.
"
2293,FDX,"For full-year 2012, margins are expected to increase 53 basis points, with Finance as the biggest contributor to the expansion and five sectors experiencing contracting margins. Excluding Finance, margins would be up a much more modest 10 basis points this year.

2295,FDX,"Summary
"
2296,FDX,"We have results from only 32 S&P 500 companies at this stage, but what we have seen thus far -- in terms of the actual reports as well as the pre-announcements -- do not inspire much confidence about the rest of the earnings season. If the trend set by these companies holds through the rest of the season, then we probably have a very weak earnings season on our hands.
"
2297,FDX,"Expectations were low to begin with, but growing global growth concerns have been pushing them down even further. By the end of next week, we will have a much more representative sample to judge the quality of this earnings season, as by then we will have seen results from almost a quarter of all S&P 500 results.Key Points
"
2298,FDX,"The second-quarter 2012  reporting season has gotten underway, but reports from the 32 S&P 500 companies that are already out do not inspire much confidence. With results from 90 companies in the index reporting next week, including bellwethers like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Google (GOOG) and Coca Cola (KO  -  Free Report), we will have a representative-enough sample to judge the quality of this earnings season.
"
2299,FDX,"Of the 30 that have reported results already, only 17 have come out with positive surprises, with a very weak median surprise of 1.1%, down from the 3.6% median surprise for these same companies in the first quarter.
"
2300,FDX,"Total earnings for these 32 companies are flat from the same period last year (up only 0.1%), while these same companies had positive 4.9% growth in the first quarter. This reflects revenue gains of 4% being offset by margin declines of 30 basis points from the same period last year.
"
2301,FDX,"On the earnings calls and pre-announcements, we are starting to hear a lot more about global growth uncertainties than was the case last quarter. We saw this with the earnings results from FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), and pre-announcements from operators like Cummins (CMI  -  Free Report), Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), Ford (F  -  Free Report) and others.
"
2302,FDX,"Notwithstanding the weak start to the reporting cycle, it is still quite early to write off the earnings season, with 96% of the companies still to report results. Total earnings for these companies are expected to be up 1.4% in the second quarter, reflecting flat revenues and margin gains of 13 basis points.
"
2303,FDX,"Half of the sixteen Zacks sectors are expected to show negative year-over-year earnings comparisons in the second quarter. The Finance sector  has the best year-over-year growth numbers, largely reflecting the group’s sub-par results in the second quarter of 2011 due to weak results at Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report).

"
2307,FDX,"The best of the margin expansion trend is now firmly behind us, with second quarter margins expected to be down by 33 basis points sequentially.

"
2310,FDX,"The market is full time on Fed watch at present, trying to handicap the future of the QE program. This mood is likely to continue through the summer months, though the start of the 2013 Q2 earnings season in a few days could potentially spotlight another source of vulnerability of the market. Expectations for earnings growth have been coming down as the quarter has progressed and currently remain fairly low.
"
2311,FDX,"The growth picture is even more underwhelming when Finance is excluded from the aggregate growth tally. Given these low expectations, it wouldn’t take much for companies to beat them. But positive earnings surprises may not mean much anymore, since roughly two-thirds of them beat earnings expectations anyway. We have seen that play out with the handful of results from the likes of Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report) and others already. More than earnings surprises, we will be looking for top-line surprises in Q2, particularly after the unusually weak revenue results in Q1.
"
2312,FDX,"Guidance is always important, but it has assumed even more significance this time around given the elevated expectations for the second half of the year. Earnings growth was barely above +1% in the first half of 2013, but it is expected to jump to +9.7% in the back half of the year. Importantly, the growth expectations for the second half of the year are not due to easy comparisons – the level of total earnings in the 2013 Q3 and Q4 each represent new all-time high records.
"
2313,FDX,"My sense is that estimates need to come down in a big way. The market hasn’t cared much in the recent past about negative revisions as aggregate earnings estimates have been coming down for over a year now. But if we are entering a post-QE world, as I believe we are, then it would be difficult to overlook negative earnings estimate revisions.Key Points
"
2314,FDX,"Expectations remain low, with total earnings for the S&P companies expected to be down -0.3% from the same period last year, reflecting -0.5% lower revenues and flat margins. This follows +2.4% earnings growth in Q1 on +0.5% revenue growth.
"
2315,FDX,"Estimates for Q2 have come down materially since the quarter got underway, with the current -0.3% decline down from +3.9% growth in total earnings in early April.
"
2316,FDX,"Finance is the only major sector with a strong growth profile, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +19.6% in Q2. This follows +7.7% earnings growth in Q1 and many quarters of double-digit gains for the sector.
"
2317,FDX,"Finance reclaims its leadership role in the S&P 500, contributing more earnings to the index’s total than Technology this year for the first time since the 2008 crisis. The sector is expected to account for 19.3% of total S&P 500 earnings in 2013 compared to Technology’s 17.8%.   
"
2318,FDX,"Technology earnings were weak in Q1 and they are even weaker this time around, with total earnings for the sector expected to decline -11.8% in Q2 after declining -4.4% in Q1. Weakness in hardware and semi-conductor industries more than offset the modest growth in software earnings.
"
2319,FDX,"Estimates for the second half of the year still reflect strong growth, with total earnings in the second half of the year expected to increase by +9.7% after the +1.1% increase in the first half. Total earnings are expected to be up 6% in 2013 and +11.6% in 2014.
"
2320,FDX,"While there is not much growth, the overall level of total earnings is quite high. Total earnings were an all-time record at $253 billion in Q1 and are expected to total $246.8 billion in Q2. For the full year, earnings are expected total $1.03 trillion in 2013 and $1.15 trillion in 2014.   
"
2321,FDX,"Net margins are expected to be essentially flat in Q2, but start expanding from the third quarter onwards. For the full year 2013, net margins are expected to top the 2006 peak and expand even more in 2014.
"
2322,FDX,"The bottom-up ‘EPS’ for the S&P 500 for 2013 and 2014 currently stands at $109.18 and $121.72, respectively. The top-down ‘EPS’ estimates for 2013 and 2014 currently stand at $107.83 and $114.80. It seems that Wall Street strategists are a bit less enthusiastic about the earnings picture than the analysts.Q2 Earnings Expectations Remain Low
"
2323,FDX,"It is a well-known fact that expenses associated with oil are considered to be one of the major input costs for any transportation company. Therefore, the recent upsurge in fuel costs does not augur well for stocks in the space.So far this year, oil prices have increased roughly 10% and are currently trading at around $66 a barrel. Various reasons like the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East contributed to the rise in oil price. In fact, this marks a phenomenal turnaround for the commodity, which was trading at around $30 a barrel in 2016. Transports Feeling the PinchWith fuel costs on the rise, it is natural that transportation stocks would be hit hard. This is because an upsurge in oil prices induces significant increase in operating expenses of transports, thus limiting bottom-line growth.In fact, the first-quarter earnings season witnessed many stocks in the space suffering due to rise in fuel costs. Notably, oil prices were up approximately 8% in the January-March period. This uptrend continued in the April-June period as well.Highlighting its struggles, the Zacks Transportation Sector is currently ranked 14th among the 16 Zacks Classified sectors.The unfavorable rank places the sector in the bottom 13% of the Zacks sectors.Turbulence Likely to Continue in Q2 The fact that high fuel costs will restrict bottom-line growth of transports in the second quarter can be made out from our latest Earnings Preview. Even though, the top and bottom line of S&P 500 companies in the Transportation sector are projected to grow year over year to the tune of 7.6% and 12.3%, respectively, the figures compare unfavorably to the readings in the first quarter. Revenues and earnings had displayed growth of 9% and 21.3% for transports in the January-March period.Key transportation players like American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) expect second-quarter results to be affected by high fuel costs. Currently, Delta envisions second-quarter fuel costs per gallon between $2.20 and $2.25 compared with $2.07 and $2.12 projected earlier. This airline behemoth has also slashed its earnings per share guidance for the soon-to-be reported quarter due to the cost headwind. The bottom line is now anticipated in the range of $1.65-$1.75, lower than the prior estimate between $1.80 and $2.Apart from high fuel costs, expenses on the labor front are expected to weigh on transportation stocks’ bottom-line performancein the second quarter.Sector Lags on the Price FrontThe turbulence in the space can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Transportation Sector has underperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the sector has shed 1% of its value, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite has increased 3.9%. YTD Price Performance                 Adding Shareholder Value — The Road AheadIn view of the turbulence plaguing transports, we believe that it would be prudent for investors interested in the space to invest in companies that not only pay consistent dividends but also raise the same. This is because such companies are financially stable and mature and can also generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions.Moreover, the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), which came into force late last year, is a boon for transports as far as shareholder-friendly activities like dividend payments are concerned. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate, under the new law, has boosted cash flow as well as earnings of transportation stocks.Due to the significant reduction in tax bills, more cash remains in the hands of these companies to fund capital expenditures, buybacks and dividends among others.Dividend Paying Transports — A Prudent ChoiceGiven the backdrop, targeting dividend-paying transportation stocks and combining them with a favorable Zacks Rank is a judicious way to increase the chances of beating the market besides ensuring a steady stream of cash heading to your portfolio.In this regard, we have zeroed in on four transportation stocks, which have raised their dividend payouts this year. All the chosen stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Year to date, these stocks have also outperformed the sector on the price front.Key PicksFedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) offers customers a one-stop source for global shipping, logistics and supply chain solutions. This Zacks Rank #2 company has a market capitalization of $70.43 billion.In June 2018, FedEx’s board of directors cleared a 30% hike in its quarterly dividend to 65 cents a share (or $2.60 annually) from 50 cents (or $2 annually). The new dividend will be paid on Jul 9, 2018 to stockholders of record as of Jun 25. The stock has gained 5.6% on a year-to-date basis.The raised dividend highlights FedEx’s commitment toward creating value for shareholders and underscores the company’s strong financial condition and bright prospects going ahead. Also, it has an impressive record with respect to dividend payments.Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) is a leading third-party logistics provider. In May, Expeditors' board of directors approved a 7.1% hike in semi-annual cash dividend to 45 cents per share (annualized 90 cents per share). This Zacks Rank #1 company has a market capitalization of $13.51 billion. The stock has gained 18.7% on a year-to-date basis.  GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report) is a leading global railcar lessor that specializes in railcar and locomotive operating leasing, aircraft operating leasing, information technology leasing, and venture finance for customers in diverse industrial sectors worldwide.On Jan 26, 2018, the company’s board of directors cleared a 5% hike in its quarterly dividend to 44 cents per share ($1.76 annually). Also, this Zacks Rank #2 company has an impressive record with respect to dividend payments. It has been paying dividends regularly since 1919. GATX has a market capitalization of $2.64 billion. The stock has gained 15.7% so far this year.  Finally, SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) is a regional carrier operating in the United States. In February, the company’s board of directors cleared a 25% hike in its quarterly dividend to 10 cents a share (or 40 cents annually) from 8 cents (or 32 cents annually). This Zacks Rank #2 company, with a market capitalization of $2.88 billion, has an impressive record with respect to dividend payments. The stock has gained 5.9% so far this year.  Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2324,FDX,"The Fed remains the center of attention today as investors expect the central bank to come through with more support at the conclusion of its two-day meeting tomorrow. Many investors doubt the relevance of more monetary stimulus to the recent loss of momentum in the economy. But the expectation is nevertheless widespread that the central bank needs to do ‘something.’
"
2325,FDX,"We will have to wait another day to find what the Fed plans to do, but growing hopes of additional Fed support has been a major prop behind the market’s recent strength, offsetting the negative developments in Europe. The Fed aside, we have a well subscribed treasury bills auction in Spain, though they had to pay offer a higher interest rate compared to a month ago. Yields on benchmark Spanish bonds remain at levels that limit the government’s capital market access, though they are a tad lower today.
"
2326,FDX,"On the domestic data calendar, we have a mixed housing report this morning, with Housing Starts lower than expected and Permits coming in better than expected.
"
2327,FDX,"The May Housing Starts data came in weaker than expected, down 4.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 708K, compared to the 5.4% gain in April to 744K. The prior month’s data was significantly revised higher to 744K from the originally reported 717K.
"
2328,FDX,"The positive revision to April aside, the May reading was still weaker than expected, though the drop would be a lot less in the absence of the April revision. Housing Permits came in better than expected, up 7.9% in May vs. the drop of 6% in April (originally reported as a drop of 7%).
"
2329,FDX,"Housing Starts have been bouncing around the 700K level in recent months, having bottomed almost two years back at the 478K level. This is an improvement, but admittedly from a very low base. Keep in mind that the long-term historical average for Starts is around double the current level, while Starts at the ‘bubbly’ peak were north of the 2.2 million mark.
"
2330,FDX,"We will probably never go back to that level, but we do need to see a sustainable recovery in this key sector of the economy. Sales and inventories have stabilized, but a pricing recovery will like take much longer given the shadow inventory of foreclosure pipeline and the recent loss of momentum in the labor market.
"
2331,FDX,"In corporate news, FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) posted modestly better-than-quarterly earnings, but disappointingly guided lower for the coming quarters. Walgreen (WAG) posted in-line quarterly results this morning as same-store sales dropped 6.6% due to the lingering effects of the loss of Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report) business last year. Importantly, the drug store chain increased its quarterly dividend by 22% and announced the acquisition of a 45% stake in Alliance Boots for $6.7 billion in cash and stock.RELATED ARTICLESHow Much Can US Stocks Decouple?Market's Attention ShiftsGaming Grexit

2332,FDX,"Earnings Preview 6/17/11
"
2333,FDX,"Earnings season is over for the first quarter, and we are starting to see the early second quarter firms report, those with May fiscal periods. Its still very light, with a total of just 36 firms due to report. However, that includes 14 from the S&P 500.
"
2334,FDX,"The firms reporting next week include: Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report), Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY  -  Free Report), ConAgra (CAG  -  Free Report), Discover (DFS  -  Free Report), Federal Express (FDX  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL) and Walgreen's (WAG). That is a nice cross section of industry, and should provide some nice clues as to how the overall second quarter earnings season will go.
"
2335,FDX,"It will also be a relatively light one for economic data. The focus will be on housing with both new and existing home sales due out. Of the two, new home sales are much more important to economic growth. The level of inventories relative to sales is the key thing to look at with existing home sales since those give a good clue to the direction of existing home prices, which are extremely important.
"
2336,FDX,"We also get data on new orders for durable goods, and the final look at first quarter GDP -- a very important measure, but very stale at this point. Along the way the Fed is meeting and will probably do nothing with regard to either the Fed Funds rate or additional quantitative easing. Analysts will, however, parse the statement closely, looking for any changes from the last one.MondayNothing of significance.TuesdayExisting Home Sales are expected to fall to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.78 million from 5.05 million in April. What is more significant will be the level of inventories, and if the April months of supply rate of 9.2 months will continue to trend up. While down from last summer, the level is still extremely high and has been rising again in recent months (it was 8.3 in March) and indicates strong downward pressure on home prices. That really is what to watch in the existing home sales numbers, since the amount of economic activity generated by an existing home changing hands is not really that big a deal. Home prices are a very big deal. Unfortunately, it looks like they are falling again.WednesdayThe Federal Reserve is universally expected to keep the Fed Funds rate in the 0 to 0.25% range it has been in since December 2008. Of more interest will be the commentary at the end of the meeting and how it has changed since the last meeting. I would expect that it will make more references to economic softness than the prior statement, but that it will continue to see the weakness as temporary. They will also probably continue to reinvest the proceeds of the securities they have bought in the first two rounds of quantitative easing, but are unlikely to embark on a third round. Essentially, the Fed is going to be on hold for some time -- at least through the end of the year, if not longer.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They had a very nice decline early in they year, but then had a very rough month or so in April and May. Last week they fell by 16,000 to 418,000. A slight increase is expected next week, rising to 418,000. The four-week moving average will probably stay well above the 400,000 level, where it has been for the last eight weeks (and weekly claims have been above the level for 10 weeks now). The sharp rise in initial claims were an early warning of the weak jobs report for May. Robust job expansion is generally associated with initial claims below the 400,000 level.  Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 21,000 to 3.675 million. That is down 910,000 from a year ago. I would expect a small decline this week. The consensus is looking for a level of 3.680 million, a slight increase. Some of the longer term decline is due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits, which run out after 26 weeks. Those, however, don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims fell by 115,000 to 3.885 million, and are down by 1.410 million over the last year. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 7.401 million, which is down 209,000 from last week (there are some timing issues so the change in continuing and existing claims does not exactly match the change in the total). The total number of people getting benefits is now 2.200 million below year-ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity -- finding a new job -- and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Given the differential between job growth and the decline in total people getting benefits, it looks like about 1 million people have simply run out of benefits, and have not found new work. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers!  Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.New Home Sales are expected to fall to a 305,000 rate from 323,000 in April. That is simply a pathetic level, even if it is slightly off the record low set in January. The records go back to the Kennedy administration. If we do come in at 305,000, that is still lower than any month prior to 2010. Unlike used home sales, each new home sold represents a lot of economic activity. Thus this is a very important report. Normally, new home sales are what lead the economy out of recessions, but they have been a huge drag this time around.FridayNew Orders for Durable Goods are expected to rise by 1.0% after falling 3.6% in April. Previous months are often revised significantly for this data, and those revisions can be just as important as the current month’s data. Much of the strength expected comes from the highly volatile transportation equipment segment (which was also a big factor in last months decline). Since they are so high-priced, a few orders for jetliners can really push around the total number, but the orders tend to be lumpy. Excluding transportation equipment, new orders are expected to rise 0.6% partially reversing a 1.5% decline last month.The third (and final) look at GDP growth in the first quarter will be released. Both of the earlier reads were a disappointing growth rate of just 1.8%, down from growth of 3.1% in the fourth quarter. The consensus is looking for no change in the number this time around. That is an anemic rate, particularly coming out of a deep recession. The composition of the growth rate is just as important as the overall growth rate itself. Growth that comes from the build-up of inventories, for example, is of much lower quality than business investment in new equipment and software. We will provide a complete breakdown of which parts of the economy are adding to growth, and which are serving as brakes on economic growth, and how the contributions have changes since the first look at the numbers last month.

2338,FDX,"Earnings Preview 3/11/11
"
2339,FDX,"The fourth quarter earnings season is almost over. A total of just 141 firms are due to report and only 3 are S&P 500 firms, and actually two of those are first quarter reports (fiscal periods ending in February). A great many of next week’s reporters are retailers, many of which have fiscal years than end in January, not December.
"
2340,FDX,"So far the earnings season seems to be going well. With 98.2% of the S&P 500 reports in, total net income is up 30.5% over a year ago. The firms reporting this week include: Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report), Federal Express (FDX  -  Free Report), Federal Signal (FSS  -  Free Report) and Dole Foods (DOLE).
"
2341,FDX,"It will be a relatively heavy week for economic data. We will get data on both Producer and Consumer Prices, Housing Starts and Building Permits and Industrial Production. In addition, we get a Fed meeting and the Policy Statement that goes with it. Any of those numbers can move the markets.MondayNo major economic reports expected.TuesdayThe Empire State Index is likely to rise slightly from its February level of 15.43. It is sort of a mini-ISM, just covering New York State, only with zero as the dividing line between expansion and contraction. Thus the economy is expected to continue to expand in NY and at a faster pace than last month.The National Association of Homebuilders index is expected to remain at 16, an awful showing. Any reading below 50 indicates a contraction. While off its all-time low of 9 set in January 2009, it is still pointing to a very weak environment for the homebuilders.The Federal Reserve is meeting. The near-universal expectation is that the Fed Funds rate will stay in the 0.0% to 0.25% range it has been in since December 2008. Realistically, it cannot go any lower, and the economy is still too weak, and the risk of serious inflation too low to justify increasing it. Since the Fed is already at the zero boundary, it has had to resort to other, less conventional methods of providing a more accommodative monetary policy, known as QE2. The key issue is likely to be if the full $600 billion program will be implemented (I’m pretty sure it will be) and if it might make sense to stretch out the program rather than have it finished in June (tapering off the program so it ends in say September could make some sense). Economists will be parsing each word in the policy statement the way that Kremlinologists would look at who was standing where on Lenin’s tomb during the Soviet era. We will provide a paragraph by paragraph analysis of the new policy statement relative to the last one.WednesdayHousing Starts are expected to continue to slide, falling to an annual rate of just 551,000 in February from 596,000 in January. In January, starts were better than expected (although still awful) mostly due to the extremely volatile multi-family part of the market. Single-family starts are a better gauge of the overall pace of housing activity. Single-family starts were only running at an annual rate of 413,000. This is an extremely low level. The good news is that the low level of housing starts means that less housing is being added to the current bloated inventory. The bad news is that normally homebuilding is one of the main forces pulling the economy out of a recession and that is simply not happening this time. The very low level of housing starts is one of the key reasons job growth is so sluggish.The bad news for the homebuilders is likely to continue into the Spring. Building permits, the best indicator of future housing starts, are expected to edge up to 570,000 from 562,000. While any rise is welcome, that would not be enough to even begin to think that housing activity is on the rebound.The Producer Price Index (PPI) is expected to have increased by 0.6% in February, down from the 0.8% increase it posted in December. Most of the increases are likely to come from higher food and especially energy prices. Stripping out those volatile components and the increase is expected to be only 0.2%, down from a 0.5% increase last month. Those numbers are for finished goods. The report also includes data on prices further up the production chain. Most likely the increases at the intermediate and crude levels of production will be higher, indicating potential price pressures down the road. Inflation has generally been higher at the producer level than at the consumer level. In theory, that should indicate some pressure on corporate profit margins, but so far we have seen very little evidence of this happening as net margins continue to rise dramatically. The rapid rise in productivity and falling unit labor costs have more than offset rising input costs.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. After being extremely erratic over the holidays, they have started to fall significantly, but are still bouncing around a bit. Last week they rose by 26,000 in the last week, to 397,000, but that was from the lowest level since May 2008. I would expect the downward trend in claims to reassert itself next week. Still, even a level of 397,000 seems pretty good compared to the experience of the last few years. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims were locked in a tight “trading range for most of 2010. We now appear to have broken out of that trading range to the downside. This could well indicate that the economy is about to start producing a significant number of new jobs. The four-week moving average (which smoothes out the week to week noise) was under the 400,000 for the second week in a row. Historically that has been an inflection point at which the economy starts to add significant numbers of jobs.Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 20,000 to 3.771 million. That is down 923,000  from a year ago. I would expect a further decline this week. Some of the longer-term decline is due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. But those don’t last forever, either. Federally paid extended claims fell by 201,000 to 4.303 million, and are down by 1.192 million over the last year. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 8.773 million, which is down 463,000,000 from last week. The total number of people getting benefits is now 2.647 million below year ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity, finding a new job, and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.We get what I think is one of the most important reports of the week: Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization. Industrial production is expected to have increased by 0.6% in January, after it declined 0.1% in January. The headline number can sometimes be distorted by the weather, as it includes the output of Utilities. It is thus best to look at what is happening in just manufacturing output as well as the overall number. In January, manufacturing output was up 0.3%.  Capacity Utilization can suffer from the same weather-related problems that Industrial Production can. Still, it is a very good gauge of the economy, particularly if one just looks at factory utilization. Since the end of the recession, capacity utilization has staged a dramatic comeback, but that is from disastrously low levels. The expected 76.5% level (overall, factory only consistently runs slightly below the overall number) is about as low as we got at the bottoms of most recessions prior to the Great Recession. Still that is a nice increase from the 76.1% level in January. It indicates that there is still very significant slack in the economy and provides the green light to the Fed to keep the Fed Funds rate pegged at zero and to fully implement the $600 billion QE2 program.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to rise by 0.4% in February, matching its January rise. Inflation has been very tame over the last year. Most of the rise is expected to come from the volatile food and energy components of the index. Stripping them out to get to the core CPI, the increase is expected to be only 0.1%, down from a 0.2% rise in January. Rent and Owners Equivalent Rent together make up over 30% of the overall CPI and more than 40% of core CPI and are likely to be either unchanged or up just 0.1% as they have been for the last year or so, thus keeping the overall increase in inflation very low. Inflation, particularly core inflation is not a significant economic problem at this point. Efforts to combat it aggressively are misguided, since those measures will tend to make real economic problems, like unemployment, much worse.The Philly Fed Index, another of the regional “mini-ISM’s is likely to slip a bit from the extremely high 35.9 reading last month. Unlike the ISM, zero is the dividing line between growth and contraction for this index. A reading around 30 would still indicate very robust economic growth in the Mid-Atlantic states, but just a bit slower than what we saw last month.FridayNo significant economic reports due out.Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
2342,FDX,"Historically the best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. Similarly a recent history of earnings disappointments, cuts in the average estimate for the quarter in the month before the report is due and a poor Zacks Rank (#4 or #5) are often red flags pointing to a potential disappointing earnings report.

2344,FDX,"Earnings Preview 12/10/10
"
2345,FDX,"The third quarter earnings season is over, and we will actually start to see a handful of fourth quarter reports next week, those with November fiscal ends. Only 63 firms will report, but 6 of those will be S&P 500 firms.
"
2346,FDX,"We define any fiscal period ending in November, December and January to be the fourth quarter. While there are a not a lot of reports, the reports we get will provide some early clues on the fourth quarter. The firms reporting this week include: Federal Express (FDX  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Discover (DFS  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) and Carnival Cruise Lines (CCL). That is an interesting cross section of the market that may provide clues to the overall direction of the economy.
"
2347,FDX,"While things will be quite on the earnings side, the same is not true of the economic data front. Inflation will be in focus to start the week as the PPI comes out on Tuesday followed by the CPI on Wednesday. We will also get data on Retail Sales, Industrial Production, Capacity Utilization, housing Starts and the leading economic indicators. In addition, we have a Fed meeting.  MondayNothing of significance.TuesdayWe get the Producer Price Index (PPI). It has been running higher than the Consumer Price Index for several months now, particularly on the headline level. Headline PPI is expected to come in at an increase of 0.5% up from 0.4% in October. Excluding food and energy, the rise is not expected to be as big, but to also show more acceleration, with a rise of 0.3% only partially reversing the 0.6% drop in October. Those numbers are for finished goods. The report will also show data further up the production pipeline, which could warn of higher inflation down the road.Retail Sales are expected to rise by 0.8%, which is a healthy showing, but down from the very strong 1.2% increase posted in October. The October increase was, however, driven by a sharp rise in Auto sales (relative to September). Stripping them out, overall sales rose just 0.4% in October. Sales ex-autos are expected to accelerate to 0.6% growth.The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee is almost universally expected to keep the Fed Funds rate in the 0 to 0.25% range it has been in for over two years now. There should not be any major announcements out of the meeting like there was with the announcement of QE2 last meeting. The market will, however, probably look very closely at the Fed policy statement for any changes from the last meeting.WednesdayThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been extremely well behaved of late, rising just 0.2% in October. Stripping out food and energy prices, inflation has been even more subdued, unchanged not only in October, but for the last three months in a row. In November the consensus is looking for the headline number to again rise 0.2% while the core barely breaks into positive territory with a 0.1% rise. That would actually be good news as it would diminish the threat of actual deflation.The Empire State Manufacturing Index, one of the “mini ISMs is expected to bounce back to a reading of 2.9% from an extremely and surprisingly weak showing of -11.14 in October. Any reading over 0 indicates an expansion in manufacturing activity in New York State. The expected reading would mean positive but very slow growth, but that is better than the fairly sharp contraction last month. On the other hand, it has been a long time since New York State was a manufacturing powerhouse. This is an index that is best tracked in conjunction with the other regional mini ISMs.Industrial Production is expected to have increased by 0.3% after being unchanged in October. The overall Industrial production number can sometimes be a bit misleading. It includes utility output, which is highly weather dependent. Thus it is important to look not only at the overall number, but the change in manufacturing output. The October number was actually much better than the unchanged reading would indicate as it included a 3.4% drop in Utility output. Manufacturing output increased by a healthy 0.5% on the month.Capacity Utilization is reported along with Industrial Production. This is a highly underrated economic indicator and deserves a lot more attention than it gets in the press. Effectively it is measuring the employment rate of our physical capital, the way the employment report measures the utilization of our human capital. Overall capacity utilization is expected to rise to 75.0% up from 74.8% in October. That is much better than the 70.7% reading we saw a year ago, but is still historically low and indicating recessionary conditions. A healthy economy has capacity utilization around 80%, so we are about half way back to normal on this measure. As with the Industrial production number it is important to look at the Manufacturing only utilization as well as the overall, since there can be weather related changes in utility utilization. The October unchanged overall reading masked a rise to 72.7% from 72.3% in manufacturing. That was offset by a drop to76.6% from 79.8% in Utility Utilization. I suspect a return to more normal utility utilization will lead to a bigger than expected increase in overall capacity utilization.ThursdayNew Claims for Unemployment Insurance have been trending down recently, but erratically. Last week the four-week moving average (which takes out some of the week to week volatility fell to its lowest level since August 2008. The actual reading for the week was 421,000, down from over 500,000 in mid-August. It looks like we have finally moved out of the “trading range that initial claims have been stuck in for most of the year. That is very good news if it continues. We probably have to get down to under 400,000 and stay there to start to make a serious dent in the army of the unemployed, but at least we are making a serious move in the right direction. A small rebound for the week would not surprise me, but the four week moving average will probably continue to decline.Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late. Last week they fell by 191,000 to 4.086 million. That is down 1.219 million from a year ago. Some of the longer-term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks, but even extended claims have started to decline as well. Federally paid extended claims fell by 393,000 to 4.507 million, and down 120,000 from a year ago (the first year over year decline in this economic cycle). Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 8.298 million, which is down 612,000 from last week. The total number of people getting benefits is now 1.249 million below year-ago levels. The big unknown is if those people are actually finding new jobs, or simply slipping into abject poverty with no income at all. Extended benefits are made up of four tiers, and the ability to move on to the next tier ended on 11/30. Reinstatement of that ability is dependent on the overall tax deal being ratified, which is likely, but not a certainty. Look for a big drop in extended claims next week simply from benefits expiring. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.Housing Starts are expected to rebound to an annual rate of 545,000, up from 519,000 in October. That is still a simply awful level of housing starts. Then again with the last six months being the lowest six months in history (back to 1963), there is simply not a big need to increase housing starts. There is still a huge inventory overhang of both new and existing homes, particularly relative to recent sales rates. Still, normally residential investment, of which new home construction is the biggest part, has historically been the locomotive that pulls the economy out of recessions and that locomotive has been derailed this time around. A rebound in housing starts could indicate that housing is getting back on track, and that could indicate much more robust economic growth as we move into 2011. It would not take very heroic absolute levels of housing starts to generate very robust percentage increases from current levels.The Philly Fed index, another regional “mini-ISM is expected to drop to 14.1 from a surprisingly robust 22.5 in October. That would still indicate a healthy rise in manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic area, but not quite as fast as last month.The index of leading economic indicators is expected to show an increase of 1.2% up from a 0.5% increase last month.FridayNo numbers of any particular significance.Earnings CalendarCompany Ticker Qtr End EPS Est Year Ago EPS Last EPS Surprise % Next EPS Report Date Time Daily PriceENZO BIOCHEM    ENZ        201010 ($0.08) ($0.05) 0 20101213 BTO $4.92 FUELCELL ENERGY FCEL       201010 ($0.13) ($0.21) -7.14 20101213 AMC $1.32 GOLUB CAPITAL   GBDC       201009 $0.29  N/A 3.57 20101213 BTO $17.02 LAKELAND INDS   LAKE       201010 $0.12  ($0.03) 400 20101213 AMC $9.05 SPARTECH CORP   SEH        201010 $0.06  $0.15  -118.52 20101213 AMC $9.86 ADDVANTAGE TECH AEY        201009 N/A $0.07  N/A 20101214 BTO $3.78 APPLD SIGNAL    APSG       201010 $0.22  $0.27  18.18 20101214 AMC $34.46 BEST BUY        BBY        201011 $0.60  $0.53  36.36 20101214 BTO $42.00 COMPOSITE TECH  CPTC       201009 N/A N/A N/A 20101214   $0.26 CSP INC         CSPI       201009 N/A ($0.04) N/A 20101214 BTO $5.12 FACTSET RESH    FDS        201011 $0.84  $0.74  2.5 20101214   $94.49 HOVNANIAN ENTRP HOV        201010 ($0.69) ($2.99) 32.08 20101214 AMC $4.36 IMPERIAL SUGAR  IPSU       201009 ($0.02) ($1.35) -1500 20101214 BTO $13.87 INTEGRATED ELEC IESC       201009 ($0.44) ($0.20) -1533.33 20101214 AMC $3.24 INTL ASSET HLDG IAAC       201009 N/A $0.08  52.63 20101214 AMC $23.76 NATL TECH SYS   NTSC       201010 $0.11  $0.11  -37.5 20101214 BTO $7.57 NEVADA GOLD&CAS UWN        201010 N/A ($0.03) N/A 20101214 AMC $1.08 PANTRY INC      PTRY       201009 $0.71  $0.60  38.24 20101214 BTO $20.13 PNI DIGITAL MED PNDMF      201009 $0.05  $0.05  N/A 20101214 DMT $1.74 SANDERSON FARMS SAFM       201010 $1.71  $0.96  -17.11 20101214 BTO $42.20 SYNERGETICS USA SURG       201010 $0.03  $0.02  N/A 20101214 AMC $4.50 THE9 LTD-ADR    NCTY       201009 ($0.37) ($0.35) 15.38 20101214 AMC $6.41 AAR CORP        AIR        201011 $0.36  $0.34  16.67 20101215 AMC $27.07 ABM INDUSTRIES  ABM        201010 $0.43  $0.39  0 20101215 AMC $24.77 APOGEE ENTRPRS  APOG       201011 ($0.10) $0.39  -80 20101215 AMC $12.71 CROSSROADS SYS  CRDS       201010 N/A $0.03  N/A 20101215   $0.97 HERMAN MILLER   MLHR       201011 $0.28  $0.20  -11.54 20101215 AMC $23.43 JOY GLOBAL INC  JOYG       201010 $1.15  $1.16  10.78 20101215 BTO $78.36 NORDSON CORP    NDSN       201010 $1.37  $0.85  16.07 20101215 AMC $85.77 PURE BIOSCIENCE PURE       201010 N/A ($0.05) N/A 20101215 AMC $2.53 RENTECH INC     RTK        201009 ($0.02) ($0.03) -200 20101215 DMT $1.38 WILLIAMS CTRLS  WMCO       201009 $0.09  $0.05  100 20101215 BTO $11.11 WPCS INTL INC   WPCS       201010 N/A $0.05  -83.33 20101215 AMC $2.88 ACCENTURE PLC   ACN        201011 $0.75  $0.67  4.76 20101216   $44.61 ACTUANT CORP    ATU        201011 $0.34  $0.20  10.71 20101216 BTO $27.26 BIO REFERNC LAB BRLI       201010 $0.30  $0.25  3.57 20101216   $20.68 DISCOVER FIN SV DFS        201011 $0.41  $0.12  34.29 20101216 BTO $18.77 FEDEX CORP      FDX        201011 $1.31  $1.10  -0.83 20101216 BTO $94.09 GENL MILLS      GIS        201011 $0.78  $0.77  1.59 20101216 BTO $35.67 GIGAMEDIA LTD   GIGM       201009 $0.03  ($0.04) -1800 20101216 BTO $1.55 HEICO CORP      HEI        201010 $0.40  $0.34  18.92 20101216 AMC $55.82 LUBY'S INC      LUB        201011 N/A ($0.10) -80 20101216 AMC $6.10 MARCUS CORP     MCS        201011 $0.07  $0.04  0 20101216 BTO $14.30 NEOGEN CORP     NEOG       201011 $0.26  $0.20  8.7 20101216 BTO $38.99 NORDION INC     NDZ        201010 $0.01  ($0.10) -1100 20101216   $10.97 ORACLE CORP     ORCL       201011 $0.43  $0.37  11.43 20101216 AMC $29.26 PIER 1 IMPORTS  PIR        201011 $0.14  $0.02  0 20101216 BTO $10.46 QUIKSILVER INC  ZQK        201010 $0.07  $0.02  166.67 20101216 AMC $5.68 RESEARCH IN MOT RIMM       201011 $1.64  $1.10  8.15 20101216 AMC $61.29 RICKS CABARET   RICK       201009 $0.14  $0.19  -55 20101216 AMC $7.22 RITE AID CORP   RAD        201011 ($0.13) ($0.10) -12.5 20101216 BTO $0.92 SCHIFF NUTRITN  WNI        201011 $0.12  $0.20  8.33 20101216 BTO $8.75 SCHOLASTIC CORP SCHL       201011 $2.19  $2.29  -66.67 20101216 BTO $30.56 SMART MODULAR   SMOD       201011 $0.11  $0.06  30 20101216 AMC $6.45 STEELCASE INC   SCS        201011 $0.14  $0.04  60 20101216 AMC $10.19 STEWART ENTRP A STEI       201010 $0.07  $0.05  -14.29 20101216   $6.23 TAKE-TWO INTER  TTWO       201010 $0.27  ($0.04) 200 20101216 AMC $12.05 TORTOISE ENERGY TYY        201011 ($0.12) N/A N/A 20101216   $26.95 WINNEBAGO       WGO        201011 $0.02  ($0.05) 466.67 20101216 BTO $12.10 XENONICS HLDGS  XNNH       201009 N/A $0.00  N/A 20101216 BTO $0.45 BEACON ENTERPRS BEAC       201009 N/A ($0.12) N/A 20101217   $0.42 CARNIVAL CORP   CCL        201011 $0.33  $0.24  12.24 20101217 BTO $43.74 WOLFORD AG ADR  WLFDY      201010 N/A $0.24  N/A 20101217   $3.04 My apologies for missing the last two weeks.

2350,FDX,"It is going to be one very busy and volatile week.
"
2351,FDX,"The main event is the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting. This is will be a one-day meeting with a statement due out around 2:15 ET. Expectations call for the Fed to cut the federal funds rate by as much as 50 basis points, though I think the cut will be 25 basis points. As important as the size of the rate cut will be, which is not guaranteed to happen, the wording in the statement will matter too. Any language judged to be overly hawkish or that signals the pace of growth is slowing too rapidly will cause some turmoil. Bluntly put, there is a lot of room for error. A ""sell on the news"" reaction to an otherwise favorable rate cut and statement is also not out of the realm of possibilities.
"
2352,FDX,"Four of the leading investment banking firms will be reporting fiscal third-quarter results. Lehman Brothers (LEH) is scheduled for Tuesday morning. Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) will report on Wednesday. Bear Stearns (BSC) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) will both report on Thursday. Profit forecasts have been falling for all four firms.
"
2353,FDX,"Friday is a triple witching day, meaning stock options, index options and futures contracts will all expire. Combined, these expirations can lead to increased volatility. In addition, Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement, starts that evening. As a result, trading volume could taper in the afternoon and some of Friday's volatility could start on Thursday.
"
2354,FDX,"To better convey just how the busy the week is going to be, here is a day by day schedule.
"
2355,FDX,"Monday: The New York Fed's Empire State Index will be released in the morning.

"
2356,FDX,"Tuesday: Lehman Brothers will report before the bell and will hold a conference call at 10 a.m. ET. August PPI will be released in the morning, giving the Fed one additional reading on inflation. The FOMC will release its statement around 2:15 (possibly, a few minutes earlier or later). In addition to Lehman, eight companies will report earnings including S&P 500 members AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report)

2360,FDX,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Sep 17 - 21General Mills recently revealed that it generated ""good sales and earnings per share gains for its fiscal 2008 first quarter"". The company guided for sales growth above its previous forecast of low single-digit growth and for earnings per share of about 81 cents per share. The majority of the covering brokerage analysts raised their forecasts in response, pushing the consensus earnings estimate five cents higher to 81 cents per share. GIS matched fiscal fourth-quarter expectations after previously topping estimates for 10 consecutive quarters. General Mills is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Sep 19, before the start of trading.

2361,FDX,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Sep 17 - 21
"
2362,FDX,"As I stated previously, forecasts for Bear Stearns have been falling ever since the company missed second-quarter expectations. During the past three months, fiscal third-quarter profit projections have plunged 35% to $2.22 per share. The most accurate estimate is even more bearish at $1.70 per share, reflecting cuts by two brokerage analysts within the past seven days. Bear Stearns is scheduled to report on Thursday, Sep 20, before the start of trading.
"
2363,FDX,"Lehman Brothers easily surpassed fiscal second-quarter expectations after coming up a penny shy during the first quarter. Profit forecasts for the fiscal third-quarter have dropped materially over the past 30 days with nine of the 14 covering brokerage analysts lowering their projections (including two within the past week). The current consensus estimate of $1.60 per share is 21 cents below the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at $1.47 per share.

2370,FDX,"A higher number of Americans are gearing up for a busy summer travel season by road or air this time encouraged by a booming economy and growing consumer confidence. This is especially true as the frenzy for trips during the Memorial Day Weekend is far more than the past decade despite the highest gasoline prices in four years. Top destinations include cruises to Alaska from Seattle and warm-weather spots like Orlando, Florida, Honolulu and Las Vegas.According to travel service provider American Automobile Association (AAA), Memorial Day weekend travel is expected to rise for the fourth straight year. More than 41.5 million Americans will travel 50 miles (80 km) over the Memorial Day weekend (May 24-28), up nearly 5% from the last year and the most in more than a dozen years. Of them, 36.6 million will go on a road trip, 3.1 million will fly, and 1.8 million will travel by train and other modes (including buses and cruises).Though road trip is expected to rise 4.7% over last year, motorists are expected to pay the highest gas price since 2014. Gas price currently averaged $2.95 per gallon, up 59 cents from last year. It is expected to climb higher and hit $3 nationwide during the Memorial Day weekend. However, travelers’ wallets will find some relief when paying for airfare, car rentals, and most mid-range hotels (read: Pump Up Gains With This Gasoline ETF).This is because airfares are 7% lower than the last Memorial Day for an average $168 round-trip on the top 40 domestic routes while the average daily cost of a car rental is 11% cheaper and the lowest in the past four years, per AAA’s Leisure Travel Index. Meanwhile, AAA Three Diamond hotels are 14% cheaper than last year at an average rate of $186 per night.Huge travel demand should boost revenues and profitability for transporters, including airlines and railroads, thereby leading to higher share prices. Investors shouldn’t miss this opportunity and could tap this trend through any of the ETFs that stand to profit big time from the upbeat Memorial Day weekend travel trend.iShares Transportation Average ETF (IYT  -  Free Report)The fund tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to a small basket of 20 securities. It is heavily concentrated on the top firm FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) at 14.7%, while other firms account for less than 9% share. From a sector perspective, air freight & logistics takes the top spot with 30.2% of the portfolio while railroads, trucking and airlines round off to the next three spots with double-digit exposure each. The fund has accumulated nearly $831.9 million in AUM while sees solid trading volume of around 246,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a High risk outlook (read: Slew of Earnings Beat Fails to Lift Transport ETFs).SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report)This fund tracks the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index, holding 42 stocks in its basket with none holding more than 3% of assets. About 32.1% of the portfolio is dominated by trucking, while airfreight & logistics and airlines round off the next spots with 25% and 22.7%, respectively. With AUM of $228.4 million, the fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a lower volume of around 34,000 shares a day. XTN has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a High risk outlook (read: Solid Small-Cap Earnings Put Spotlight on These Sector ETFs).First Trust Nasdaq Transportation ETF (FTXR  -  Free Report)This fund offers exposure to the 30 most-liquid U.S. transportation securities based on volatility, value and growth by tracking the Nasdaq US Smart Transportation Index. Each firm hold less than 8.8% share in the basket. From an industrial look, auto parts takes the largest share at 25.3% while trucking, delivery services, automobiles and railroads round off the next spots with double-digit exposure each. FTXR has accumulated $3.8 million in its asset base and charges 60 bps in annual fees. Average trading volume is meager at 1,000 shares. The ETF has a Zacks ETF Rank #3.U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to the global airline industry, including airline operators and manufacturers from all over the world, by tracking the U.S. Global Jets Index. In total, the product holds 34 securities that are heavily concentrated on the top four firms with double-digit allocation each. Other firms hold no more than 4.25% share. The fund has gathered $98.1 million in its asset base while sees lower trading volume of nearly 39,000 shares a day. It charges investors 60 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a High risk outlook (read: Sector ETFs to Top & Flop on Higher Oil Prices).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

2371,FDX,"Earnings Preview 9/10/10
"
2372,FDX,"The second quarter earnings season is over, and now we are getting the first of the third quarter. We define any fiscal period ending in August, September and October to be the third quarter.
"
2373,FDX,"Still, we are just talking about a trickle of reports, just a total of 47 companies will report. However, that includes six from the S&P 500, including Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Federal Express (FDX  -  Free Report), Discover Financial (DFS  -  Free Report), Pall Corp (PLL), Kroger’s (KR  -  Free Report) and Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report). That is an interesting cross section of companies and together they should give some interesting clues on the overall economy.
"
2374,FDX,"With little action on the earnings front, all eyes will be focused on the economic data, and we will have a fairly active week on the data front. We start with Treasury Budget on Monday, and end with the Consumer Price Index on Friday. In between we get news on Producer prices, Industrial Production and Retail Sales. Any of those numbers has the potential to move the markets.MondayWe find out how much red ink was spilled in Washington during August when the Treasury budget is announced. The data is highly seasonal, but is not seasonally adjusted, so the month-to-month changes are less than meaningless -- they are downright misleading to look at. The most interesting comparison is the year over year. The expectation is that the government spent $97.5 billion more than it took in through taxes in August. That is a small improvement over the $103.6 billion in red ink last August. The other thing to look at is the year-to-date deficit relative to the year to date in 2009. The trend has been for small year-over-year declines in the deficit, but still very large numbers in any absolute or historical context.TuesdayRetail sales in August are expected to have increased by 0.2% in August, down from a 0.4% increase in July. This is a very broad based measure of consumer spending, and goes far beyond just sales at the malls. A big part of the increase in July was higher sales from gas stations -- reflecting higher prices, not more driving. That effect should be much more muted in August. Auto sales were on the soft side in August, so excluding Auto sales from the calculation is expected to result in a 0.3% increase in sales up from a 0.2% increase excluding Autos in July.WednesdayThe Empire State Manufacturing survey, which is sort of like a mini-ISM just covering New York State. Unlike the national ISM number, the dividing line between expansion and contraction is zero, not 50. The consensus is looking for a reading of 10.0 up from 7.1 last month. That would mean that the manufacturing side of the economy is not only expanding in New York, but doing so at an accelerating pace.Industrial Production is expected to have increased by 0.4% after a 1.0% increase in July. The overall Industrial Production number can sometimes be a bit misleading. It includes utility output, which is highly weather dependent. Thus it is important to look not only at the overall number, but the change in manufacturing output as well.Capacity Utilization is reported along with Industrial Production. This is a highly under-rated economic indicator, and deserves a lot more attention than it gets in the press. Effectively it is measuring the employment rate of our physical capital, the way the employment report measures the utilization of our human capital. Overall capacity utilization is expected to rise to 75.0%. That is much better than the below-70 reading we saw a year ago, but is still historically low and indicating recessionary conditions. A healthy economy has capacity utilization around 80%, so we are about half way back to normal on this measure. As with the Industrial Production number, it is important to look at the Manufacturing only utilization as well as the overall, since there can be weather related changes in utility utilization.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They fell 27,000 in the last week, to 451,000. The third straight week of declines. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims have been locked in a tight “trading range."" Look for them to fall modestly next week. We probably need for weekly claims (and the four-week moving average of them) to get down to closer to 400,000 to signal that the economy is adding enough jobs to make a dent in the unemployment rate. A rate of over 500,000 signals that the unemployment rate is probably headed back up and a high probability of a double dip.Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late. Last week they fell by 2,000 to 4.478 million. That is down 1.557 million from a year ago. Most of the longer-term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits, which run out after 26 weeks. Federally paid extended claims rose by 29,000 to 5.47 million. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 9.948 million, which is up 27,000 from last week. The total number of people getting benefits is now 128,000 million above year-ago levels. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.The Producer Price Index (PPI) is expected to rise 0.2% on a headline basis, equaling its 0.2% rise in July. Excluding the volatile food and energy components prices are also expected to be up 0.2% in August, but down from a 0.3% rise in July. The report will also give clues about future inflation trends from prices further up the production pipeline. In general, inflation pressures are very tame right now.FridayInflation at the Consumer level is also very tame. The Consumer Price index is expected to show a rise of just 0.1% in August after a 0.3% rise in July. Excluding food and energy prices, the CPI should also be up 0.1% matching the rise in the core CPI in July. Right now deflation is a bigger threat than runaway inflation. At any given level, deflation is a far more serious problem than inflation. If the CPI were to come in a tick our two higher than expected it would not be all that bad. If it were to come in negative, that would be troublesome.Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
2375,FDX,"Historically the best indicators of firms which are likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. While normally firms that report better than expected earnings rise in reaction, that has not been the case so far this quarter. Given the very small number of firms reporting, there were no obvious candidates for ether positive or negative surprises this week.

2377,FDX,"Catalysts? What catalysts?
"
2378,FDX,"Anyone who wants for a reason for the markets to move in one direction or another during the week of June 18 is going to be disappointed. Daily market fluctuations, both here and overseas, possible comments out of Fed officials and sentiment are all the market will have to rely on. The list of scheduled events is small, few companies are providing guidance and people are taking summer vacations. Even the Stock Trader's Almanac offers nothing except to say that the week after June triple witching has been negative for the Dow during 14 out of the past 16 years.
"
2379,FDX,"To be fair, there are eight S&P 500 companies on deck as the second-quarter earnings preseason continues. The companies are Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Circuit City (CC), Carnival (CCL  -  Free Report), Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), H&R Block (HRB  -  Free Report), Jabil Circuit (JBL  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). None of these, however, should wield enough influence to do anything more than cause some potential intraday swings in the market. 
"
2380,FDX,"The economic calendar won't add much excitement either. May housing starts will be published on Tuesday. Thursday brings the May Leading Economic Indicators and the Philadelphia Fed's June survey.
"
2381,FDX,"Given this backdrop and lack of catalysts, interest rates could continue to play a role. The Fed's next meeting is not until June 27-28 (a two-day meeting) and although the committee should leave interest rates unchanged, the bond markets remain weak on a technical basis. Higher interest rates are a problem for the housing market and for the capital markets since they make more expensive to complete corporate deals. This is why perhaps the best catalyst for the bulls would be a large, private equity takeover - a clear sign that interest rates haven't risen too much. Of course, predicting if and when this will happen is beyond the scope of my crystal ball.

"
2383,FDX,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of June 18 - June 22Commercial Metals (CMC  -  Free Report) has had a mixed record when it comes to earnings performance. It has beat expectations and missed expectations twice over the past four quarters. A recent improvement, albeit small, in the consensus estimate suggests CMC might just report bullish fiscal third-quarter reports. A revision by one brokerage analyst pushed the quarterly consensus estimate up by one cent to 78 cents per share. The Most Recent Consensus is at 79 cents per share. Commercial Metals is scheduled to report on Wednesday, June 20, before the start of trading.
"
2384,FDX,"Gerber Scientific (GRB) recently preannounced results for its fiscal fourth quarter. The company, which makes graphics software for signs and apparel, expects to report revenues of $153 to $155 million and earnings of 22 to 26 cents per share. Both numbers were above the company's previous guidance. All of the covering brokerage analysts raised their projections in response, sending the consensus earnings estimate six cents higher to 23 cents per share. GRB has topped profit expectations for four consecutive quarters. Gerber Scientific is scheduled to report on Thursday, June 18.
"
2385,FDX,"Two brokerage analysts have raised their projections on Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) within the past 30 days. The impact of these revisions has been to push the second-quarter earnings estimate up by a penny to $2 per share. The Most Recent Consensus is considerably more bullish at $2.09 per share. The investment banking and brokerage firm has topped expectations during each the past four quarters by an average margin of 40 cents per share. Morgan Stanley is scheduled to report on Wednesday, June 20, before the start of trading.
"
2386,FDX,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of June 18 - June 22
"
2387,FDX,"About one quarter of the covering brokerage analysts have cut their forecasts for Best Buy's (BBY  -  Free Report) fiscal first quarter. The downward revisions may reflect concerns about weaker sales of LCD televisions and higher gasoline prices. The consensus earnings estimate of 50 cents per share is a penny less than 30 days ago and two cents below the average forecast of 60 days ago. BBY has missed expectations once during the past four quarters. Best Buy is scheduled to report on Tuesday, June 19, before the start of trading.

Outside of the weekly reports and, obviously, the Fed meeting, there is really not much else on the economic calendar.
"
2396,FDX,"So what will move the markets next week? Sentiment. Daily fluctuations should continue, dependant on the news of the day and how the overseas markets fare. Traders still need to be willing to jump between going long and short. Investors will need to use prudence, but buying opportunities do exist.
"
2397,FDX,"Its worth noting that despite Tuesdays drop, one-fourth of the companies within the S&P 500 index are trading within 5% of their 52-week highs. (14 closed Thursday at 52-week highs.) In other words, underlying bullish sentiment still remains. Part of the reason is that analysts continue to forecast the average company to grow earnings at a double-digit pace this year. M&A activity and stock buyback programs are also playing a role. Finally, the economy is still expected to grow. Yes, the problems in the subprime market are a concern, but so far, risk-aversion has yet to become the norm.

"
2400,FDX,"Several food companies have surprised to the upside and General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) could be next. One of the 17 covering analysts raised his fiscal third-quarter estimate in the past week. The effect was to push the consensus estimate up by a penny to 70 cents per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more bullish at 73 cents per share. GIS has topped expectations for nine consecutive quarters. General Mills is scheduled to report on Thursday, Mar 22, before the start of trading.

Over the past few weeks, analysts have revised their projections causing the consensus estimate to fall by a penny to 39 cents per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more bearish at 38 cents per share. NWY has missed expectations twice and topped expectations twice in the past four quarters.

2407,FDX,"In spite of some mildly disappointing economic numbers that have come over the last couple of months, ample evidence points a strong market throughout the rest of the summer, according to the Experts. Earnings remain an unrestrained feather in the economys hat, and the consumer shows little sign of buckling in spite of predictions to the contrary. The pressure of negative exogenous influences also appears to be abating to some extent, and fully invested appears to be a common investment position for the pros. Consumer Forges Ahead
"
2408,FDX,"Doom and gloom are clearly not on the forefront of the mind of the American consumer. The American consumer is exhibiting a great deal of confidence about the things going on in this economy. The Conference Boards sentiment survey jumped to 95.6 in June, from 90.2 the previous month. Economists expected the confidence index to rise to 95. Further, 25.6% of those surveyed saw business conditions as good. The Conference Board surveys 5,000 households about general economic conditions, employment prospects and spending plans. Consumers also have very positive expectations for the next six months. The index component that tracks consumer expectations rose to 100 from 94.8, and the component that tracks optimism about the current situation jumped to 104.8 in June from 90.5 in May.
"
2409,FDX,"The concerns of a real estate bubble developing appear to have been premature. In May record sales of new and existing homes delivered a strong boost to the economy. Granted, some of that can be attributed to a rush to buy a home before the June 30 Fed meeting at which the Fed was widely expected to increase the Fed Funds rate, which directly affects the mortgage rate. Sales of existing homes rose to record levels in May, according to the National Association of Realtors. It jumped to 6.8 million, from 6.63 million in April. That number reflected a 15.8% increase over May 2003. The previous record was 6.68 million in September, 2003. The national median home price was up 10.3% on a year over year basis. Similarly, new home sales soared 15% in May to a record annual rate of 1.369 million homes. Sales were 25% above the year ago levels. 
"
2410,FDX,"Long time readers of this column will recall Jack Schanneps analysis of consumer confidence. The editor of the Schanneps Timing Indicator and theDowTheory , will recall that consumer confidence usually tops out before the market does. According to his research, a peak in consumer confidence usually leads a bear market and recession by 13.2 months, which gives credence to Schanneps faith that the bull market continues. His primary indicator is that June saw new highs for the Dow Industrial and Dow Transports, though the bull market has not yet seen another new high for the NYSE Composite reading. Schannep remains 100% invested, and his portfolio is equally weighted between Diamonds (AMEX: (DIA  -  Free Report) ) and Spyders (AMEX: (SPY  -  Free Report) ).Abating Pressures, Positives for a Summer Rally
"
2411,FDX,"Dennis Slothower, editor of Stealth Stocks , sees a number of factors that have improved significantly over the last couple of weeks that should drive a summer rally. First and foremost is oil, which has come off its May highs by about 15%. Slothower feels that OPECs tone has changed considerably, which helped the price of oil. Most significant in the rhetoric of OPEC members has been Saudi Arabias new commitment to fight terrorism. Slothower also feels that this will end a large financial source for al Qaeda. Additionally, the early handover of democracy in Iraq allowed oil prices to drop. 
"
2412,FDX,"Further, Slothower is confident thanks to strong earnings growth, and the concomitant drop in P/E ratios. The move of consensus estimates to more than 20% EPS growth for the second quarter from 13% is a huge boon to the market, and Slothower expects it to be a source for a late summer rally as pre-announcements and reports come in.All in Where?
"
2413,FDX,"All three of Schannep, Slothower and Richard Moroney, editor of Dow Theory Forecasts are fully invested for the very similar reasons cited above.

For the three months ended 3/31/04, revenues rose 74 percent to $14.4 million. Net income totaled $1.6 million versus a loss of $1.3 million. Revenues reflect increased advertising sales and sales from newly acquired ArtToday.
"
2416,FDX,"SOTHEBY HOLDINGS, INC. (NYSE: (BID  -  Free Report) )  Sotheby Holdings, Inc., auctions a variety of property, including fine art, antiques and decorative art, jewelry and collectibles. For the three months ended 3/31/04, revenues totaled $106.4 million, up from $41.2 million. Net income totaled $13.5 million versus a loss of $27.6 million. 
"
2417,FDX,"Richard Moroney currently finds the industrial sector a compelling investment. While, over the last five years the median industrial company realized annualized profits of 2%, this year, it is expected to post 19%, as well as next. In spite of some deceleration in the manufacturing growth rate, the Institute for Supply Managements Manufacturing Report on Business has been above 60 for several months and remains so, indicating strong expansion.
"
2418,FDX,"Waste Connections (NYSE: WCN ) provides solid-waste collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling services to more than a million customers. The company focuses on secondary markets, primarily in the West and Midwest, where it faces less competition from large waste companies and sees more opportunities to enter into exclusive contracts. Waste Connections also favors these markets because they are home to a large number of independent solid-waste-services firms, all potential acquisition targets. The company has acquired 170 waste-collection businesses, transfer stations, and landfills since its founding in 1997. Over the past five years, the company has delivered annualized growth of 25% in revenue and 53% in per-share earnings. Waste Connections generates about 50% of its collection revenue from commercial customers, 40% from residential customers, and 10% from industrial and construction customers. The company should benefit from greater industrial and construction waste volume as the economy continues to improve. In the March quarter, revenue climbed 16% to $149 million, and per-share earnings rose 8% to $0.53. At 18 times expected 2004 per share earnings of $1.64, the stock trades in line with its five-year valuation range. The stock is a Buy.
"
2419,FDX,"FedEx (NYSE: (FDX  -  Free Report) provides guaranteed domestic and international express air delivery, residential and business ground delivery, and heavy-freight delivery through its own air and ground transportation systems. With business activity picking up, demand for delivery services has increased in recent quarters. Rate increases across FedExs business lines should contribute to revenue growth. In February 2004, FedEx paid $2.4 billion in cash for Kinkos, which operates about 1,200 copy centers that also provide business services. FedEx has already rolled out its delivery services at all of the Kinkos stores nationwide and should have packaging and packing offerings available in time for the holiday shipping season. The acquisition of Kinkos will make it easier for customers to ship packages through FedEx and give the company a more diversified revenue base. Kinkos also offers FedEx expansion opportunities overseas, where Kinkos currently has a limited presence. In the May quarter, revenue rose 21% and per-share earnings rose 48% to $1.36. The Long-Term Buy trades at 18 times expected per-share earnings of $4.41 in the year ending May 2005.

2425,FDX,"Shares of Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) have lost 11% in the past six months, significantly underperforming its industry’s gain of 6.1%. Reasons Behind the Price PlungeThe company has been facing a number of challenges related to network congestion for the past few months, which have hurt its operational performance. Further, oilfield service major, Halliburton Company's (HAL  -  Free Report) statement issued in February 2018 that Canadian National’s service delays have been affecting its bottom line, underlines the gravity of this situation.Additionally, rival Canadian Pacific Railway Limited’s (CP  -  Free Report) commentary about its increasing network fluidity highlights the fact that these operational issues might affect Canadian National’s customer base and adversely impact its growth prospects, unless resolved quickly.In March 2018, Canadian National also announced a change at its helm to primarily address the service issues. The new CEO (interim) — Jean-Jacques Ruest — has apologized to its customers for the service woes and promised an improvement on the service front. However, in case the management change fails to yield the desired results, the stock might be hurt further.Deterioration in operating ratio (defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) due to high labor and fuel costs also does not bode well for the stock. Canadian National’s high debt levels raise concerns as well.Furthermore, the stock has a VGM Score of C, which too highlights its unattractiveness. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Zacks Rank & Key PickCanadian National carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2426,FDX,"Earnings Preview 6/11/10
"
2427,FDX,"The first quarter earnings season is effectively over. There will be just 33 firms reporting next week, and some of those will be reporting second quarter earnings, not first quarter (we define fiscal periods ending in May, June and July as being second quarter). However, among the 33 total are five S&P 500 firms. These are Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Discover Financial (DFS  -  Free Report), Kroger’s (KR  -  Free Report), S.J. Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report) and Federal Express (FDX  -  Free Report). The Fed Ex report should be particularly interesting in that its shipment volumes are a telling clue as to how the rest of the economy is doing.
"
2428,FDX,"With the week light on earnings reports, most of the attention will be focused on the economic data coming out. It will be a very heavy week for data, but it will all be packed into the three days in the middle of the week. The data will include two regional Fed indexes that are sort of like mini-ISM numbers, key inflation reports and one of the most underrated and very important reports, the one on Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization.
"
2429,FDX,"Oh, and we also get Housing Starts and Building Permits. Thus, even without a lot of earnings news there will be more than enough to keep the markets from getting bored.MondayNo reports of significance.TuesdayThe Empire State Manufacturing index, which is a Fed indicator of the strength in Manufacturing in New York State. It is similar to the ISM survey except that the dividing line between expansion and contraction is 0, not 50. It is expected to show further improvement to 19.9 for June, from 19.1 in May. That is a very strong showing, but manufacturing in New York State is a very small part of the overall economy.WednesdayA heavy data day starts out with Housing Starts. They surged in April to an annual rate of 672,000, which was up a very strong 40.9% from a year earlier. However, much of that strength was likely related to the end of the homebuyer tax credit at the end of April. That effect will show up more quickly in data related to new homes than for used homes since new homes sales (and housing starts are clearly related to new home sales since many are sold before construction starts) because new home sales are recorded at the signing of the contract, while used home sales are recorded at the closing. Thus, Starts are expected to fall back to an annual rate of 655,000 in May. That would still represent a substantial year-over-year increase, but from extremely depressed levels. Residential investment is usually a key driver in pulling the economy out of recessions, but it has largely been derailed in this recovery, despite significant government support for the industry.The best indicator for future housing starts is building permits. They fell sharply to an annual rate of 606,000 in April, and are expected to rebound to 655,000 in May. That would be pretty good news about the future direction of housing starts and residential investment. Each new house built generates an enormous amount of economic actively that ripples through the rest of the economy. However, if one includes the shadow inventory, there is more than enough housing available in the country, so in the long term it does not make a lot of sense to building a lot more of it at this point.We should get more evidence that inflation is not a problem when the Producer Price Index (PPI) comes out. It is expected to drop 0.4% in May, that comes on top of a drop of 0.1% in April. Declining energy prices are expected to play a major role in the decline. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, is expected to increase just 0.1% -- down from a 0.2% increase in April. Right now, it looks like deflation is a greater threat than inflation, and the low inflation rate will allow the Fed to keep short term rates low for a very long time. Indeed a very good case could be made that they need to be aggressively easing monetary policy, but since short-term rates are already near zero, that would require quantitative easing.Industrial Production is expected to increase by 0.7% in May on top of a 0.8% increase in April. Factories have been leading the comeback in the economy, but they are still climbing out of a deep hole. The total industrial production figures also include the output of mines and utilities. The utility numbers often are as influenced by the weather as by the state of the economy, so make sure to look at the manufacturing only numbers as well, which have been up 1.0% in each of the last two months.The Industrial Production report also contains data on Capacity Utilization, which is sort of like the employment rate for physical capital. In April, total capacity utilization rose to 73.7% from 73.1%. It is up nicely from the low of 68.3% hit in June of last year, but remains well below its long-term average level of 80.6%. It is expected to increase further to 74.2% in May. As with the Industrial Production numbers, the total can be distorted by the weather in the utility numbers. The manufacturing-only numbers were lower at 70.8% in April, but have been showing greater improvement than the overall number. It fell all the way to 65.2% last June.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They fell 3,000 in the last week, to 456,000. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims have become very erratic so far in 2010. Look for them to fall next week. Longer term, we have made progress, but not good enough. We probably need for weekly claims (and the four-week moving average of them) to get down to closer to 400,000 to signal that the economy is adding enough jobs to make a dent in the unemployment rate. We are a lot closer now than we were last spring when they were running north of 640,000 on a consistent basis, but we still have a ways to go.Continuing claims have also been in a steep downtrend of late. However, that is in part due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits, which run out after 26 weeks. If one factors in the extended claims paid by the federal government as part of the Stimulus Program, claims soared last week. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. Last week regular continuing claims were 4.462 million, down 255,000 from the previous week. Extended claims (paid from federal ARRA funds) were 5.390 million, an increase of 69,500. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.Inflation at the consumer level is also very tame. The headline CPI is expected to match its April decline of 0.1%, in part due to lower gasoline costs. Excluding food and energy, prices are expected to have risen by just 0.1% in May after having been unchanged in April. Consumer price inflation, both headline and core, has been virtually non-existent over the last six months. Inflation simply is not a threat right now, nor is it likely to be any time soon. Policy makers' fear of a non-existent threat is preventing them from tackling very real problems like unemployment and low capacity utilization.The Index of Leading Economic Indicators is expected to have increased by 0.4% in May after declining 0.1% in April. Given the decline in the S&P 500 during May, which is one of the most important of the indicators, a 0.4% increase would mean a very strong showing for the rest of the indicators. Building permits are another one of the indicators, so if they come in stronger than expected on Wednesday, then look for a positive surprise in the LEI on Thursday; ditto if they disappoint.The Philly Fed index, which is similar to the Empire State index released on Tuesday but covering the Mid-Atlantic states, is expected to show growth in June, but at a slower rate than in May. The consensus expectation is for a reading of 17.0, down from 21.4 in May. Any reading over 0 indicates expansion, and 17.4 is still a very healthy reading.FridayNo reports of particular significance.Earnings CalendarCompany Ticker Qtr End EPS Est Year Ago EPS Last EPS Surprise % Next EPS Report Date Time Daily Price Capstone Turbin CPST 201003 ($0.04) ($0.06) -25.00% 20100614 AMC 1.1 Chindex Intl CHDX 201003 $0.10  $0.22  -18.18% 20100614 BTO 10.91 Comarco Inc CMRO 201004 ($0.07) ($0.39) 125.00% 20100614 AMC 2.42 Eltek Ltd ELTK 201003 N/A $0.02  N/A 20100614 BTO 1.54 La-Z-Boy Inc LZB 201004 $0.21  $0.07  88.89% 20100614 AMC 12 Majesco Entmnt COOL 201004 ($0.04) ($0.01) 350.00% 20100614 AMC 0.78 Mds Inc MDZ 201004 ($0.02) $0.04  -700.00% 20100614 AMC 8.53 Motorcar Parts MPAA 201003 $0.14  ($0.09) 5.88% 20100614   6.16 Natl Tech Sys NTSC 201004 $0.06  $0.06  -11.11% 20100614 BTO 5.71 Rentrak Corp RENT 201003 $0.01  $0.13  -27.27% 20100614 AMC 21.99 Synergetics Usa SURG 201004 N/A $0.02  N/A 20100614 AMC 2.5 Valence Tech VLNC 201003 ($0.04) ($0.04) 0.00% 20100614 AMC 0.86 Bakers Footwear BKRS 201004 N/A ($0.39) N/A 20100615 BTO 1.64 Best Buy BBY 201005 $0.50  $0.42  1.12% 20100615 BTO 40.24 Caseys Gen Strs CASY 201004 $0.41  $0.31  0.00% 20100615 BTO 35.71 Clarcor Inc CLC 201005 $0.41  $0.33  6.52% 20100615 AMC 35.16 Factset Resh FDS 201005 $0.77  $0.73  1.35% 20100615 BTO 67.47 Funtalk China FTLK 201003 $0.17  ($0.13) N/A 20100615 BTO 6.14 Korn/Ferry Intl KFY 201004 $0.13  ($0.11) 0.00% 20100615 BTO 13.82 Amer Apparel APP 201003 ($0.22) ($0.13) 0.00% 20100616 BTO 1.54 Canadian Solar CSIQ 201003 $0.08  ($0.13) -31.37% 20100616 BTO 9.79 Fedex Corp FDX 201005 $1.32  $0.64  5.56% 20100616 BTO 80.26 Ihs Inc-A IHS 201005 $0.57  $0.50  -8.70% 20100616 AMC 53.69 Spansion Inc CODE 201003 N/A N/A N/A 20100616 BTO 16.8 Actuant Corp ATU 201005 $0.27  $0.20  18.75% 20100617 BTO 19.89 Discover Fin Sv DFS 201005 $0.11  ($0.18) -650.00% 20100617 BTO 13.6 Kroger Co KR 201004 $0.55  $0.66  14.71% 20100617 BTO 19.77 Pier 1 Imports PIR 201005 ($0.02) ($0.20) -3.13% 20100617 BTO 7.64 Smart Modular SMOD 201005 $0.18  ($0.01) 33.33% 20100617 AMC 5.74 Smithfield Food SFD 201004 $0.18  ($0.55) 15.79% 20100617 BTO 16.28 Smucker Jm SJM 201004 $0.80  $1.02  11.43% 20100617 BTO 56.34 Winnebago WGO 201005 $0.03  ($0.29) 122.22% 20100617 BTO 11 Alloy Inc ALOY 201004 N/A ($0.22) N/A 20100618 BTO 7.9 Dirk van Dijk, CFA is the Chief Equity Strategist for Zacks.com.

2434,FDX,"Earnings Preview 12/14 - 12/18
"
2435,FDX,"Next week will be a light one on the earnings front, with a total of only 40 companies reporting, including 9 S&P 500 firms. Among the more noteworthy names that are going to report are: Federal Express (FDX  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report). There will also be several potentially market-moving economic reports.Monday
"
2436,FDX,"•    Nothing of significance.Tuesday
"
2437,FDX,"•    The Producer Price Index (PPI) is released for November. The headline PPI is expected to show an increase of 0.9%, on top of last month’s 0.3% increase. However, most of that is expected to come from food and energy price increases. The core PPI is expected to post an increase of just 0.2% after falling 0.6% in October.
"
2438,FDX,"•    The Empire State Manufacturing Survey is expected to show that manufacturing activity in the New York area increased at a slightly faster pace in its December survey than it did in its November survey, with a reading or 25.0, up from 23.5.
"
2439,FDX,"•    Capacity Utilization is expected to have risen to 71.1% overall in November, up from 70.7% in October. This is still an extremely low reading, but has been showing signs of rebounding in recent months. If the consensus expectations are met it will be the 5th straight monthly increase since it bottomed in June at 68.3%, an all-time record low. Total Capacity Utilization normally runs at around 80% in a healthy economy. Manufacturing Capacity utilization was 67.6% in October, up from a low of 65.1% in June. This report is far more important than the amount of attention it usually receives.
"
2440,FDX,"•    Industrial production is expected to have expanded by 0.6% in November after a 0.1% increase in October.Wednesday
"
2441,FDX,"•    Housing Starts are expected to rebound to an annualized rate of 575,000 after a very disappointing level of just 529,000 in October. Recent strength in new home sales have given builders a bit more leeway in starting additional homes.
"
2442,FDX,"•    Building Permits, the best indicator of future housing starts, are expected to rise to a 570,000 annual rate, up from 552,000 in October.
"
2443,FDX,"•    The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will probably rise by 0.3% in November on a headline basis after rising 0.2% in October. Core (ex-food and energy) CPI is expected to be up a more tame 0.1% after a 0.3% increase in October. Within the report, pay special attention to how Rent and Owner's Equivalent Rent are doing. Together they make up almost 30% of the total CPI and almost 40% of the core CPI, and should be keeping overall inflation in check.
"
2444,FDX,"•    The Federal Reserve finishes up their two-day policy meeting. There is almost no chance that they will raise the Fed Funds rate from its current 0 to 0.25% range. Economists will be reading the tea leaves in the Fed statement closely for any change in tone that might indicate when the Fed will start tightening again.Thursday
"
2445,FDX,"•    Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. These have been in a steep downward trend of late, although still at historically high levels. Last week there were 474,000 initial claims -- the first increase in five weeks. Look for the decline to resume. Continuing claims have also been in a steep downtrend of late, even if one factors in the extended claims paid by the Federal government as part of the Stimulus Program. Look for a further decline in regular continuing claims from the current level of 5.157 million, offset by a smaller rise in the extended claims which now total 4.586 million.
"
2446,FDX,"•    The Index of Leading Economic Indicators is expected to post a gain of 0.7% following a 0.3% gain last month.Friday
"
2447,FDX,"•    No reports of any significance.Potential Positive Surprises
"
2448,FDX,"Historically, the best indicators of firms which are likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. Some of the companies that have these characteristics include:Federal Express (FDX  -  Free Report) is expected to post EPS of  $1.06, down from $1.58 last year. That low expectation sets it up for a positive surprise.  Last time out they just met expectations, but the stock holds a coveted Zacks Rank #1 and over the last month the expectations for the about-to-be-reported quarter have jumped by 25.7%.  General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) is expected to report EPS of $1.45 vs. $1.36 a year ago. The mean estimate for the quarter has edged up by 0.8% over the last month and last time out the company posted a positive surprise of 24.3%. The stock holds a Zacks Rank of 2.Joy Global (JOYG), the maker of mining machines, is expected to see EPS drop to $1.01 from $1.23 last year. However, last time out it posted a 26% positive surprise and the estimates for this quarter have edged up by 0.8% over the last month. The stock holds a Zacks Rank of 2.Potential Negative Surprises
"
2449,FDX,"In keeping with the overall very positive tone of this earnings season, the potential negative firms are less clear cut. However:Applied Signal (APSG) is expected to post EPS of $0.24 a share, up from $0.20 a year ago. Last time they disappointed by 3.85%. The mean estimate for the quarter is down 0.9% over the last month and the stock has a weak Zacks Rank of 4.Earnings CalendarCompany Stock ZacksEstimate Year AgoEPS LastQtrSurprise Date Time PriceBrt Realty Trst  BRT  -0.39 $0.20  N/A 12/14/2009 AMC $4.58 Global Crossing  GLBC  -0.66 ($1.26) -92.19% 12/14/2009   $11.98 Intl Asset Hldg  IAAC  0.38 ($0.01) N/A 12/14/2009 AMC $15.50 Verifone Hldgs  PAY  0.2 $0.19  53.85% 12/14/2009 AMC $14.19 Steak N Shake  SNS  0.12 ($0.18) 116.67% 12/14/2009 AMC $11.49 Adobe Systems  ADBE  0.31 $0.54  0.00% 12/15/2009 AMC $35.80 Aar Corp  AIR  0.31 $0.49  8.00% 12/15/2009 AMC $19.74 Best Buy  BBY  0.42 $0.35  -11.90% 12/15/2009 BTO $43.21 Emcore Corp  EMKR  -0.12 ($0.30) 35.71% 12/15/2009 AMC $0.93 Factset Resh  FDS  0.74 $0.70  1.37% 12/15/2009 BTO $75.04 Rentech Inc  RTK  -0.01 ($0.03) 214.29% 12/15/2009   $1.69 Wpcs Intl Inc  WPCS  0.08 $0.05  500.00% 12/15/2009 AMC $3.01 Apogee Entrprs  APOG  0.22 $0.58  84.00% 12/16/2009 AMC $13.90 Hovnanian Entrp  HOV  -1.49 ($5.79) -48.13% 12/16/2009 AMC $3.65 Joy Global Inc  JOYG  1.01 $1.23  26.04% 12/16/2009 BTO $52.14 Martek Bioscs  MATK  0.33 $0.27  3.85% 12/16/2009 AMC $17.09 Herman Miller  MLHR  0.19 $0.60  15.79% 12/16/2009 AMC $16.25 Nordson Corp  NDSN  0.88 $1.00  44.90% 12/16/2009 AMC $54.86 Paychex Inc  PAYX  0.33 $0.39  0.00% 12/16/2009 AMC $31.84 Accenture Plc  ACN  0.65 $0.74  0.00% 12/17/2009 AMC $42.68 Appld Signal  APSG  0.24 $0.20  -3.85% 12/17/2009 AMC $20.49 Actuant Corp  ATU  0.16 $0.45  12.50% 12/17/2009 BTO $16.92 Discover Fin Sv  DFS  0.15 ($0.19) 500.00% 12/17/2009 BTO $15.60 Darden Restrnt  DRI  0.42 $0.44  3.08% 12/17/2009 AMC $32.13 Fedex Corp (FDX  -  Free Report) 1.06 $1.58  0.00% 12/17/2009 BTO $88.04 Genl Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) 1.45 $1.36  24.27% 12/17/2009 BTO $68.73 Marcus Corp  MCS  0.08 $0.08  -2.86% 12/17/2009 BTO $12.79 Nike Inc-B (NKE  -  Free Report) 0.71 $0.80  7.07% 12/17/2009 AMC $62.70 Oracle Corp  ORCL  0.35 $0.34  0.00% 12/17/2009 AMC $22.59 Palm Inc  PALM  -0.41 ($0.78) 18.18% 12/17/2009 AMC $12.17 Pier 1 Imports  PIR  -0.03 ($0.41) 13.64% 12/17/2009 BTO $4.63 Rite Aid Corp  RAD  -0.18 ($0.17) 6.67% 12/17/2009 BTO $1.31 Research In Mot  RIMM  1.04 $0.83  3.00% 12/17/2009 AMC $65.80 Steelcase Inc  SCS  0 $0.03  -200.00% 12/17/2009 AMC $5.88 Smart Modular  SMOD  0.05 $0.02  100.00% 12/17/2009 AMC $4.97 Winnebago  WGO  -0.07 ($0.33) 17.39% 12/17/2009 BTO $10.49 Carmax Gp (Cc)  KMX  0.12 ($0.10) 161.11% 12/18/2009 BTO $20.60 Neogen Corp  NEOG  0.29 $0.26  11.54% 12/18/2009 BTO $32.34 Rosetta Genomic  ROSG  -0.25 ($0.25) -86.67% 12/18/2009 BTO $2.15 Stewart Entrp A  STEI  0.06 ($0.39) -25.00% 12/18/2009 BTO $4.99 Dirk van Dijk, CFA is the Chief Equity Strategist for Zacks.com.

2450,FDX,"Stocks turned south after 3 straight days of gains even as unemployment claims dropped. Take a look at the Analyst Blog titled Initial Claims Drop Again for the story on jobless claims.
"
2451,FDX,"Investors also received data on housing today, which was mostly in line with expectations. Check out the Analyst Blog on housing, titled Apartment Starts, Permits Rise. 
"
2452,FDX,"Todays losses were modest. The Dow dipped by 7.79 points, or 0.1%, to 9,783.92. The S&P 500 fell 3.27 points, or 0.3%, to 1,065.49. The Nasdaq declined by 6.40 points, or 0.3%, to 2,126.75.
"
2453,FDX,"Oil gave up 3 cents, settling at $72.47 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
"
2454,FDX,"Contributing to Thursdays moderate dips were reports from FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report). 
"
2455,FDX,"FDX was down 2.23% as the company announced fiscal first-quarter earnings of $181 million, versus last years $384 million. Revenue of $8.01 billion slid from the previous years $9.97 billion. 
"
2456,FDX,"ORCL closed down by 2.76%. The company posted fiscal first-quarter net income of $1.1 billion, up from the year-prior $1 billion. Revenue declined by 5% year-over-year to $5.1 billion.  
"
2457,FDX,"Focus List UpdatesDolan Media (DM), which was just added to the focus list yesterday, jumped 4.88% on nearly average volume and no company news. 
"
2458,FDX,"There was a favorable article in the financial press on the company out after the bell yesterday, which might have contributed to the jump in today's share price.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) declined by 0.94% as gold retreated from an 18-month high. We continue to like this company and its exposure to gold, copper and silver. Weve owned it for only a week and it is up about 6% in that time. We anticipate greater gains from this one. 
"
2459,FDX,"J.M. Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report) slipped less than 0.8% today. We have seen quite a few estimate revisions from covering analysts. Of the 9 analysts polled by Zacks, 4 have raised full-year estimates for fiscal 2010 in the past 30 days. The consensus is now $3.81, up from $3.77. 
"
2460,FDX,"NewMarket (NEU) continued to break out, hitting a multi-year high of $95.35. It closed up 3.72% at $95.33 on the session on higher than normal volume of 262,000 shares compared to 167,000 shares.
"
2461,FDX,"Despite the strong move upward, the stock isn't altogether expensive. NEU trades at just 11.8x forward earnings. 
"
2462,FDX,"Check out the amazing 1-year chart below:Steven Madden, Ltd (SHOO  -  Free Report) rose 2.5% to set another 52-week high in light trading today. There was no news, but the estimates for the retailer remain strong as well as the valuations. 
"
2463,FDX,"Growth and Income UpdatesAbbott (ABT  -  Free Report) declared a quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share. The company noted that this marked the 343rd consecutive quarterly dividend paid by Abbott since 1924. The dividend is payable Nov. 15 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Oct. 15. Abbott has hiked its dividend payout for 37 consecutive years, including an 11% boost earlier this year.
"
2464,FDX,"The stock slipped by 0.77% in todays down market. We continue to hold ABT, looking for gains.
"
2465,FDX,"Buckeye Partners Ltd. (BPL  -  Free Report) posted a respectable gain of .89% in spite of weakness in the energy market. Crude had been stuck below $70 earlier in the week before some bullish economic data hit the Street and sent prices higher once again, but retracted a bit today on some weaker than expected data.
"
2466,FDX,"Herbalife Ltd. (HLF  -  Free Report) gave back a large portion of its gains from the previous day, dropping 4% on the day and falling back to a short-term trend line. The pullback is most likely just short-term volatility in the market as opposed to any underlying shift in the fundamentals or sentiment. 
"
2467,FDX,"This week brings the initial batch of third-quarter results. Seven early reporters from the S&P 500 - all of whom have quarters ending in August - will report: Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and Pall (PLL).

2468,FDX,"So how will the third-quarter look? The Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for S&P 500 earnings of $13.50 per share, a 15.4% decline from a year prior.
"
2469,FDX,"Going back to the week's events, the economic calendar will stay busy with inflation, manufacturing and housing data being released.
"

Duke will discuss regulation and accounting at the AICPA's annual conference in Washington D.C. Lacker will appear before the Charlotte chapter of the Risk Management Association.
"
2474,FDX,"Friday will be a quadruple witching day. Stock option contracts, stock futures contracts, market index options and market futures contracts will all expire. This could lead to increased volatility.
"
2475,FDX,"We are in a fear and greed market with a relatively small group of traders playing hot potato. Bonds are doing extremely well (fear), while the S&P 500 continues move higher (greed). It doesn't make sense, but stocks are trending higher. Dow 10,000 is only a few good days away and the fast money remains in control.
"
2476,FDX,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises
"
2477,FDX,"One analyst just raised his fiscal third-quarter profit forecast on Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report). The revision pushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate a penny higher to 28 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at 32 cents per share. Though the software company has only matched expectations over the past 2 quarters, it did top during the previous 4 quarters. Adobe is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Sep 15, after the close of trading.
"
2478,FDX,"Three analysts raised their fiscal second-quarter projections on Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) over the past few weeks. The changes have resulted in a Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents per share, a penny higher than the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate estimate is slightly more bullish at 42 cents per share. BBY has topped expectations for 3 consecutive quarters.

2479,FDX,"FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) preannounced fiscal first-quarter earnings of 58 cents per share today. The number is well above both the company's guidance and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents per share. Fiscal second-quarter guidance also looks strong at a range of 65 to 95 cents per share. Though the surprise should be baked into the price, if reaction to the conference call is favorable, there is the possibility of additional upside. FDX is scheduled to report on Thursday, Sep 17, before the start of trading.

"
2486,FDX,"The market has been looking to the financial sector for clues about the health of the economy and the strength of any pending recovery. But this is a departure from the past, mostly because of the group's role in the global economic meltdown that shook the markets last fall. 
"
2487,FDX,"Historically speaking, other industries have offered more clues about the country's economic health, one of the best being transports. 
"
2488,FDX,"Transports Are A Leading Indicator
"
2489,FDX,"Transports are considered early cycle indicators, with consumer and business spending quickly showing up in the group's results. So while the financials are squarely in the spotlight, the transports deserve some attention too in order to develop a more rounded view of the economic landscape. 
"
2490,FDX,"Let's take a closer look at some major players operating in different segments of the transports sector. 
"
2491,FDX,"Federal Express (FDX  -  Free Report) has rebounded nicely from its March low of $34, recently topping off above $64. But estimates continue to fall, with the current year down 77 cents in the last 90 days to $2.71. That means this stock trades with a P/E multiple of 23X, a fairly steep premium to the overall market. So what does that earnings multiple get you? Well, the next-year estimate is projecting 40% earnings growth, but CFO Alan Graf recently said that  ""The operating environment for our first two quarters in fiscal 2010 is expected to be extremely difficult.""  
"
2492,FDX,"Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report) operates in a different segment of the market than FedEx, servicing corporate/industrial clients. The company's July 23, second-quarter results were respectable, posting earnings of 92 cents against the expected 78. But once again, CEO Jim Young said that he expects it to be some time before the economy recovers. Estimates are down here also, with the current year off 32 cents in the last 90 days to $3.68 per share.    
"
2493,FDX,"Genco Shipping & Trading Ltd. (GNK  -  Free Report) operates as a dry good shipper worldwide. Shares of GNK are up more than 300% since bottoming out late last year, but the next-year estimate is projecting an earnings contraction. The valuation picture does looks solid though with a P/E multiple of 7X. Take a look at the chart below. 
"
2494,FDX,"Frontline Ltd. (FRO  -  Free Report) give us a window into the energy industry, as the company specializes in transporting crude. In spite of crude's big run-up over the last 3 months, estimates for FRO have been slumping, with the current-year down 10 cents to $1.29 per share and the next year down 61 cents to a modest $1.50. In order for the company to send its share price even higher after a nice rebound from recent lows, it will have to consistently produce major earnings growth. Take a look below. 
"
2495,FDX,"Conclusion
"
2496,FDX,"The recent market rally has been awesome, a breath of fresh air to many investors who took a hit earlier in the year when the market crumbled. But optimism must be supported by fundamentals. Right now, the transports are recording respectable results against lowered expectations, but guiding quite cautiously. When you balance out financial sector optimism with the transport sector's caution tone, somewhere in the middle is probably the best place to be.

"
2499,FDX,"Stock performance in the transportation sector has been very uneven, reflecting the varying fortunes of particular industries within the sector. The median year-to-date-stock price gain/(loss) has been mixed for industries in the Zacks transportation universe, with all industries underperforming the S&P 500s 3.3% increase, with the exception of railroads and air freight. 
"
2500,FDX,"Air freight has been helped by large gains in smaller companies as the giants within the air freight sector, United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) and FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report), are down 10.6% and 8.4% year to date, respectively. The railroads were helped when CSX Corporation (CSX) kicked off the second quarter earnings season earlier this week with better-than-expected earnings.
"
2501,FDX," Railroads 11.8%
"
2502,FDX," Air Freight 5.1%
"
2503,FDX," Equip & Leasing (2.1)%
"
2504,FDX," Trucking (2.5)%
"
2505,FDX," Shipping (2.8)%
"
2506,FDX," Airlines (29.5)%
"
2507,FDX,"Among the hardest hit industries have been airlines, where demand is dropping precipitously, reflecting the impact of the global economic slowdown. We believe there are a number of countervailing factors that will affect the transportation sector within the coming months:
"
2508,FDX," Volume weakness - as the global recession takes hold, we expect volumes to weaken from current levels as fewer businesses ship goods, whether by air, sea, rail, or road, and fewer individuals decide to travel, which will hurt airlines 
"
2509,FDX," Waning pricing power - to date, pricing has been fairly solid, particularly in those industries that are able to pass through rising fuel costs through fuel surcharges, such as railroads and trucking. Airlines have managed to add revenues through surcharges for second bags and other items. However, as the recession takes hold, we expect revenues to come under pressure, due to competitive pressures as companies fight for a share of a smaller pie
"
2510,FDX," Falling fuel prices - declining fuel prices, a significant line item on income statements for many transportation companies, should help alleviate cost pressures; on the negative side, this will hurt revenues as fuel surcharge revenue recedes
"
2511,FDX,"Stocks of dry bulk shipping companies, once the hardest hit industry within the transportation group, have recovered nicely from their lows and are down less than 3% compared to the 32.7% decline at the time of our March report, reflecting improvement in shipping rates and other favorable developments. The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) is up to 3,501 from its recent low of 663 on December 5, 2008, though still down precipitously from the record high achieved on May 20, 2008 of 11,793.
"
2512,FDX,"Moreover, many dry bulk shippers in the Zacks-covered universe have been successful in negotiating waivers in financial covenants contained within loan agreements, thereby providing some much-needed breathing room to operate in this downturn. That said, dry bulk shippers are not out of the woods yet, and will need to see a sustained uptick in global trade patterns before normal operating trends can be achieved.
"
2513,FDX,"OPPORTUNITIES
"
2514,FDX,"At this time, we see no near-term opportunities in this space. There are currently no stocks in the covered transportation universe with a Zacks ranking of 1 (Strong Buy) and only one company -- Euroseas Ltd. (ESEA) --  that has a Zacks rank of 2 (Buy).
"
2515,FDX,"WEAKNESSES
"
2516,FDX,"We would avoid companies that are in very volatile industries, such as shipping and airlines. Stock prices in these industries can display enormous gains and losses on a frequent basis and are not for the faint of heart.
"
2517,FDX,"Specific Sell recommendations include Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. (OSG), the second largest publicly listed oil tanker owner in the world, and China Eastern Airlines Corporation Limited (CEA  -  Free Report), one of the 3 largest airliners in China by fleet size and the primary air carrier serving Shanghai.
"
2518,FDX,"There is one company -- DryShips Inc.  -- in the covered transportation universe that has a Zacks Rank of 5 (Strong Sell) and six companies -- Excel Maritime Carriers Ltd (EXM), FedEx Corporation, Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (SBLK), UAL Corporation (UAUA) and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP) -- that have a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell).

"
2547,FDX,"The revisions ratio reversed course, falling after a long string of steady increases. The reversal brought it from the abysmal lows of 0.20 last winter (i.e. 5 cuts for every increase) to a high of 1.29 two weeks ago. Last winter, in individual sectors, the cuts were often in excess of 10:1.
"
2548,FDX,"The current reading is on a very low number of total revisions, which is quite normal for this time of the quarter. However, it is sort of like a stock that moves on low volume. Its good if the stock moves up, but you have less conviction about its significance than if it is on high volume.
"
2549,FDX,"Tech has moved up substantially in the revisions ratio rankings in large part due to the strength in the Chip industry. Some of the real standouts in terms of large numbers of estimate increases leading to very large increases in mean estimates are National Semiconductor (NSM) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report).
"
2550,FDX,"The strength in Staples was lead by General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report). However it is a sector where the estimate changes do not tend to be dramatic. Two other notables that had many more increases than cuts, but small changes in the mean estimate, were Colgate-Palmolive (CL  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report). The one firm in the sector that was noteworthy in heading south was Walgreens (WAG).
"
2551,FDX,"The weakness in the Industrial sector was most apparent in some of the transportation related companies, like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airline (LUV  -  Free Report). Paccar (PCAR  -  Free Report) was also very weak.

"
2571,FDX,"The Dow slipped by 7.49 points, or 0.1%, to 8,497.18. The S&P 500 was down 1.26 points, or 0.1%, closing at 910.71. The Nasdaq climbed 11.88 points, or 0.7%, to 1,808.06.
"
2572,FDX,"FedEx posted a widened loss on a year-over-year basis and reported a drop in revenues. The company also injected worry into the market by cutting its already reduced outlook for the next quarter and stating that it sees difficult conditions ahead. FDXs words of caution grabbed the attention of analysts as shipping companies are used as a barometer of the economys health. 
"
2573,FDX,"Financials got hit today in response to downgrades on 18 banks from Standard & Poor's. S&P noted that the financial sector will continue to see volatility and stricter regulation.
"
2574,FDX,"A glimmer of hope came in the form of todays Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading, which showed an increase of 0.1%. The result was less than analysts expectations of a rise of 0.3%, indicating that prices are being kept in check and fending off inflation.

2584,FDX,"We will see initial second-quarter numbers with Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Carnival (CCL  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and J.M. Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report) reporting this week. Notably missing from the group are the investment bankers, the surviving members of which have changed to traditional calendar quarters.
"
2585,FDX,"Though there are five S&P 500 companies reporting, the earnings calendar is pretty light. Just 23 companies are confirmed to report.
"
2586,FDX,"Conversely, the economic calendar is fairly busy. We'll see the producer and consumer price indexes, housing data and the Phili Fed survey.
"

"
2593,FDX,"Warsh will speak to a different bankers' convention on Tuesday. He will discuss economic policy and the financial markets.
"
2594,FDX,"Friday is a quadruple witching day, meaning option and futures contracts will expire. This could lead to higher volatility.
"
2595,FDX,"What should be interesting to see is whether we get some end-of-quarter window dressing by fund managers. Many have been sitting on the sidelines - as is evident by the light volume - and are likely underperforming their benchmarks. This raises the possibility that we could see managers buying ""good"" stocks to make their portfolio holdings look better.
"
2596,FDX,"Keep an eye on commodities and bonds. Commodities have been very strong and treasury yields may come down after having just set short-term highs.
"
2597,FDX,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings SurprisesAdobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report) has delivered positive surprises during 7 of the last 9 quarters. (Its fiscal first-quarter numbers matched expectations.) Though the consensus earnings estimate is unchanged at 28 cents per share, the most accurate estimate is higher at 30 cents per share. This suggests another good report could be forthcoming. Adobe is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Jun 16, after the close of trading.
"
2598,FDX,"Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) has benefited from the demise of Circuit City, having topped expectations for 2 consecutive quarters. Three of the covering brokerage analysts think the company may deliver another upside surprise and have raised their fiscal first-quarter estimates as a result. These revisions have led to a most accurate estimate of 34 cents per share, which is a penny better than the consensus earnings estimate. Best Buy is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Jun 16, before the start of trading.
"
2599,FDX,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises
"
2600,FDX,"During the past few weeks, 2 analysts have cut their fiscal fourth-quarter profit forecasts on FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report). The negative revisions have resulted in a most accurate estimate of 47 cents per share, which is 5 cents below the fiscal fourth-quarter consensus earnings estimate. FDX has missed twice during the past 4 quarters. FedEx is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Jun 17, before the start of trading.

"
2605,FDX,"1Some of the companies listed in the earnings calendar may not be in the Zacks Rank universe.
"
2606,FDX,"Stock performance in the transportation sector has been very uneven, reflecting the varying fortunes of particular industries within the sector. The median year-to-date-stock price gain/(loss) has been mixed for industries in the Zacks transportation universe -- all industries are underperforming the S&P 500s 0.7% increase, with the exception of air freight. Air freight has been helped by large gains in smaller companies as the giants within the air freight sector, United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) and FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report), are down 4.3% and 15.7% year to date, respectively.
"
2607,FDX," Air Freight 17.3%
"
2608,FDX," Equipment & Leasing 0.5%
"
2609,FDX," Trucking (0.7)%
"
2610,FDX," Shipping (0.9)%
"
2611,FDX," Railroads (3.8)%
"
2612,FDX," Airlines (32.8)%
"
2613,FDX,"Among the hardest hit have been airlines and railroads (see the Analyst Blog by Dirk van Dijk, entitled Recovery Derailed?), where demand is dropping precipitously, reflecting the impact of the global economic slowdown. We believe there are a number of countervailing factors that will affect the transportation sector within the coming months:
"
2614,FDX," Volume weakness - as the global recession takes hold, we expect volumes to weaken from current levels as fewer businesses ship goods, whether by air, sea, rail or road, and fewer individuals decide to travel, which will hurt airlines
"
2615,FDX," Waning pricing power - to date, pricing has been fairly solid, particularly in those industries that are able to pass through rising fuel costs through fuel surcharges, such as railroads and trucking. Airlines have managed to add revenues through surcharges for second bags and other items. However, as the recession takes hold, we expect revenues to come under pressure, due to competitive pressures as companies fight for a share of a smaller pie
"
2616,FDX," Falling fuel prices - declining fuel prices, a significant line item on income statements for many transportation companies, should help alleviate cost pressures; on the negative side, this will hurt revenues as fuel surcharge revenue recedes
"
2617,FDX,"Stocks of dry bulk shipping companies, the hardest hit industry within the transportation group, have recovered nicely from their lows and are near break-even levels compared to the 32.7% decline at the time of our last report in March, reflecting improvement in shipping rates and other favorable developments. The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) is up to 2,605 from its recent low of 663 on December 5, 2008, though still down precipitously from the record high achieved on May 20, 2008 of 11,793.
"
2618,FDX,"Moreover, many dry bulk shippers in the Zacks-covered universe have been successful in negotiating waivers in financial covenants contained within loan agreements, thereby providing some much-needed breathing room to operate in this downturn. That said, dry bulk shippers are not out of the woods yet, and will need to see a sustained uptick in global trade patterns before normal operating trends can be achieved.
"
2619,FDX,"OPPORTUNITIES
"
2620,FDX,"At this time, we see no near-term opportunities in this space. There are currently no stocks with Zacks ranking of 1 or 2 -- indicating upward bias in the share price over the near term -- in the covered transportation universe.
"
2621,FDX,"WEAKNESSES
"
2622,FDX,"We would avoid companies that are in very volatile industries, such as shipping and airlines. Stock prices in these industries can display enormous gains and losses on a frequent basis, and are not for the faint of heart.
"
2623,FDX,"Specific Sell recommendations include Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. (OSG), the second largest publicly listed oil tanker owner in the world, and China Eastern Airlines Corporation Limited (CEA  -  Free Report), one of the 3 largest airliners in China by fleet size and the primary air carrier serving Shanghai.
"
2624,FDX,"There are two companies -- DryShips Inc. (DRYS) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report)-- in the covered transportation universe that have a Zacks Rank of 5, and five companies -- CAI International, Inc. (CAP), Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report), FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report), Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. (OSG) and United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) -- that have a Zacks Rank of 4, indicating near-term selling pressure on the share price.
"
2625,FDX,"Guess, Inc. (GES  -  Free Report) could top expectations. FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) could disappoint. Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) will also report.
"
2626,FDX,"The earnings calendar is limited this week with just 93 companies confirmed to report. First-quarter earnings season will not ""officially"" start until April.
"
2627,FDX,"We will, however, get our first glimpse at first-quarter earnings as companies with fiscal quarters ending in February start to release results. Among these early reporters are Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report).
"
2628,FDX,"Excluded from the list are the investment banks. Bear Stearns and Lehman are obviously gone. Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), which had reported quarterly results last March, both told me their earnings reports would not be issued until the second-half of April. (Specific dates have not been announced.)
"
2629,FDX,"The Fed will hold a 2-day meeting starting on Tuesday with the statement released around 2:15 ET on Wednesday afternoon. Look for additional announcements about the Fed's plan to expand its balance sheet by purchasing various types of debt.
"

"
2636,FDX,"Many traders will be looking to see if stocks can keep their upward momentum. The major indexes are not overbought or near resistance, 2 positive factors.
"
2637,FDX,"That said, wildcard events (e.g. threats of corporate bankruptcies, initiatives from the Obama administration, credit rating downgrades, bank announcements, etc.) still remain the primary drivers of market sentiment.
"
2638,FDX,"We're coming off a good week and let's hope the bear market rally continues. Just understand, however, that the punch bowl is running dry.
"
2639,FDX,"Have a happy St. Patrick's Day and remember to wear something green on Tuesday!
"
2640,FDX,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings SurprisesGuess, Inc. (GES  -  Free Report) has a long record of topping quarterly expectations. Recent positive revisions by 2 of the covering brokerage analysts suggest another positive surprise could be forthcoming. The most accurate estimate is 53 cents per share, a penny above the consensus estimate.
"
2641,FDX,"The big issue with GES, however, could be its guidance. Brokerage analysts cut their fiscal 2010 expectations last week, causing the consensus earnings estimate to fall to $1.98. Therefore, traders may want to use caution ahead of the earnings report.
"
2642,FDX,"Guess is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Mar 17, after the close of trading.
"
2643,FDX,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings SurprisesFedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) has missed once in the past 3 quarters. Ahead of the company's fiscal third-quarter report, 6 brokerage analysts have cut their profit projections. The negative revisions sent the consensus earnings estimate 3 cents lower to 47 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at 44 cents per share. FedEx is scheduled to report on Thursday, Mar 19, before the start of trading.

2665,FDX,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises
"
2666,FDX,"Trends in earnings estimate revisions do not suggest any of the companies reporting will top expectations. This is partially due to the fact that several of the companies have lowered guidance.
"
2667,FDX,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises
"
2668,FDX,"Last month, Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) cut its guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2009, which ends in February. Citing ""significant changes in the consumer environment,"" the company warned that same-store sales could be down 1% to 8%.
"
2669,FDX,"Nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts cut their projections in response, lowering the fiscal third-quarter consensus estimate by 13 cents to 27 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at 25 cents per share. Investors should also note that the electronic retailer's fiscal second-quarter results were 9 cents below expectations. Best Buy is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Dec 16, before the start of trading.
"
2670,FDX,"After nearly a perfect record of topping expectations, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) missed third-quarter estimates by 8 cents. The trend in earnings estimates suggests that the financial firm could disappoint investors again. During the past 30 days, 11 of the 16 covering brokerage analysts have cut their fiscal fourth-quarter estimates. The reductions caused the consensus estimate to plunge to a projected loss of $3.37 per share from a profit forecast of 84 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at a loss of $3.61 per share. Goldman Sachs is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Dec 16, before the start of trading.

"
2680,FDX,"A post closing bell announcement from Electronic Arts (ERTS) didnt help the atmosphere on Wall Street as the company stated that it expects revenue and earnings for fiscal 2009 to fall short of its previous guidance thanks to weaker-than-expected holiday sales.

2689,FDX,"As I write this on Friday afternoon, there is a possibility of major events impacting how stocks trade on Monday, Sep 15.
"
2690,FDX,"The first is Hurricane Ike. Ike is projected to make landfall late tonight or early Saturday morning between the Freeport/Lake Jackson area and Galveston as either a Category 2 or Category 3 storm. If the storm causes refineries to stay shut down for an extended period of time, oil prices could rally. Furthermore, if the wind and flood damage are significant, insurers and reinsurers could be under pressure.
"
2691,FDX,"The second is Lehman Brothers (LEH). There are rumors that a sale could be completed before the Asian markets open on Monday. The actual timing and terms may help or hurt other financial stocks.
"
2692,FDX,"(There are also rumors that J.P Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) is close to acquiring beleaguered Washington Mutual (WM).)
"
2693,FDX,"Even in the absence of these events, I would still expect the week to be volatile.
"
2694,FDX,"The earnings calendar features reports from 12 S&P 500 members, including brokers Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). Other notable reports will come from Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report). In total, we have confirmed reports from over 30 companies.
"
2695,FDX,"The Fed will hold a one-day meeting on Tuesday, Sep 16. Rates should stay unchanged, though fed fund futures have recently started reflecting a higher possibility of a quarter-point cut. The odds of a cut actually occurring, however, are slim.
"
2696,FDX,"Friday, Sep 19, is a quadruple witching day. This means both option and futures contracts will expire. The combined expirations can lead to higher volume and greater fluctuations in stock prices.
"
2697,FDX,"August consumer inflation, industrial production and housing starts will be among the key economic data being released:
"
2698,FDX,"Monday: September Empire State manufacturing survey, August industrial production and capacity utilization

"
2704,FDX,"Earnings estimate revisions are not signaling a probability of positive surprises from any of the companies scheduled to report.
"
2705,FDX,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings SurprisesDarden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report) recently warned that it expects fiscal first-quarter earnings to be between 60 and 62 cents per share. The company cited a 1.1% decline in same-store restaurant sales at its Red Lobster, Oliver Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse chains. Nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts cut their profit projections in response, causing the consensus earnings estimate to fall 14 cents to 61 cents per share. DRI has missed expectations twice during the past three quarters. Darden Restaurants is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Sep 16, after the close of trading.

2713,FDX,"Although we are still a few weeks away from the ""official start"" of second-quarter earnings season, there will be some notable reports during the third week of June. Five S&P 500 members are on the calendar: Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report).
"
2714,FDX,"Second-quarter earnings will be down on an aggregate basis, but up on a median company basis.
"
2715,FDX,"At the aggregate level, earnings for the S&P 500 will be down 9.6% on a bottom-up basis (compiling estimates for all 500 companies) and down 7.5% on an top-down basis (compiling estimates for the index itself). Conversely, if growth is calculated on a median company basis, which diminishes negative impact of financial companies, earnings should grow by 6.4%.

2726,FDX,"Recent earnings estimate revisions do suggest any of the 25 companies confirmed to report are likely to beat expectations. This said, investors may want to note that Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) has topped forecasts for 11 consecutive quarters. Fiscal-second quarter, and full-year 2008 and 2009, forecasts have been falling, however, so another positive surprise is by no means guaranteed. Goldman Sachs is scheduled to report on Tuesday, June 17, before the start of trading.
"

"
2728,FDX,"More than half of the covering brokerage analysts have slashed their fiscal second-quarter forecasts on Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) within the past 30 days. The cuts have caused the consensus earnings estimate to fall 33 cents to 98 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at 95 cents per share. MS has missed expectations twice during the past four quarters. Morgan Stanley is scheduled to report on Wednesday, June 18, before the start of trading.

"
2734,FDX,"The first quarter earnings season is all but over with 487 firms in the S&P 500 having reported. Six sectors have all their reports in and two more are more than 95% done.
"
2735,FDX,"We can draw a couple of conclusions about the results. First is that there is a serious dichotomy between growth as measured by the median EPS growth rate and as measured by the total net income growth. The median EPS growth rate is fairly healthy, while the total net income reported is sharply below a year ago.
"
2736,FDX,"More companies are posting positive surprises than disappointments, although the margin is slightly less than we have seen in the past. It is also clear that there seem to be two markets, with part of the economy continuing to enjoy very robust earnings growth, while other parts, chiefly the Financials, are having a down right awful earnings season.
"
2737,FDX,"Lets first look at the good news. The median year-over-year EPS growth rate is 9.0%, and six of the ten sectors are posting double-digit gains. While that is short of the sort of double digit growth in median EPS that we saw quarter in and quarter out for many years, it is far from the end of the world. The median expectation for the firms yet to report is for 5.6% growth. Assuming that those companies surprise by the same margin as the firms that have already reported (median surprise of 3.03%), we will see the current number stay right around where it is now, or even dip slightly.
"
2738,FDX,"The ratio of positive to negative surprises is running at 2.3:1. Not as good as in the past (over 3.0 is normal in recent years), but comfortably above 1.0. Only the Financials are posting more disappointments than positive surprises, and there just barely. The Financials have been responsible for 32.1% of all disappointments, even though they are responsible for only 18.9% of the total firms reporting.
"
2739,FDX,"On the other side, the ratio of positive surprises to disappointments is running at very high levels in Health Care (5.43) and Industrials (5.50). Energy, with a surprise ratio of 3.00, has the second highest median surprise, at 7.23%. Telecom has the best median surprise at 8.00%, even though its surprise ratio is just 1.67. However, given the very small number of firms in the Telecom sector (nine), medians of any sort are less meaningful than sectors with large numbers of firms in them.
"
2740,FDX,"In terms of year over year growth, Energy is the clear winner, with half the firms reporting year over year EPS growth in excess of 29.3%. Since all the energy firms have their numbers in, that number will not change. Tech holds the silver with 22.2% growth, while Industrials hold the bronze at 17.4%. Honorable (double digit) mentions go to Telecom, Health Care and Staples. Financials and Discretionary are both posting negative growth, while Materials and Utilities were barely positive.
"
2741,FDX,"Keep in mind what the median measures. It is a gauge of what the ""normal"" firm will report in terms of EPS. It is not influenced significantly by extreme data points, and implicitly treats the results from Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE) and Wal-Mart (WMT) the as being just as important as the results for Murphy Oil (MUR  -  Free Report), Manitowoc (MTW) and Big Lots (BIG). Changes in shares outstanding, due to buybacks or new issuance also affect the results in this measure, while they do not affect total net income.

"
2743,FDX,"Turning now to the ""worst of times"" in this tale of two markets. Total net income reported is 18.5% below the total net income that those same 487 firms earned a year prior. (It is, however, an improvement from the -23.0% they reported in the fourth quarter.) Specifically, those firms reported $169.8 billion in net income (before non-recurring items) this year and $208.2 billion last year.
"
2744,FDX,"The Financials have been responsible for more than all the drop in net income though. Total earnings in the sector are off 81.1% to $11.3 billion versus the $59.4 billion they reported a year ago. That is a drop of $48.2 billion vs. a drop of just $38.5 billion for the market as a whole. Put another way, if the Financials are excluded, then total net income is actually up 6.5%. While still below the median growth number (which would be 11.43% if the Financials were excluded) it is much less than the yawning chasm at the full S&P numbers show. The actual picture is some what wore than that for the Financials since some of there problems have been taken in the form of one time extraordinary charges, or have not even shown up on the income statement (just hits to the balance sheet taken in other comprehensive income).
"
2745,FDX,"Lets put what is happening to the Financials another way. At this point in the earnings season last year, the Financials had earned more than the next two highest sectors (Energy and Health Care) with the Telecom sector thrown in for good measure. This year they are in sixth place, behind Energy, Health Care, Industrials, Tech and Staples. Its earnings only exceed the small Telecom, Materials, and Utility sectors, all of which in normal times provide less than 4% of total earnings each, and the Discretionary sector, which is both hurting itself, and which tends to be highly seasonal (most retailers are in the sector). On the other hand, in the fourth quarter Financials were dead last as the sector as a whole was bleeding red ink.
"
2746,FDX,"Last year, the Financials gathered 28.5% of all the earnings in the S&P 500 in the first quarter, this year they were responsible for just 6.6%. Energy on the other hand was responsible for 21.0% of all first quarter earnings this year up from 13.6% a year ago.
"
2747,FDX,"The biggest earnings gains so far have been in the Energy sector, with total net income 25.6% above last year, and in the Material sector, with a gain of 14.3%. Both have all the reports in so those numbers are now fixed. Tech holds the bronze with growth of 14.0%and is the only other sector to post double digit growth on a total net income basis. While the Financials are clearly the core of the problem in terms of weak earnings, it has not been a good quarter so far for the Durables (down 34.5%).
"
2748,FDX,"Health Care is up just 3.8%, a very significant slowdown from the 17.9% growth it showed in the fourth quarter. Much of that slowdown can be traced to lower earnings at Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), which in the first quarter of last year was responsible for 19.9% of all earnings in the sector. Weak results from Health Insurance firms like United Health (UNH  -  Free Report) and Wellpoint (WLP) did not help the sectors cause this quarter either.

"
2750,FDX,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
2751,FDX,"The revisions ratio is continuing to trend up. It is now at 1.14, a reading that we generally consider neutral, but the trend is encouraging. With positive surprises running more than two to one over disappointments, one should expect to see more increases than cuts in full year expectations. After all, first quarter earnings are part of full year earnings, thus if a firm reports higher than expected earnings for the quarter, and the analyst does not raise his full year numbers by the amount of the beat, he is implicitly cutting his estimates for the rest of the year. However, we did see a nice improvement, with the ratio rising to 1.14 from 1.08 last week and 1.02 two weeks ago. It does appear that the analysts are reacting to the better than expected results posted so far.
"
2752,FDX,"Over the last four weeks there have been 3,326 changes in estimates: 1,775 up and 1,551 down, down 10.9% from 3,733: 1,935 up and 1,798 down last week. We are now past the peak of total revisions activity for the quarter.  The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.95, slightly below the revisions ratio, and in neutral territory. Seven sectors are in positive territory.  The Financials and The Consumer Discretionary sectors continue to be the weakest, as they have for many months now. However, even there, the ratios have more than doubled off their lows.
"
2753,FDX,"Within some of the sectors where the overall revisions ratio is not that dramatic there were some interesting industry trends. In Materials, paper was pummeled (International Paper (IP  -  Free Report), Mead-Westvaco (MWV), and Weyerhaeuser (WY  -  Free Report) all suffered lots of cuts) while Gas was good (Praxair (PX  -  Free Report) and Air Products (APD) had lots of increases).
"
2754,FDX,"The Energy sector again topped the chart this week with a revisions ratio of 2.22. The general story is: Upstream good, downstream bad. The Exploration and Production firms such as Chesapeake (CHK) and EOG Resources (EOG) were noteworthy for their strength. The Coal firms Peabody (BTU) and Consol Energy (CNX) were also strong. The independent refiners like Tesoro (TSO) and Valero (VLO) bucked the trend and were weak. As angry as people are about prices at the pump, this is strong evidence that it is the price of crude, not huge downstream (refining and marketing) profits that are the heart of the problem.
"
2755,FDX,"The Industrials had the next best revisions ratio this week at 2.07. The strength was mostly due to the Aerospace (General Dynamics (GD) and Lockheed (LMT  -  Free Report) stand out).  That strength was offset by weakness among the Air Freight firms, Fedex (FDX) and UPS (UPS  -  Free Report).
"
2756,FDX,"The Financial sector continues to get slammed with estimate cuts. While the cuts were widespread, there were three insurance firms that stood out by bucking the trend. Aflac (AFL), ACE (ACE) and Chubb (CB) all had more than ten estimates raised.

"
2758,FDX,"The 2009 revisions story is similar to the 2008 story. Although the revisions ratio is below one, it is improving at 0.98, up from 0.95 last week, and 0.88 two weeks ago. The most strength comes from the Energy and Industrial sectors, both with more than two increases for each cut.  The strong firms were very similar to those for 2008. One Energy firm that was noteworthy in its weakness (for both years) was BJ Services (BJS) which suffered a large earnings shortfall in the first quarter.
"
2759,FDX,"The revisions picture for the Financial sector is even worse for 2009 than it is for 2008, coming in at 0.32, or over three cuts for every increase. Revisions like these will eat away at the robust earnings rebound seen for 2009 (unless 2008 gets cut faster). We do not seem to be getting out of the woods on the Financial sector front. While the weakness was widespread, the end of the alphabet seemed to be taking it hardest with numerous cuts for Wachovia (WB) Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Washington Mutual (WM), XL Capital (XL) and Zion (ZION  -  Free Report).
"
2760,FDX,"The total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is also nearing its seasonal peak. There were a total of 2,619 revisions: 1,296 up and 1,323 down. This is down 11.1% from 2,947 (1,437 up and 1,510 down) last week. As with the 2008 revisions, we are past the peak for the quarter. The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.80, somewhat weaker than the revisions ratio, and almost into negative territory.

"
2762,FDX,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
2763,FDX,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing ""earnings share"". The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
2764,FDX,"For years, the Financials were the dominate force in the market, both in terms of market cap, and even more so in terms of total earnings. They have now been dethroned on both counts. Still, despite their current problems, the Financials are still a very significant influence on the market. However, it is now likely that they will lose the earnings crown this year to the Energy sector.  Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials accounted for 22.2% of the total net income for the S&P 500. In 2008, that is currently expected to decline to 16.7% before rebounding to 20.5% in 2009. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings.
"
2765,FDX,"Energy has usurped the crown this year, with its earnings share climbing to 18.4% from 16.5% in 2007. However, analysts expect a Financials restoration next year, with the sectors share rebounding to 20.5% while Energy slips back to 16.5%.
"
2766,FDX,"On the market cap (and index weight) front, Tech overtook the Financials 16.7% to 15.8%. Energy, despite being the biggest expected earner for 2008, is only in third place when it comes to index weight at 14.3%. Given the ongoing estimate cuts in the sector, and the estimate increases in the Energy sector, I suspect the Energy sector might just keep its crown in 2009 as well, but that is a long shot prediction. Keep in mind that these numbers are snapshots, when you should be thinking about a movie. Just three months ago, the Financials were expected to gather 22.1% of all earnings for 2008, and Energy was expected to only get 15.9%. For 2009, the expected earnings shares were 15.0% for Energy and 22.4% for Financials. Over the same time, the market cap share for Financials has slipped from 17.15% to 15.76%, while Energys share has risen from 12.74% to its current 14.31%.
"
2767,FDX,"For many years Financials were clearly the dominate factor in the overall market, despite generally selling for below market P/Es. Based on 2008 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of 14.4x and based on 2009, only 10.0x. However given the pace of estimate cuts in the sector, the true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower.
"
2768,FDX,"Energy has just taken the throne as the cheapest based on 2008 earnings, trading at 11.9x, and 11.2x based on 2009 expectations. The Tech sector is far and away the most expensive in the market, trading for 19.3x 2008 and 16.5x 2009 expectations.  Keep your eyes on the revisions. Unless the spreading of economic weakness to the rest of the world causes oil prices to plunge (and the recent trends are very much in the other direction), you can have much more confidence in Energy earnings forecasts actually being achieved (or exceeded) than is true with the Financials.
"
2769,FDX,"The S&P 500 as a whole is trading for 15.3x and 12.9x, 2008 and 2009 earnings, respectively. Based on a blend of 67% 2008 earnings and 33% 2009 earnings; that translates to a 6.91% earnings yield, which looks extremely cheap relative to a 3.85% ten year T-note. Even against the AA corporate bond yield of 5.84% it looks attractive. However, the current level of expectations for corporate earnings still implies that profits will stay well above their historical averages as a share of GDP. That would be an exceedingly rare occurrence during a recession.  The comparison between the earnings yield on the S&P and the 10 year T-note is in my opinion more a reflection of the extreme unattractiveness of long term T-notes at this point than stocks looking particularly cheap in general, however there are attractive stocks out there. It appears that the flight to quality has caused a massive bubble in the price of T-notes. The prices are hard to justify given the risk that the massive injections of liquidity by the Fed to ameliorate the credit crunch will end up fueling the fires of inflation.

The retailer anticipates profits of $1.11 to $1.12 per share. Strong demand for video games led to same-store sales growth of 17.4%. Five brokerage analysts adjusted their projections as a result, leading to a consensus earnings estimate of $1.12 per share. GME has surpassed expectations for four consecutive quarters. GameStop is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Mar 18, before the start of trading.

Furthermore, the insurer has a history of beating expectations, having issued positive earnings surprises for more than 10 consecutive quarters. WellCare is scheduled to report on Thursday, Mar 20, before the start of trading.
"
2786,FDX,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Mar 17 - 21Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) has missed earnings expectations for two consecutive quarters. Forecasts for the firm's fiscal first-quarter have fallen 31 cents over the past 30 days to $1.13 per share, reflecting downward revisions by more than half of the covering brokerage analysts. Morgan Stanley is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Mar 20, before the start of trading.
"
2787,FDX,"First-quarter estimates have also been falling on Bear Stearns (BSC) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report). Given Friday's announcement about BSC's liquidity problems, the firm's financial status will be more important than its earnings announcement. GS has not missed earnings expectations since 2005, though the trend in estimate revisions suggests this streak is at risk of being broken.
