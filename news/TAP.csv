0,TAP,"Beer giant Molson Coors (TAP) is reportedly considering whether to offer marijuana-infused drinks via a partnership with a Canadian marijuana producer. An analyst said such a move would give Molson ""meaningful exposure"" to the North American cannabis market and some of the biggest marijuana stocks.A cannabis push could echo attempts by rival Constellation Brands (STZ) to head off the plant's perceived threat to alcohol sales. And it could accelerate the race of U.S. companies into Canada — and Canadian companies into the U.S. — following a vote in Canada last week to legalize recreational marijuana.Molson Coors has held talks with companies as Aurora Cannabis and Aphria, according to BNN Bloomberg. The brewer has been exploring whether to ""invest in (the companies) and collaborate on future cannabis-infused beverages,"" the report said. Molson has been in talks with the those companies and others over the past six months, the report said.A Molson spokesman, when reached for comment, said ""we don't comment on rumor or market speculation."" Aurora Cannabis was not immediately available for comment.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLast year, Molson Coors CEO Mark Hunter said the company had a team to gauge the ""potential impacts and/or the opportunities"" of the marijuana industry. Molson this spring told IBD that it was ""working actively"" to understand cannabis' potential impacts on its business, and would ""take our time and get it right.""A few weeks ago, at the company's Investor Day, Hunter said ""we have assembled a team in Canada to actively explore the risks and opportunities of entering the cannabis space in that market, where it will be federally legal by this fall.""Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that recreational legalization will take hold on Oct. 17. Legalization of edibles and other ingestibles — which have grown in popularity — will come later.U.S.-traded marijuana stocks, like Canopy Growth (CGC) and Cronos Group (CRON), jumped after Canadian lawmakers approved the legislation, but then sold off Friday.Marijuana stocks retreated on Monday. Canopy Growth, which began trading in the U.S. in late May, sank 5.1% in the stock market today. Cronos stock, which began trading in the U.S. in February, slid 4.7%. But it's still above its 50-day line. ETFMG Alternative Harvest (MJ), an exchange-traded fund with exposure to the marijuana industry, retreated 2.8%, piercing its 200-day line.Cowen analyst Vivien Azer, in a research note on Friday, said any Molson Coors move into the cannabis industry by Molson would likely resemble the one Constellation made with Canopy Growth last year.In that deal, Constellation Brands took a 9.9% stake in Canopy to help ""identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics."" The companies also agreed to share ""knowledge and expertise."" Constellation aims to collaborate with Canopy on cannabis-infused drinks.Andy Thomas, the CEO of Craft Brew Alliance (BREW), whose brands include Red Hook, told IBD this spring he would consider making or selling cannabis drinks if pot were federally legalized.On Friday, Constellation Brands, which sells Corona Beer as well as other alcoholic beverages, reports quarterly earnings.Constellation Brands stock fell 1.5% Monday. Molson Coors stock rose 1.1%.Azer said the report from Bloomberg was not a surprise. She said that Molson Coors ""has meaningful exposure to the North American cannabis market (as the No. 2 participant in beer in both Canada and the U.S.).""She also said that a potential partnership with Aurora or Aphria ""makes sense to us as they are two of the more sizable competitors in the market."" She said that the news of Molson Coors indicates that ""a stake could be announced by the end of the year.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Marijuana Stocks To Buy And WatchMarijuana Stocks: High Times Buys Rival Publications Ahead Of IPOMedMen Eyes Marijuana Delivery, U.S. Expansion As Sales Jump 760%Marijuana Stocks: MedMen, The Apple Store For Weed, Is Now Public

1,TAP,"Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ) on Friday said it was looking closely at what it could and couldn't do within the U.S.' growing marijuana industry — saying that if a legal opportunity surfaced, ""we will do it.""""We're looking at it pretty carefully,"" CEO Rob Sands said on a call to discuss Constellation Brands' fiscal first-quarter earnings. ""If we see that opportunity within the confines of what we can legally do, we will do it.""The remarks came in response to an analyst question about Sands' broader thinking about the cannabis market, and to what extent Constellation Brands saw an opening to enter the marijuana business in states like California.Recreational marijuana sales became legal in California in January. Constellation Brands last year invested in Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC) a Canadian pot producer. Canada is legalizing recreational pot use, starting in October. Sands on Friday said Constellation had recognized gains of more than $700 million since it invested in Canopy, which recently listed in the U.S.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLegalization has raised concerns about how the marijuana industry might cut into alcohol sales. It's also spurred speculation over how it could change the way people socialize.In an effort to get ahead, Heineken (HEINY)-owned Lagunitas, a brewer in California, said this week it will launch a THC-infused sparkling water in California dispensaries on July 30. Sands said Constellation was ""pretty interested"" in what Lagunitas was doing, and how it was doing it.Lagunitas' cannabis beverage, Hi-Fi Hops, stems from a collaboration with AbsoluteXtracts, which is part of CannaCraft, a California marijuana producer.Pot is still illegal on a federal level in the U.S. Making a cannabis-infused beverage directly would put brewers' licenses to make beer at all at risk, according to a story from the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat.Under the collaboration, however, Lagunitas supplies the sparkling water, while CannaCraft handles the THC-infusion process.Molson Coors (TAP) is also reportedly weighing whether to partner with a Canadian marijuana company to offer cannabis-infused drinks. U.K. tobacco company Imperial Brands (IMBBY) this week said it was investing in a medical marijuana research company.Constellation Brands skidded 5.55% in the stock market today, after its earnings per share and full-year profit outlook missed analyst estimates. The company blamed marketing expenses, bad weather, and higher transportation costs.Elsewhere during the call, Sands said its Toronto-based affiliate, Greenstar, was working ""diligently"" with big advertising, marketing and consulting firms to figure out how to take advantage of the cannabis industry. He said the Canopy collaboration aims to develop products ""for the world market.""Canopy in June also said Greenstar had bought up 200 million Canadian dollars' worth of its convertible debt. Canopy, which also reported earnings this week, said during its conference call that the offering got about 60 new institutional investors.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Marijuana Stocks Rise Higher, Eye These IPOs As Canada Fully Legalizes WeedReefer Merger Madness: Aurora Cannabis, MedReleaf In Record Deal; Canopy Growth Plans NYSE ListingCould Big Tobacco Become Big Cannabis As Marijuana Business Soars?Marijuana Stocks To Buy And Watch

GM stock and other auto stocks aside from Tesla have retreated in recent weeks as the Trump trade war turns to auto tariffs.June sales are likely to be strong, thanks in part to an extra selling day and weekend this year, industry analysts say. The annualized pace of U.S. auto sales in June is estimated to rise to 17.1 million after dipping to 16.9 million in May, according to Edmunds. Fiat Chrysler, Toyota Motor and Ford Motor should grow sales 7%, 4% and 1%, respectively. But Nissan is likely to see sales shrink 7% from a year ago.GM sales release Tuesday will be the automaker's first on a quarterly basis since it abandoned monthly reports in April.Trade concerns hammered most auto stocks in June.GM warned Friday that if President Donald Trump charged ahead with tariffs, the move could result in ""less investment, fewer jobs and lower wages"" for its workers. The Association of Global Automakers, comprised of 14 carmakers, also pushed back against the proposals to impose high tariffs on vehicle imports and auto parts on national security grounds.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Daimler (DDAIF) last month warned on full-year profit, citing the impact of Chinese tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles.The specter of tit-for-tat tariffs from China, Europe and other key markets comes at a tense moment for automakers. Car site Edmunds sees several challenges in the auto market, which could be near a tipping point.""The strength of the economy is creating a very thick forcefield for automakers now, but once that starts to weaken, there are a lot of market factors bubbling just below the surface that could really start to slow down sales,"" said Jeremy Acevedo, manager of industry analysis at Edmunds. ""Even though millennials are finally starting to buy new vehicles, the U.S. market is virtually saturated. Add to that record-high vehicle prices, rising interest rates and historically high numbers of people who owe more than their cars are worth, and the stage is set for a market contraction.""Both industry experts and carmakers expect the annualized pace of U.S. auto sales to dip below 17 million in 2018, for the first time in years.Meanwhile, automakers are investing staggering sums of money in developing self-driving cars, though consumers remain cool on the idea.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Tesla Meets Goal Of 5,000 Model 3 VehiclesToyota: Trump Tariffs On Autos Would Undermine National SecurityHere Are The 5 Biggest Dow Jones Stock Losers This YearRetail, Energy Among Top Stock Plays As Sector Rotation OccursIBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock Lists

28,TAP,"U.S. pot sales could reach $75 billion by 2030 if the nation fully legalized recreational use, an analyst said in a report Wednesday, potentially making the industry bigger than the U.S. wine market is today.XThe new forecast for the marijuana industry, from Cowen & Co., arrives amid growing support for legalization in the U.S. Expanded recreational access across more U.S. states — including California, the world's biggest legal pot market — and the coming recreational legalization in Canada this year has drawn more newcomers. In the process, those new customers have also begun to transform the way people consume the plant.The $75 billion projection by 2030 compares with current annual U.S. wine sales of about around $60 billion, according to a chart in the report that cited company reports, Cowen's own research and Marijuana Business Daily Factbook 2017. Cigarette sales held at $77 billion and beer sales at $110 billion.Cowen's new projection also assumes soaring growth in just a handful of years. In 2016, Cowen said the recreational cannabis industry could be worth $50 billion by 2026. However, the firm on Wednesday said that ""new forecasts suggest that the market is already that size.""Corona parent Constellation Brands (STZ), for one, estimates that the current size of the cannabis market, including both legal and illegal sales, is at around $50 billion, according to the Cowen report.Alcohol appears likely to be the big loser from pot legalization. The new research from Cowen finds that the monthly level of binge drinking in states where recreational pot use was legal as of 2016 was 13% lower than in states where cannabis was completely illegal.Companies like Brown Forman (BFB), the maker of Jack Daniel's, and others have worried that legal use could dent sales.""This work builds on our prior assertions that cannabis acts as a substitute social lubricant for consumers,"" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said in the report.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs the pot industry draws new customers, particularly women and Baby Boomers, demand for products other than loose, dry buds has increased.Monthly spending among women increased 20% last year, amid ""improved access and safety"" and an increase in products targeted toward them, the marijuana delivery platform Eaze said in a report in January.Ready-to-use products, such as buttonless vaping pens, edibles and prerolled joints, have become more popular. Interest in cannabidiol, or CBD, a non-psychoactive component of marijuana, has also grown, as more consumers seek relief from physical pain and anxiety.Jim Patterson, the CEO of Eaze, said that flower, the industry's preferred term for buds, accounted for around 32% of its total sales in the most recent month of available data, according to a separate research note from Cowen. That's well down from around 85% of sales when the company, which operates in California, first started out.Cowen said that Constellation, which owns Corona beer but also caters to craft-beer enthusiasts and people willing to pay more for wine, is best equipped to handle any potential changes in the way people socialize.The company, Azer said, has ""outsized exposure to more affluent, multicultural and gender-diverse consumers"". Constellation was also the first publicly traded alcohol company to gain exposure to cannabis, via its investment in Canopy Growth, a Canadian pot producer.Constellation last week said it had recognized $453 million in total pretax gains from its investment in Canopy.Constellation shares closed up 0.6% in the stock market today, Molson Coors (TAP) rose 0.6%, Anheuser Busch (BUD) added 0.4% and Brown-Forman gained 1.4%. Cronos Group (CRON), a Canadian marijuana company that listed on the Nasdaq in February, reversed higher to finished up 0.2%.Cronos Group last month also said it would partner with MedMen, a cannabis retailer and producer in the U.S., to create MedMen Canada.

29,TAP,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and other bank stocks cruised higher from late 2017 to February on diet of rising Treasury yields, a more-hawkish Fed rate hike outlook, lower corporate taxes, deregulation and a strengthening economy.The Federal Reserve spooked Wall Street by sanctioning Wells Fargo (WFC), sending the stock tumbling in early February. Other big bank stocks such as JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup (C) also retreated.Even as analysts await some big first-quarter earnings gains from the banks, fears of a protracted trade battle with China have raised questions about the impact on the economy, Fed rates and the stock market. Bank stocks are heavily dependent on the economy and interest rates. Their relative strength lines, which measure a stock's performance against the S&P 500, have also flattened.But this is not that unusual.

52,TAP,"A quiet sea change is underway in U.S. defense procurement, one that has vast implications for innovative tech firms around the country.For the first time in a long time, the Pentagon is seeking to aggressively tap the expertise of companies well outside the circle of contractors that have provided the technological advantage to America's military.This effort is driven by the understanding that in an era of rapid technological change, some of the greatest advances that would benefit the armed forces are occurring in the commercial sector. The stepped-up interest is a potential benefit to the bottom line for thousands of U.S. companies that might not have otherwise considered the Defense Department a viable market.The allure of nondefense companies is not new. Defense and Congress every few years call for greater use of commercial capabilities. But the extent of the renewed vigor is sky-high, coming from both ends of Pennsylvania Ave. — from a White House intent on cutting regulations and a Congress intent on reforming Pentagon procurement.It is underpinned by a congressionally mandated panel of contracting experts that examined how to make the military's vast and glacial procurement system more effective and efficient. The experts reported back last year, telling lawmakers that the traditional coterie of defense companies is no longer sufficient to keep the U.S. in the technological lead when facing potential enemies.""The defense industrial base has changed, and to maintain technological advantage, DoD increasingly must leverage the commercial marketplace. To be successful in this broader marketplace requires a fundamental change in the DoD-commercial relationship. DoD must become an attractive customer with which commercial firms want to do business,"" they wrote.The press for widening the circle of defense companies comes at a critical period for the U.S. military — as it is facing dramatically rising threats from Russia and China, two nations with a voracious appetite for new technology and that cast a wide net for any advantage.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""The competitive military advantage we enjoy today is the result of capabilities developed by our services in an era of unchallenged technological dominance. That era has now passed,"" Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, told a congressional panel in May.To reach companies that don't typically do business with the Department of Defense, the Pentagon is turning to a funding mechanism known as ""Other Transaction Authority,"" or OTA.OTA is designed to jump-start the slow technology-buying process and rapidly develop prototypes for assessment by the military services. The speed is generated by slashing the Pentagon's legendary red tape, and efficiency is gained by testing technology before buying it. OTA projects provide greater flexibility than typical government procurements, and they are very welcoming of companies that have no history working with the Department of Defense. A research and prototyping project can be shepherded through the acquisition process and funded in about two months, where it could take well over a year if managed through the usual wickets.Use of OTA in the Department of Defense has increased fivefold since 2012, says Stan Soloway, a former deputy undersecretary for defense, from $400 million to approximately $2 billion last year. The current year is expected to continue that upward trend.While still a drop in the bucket compared with the annual Pentagon budget of approximately $700 billion, the increasing reliance on OTA highlights its value for a military eager to mine the full spectrum of the commercial sector.So how to best employ the OTA mechanism? An important aspect is having the armed forces look well beyond Silicon Valley to other technology centers in the U.S.That's a key reason why the U.S. Army, for example, in search of simulation, gaming and augmented-reality/virtual-reality systems to improve its training of soldiers, recently held an industry day in Austin, Texas. The event attracted nontraditional defense companies, large and small. They ranged from sizable companies such as Dell and Accenture, to small Austin-area startups such as Offworld Industries and iTexico.A second aspect is creating the right environment to bridge the cultural gap between the public and private sectors. The Defense Department can bring new meaning to the word ""byzantine."" So companies with innovative technology that have never before worked with the armed services require mentorship to ensure the partnership is fruitful. The goal should be to make the partnership easy for the innovator and the contracting office, while boosting the capabilities of U.S. forces as rapidly as practical.Potential adversaries have greater access to emerging commercial technologies than ever before, posing a serious threat to national security. OTA will allow the U.S. to tap the technological prowess of U.S. commercial firms, while making Pentagon procurement reform a reality.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

55,TAP,"Economics: When the Fed signaled two more interest rate hikes this year, virtually every story talked about preventing the economy from ""overheating."" The real danger to the economy is the constant use of engine metaphors.Every conversation about the economy invariably compares it to a mechanical device.When the economy is going well, it's ""humming"" or ""chugging along."" When it's not, it's ""sputtering"" or ""stalled.""We ""prime the pump"" with stimulus spending during a recession and hope the economy will reach ""escape velocity."" Tax cuts and more federal spending can ""fuel growth"" or ""turbocharge"" it. Money gets ""pumped into"" it.Economists look for ""red lights flashing"" because if the economic engine is ""revved too much"" it could ""overheat.""

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThese metaphors are meant to help people better understand what is otherwise a complex and abstract phenomenon.But in this case, the metaphors are horribly wrong, and relying on them causes nothing but trouble.Oxford University economist Kate Raworth says that the engine metaphor goes back to the 1870s, when ""a handful of aspiring economists hoped to make economics a science as reputable as physics.""""Their mechanical metaphor sounds authoritative, but it was ill-chosen from the start,"" she writes, ""a fact that has been widely acknowledged.""Comparing the economy to an engine means that it's made up of parts that interact in precise ways and that, if they break down, can easily be fixed by smart technicians. It suggests that pushing the right buttons and flipping the right switches, adding the right mix of fuel in the proper amounts will keep it running smoothly.The metaphor ends up driving reality, and economic policy prescriptions. Yet these policy prescriptions almost never work as intended. Stimulus plans don't stimulate. Fed rate hikes often cause the recessions they're supposed to prevent. As Paul Krugman put it, ""bad metaphors make for bad policy.""The more accurate metaphor for the economy is an ecosystem.""The economy is too complex to be engineered,"" noted Max Borders in an article for the Library of Economics and Liberty. ""It is dynamic and organic. """"We can no more fix an economy,"" he says, ""than we can fix a rain forest or a coral reef. At best, we can leave it alone.""Andrew Coyne, writing in Canada's National Post, makes the same point. ""Leave its self-equilibrating processes to work, and watch it flourish.

63,TAP,"The ""gig economy,"" RIP. Well, maybe.As you'll recall, the gig economy refers to a radical transformation of the nature of work and U.S. labor markets. Digital platforms better match workers with jobs (aka, gigs). Uber was, and is, the prototype of this upheaval.Its existence seemed confirmed. One survey by well-regarded labor economists Lawrence Katz of Harvard and Alan Krueger of Princeton estimated that the share of U.S. workers in various ""alternative work arrangements"" rose from 10.7% of total employment in 2005 to 15.8% in 2015. That's a big deal.Opinion has been divided. Supporters found many virtues. Workers would work when they wanted. Companies could better calibrate their work forces to their needs. Productivity would improve. Critics were unpersuaded. A bigger gig economy, they argued, would reduce job security and fringe benefits (health insurance, retirement accounts).But suddenly, the debate has imploded; the gig economy may be a myth. A new survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that, in 2017, the share of workers in ""alternative employment arrangements"" (gig jobs and other) was 10.1% of total employment, almost exactly what it was in 2005 (10.7%) and 1995 (9.9%). Whatever Uber and other digital platforms are doing, they haven't altered long-term trends.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe 1995 survey, the first of its kind by the BLS, defined ""traditional"" job as permanent employment on a firm's payroll. ""Alternative"" jobs fell into four groups: (1) on-call workers — for example, seasonal workers; (2) independent contractors — freelancers, self-employed consultants; (3) temps — people paid by a temp agency but who physically work at another company; and (4) contract firms that provide services to other firms (examples: security guards or cafeteria workers).Look at the table below. It shows that, as a share of total employment, these types of jobs have remained remarkably stable. Independent contractors are the largest single group, representing 6.9% of total employment in 2017 compared with 7.4% in 2005 and 6.7% in 1995.""The nature of work hasn't fundamentally changed,"" argues Lawrence Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research and advocacy organization. ""Freelancing and gig work are not taking over.""To be fair, there is no widely accepted definition of what constitutes a ""gig"" job. As a result, the gig debate can be highly confusing. Doubtlessly, Uber and similar websites have altered employment trends, but the effect is apparently much less than the perception. One explanation is that many Uber drivers regard their earnings as a second source of income, and the BLS survey counted only workers whose jobs provided their main source of income. Uber-like jobs have been undercounted.True. But correcting for this bias may not make much difference.In a study, Mishel reports that although Uber has about 833,000 drivers in a year, most drive only part-time and for part of the year. Taking the high turnover into account, he estimates that the number of Uber drivers is equivalent to 90,521 full-time workers. Even including similar jobs at other companies, that's only about 0.1% of full-time U.S. employment — one-tenth of 1%. Hardly a revolution.The BLS expects to publish more data on computer-driven job creation later this year. This may clarify what the gig economy is or isn't. For the moment, it's best to regard the gig economy as modestly adding to the economy's flexibility, for better or worse.It enables households to tap a second source of income when they need it — when they've had unanticipated expenses or the economy dips into a recession. But the same flexibility abets job insecurity. Employers can maintain a cushion of workers — temps, contract workers or whatever — who can be more easily fired if prospects worsen.It's also clear that the various alternative work arrangements are not substitutes for each other, the BLS found. Independent contractors were older and four-fifths preferred their current status to a traditional job; by contrast, temporary work agency workers were younger, more likely to be black or Hispanic, and only about two-fifths preferred their current work status.There is a larger lesson. Be suspicious of the scribbling and chattering class (of which this reporter is obviously a member). It's in the business of discovering and popularizing new social, political and economic trends.

64,TAP,"An unlikely superstar is emerging in the battle for ETF supremacy: the professor.Over the last six months, the $3.6 trillion U.S. exchange-traded fund industry has plucked several prominent academics out of the classroom and put them on the corporate payroll. OppenheimerFunds has appointed a brain trust to help generate and validate ideas for new products. Research Affiliates, a strategy and index creator, hired a Duke University scholar as a partner and senior advisor. And one college professor on the outskirts of Boston even started his own fund.It's easy to see why. With the three largest ETF issuers controlling 83% of the assets, others must go above and beyond to stand out. That means pioneering higher IQ products, like smart-beta, which shun traditional indexes in favor of weighting by other factors. It also means innovating wherever possible, setting an attractive price, coming up with a memorable ticker — and now, getting backing from an array of big thinkers.""Academics always bring credibility to the table,"" said Rusty Vanneman, chief investment officer at CLS Investments, which manages $9 billion from Omaha, Neb. ""They have always been important but probably even more so in recent years.""Factors — as the finance industry calls the dizzying array of theories about why the price of stocks or bonds moves — are used to direct more than $700 billion, or 20%, of the U.S. ETF market, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Encompassing themes like value, growth, momentum and quality, many of these strategies were hothoused within universities, yielding research and publicity.That academic rigor has proved popular with investors and issuers alike. While investors have been won over by the promise of better returns than plain-vanilla ETFs that are linked to a simple index, issuers can justify charging more for these products due to their additional complexity. The average management fee is 0.4%, vs. as little as 0.03% for funds weighted by market capitalization.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut with so many funds to choose from, the divergent methodologies supporting them have come into question. One value fund may look at a stock's price-to-earnings ratio, for example, but those earnings could be calculated on a forward, trailing or operating basis. Or, a fund could ignore earnings entirely and look at the ratio of price-to-sales, dividends or book value, says CLS's Vanneman.It's not that one method is better or worse. But based on the precise formulas, the outcomes should differ.""You have to decide that you know an aspect of financial markets in order to be able to pick between the various solutions because they are so nuanced,"" said Sam Fraundorf, the Atlanta-based chief investment officer at Diversified Trust, which oversees $6.5 billion. ""I'm not sure that all this proliferation is in any way, shape or form designed to enhance a true investment experience.""Enter the experts. Combining academic research with the front-line experience of issuers can help produce better ETFs, according to Mo Haghbin, head of product at OppenheimerFunds's beta solutions business.That's why it's recruited two academics from Harvard Business School and one from the London School of Economics to a new advisory board. The trio also weighs in during weekly strategy calls on topics such as how to construct multi-factor funds that focus on emerging markets, or the investment rationale behind thematic products, like artificial intelligence, Haghbin said.Similarly, Campbell Harvey, who teaches at Duke, joined Research Affiliates in October as a partner and senior advisor. Going one further, Joel Shulman, who teaches entrepreneurship at Babson College outside Boston, has started his own ETF under the EntrepreneurShares brand.""With what's happening in smart beta and all of these different strategies coming to market that may or may not have merit, it's really important that sponsors take the time to do this research,"" Oppenheimer's Haghbin said. ""The next big innovation in smart beta could be something that was researched 10 to 20 years ago that hasn't made it into the mainstream yet, so we want to continually have this dialogue and feedback loop.""Of course, academia has long informed asset management, and vice versa. Nobel laureate and Yale professor Robert Shiller teamed up with Barclays to start an exchange-traded note back in 2012; Wharton's Jeremy Siegel was instrumental in getting WisdomTree Investments off the ground a decade ago; while Burton Malkiel — who wrote ''A Random Walk Down Wall Street"" — is on several fund indexing committees and serves as chief investment officer for Wealthfront, an ETF-focused online financial advisor.Some of the largest players also employ their own academics to gain an edge. BlackRock, the world's largest ETF issuer, hired Andrew Ang from Columbia Business School back in 2015 to lead its factor-based strategies team, and partnered with MSCI to re-imagine how advisors think about factors. MSCI, meanwhile, relies on its own Ph.D.s to develop the measures that will work for both ETF issuers and investors.All that big-name firepower matters. Having Ang on board has helped BlackRock ""enormously,"" said Rob Nestor, head of iShares smart beta, noting that Ang's relationship with some of the world's largest pension funds has encouraged greater collaboration with them. For MSCI, research is also a core selling point that differentiates the firm from its rivals, according to Raman Aylur Subramanian, who heads equity applied research for the Americas at the indexer.But all that knowledge and expertise has to amount to more than window-dressing, cautions Duke's Cam Harvey. He's found more than 200 phony factors documented in academic literature.""Just because you have an academic affiliated with you, that's just not enough,"" he said. ""You want the academic to be doing something that will ultimately benefit the investor and the firm. If you add value for the investor, you will benefit the firm.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:AI, Robotics, Blockchain Among Hot New ETF Industry TrendsCapture More Upside And Less Downside With Low Volatility ETFsBlockchain Expands Beyond Bitcoin To Amazon, Nvidia, Alibaba

""You can't make that up, right?""RH's newer showrooms will occupy less square footage, but the company is going ahead with plans to open more locations.

67,TAP,"The biggest oil stocks were slow to join the shale boom, but they're ready to pounce on what soon could be the next bonanza: deepwater oil drilling.XOnce too costly except when oil prices were at their highest levels, deepwater oil projects now can break even at price points similar to many low-cost shale fields. New technology and streamlined processes get the credit. Consider this: Crude prices can fall to $35 a barrel, less than half current levels, and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) could profit off the Vito deepwater oil project, 4,000 feet deep in the Gulf of Mexico.Shell gave the final green light to the Vito project in April, after slashing development costs by 70%. A month later it announced another deepwater oil discovery, also in the Gulf. This isn't a coincidence. The oil company plans to boost deepwater oil production by over 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, to more than 900,000 by 2020. This comes even as Shell ramps up shale activity in places like the Permian Basin.Shell is not alone. Other big oil stocks are again looking at deepwater oil projects, whose high costs made them ripe targets for cuts after crude oil prices collapsed in 2014. Deep-pocketed companies like Shell, Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the potential boom. The steep startup costs of a deepwater drilling platform and rig mean only the biggest companies can afford to invest even as deepwater oil grows increasingly competitive with shale. And deepwater opportunities are wide open next to the crowded competition onshore, where many smaller companies are vying for land, labor and equipment.""A gap had emerged between offshore and onshore,"" said John Kerr, chief technology officer at BHGE's (BHGE) oilfield equipment unit, in an interview with IBD. ""The last three to four years we basically applied a strict diet into what was a historically expensive environment.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnalysts caution against direct comparisons of deepwater oil drilling and shale, saying they are like apples and oranges. But in general, shale drilling is more nimble. That means companies can respond more quickly to price fluctuations by adjusting activity without sinking their cash flow. A well in the Permian can cost about $10 million.Deepwater oil projects, those that reach depths of 500 feet or more underwater, can require billions of dollars of total investment. And their complex, sprawling operations can't throttle back so easily. The Vito development, for example, will consist of eight subsea wells.However, once those upfront costs are sunk, so to speak, deepwater projects look different. Before oil crashed, they used to cost as much as $1 million a day in the Gulf of Mexico, according to Wood Mackenzie, an energy research company. Today that's down to $400,000 or less.The steep rate of decline for shale well production also requires companies to ramp up drilling just to keep a shale project's output steady, driving up costs. A typical onshore shale well's output drops off 60%-80% in 12 months, said James Williams, an economist at energy consultant WTRG. But a typical offshore well has a 10%-12% drop-off rate in 12 months.And because deepwater oil plays have orders of magnitude more oil than shale plays do, costs are spread out over more barrels. Oil exploration and production company Hess (HESS) said unit development costs for its Liza deepwater project off Guyana are about $7 barrel. Compare that with $12 a barrel seen in the Permian's Delaware Basin.""The Delaware Basin is a great place to invest your money but Guyana is even better,"" CEO John Hess said in May, according to E&P Magazine.In fact, Guyana is among the most interesting deepwater basins in the world, Andrew Latham, vice president of exploration research at Wood Mackenzie, told IBD. He noted that Exxon Mobil and Hess make discoveries with almost every well they drill in the region.""They are basically going to where geology is favorable,"" he said. ""The focus is on quality, going after very productive reservoirs.""He is also bullish on the potential in Brazil, Gulf of Mexico, Senegal and the eastern edge of the Mediterranean Sea near Egypt and Cyprus.One of those areas could be the next ""super basin,"" another windfall for oil stocks on the scale of the Permian.At the CERAWeek energy conference in March, the chief exploration officer at Italy's Eni (E) mentioned the Santos basin in Brazil, saying deepwater can be profitable with oil prices at $50 per barrel.Also at CERAWeek, BHP Billiton's (BHP) exploration chief said the company is focusing on the Gulf of Mexico, Western Australia and the Caribbean.In the Gulf of Mexico alone, an estimated 2.5 billion barrels in ultra high-pressure fields have been discovered, says William Turner, who analyzes the Gulf for Wood Mackenzie. And there are likely even more discoveries in the Gulf that companies haven't reported yet.Companies don't have approvals yet to use the technology that can tap into them. But once approvals start, oil firms like Total (TOT) and Chevron will start drilling and report more ultra deepwater finds, he says.If oil is at $70 a barrel, Wood Mackenzie estimates more than 69 billion barrels of deepwater oil are profitable worldwide as well as 31 billion barrels of oil equivalent of gas.As it did with shale projects, the oil crash forced deepwater project managers to find ways to streamline.Companies used their best drilling and completion crews. The ones that didn't cut it didn't make it during the downturn.Increased coordination between drilling and surface teams helped them get the job done right the first time. Or, if there was a problem, they were able to fix it more quickly.Companies also used off-the-shelf drilling platform technology instead of costlier bespoke equipment.""The two big areas they have worked on are drilling expenses and facility expenses,"" Judson Jacobs, senior research director of upstream operations at research firm IHS, told IBD. ""Largely what they've done is become more efficient with how they drill.""The time between a deepwater discovery and the start of production is now about three to five years, instead of seven years as in the past, according to Bob Fryklund, chief strategist for IHS' upstream division.So what might've been a ""long-cycle"" project is now a medium-term one, making it more competitive, he says.Another technique gaining interest is subsea processing. That's where oil processing takes place on the seafloor instead of the ocean's surface.""What drives the costs the most is the topside, what you have to put on the surface,"" Fryklund said. ""We can now put a lot of stuff on the floor.""Oil companies could reduce costs by an additional 30%-50% with newer technology and higher levels of data analytics, Jacobs says.For example, 3D printing has improved the turnaround time for repairing and replacing parts.In the future, artificial intelligence and robotics will further cut costs for deepwater drillers.Among the big oil stocks, BP (BP) already uses magnetic crawler robots to scour for cracks in pipes in some Gulf of Mexico projects. Later this year, Total will deploy a robot to look for gas leaks in its North Sea operations off the coast of Western Europe.Tech advances are also enabling more remote drilling, says Kishore Sundararajan, chief engineering officer at BHGE's oilfield services unit. And since space on the rig is the most expensive real estate on a deepwater project, moving personnel off the rig via remote operations saves money.The Trump administration plans to open new areas to the oil industry. Nearly the entire U.S. coastline would be fair game.The Northeast Atlantic, which hasn't seen drilling since the 1970s, could be a particularly attractive spot for oil companies, Fryklund says.The Trump administration also wants to remove regulations imposed after the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon disaster. Those rules added to the industry's production costs, worsening the downturn seen a few years later.""With the Trump administration, there is expectation they are going to review some of the more stringent offshore drilling rules in the U.S."" that resulted from overregulation, according to Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group. ""Expect to see a more friendly environment for producers to come in.""Still, Flynn says, BP's disaster-related expenses, which are about $65 billion, could be a deterrent against lax safety that regulators can't provide.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Oil Stocks And Industry NewsWhy Oil Stocks Are Getting Slammed On The Stock MarketHere's The Clearest Sign Yet That The Biggest IPO Ever Is On HoldBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

You'll find that the 11 stocks hail from only five broad sectors: internet, retail, software, finance and leisure.That's roughly one-sixth of the 33 industry sectors that make up IBD's stock research tables.The point? Concentration matters.Want to hitch your portfolio to companies that gallop past the major equity benchmarks? Stay ever mindful of the strongest industry sectors that are leading the charge.That's what many savvy growth-focused fund managers do. They assess the economy, new technologies and innovations. They monitor government policies, interest rates and foreign developments. Then they place bigger bets on the sectors with the strongest growth prospects.Sharp individual traders can do the same and use the IBD 50 as their guide. Funnel your hard-earned money into the true movers and shakers.Within the IBD 50, eight firms belong to the computer software sector. They include Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Baozun (BZUN), Adobe (ADBE) and new Leaderboard name Veeva Systems (VEEV). Another six stocks lead the electronics sector. The internet, medical and retail sectors each count five names.You don't necessarily need to trade exclusively in just one or two sectors. That would be like going full bore on margin. You can rack up profits quickly when the market heats up. But if a top sector suddenly goes out of favor, you'll need to act very fast to lock in gains and limit the damage.But as you gain more experience with the CAN SLIM seven-point stock selection system, you'll grow more comfortable investing a greater percentage of your assets in the top sectors.Always make sure you are paying close attention to defense-type sell signals.

Will it be the ultimate peak? Perhaps not.Back in October last year, the leader in IBD's internet content industry group flew past a 20.98 buy point in a cup base that featured no handle. That was a first-stage bottoming base. The Jack Dorsey-led company had cratered from an all-time high of 74 back in December 2013 to 13.73 in May 2016.

76,TAP,"Health savings accounts are pitched mostly as a tax-advantaged financial tool to help those with high-deductible insurance plans control current medical costs. But here's a little HSA investment advice: Think hard before you spend your HSA funds.Some folks can pay their health care bills without tapping their account balance. They may leave HSA funds untouched in a savings account, accumulating a bit of interest. But others choose to invest unused HSA money in stocks, mutual funds or other assets, especially if they can afford to pay out-of-pocket medical bills from other sources for several years.The goal with investing funds is simple: Boost HSA funds available in retirement when health care needs likely will be more expensive and more frequent.How do you know what's best for you?Financial advisors' HSA investment advice starts with the recommendation that you review your personal finances. Brent Ulreich, a certified financial planner with Wexford, Pa.-based Hefren-Tillotson, says establishing an emergency fund is the first step in financial planning. Next look for any extra cash you might be receiving that could be allotted to an HSA, like a  tax refund. Beyond that, a hybrid strategy with HSAs is best.""I'm a fan of setting a dollar limit for what you can pay out-of-pocket, and don't use HSA (funds) for that,"" he said. ""If a prescription costs you $60 and it won't kill you to pay it, just pay it out-of-pocket. But if you have major surgery and it costs several thousand dollars, then use the HSA to cover part of it. Don't go into debt for a surgery. If it's going to put too much pressure on you, take a distribution from your HSA.""Never use a credit card or take out a high-interest personal loan to pay for expensive medical procedures, he says. Use HSA funds instead.Aaron Pottichen, president of retirement services at Austin, Texas-based consulting firm CLS Partners, says millennials and 45- to 55-year-olds stand to benefit most from investing HSA funds.""Millennials are more likely to have high-deductible insurance plans, because they have great confidence they won't have high medical costs for a while,"" he said. ""So they see the value of setting money aside to either use later or invest.""Higher-income earners who are 10 to 15 years before retirement are looking for new ways to accumulate more assets before retirement, he adds.Individuals and families can have more than one HSA, as long as they don't surpass annual contribution limits. A family or individual can use one HSA for current or short-term medical expenses and the other for investing.In this case, you would choose an HSA administrator with solid banking options for the account you plan to use for spending and saving. Look for administrators with easy access to accounts, offering online banking, checking and debit cards.If you're able to save the funds for a while, look for administrators that offer savings accounts with higher interest rates. But don't expect much. Among Investor's Business Daily's nine Best HSAs 2018, the highest HSA interest rate currently is 1.5%.If you're leaving HSA funds untouched for a long time, look for administrators with varied and top-notch HSA investment options. IBD's Best HSAs list shows details on the investment options offered by the companies.The Best HSAs 2018 list also highlights plans with strong investment quality. (You'll find more on how to select the right HSA plan and how HSAs work elsewhere in our special report, along with details on HSA rule changes for 2018.)Industry reports show that more and more HSA holders are considering investing their funds. HSA research firm Devenir found that health savings accounts grew to an estimated $45.2 billion in assets in over 22 million accounts at the end of 2017. By the end of January 2018, HSA assets had risen to almost $50 billion, according to its website.Over the last eight years, the portion of HSA funds that were invested has steadily increased, from just under $1 billion in 2010 to $8.3 billion in 2017. Devenir expects that figure to grow to $10.5 billion in 2018 and $13.3 billion in 2019.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe long-term advantage of investing is clear. While you take on some risk, as you would with any investment, the HSA balance can grow and be used at a later date. HSA funds are neither taxed nor penalized as long as distributions are used for qualified medical expenses.Bonus: After age 65, HSA distributions can also be used for expenses other than qualified medical expenses without penalty, though they are subject to income tax. But beware: If you use HSA funds for nonqualified medical expenses before age 65, they will be taxed as income and subject to a 20% penalty.If you decide to invest HSA funds, consider your risk tolerance.""How much do you anticipate spending from this account over the next year or two years?"" Ulreich said. ""If your time horizon is short, don't invest with too much risk.""If you have 10 to 15 years of medical costs saved up, you can take on more investment risks, he adds.Peter Stahl, president of consulting firm Bedrock Business Results, offers this HSA investment advice: Your investment strategy for HSA funds, he says, should mirror your other investment patterns.""I usually recommend that you line up the allocation like your defined contributions in your other investments like your 401(k), because those are the same type of long-term assets,"" he said.Read The Latest FANG Stocks NewsLong-Term Investment Strategies With ETFsThese Companies Are Outperforming 95% Of All Stocks

""This trial didn't really get very far, but structurally everything is in place for users and developers to leverage Facebook as a gaming and sharing channel when online betting goes live.""The figures that could be funneled into online advertising are substantial, with Barclay's estimating the opportunity to be worth around $3 billion. However, it stressed there is precedent for the sums being even higher.""However, if the same situation that happened in 2015 plays out whereby DraftKings and FanDuel spent 180% of revenue on customer acquisition (the scorched-earth land-grab phase), this figure could easily top $10 (billion) in digital ad (spending),"" Sandler said.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley analyst Thomas Allen believes media companies could also be in line to benefit from legal sports gambling, ""including sports team and rights owners,"" such as Liberty Media (BATRA) and Madison Square Garden (MSG).However, there will also be wider benefits, with the likes of ESPN parent Disney and MSG Networks, which will cash in ""from increased advertising on live sports content.""""Online gaming companies typically spend 20%-30% of sales on marketing in order to consolidate share, and so TV networks and sports leagues could be beneficiaries,"" Allen said in a research note.Sports betting is not out of the woods yet, as Congress could step in, according to Cowen analysts.But the firm pointed out that opponents to gambling lack the votes needed to enact a ban.

108,TAP,"Comcast (CMCSA) made its $31 billion, all-cash offer for satellite TV broadcaster Sky official on Wednesday, but any notion that a bigger deal for 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) is on the horizon may have been put to bed by a company executive.Judging from Comcast's stock movement Wednesday, investors seem to think comments by the cable TV giant's chief financial officer indicate that all the company wants at this point is Sky. Shares were up 4% earlier in the day and ended the regular session 2.7% higher to 34.26.The reason: While Comcast has structured the Sky bid as all cash, it would need to tap equity to bid for Rupert Murdoch's Fox. Further, it would have to outbid Walt Disney (DIS), which in November agreed to buy Fox — including its stake in Sky — for $54.4 billion in an all-stock deal.When asked about Comcast's view of equity and debt to finance other possible acquisitions, CFO Michael Cavanagh said on the company's earnings call Wednesday: ""I don't see us using stock at these levels, period.""Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29
"
109,TAP,"Get premium stock lists, pass or fail stock ratings and more. Start Here""While circumstances can always change, I think it is unlikely that we would use Comcast shares as a medium of exchange for a transaction,"" Cavanagh added later on the earnings call.Fox has made a competing bid for Sky and had been its only official suitor until Comcast confirmed it wanted the U.K.-based company on Wednesday. Comcast in February announced its intention to bid for Sky, sending shares of the cable TV firm down. Comcast has dropped nearly 15% this year.When Comcast targeted Sky, that spurred speculation that they would follow up by bidding for all of Fox, thus sparking a bidding war vs. Disney. Comcast may not be ready, at least for now, to bid for Fox using its equity at depressed levels.""People are taking that (Cavanagh's comments) to mean they won't pursue Fox any further,"" said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson.""But that may not be the right reading,"" added Moffett. ""Sky makes a lot more sense with a studio acquisition than without one. Without using equity, Sky and Fox together would mean roughly $100 billion of debt. That's a staggeringly large number, so an all-cash offer is unlikely. But, mathematically, it isn't inconceivable.""An independent committee of the Sky board on Wednesday withdrew their recommendation to accept the Fox offer and terminated the cooperation agreement. Analysts expect Fox to increase its offer for Sky, possibly with Disney's help.Fox owns 39% of Sky and has offered to buy the rest of the company. A U.K. regulator in January advised that the government to block the Fox bid because of media ownership concentration. But regulators could be open to Disney or Comcast owning Sky, even though they're foreign companies.Comcast said adjusted first-quarter earnings were 62 cents a share, up 17% from a year ago, with revenue rising 11% to $22.79 billion, topping consensus estimates. Analysts expected Comcast to report earnings of 59 cents on sales of $22.74 billion for the period ended March 30.Comcast said it lost 96,000 video subscribers in the March quarter vs. 42,000 a year earlier. Analysts had expected Comcast, which owns media firm NBCUniversal, to lose 75,000 video subscribers.AT&T (T) reports earnings late Wednesday.

110,TAP,"IPO stock Gardner Denver (GDI) is shaping the right side of a new base formation.XWhile the company is on the IPO Leaders list, it was founded in 1859. The company was taken private by private equity firm KKR in 2013 for $3.9 billion before debuting again in the stock market on May 12, 2017.Gardner makes industrial compressors, blowers, pumps, loading arms, fuel systems and other aftermarket parts.In the most recent quarter, earnings and sales growth increased 280% and 29%, respectively, vs. the year-ago period. Analysts expect the company's earnings to grow 50% in 2018 and 9% in 2019.According to Goldman Sachs, Gardner is seeing strong growth in all three of its businesses — energy, industrial and medical. The broad-based increase in orders and share gains in industrial were particularly encouraging, while incremental margin improvements show the company's ability to raise prices and maintain cost controls.Goldman Sachs has a buy rating and a 36 price target on the stock — about 5% from Thursday's midday price.Within the industrial machinery industry group — which is ranked No. 85 out of 197 groups — Gardner is the No. 2-ranked stock, with a strong 91 IBD Composite Rating. The rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics.After a solid run-up from an initial cup with handle's 24.44 buy point in September, the industrial company is finally forming a second base.The stock's 24%-deep cup-shaped base shows a 38.10 buy point — according to MarketSmith chart analysis — but a handle may be forming. If the week closes with a loss, the new risk-optimal entry will be 35.38. Shares are about 10% away from the new high entry, but just 3% under the potential handle buy point.According to the IBD Stock Checkup, the stock has a B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Meanwhile, the relative strength line is nearing a new high, indicating strong market outperformance.RELATED:Yes, Technology Still Rules, As This Tech-Sector Play ShowsThese Stocks Are In Or Near Buy Zones Ahead Of Earnings: Investing Action PlanRoss Stores Reclaims Buy Zone With Earnings On TapIPO Stock News And Analysis: Find Today's Top New Issues

111,TAP,"On the leading edge of the flourishing marijuana industry is MedMen's West Hollywood cannabis dispensary, which resembles an Apple (AAPL) store crossed with an upscale ski lodge. Touch-screen tablets on large, hazelnut tables display the buds' names and their prices. Clear, snowglobe-sized pods containing pot samples have a small latch at the top that customers can open to take in the fragrance. A staff member, one of many in a red MedMen T-shirt, relays customer orders via a small, clip-on microphone to a pickup counter.Big money is pouring into the legal cannabis market, potentially steering more U.S. consumer spending toward weed. And as the marijuana industry evolves into everyday consumerism, struggling beer and tobacco companies might find an avenue for new business in some of the increasingly popular products in Med Men's store: the cannabis drinks stacked in a refrigerator near the corner, or the sleek vaping devices and tins of prerolled joints, showcased in the tables' inset, fluorescent-lit displays.The trend has spurred Constellation Brands (STZ), the parent of Corona beer, to place a bigger bet on cannabis drinks. The creator of Blue Moon, the wheat beer owned by Molson Coors (TAP), wants to make THC beer. Former beverage execs have switched to the marijuana business. As for big tobacco companies, vaping devices alone could hand them a huge chunk of the pot market, a top Wall Street analyst says.Such moves face obvious obstacles. Pot is still federally prohibited, forcing shops to deal strictly in cash, even as California, the biggest marijuana market on the planet, and other states break away to legalize recreational use. Mixing alcohol with THC is also illegal. Less obvious obstacles include creating a cannabis drink that tastes like the alcoholic beverages we know and not, say, a weed fiber supplement.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, Andy Thomas, CEO of Craft Brew Alliance (BREW), whose beer brands include Red Hook and Kona, told IBD that pot is ""potentially one of the most disruptive factors"" to the beer industry, whether it's smoked, vaped or swallowed.""I think regardless of what kind of path you take, you can't help but say it's going to be another one of those forces that changes the way people socialize,"" he said.""You have to look at it as an opportunity,"" he added later. ""Otherwise I think we're kind of putting our head in the sand.""This month, Cowen & Co. estimated U.S. marijuana business could reach $75 billion by 2030 if fully legalized, indicating explosive growth. Its forecast two years ago put 2026 sales at $50 billion. That projection also compares with some estimates for current annual cigarette sales of $77 billion and beer sales of $110 billion, both of which are on the downtrend.Baby Boomers, seeking pain relief, are already buying more pot in general. So are more women, as cannabis products become easier and safer to buy in legal states. A report from the marijuana delivery platform Eaze, which operates in California, found that monthly marijuana spending last year among its thousands of users increased to $179-$189 from $125-$152 in 2016. An average-size pot dispensary draws more average yearly sales per square foot than a Whole Foods, and slightly less than a Costco (COST), research from Cowen and Marijuana Business Daily has shown.As the marijuana business shakes off threats from the Trump administration, MedMen, which has stores and other facilities in California, Nevada and New York, is trying to undo the stereotype of the pot dispensary as a windowless, cavernous weed deli.The company's stores have a bright, browsing-friendly atmosphere with staff who recommend cannabis products based on customers' preferences. In MedMen's store in downtown Los Angeles, shelves of creams, pet meds and Gummi candy line one wall. Near the checkout, wooden bins loaded with joints, packs of tea and other edibles, make up what spokesman Daniel Yi likened to an impulse-buy display.""Just the same way you shop at BevMo for your favorite Cab, the consumer wants to experience the store,"" he said during an interview in March.He said then that cannabis products that come in alternate forms — rather than the dry stuff people have been grinding, packing and rolling themselves for generations — could soon make up a majority of legal cannabis sales.Amid the influx of new marijuana users and shifting consumption habits, alcohol and tobacco companies have particular reason to take notice.As of 2016, the monthly rate of binge drinking was around 13% lower in states that had fully legalized pot than in states where it was illegal, Cowen's research this month shows.Meanwhile, Canada has been grooming itself to be a global leader for the cannabis industry. Toronto-based Cronos Group (CRON) has listed on the Nasdaq. Others, like Aurora Cannabis, plan to follow.""Ultimately, I see no reason why the global cannabis industry won't be as large as the brewing industry,"" said Cam Battley, chief corporate officer of Aurora.In May, Canopy Growth (CGC), which already trades in Canada, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. MedMen followed that same month, with a listing on the Canadian Securities Exchange that came via a reverse takeover deal.However, tobacco companies like Altria Group (MO) and British American Tobacco (BTI), which includes Reynolds American, might have an easier time carving a way forward.""Vaping is one of the fastest-growing segments in both nicotine and cannabis,"" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said in 2016. ""Upon federal legalization, big tobacco could leverage its expertise to explore the legal cannabis market through vapor.""She estimated then that big tobacco companies could nearly double their underlying growth via the cannabis market and grab around a fifth of the overall share of the marijuana industry by 2036 in a fully-legal U.S.Rather than try to snuff out the marijuana industry threat, beer giant Constellation agreed in October to take a minority stake in Canopy Growth. Bruce Linton, CEO of Canopy, said the investment followed nearly a year of conversations. Canopy, he said, was inspired to reach out after Constellation expressed interest in the cannabis market.""That was the very opposite of most of the other liquor, alcohol, wine guys, which was: 'How do we get rid of this problem?'"" Linton said. ""And so we thought that's the kind of guy we want to talk to.""The Canopy investment further chipped away at a longtime barrier between the beer and marijuana industries. But for other companies to make a similar move, they'd need to create an affiliate or subsidiary in Canada, and repatriating earnings from cannabis sales could still be difficult. Constellation Brands did not respond to requests for more detail about its investment in Canopy.The ongoing federal ban on pot is just one obstacle for the burgeoning marijuana industry, though the Trump administration last week signaled it wouldn't crack down on weed in states that have legalized it. Another is getting a precise, consistent dose that delivers a predictable high.Some bars already serve cocktails containing cannabidiol, or CBD, a nonpsychoactive but often-mellowing component of cannabis. CBD beer already exists. But the substance is unlikely to ease big alcohol companies' worries about people swapping booze with pot.""To really solve for the substitution issue, it's going to need to be THC,"" Azer said, referring to the psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol.But unlike tequila shots or bong rips, after which you generally know where you stand, edibles or THC coffee might take an hour or two.""People who consumed or who have kind of boomeranged to cannabis probably had a really bad story and experience with an edible, where they didn't know the dosing, or what's in it,"" said Sheena Shiravi, Eaze's director of communications. ""Education is really the key to that.""Eaze, she said, has tried to be upfront about products' THC and CBD levels, so that people can figure out how they react to a milligram or two. Lower-dose edibles, with two milligrams of THC, were popular last year, she said.Even so, achieving consistent taste in edibles and beverages — let alone one that doesn't resemble a rubberized, liquefied version of weed – has been another hurdle.""There have been a lot of folks in our space, the edibles space specifically, that have had trouble with uniformity throughout their products, making sure that one bite and one sip is the same as the next, or discoloration, cloudiness in the case of beverages and food, it can clump up and just taste funky,"" said Alex Howe, co-founder and president of Rebel Coast winery, which is making a THC-oil-infused, alcohol-removed sauvignon blanc.Chip Forsythe, Rebel Coast's winemaker and CEO, said he chose a sauvignon blanc because of the wine's citrusy, lemon-grass notes. And he said it tasted better than other wines when the alcohol is removed, while lending itself to some  characteristics of cannabis.But even as people look to avoid hangovers and alcohol's side effects, making that wine, he said, is far more difficult than letting the grapes sit around while yeast eats the sugar. And he said people still like the taste of the grape-based stuff that has existed for thousands of years.""We did a lot of trials in the beginning thinking that marijuana infused-wine should taste like wine and smell like marijuana,"" Forsythe said. ""We've ruled that out just from getting a tremendous amount of customer feedback on it. People really wanted something that tasted like wine, looked like wine and smelled like wine.""Thomas, of Craft Brew Alliance, said his company has held focus groups and conversations with people in the marijuana industry. He said he would consider making or selling cannabis-infused beverages and other products if federal prohibition were lifted. But he notes that pot regulations differ from state to state, and that competition can differ from product to product.""Trying to compete with weed at something that's predominantly in edible form is a very different animal than trying to compete with weed as something that's part of an ingredient form, is probably totally different than competing with weed, which is kind of an inhalable,"" Thomas said. ""And I think until we really know a lot of that it will be challenging for us to figure out what to do.""None of those products seems likely to wipe out demand for buds. Canopy's Linton likes the odds for marijuana beverages, which combine drinking rituals with the high that comes from smoking.""I've never had somebody say, 'Do you want to come over for Gummi bears?'"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Could Big Tobacco Become Big Cannabis As Marijuana Business Soars?These Marijuana Stocks With Second-Hand Exposure May Surprise YouHere's How Enormous Marijuana Business Could Get With LegalizationThe Apple Store For Weed Partners With Nasdaq's First Pot Stock

114,TAP,"Boeing (BA) said an aircraft completion center in China is nearly finished as it downplayed U.S.-China trade war fears, after easily beating first-quarter forecasts and raising its guidance Wednesday.In March, President Trump announced steep tariffs on steel and aluminum, and China retaliated with tariffs of its own on U.S. products, including some Boeing jets.""We're frankly encouraged by the continued dialogue,"" between the U.S. and China, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said during the company's first-quarter earnings call.He noted that Boeing has been engaged with Beijing for years, adding that executives are making a visit to China.He also said the company wasn't seeing any material effect ""right now"" from inflation on aluminum or other raw material costs.While fears of a trade war have since eased with China's counter-tariffs seen having a limited impact on Boeing, the country remains a key source of aviation growth and a potential vulnerability going forward.In the past three years, one out of four airplanes Boeing makes, including one in three 787 Dreamliners, was delivered to customers in China.And some 40% of Boeing's backlog, which represents about seven years of production, is for customers in the Asia-Pacific region, Boeing officials said in January.Meanwhile, Boeing is working to open its long-planned aircraft completion center for 737s sold to Chinese customers by the end of the year, Muilenburg said.Shares closed up 4.2% at 342.86 on the stock market today, after falling 2.9% Tuesday amid the broad market sell-off.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

120,TAP,"SpyGate: Did the Obama administration spy on the Donald Trump campaign because it feared Russian hacking of the 2016 election? Or was it merely a smokescreen to cover up the real reason: to keep Trump from winning the presidency or take him down if he did?As the saying goes, timing is everything. Recent revelations keep pushing back the beginning of the CIA and FBI investigation into ""Russian hacking"" or ""meddling"" in the 2016 election further and further in time.This is significant, since the farther back in time the actual origin of the spying on Trump, the less likely it is that it had anything to do with Russian involvement in the 2016 elections, but everything to do with stopping the surprising surge of Trump during the GOP primaries and beyond.Increasingly, a political motive seems not only likely, but almost certain.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn a recent piece that warrants a thorough reading, Andrew C. McCarthy, a former assistant U.S. attorney who now writes for the National Review, painstakingly dismantles the multiple lies told about how and when the spying on Trump began.There is what he calls ""The Original Origination Story"" that involves little-known Trump adviser Carter Page. He visited Moscow in July 2016, three months after hooking on to the Trump campaign.According to former MI6 British spy Christopher Steele's now infamous dossier on Trump, Page's trip was when the alleged Trump-Russia plan to hack the Democratic National Committee was born.The only problem is, the Steele dossier has been exposed as a fanciful product of the Clinton campaign and the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which hired Steele. And the main assertions were based on hearsay from Russian officials, and never validated.Even so, the FBI and Justice Department used the dossier to apply to the FISA court to tap Page's communications and, as a result, much of the rest of the Trump campaign.In doing so, the FBI broke its own rules and, worse, the Obama Justice Department withheld the fact from the FISA court that the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee were responsible for the dossier.Then there was what McCarthy calls ""Origination Story 2.0.""This involves George Papadopoulos, a young, also little-known Trump aide. At a May 2016 meeting in a London pub, he told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer about an academic named Josef Mifsud with Kremlin ties who told Papadopoulos that the Kremlin had a huge number of emails that could be damaging to Hillary Clinton.Democrats point to this as proof that Trump had colluded to hack the DNC. But as McCarthy notes, there's a major flaw in that logic: ""If Russia already had the emails and was alerting the Trump campaign to that fact, the campaign could not have been involved in the hacking.""Moreover, Democrats insist Mifsud's comments about emails referred to the DNC emails that were, in fact, hacked by Russians.But that's not the case. Papadopoulos has said he thought Mifsud was talking about the more than 30,000 emails that Hillary Clinton ""accidentally"" had deleted from her illegal unsecured home email server.So if those didn't set up the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, what did?In fact, says McCarthy, the real origin of the investigation appears to have been in Spring of 2016, before Papadopoulos' conversation with the Australian ambassador in May and also before Page's visit to Moscow in July.It started with James Comey briefing President Obama's National Security Council about Carter Page, likely sometime in mid-Spring.Why? Well, both Page and Paul Manafort, another Trump adviser, had business ties to Russia, which, perhaps justifiably, concerned the FBI.But rather than telling the Trump campaign about their concerns, or even moving against the Russians, the Justice Department and the FBI starting treating Trump's campaign like a criminal enterprise.Instead of continuing to interview Page, or Manafort, or Papadopoulos, they inserted a spy, Stefan Halper, in the campaign, and tapped its phones. It had the earmarks of a political hit, not an actual investigation.As for the CIA, another line of inquiry finds they also were busy early on pursuing Trump.George Neumayr, writing in The American Spectator, notes that CIA Director John Brennan used the flimsy excuse of a tip from the Estonian intelligence agency that Putin was giving money to the Trump campaign to form an ""inter-agency taskforce"" on supposed Trump-Russia collusion in 2016. It met at CIA headquarters, spy central.The Estonian tip didn't pan out, but the task force remained.""Both before and after the FBI's official probe began in late July 2016,"" wrote Neumayr, ""Brennan was bringing together into the same room at CIA headquarters a cast of Trump haters across the Obama administration whose activities he could direct — from Peter Strzok, the FBI liaison to Brennan, to the doltish (Director of National Intelligence) Jim Clapper, Brennan's errand boy, to an assortment of Brennan's buddies at the Treasury Department, Justice Department, and White House.""It eventually led, on July 31, 2016, to the creation FBI's ""Crossfire Hurricane"" program to spy against the Trump campaign.What we're discovering is that the investigations and spying on the Trump campaign for evidence of possible collusion with Russia appear to have begun well before the CIA and FBI said they did.And it all arose from progressive, pro-Hillary embeds deep within the Deep State and at the top of key Obama agencies, people who could use their positions of supposed Olympian objectivity to mask their political bias — and to ignore years of evidence that Hillary Clinton had colluded with the Russians for her own financial benefit.As McCarthy concluded: ""The Trump-Russia investigation did not originate with Page or Papadopoulos. It originated with the Obama administration.""YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Russia Investigation: 3 Ways Democrats Confirmed GOP Claims Of AbuseRussia Scandal: Did Hillary Clinton Run FBI's Trump Investigation?Justice, FBI Russia-Trump Investigation Just Got Even More Corrupt — Why Does It Continue?Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

135,TAP,"The stock market faces several key tests in the coming week. Can the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq reclaim key support. Can Apple (AAPL) stock hold its 200-day? How will chip stocks respond? Will the 10-year Treasury yield top 3%? And is Twitter (TWTR) now a better stock than Facebook (FB) or Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL)?The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all fell below their 50-day moving averages on Friday. Apple stock, the top weighting in all three gauges, tumbled to just above its 200-day line. Several chip warnings set the stage for the stock market and Apple struggles; now Intel (INTC) leads several other big chip names with earnings this week. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield shot up to a four-year high of 2.96%, as inflation and Fed rate hike fears mount up.Those stock market tests are interrelated to a large extent. But there's also a big question. After struggling for years as a company and stock, Twitter has been roaring back over the past 12 months and in 2018 while FANG stocks Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet have lost momentum.The stock market is in a confirmed uptrend, and the major averages did close higher for the week. But the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite came under pressure just as stock breakouts were picking up steam. The 50-day line usually is an important level, but it's loomed especially large over the last several weeks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSince tumbling through its 50-day line on Feb. 5, the S&P 500 has only closed above that level 13 times. The Dow Jones has only been ended above the 50-day in nine sessions since Feb. 5. The Nasdaq was above its 50-day for the most part from mid-February to March 21, but since then it's had just 3 days over that line.The S&P 500 and other major averages rose slightly on the stock market today.After tumbling 2.8% on Thursday, the iPhone maker fell 4.1% on Friday, crashing through its 50-day moving average and closing just above its 200-day line. No question, Apple stock was a major reason for Friday's stock market sell-off.Apple did trade below its 200-day line for a few days in early February as the brief stock market correction bottomed. But aside from that unusual market environment, Apple stock has not traded below its 200-day line since July 2016.Technically, Apple is in a flat base. But its  relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at its lowest levels since mid-February. The RS line hasn't made headway in almost a year.Apple rose a fraction Monday morning.Chip stocks set the stage for Friday's sell-off in the major averages and Apple with gloomy outlooks from a trio of major semiconductor players: Chip-gear makers ASML (ASML) and Lam Research (LRCX) and contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). Taiwan Semi, which makes chips for Apple and many others, cited weak smartphone demand.The iShares Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX) ETF dipped below its 50-day on Wednesday, then tumbled Thursday and Friday. The Philly Sox SOXX ETF rose slightly early Monday.While the stock market can rally without chips participating, it's not easy. Chips are a major part of the stock market. And chips are in so many products, from the Apple iPhone to the Tesla (TSLA) Model 3. So if semiconductors are struggling, that's a bad sign for several other big stock market sectors.Intel, Texas Instruments (TXN), MKS Instruments (MKSI) are among the key chip names on tap this week.The 10-year Treasury yield rose sharply last week, especially Wednesday-Friday, closing at a four-year high of 2.96% and contributing to Friday's stock market slide. With oil prices at their highest levels since late 2014 and wage pressures bubbling, inflation and Fed rate hike concerns are growing.On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield hit 2.99% and then pared gains to 2.97%.A year ago, this would have been a laughable question. At most, investors might debate whether Twitter or Snap was a better Facebook also-ran.Over the past 12 months, Snap has tumbled 28%. Facebook has climbed 16% and Google-parent Alphabet 25%. Twitter stock has more than doubled, surging 118%. In 2018, Twitter has rallied 33%, while Facebook is down 6% while Google and Snap are up 2% and 4%, respectively.Snap was massively overhyped for its March 2017 IPO. Facebook, struggling with user growth and time on site, is struggling with a data privacy scandal as well as Russian interference. Those Facebook woes have spilled over to Google, while both are facing growing headaches in Europe over competition and privacy concerns.Twitter has gained momentum. In the fourth quarter it crushed adjusted earnings views and reported its first-ever GAAP profit. Always popular with reporters, policy experts and newshounds, Twitter is building on its news niche with more video even as Facebook de-emphasizes news.Alphabet reports earnings late Monday, followed by Twitter early Wednesday and Facebook that evening.Twitter is consolidating just above its 50-day line, but does not yet have a proper base or buy point. Alphabet is working on a double-bottom base, just below its 50-day. Facebook has been moving higher, but is below its 50-day and 200-day lines.Alphabet and Facebook were just above break-even Monday morning, while Twitter rose a fraction.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stock Futures Signal More Losses; These Big Earnings Are On TapNot Just Apple: The Other Big Reason For Friday's Market Sell-OffThe Big Picture: Coming Week Could Turn Market AroundStocks To Watch: TD Ameritrade, Green Dot Among Stocks Added To IBD 50 ListFacebook, Amazon, Alphabet Lead Tech Earnings Bonanza: Investing Action Plan

137,TAP,"Stock futures were lower Monday morning for the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100, heading into the start of the second quarter. Walmart (WMT) reportedly is in talks with Humana (HUM), President Trump continued to hammer Amazon (AMZN) and make new threats to scrap the Nafta trade agreement. Tesla (TSLA) faced more negative headlines ahead of Model 3 production figures.Meanwhile, China began implementing tariffs on 128 U.S. products. They are officially in retaliation for U.S. steel tariffs, but coming as Trump has announced plans for penalties on $60 billion in Chinese goods.The stock market entered a correction last week as the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones tested their 200-day moving averages and many leading tech stocks suffered serious damage. But the major averages rebounded.

Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.8% in the stock market today.Keep in mind that extended trading often doesn't carry over to the regular session. Stock futures did not predict last Tuesday's sell-off. Stock futures did point to a solid open on Thursday, but didn't see the magnitude of the regular session's gains.Walmart is talks with health insurer Humana, according to multiple reports. That could mean deepening an existing partnership or possibly a takeover.That would follow several other big health care deals, including the pending CVS Health-Aetna takeover and the Cigna purchase of Express Scripts. Those deals reflect in part concerns over Amazon's moves into health care.Walmart-Humana would have some of the same logic as the CVS Health-Aetna deal. Walmart has thousands of pharmacies in its stores. A deal with Humana could direct more people to its pharmacies, boosting sales and perhaps curbing costs. Humana also has a sizable pharmacy benefit manager operation, much as pharmacy giant CVS is also a huge PBM.Walmart stock fell 1% in late Thursday trading while Humana jumped 10%. Humana leapt 8% in Monday's premarket while Walmart was not yet active. How they react in regular trading may depend on whether the companies confirm or deny talks, and whether investors see a takeover as likely.Amazon tumbled through its 50-day line Wednesday on a report that Trump wants to ""go after"" the e-commerce giant. The White House denied any anti-Amazon move was on the way. But on Thursday, Trump on Twitter accused Amazon of paying little in taxes and paying too-low rates to the U.S. Postal Service. Amazon initially fell further, but closed higher as the stock market rallied strongly. But Amazon held below its 50-day/10-week line.On Saturday, Trump continued his anti-Amazon claims on Twitter. He also hammered The Washington Post, owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.While we are on the subject, it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts to Billions of Dollars. The Failing N.Y. Times reports that ""the size of the company's lobbying staff has ballooned,"" and that...— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2018 ...does not include the Fake Washington Post, which is used as a ""lobbyist"" and should so REGISTER. If the P.O. ""increased its parcel rates, Amazon's shipping costs would rise by $2.6 Billion."" This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2018Amazon stock was down 1% early Monday.Tesla confirmed Friday that Autopilot was engaged during a recent Model X crash that killed the human driver. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board last week said it was probing the accident. On Sunday, the NTSB said it was ""unhappy"" that Tesla disclosed details about the crash. Late Thursday, Tesla recalled 123,000 Model S vehicles for a possible flaw in its power steering.Also last week, Moody's downgraded Tesla over its heavy cash burn and Model 3 production woes.Tesla should release first-quarter production and delivery figures for the Model 3, Model S and Model X this week. The focus will be on Model 3 output, which has repeatedly missed company targets, which have cut and pushed back several times.The automaker, once again, raced to boost vehicle output and deliveries at the end of the quarter. Tesla encouraged Model S and Model X production workers to volunteer to help on the Model 3. But that highlights how Tesla hasn't worked out how to ramp up production in a steady, sustainable way.The Autopilot and Model 3 woes are more glaring now because Tesla no longer has such a huge technological edge. Major automakers are rapidly introducing electric vehicles. General Motors (GM) and Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Waymo are among those planning to roll out robotaxi services.As for Tesla? Sister company SpaceX put an old Tesla Roadster into space.Tesla stock, despite a Thursday rebound, tumbled 12% for the week and 22% in March. Shares fell 3% early Monday.The stock is at 52-week lows, but really has not made much progress since 2014. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging since last June.

140,TAP,"Dividend stocks come in all shapes and sizes. And seasons.The name CF Industries (CF) recently cropped up on IBD's Dividend Leaders list, just as Corn Belt farmers should be rolling into their spring planting season. This year's weather has been uncooperative, however, keeping farmers from their fields by spreading snow, rain and heavy winds from the Gulf Coast through the Midwest.Still, analyst consensus projects the equivalent of a 476% rebound in CF's EPS to 94 cents a share this year, followed by an 85% gain in 2019 to $1.74. CF lost 25 cents a share in 2017. The Deerfield, Ill., company exited nine quarters of earnings declines in the fourth quarter. Its Q1 EPS is forecast to rise 400%.The stock's chart is not pretty. Its price has slipped 9% since the start of the year. Shares are just climbing off support at their 40-week moving average. They could be building a base, but have got a ways to go. And the stock's dragging relative strength line is not what you want to see, even from dividend stocks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnd yet CF may be worth putting on your radar. Some analysts project that the entire fertilizer industry is set for a cyclical upturn. Two of the industry's largest names, Potash Saskatchewan and Agrium, combined in January to form Nutrien (NTR). The merger tightened competition and provided the industry added control over manufacturing and supply. Consensus estimates expect Nutrien's earnings to soar 420% this year and 27% in 2019.Susquehanna Financial group trimmed its earnings outlook for CF Industries in late March, as bad weather pointed to delays in purchases of nitrogen fertilizer. Susquehanna also dropped the stock's 12-month price target to 50 from 54. The target is still more than 30% above where the stock traded on Monday.CF currently pays a 30-cent quarterly dividend per share, so the stock yields 3.1% annually. The company paid down $1.1 billion of high-interest debt at the end of 2017. Analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group project the company will pay down an additional $500 million in debt this year.Next to flashy tech and big defense names, fertilizers seem like a sleepy little sideline industry. But the stocks wowed investors with a collective run-up of more than 1,100% from 2002 to 2008. The group crashed along with the market, then ran up an additional 316% from 2008 to 2013.The Potash/Agrium merger left CF, Mosaic (MOS) and Nutrien as the leading publicly traded players in a vast and vitally important industry. Only CF and Nutrien are dividend stocks. But all of the stocks in the group vary according to several factors. One is the price of corn and soybeans. Two of the most widely planted North American crops, they also require the most intensive use of fertilizers.But the trade tiff between the U.S. and China have left corn prices uncertain, to say the least. Prices on Monday were up 8%. That sounds OK, but it is also 11% below corn's high from last July.Another factor: crude oil prices. The use of corn-based ethanol as an extender for U.S. gasoline supplies has kept corn and oil prices fairly closely related. It has also typically made fertilizer stocks an aggressive way to tap oil price gains.Between August 2006 and June 2008, for example, the stocks in IBD's Chemicals-Agricultural industry group staged a massive 453% rally. That corresponded precisely to a 155% run-up in U.S. oil prices during that same period.In addition, other factors amplified the 2008 fertilizer rally. For one, phosphorus rock was in comparatively short supply. Today, the links between fertilizer stocks and oil prices are somewhat weakened.As a group, fertilizer stocks on Monday traded up 24% from a June 2017 low. Crude oil prices climbed 60% during that same period.At the same time, the price of natural gas fell 10%. And nitrogen production capacity is now in relatively tight supply. Analysts project that this combination of tight supply, low raw-material costs and recovering demand is ultimately going to play in strong favor of the big fertilizer names.Susquehanna's March 28 note said the analysts remained ""positive on the nitrogen cycle."" The analysts continue to expect a multiyear up cycle ""due to lagging global capacity growth that should be outpaced by even modest demand growth.""CF's five-year dividend growth rate is 31%, although it has not raised its payout since August 2014.RELATED:Why You Want To Pay Attention To These Earnings Reports Oracle Chief Tells Trump Pentagon Cloud Plan Makes 'No Sense' Apple, Intel Lead Five Tech Titans That Just Carved This Bullish Pattern

158,TAP,"Climate Change: Scientists just discovered a massive, heretofore unknown, source of nitrogen. Why does this matter? Because it could dramatically change those dire global warming forecasts that everybody claims are based on ""settled science.""The researchers, whose findings were published in the prestigious journal Science, say they've determined that the idea that the only source of nitrogen for plant life came from the air is wrong. There are vast storehouses in the planet's bedrock that plants also feed on.This is potentially huge news, since what it means is that there is a vastly larger supply of nitrogen than previously believed.University of California at Davis environmental scientist and co-author of the study, Ben Houlton, says that ""This runs counter the centuries-long paradigm that has laid the foundation for the environmental sciences.""Pay close attention to the word ""paradigm.""If Houlton's finding about these vast, previously unknown nitrogen stores holds true, then it would have an enormous impact on global warming predictions.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseClimate scientists have long known that plants offset some of the effects of climate change by absorbing and storing CO2. But climate scientists assumed that the ability to plants to perform this function was limited because the availability of nitrogen in the atmosphere was limited.As a 2003 study published in the same Science journal put it, ""there will not be enough nitrogen available to sustain the high carbon uptake scenarios.""In the wake of the latest findings, Ronald Amundson, a soil biogeochemist at the University of California at Berkeley, told Chemical and Engineering News that ""If there is more nitrogen there than expected, then the constraints on plant growth in a high-CO2 world may not be as great as we think.""In other words, with more nitrogen available, plant life might be able to absorb more CO2 than climate scientists have been estimating, which means the planet won't warm as much, despite mankind's pumping CO2 into the atmosphere.Houlton has been exploring this possibility for years. Back in 2011, he reported that forest trees can tap into nitrogen found in rock.At the time, he said ""the stunning finding that forests can also feed on nitrogen in rocks has the potential to change all projections related to climate change,"" because it meant there could be more carbon storage on land and less in the atmosphere than climate models say.The question is whether any climate scientists or environmentalists — who are entirely wedded to the idea that industrialization is destroying the planet — would ever admit this.That's why that word ""paradigm"" is important.As we've noted in this space, the idea of ""settled science"" peddled by environmentalists and politicians defies the history of science, which has seen repeated upheavals of previous forms of ""settled science.""Thomas Kuhn studied this phenomenon in his 1962 book ""The Structure Of Scientific Revolutions."" He explained how scientists develop a theory — or paradigm — based on available evidence — to explain what they're seeing.Once that paradigm takes hold, scientists are often loath to give up on it even if evidence piles up that it might be wrong. Eventually, however, faulty paradigms do give way, ushering in a new scientific paradigm. Examples of such paradigm shifts in the past: heliocentric solar system, continental drift, Einstein's theories.That same thing might be happening right now with climate science.As we've said many times, evidence continues to show weaknesses in climate models used to predict future warming. They failed to predict a decade-long pause in global temperatures. Nor have various calamities that were supposed to have occurred by now materialized. And a recent paper published in Nature concluded that the planet is less sensitive to increases in CO2 than the computer models say.Meanwhile, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been conducting highly suspicious temperature data manipulation. The changes in the temperature data consistently make the past seem cooler, which in turn makes the present seem warmer.This creates a data illusion of ever-rising temperatures to match the increase in CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere.Marc Morano, editor of the popular ClimateDepot blog and author of ""The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change,"" notes that ""science is not supposed to have a politically predetermined outcome pushed by ideology and politics. This new nitrogen study is but one example of consensus science being overturned.  The global warming science establishment should now be open to similar studies and dissenting voices on CO2 to overturn the alleged climate change consensus.""But will they?With their reputations and huge amounts government grant money at stake, it's unlikely that many climate scientists would ever admit to being wrong. No matter how obvious it became that they were.UPDATE: A group of climate scientists took issue with this editorial, calling it misleading and derogatory.

160,TAP,"Online retail king Amazon.com (AMZN) plans to open as many as six more high-tech convenience Amazon Go stores this year, after having opened the first one a month ago, a report said Thursday.X Some of the new Amazon Go stores are likely to open in the company's hometown of Seattle, where the first location is based, as well as Los Angeles, said a report from Recode, which it attributed to multiple people familiar with the company's plans.The Amazon Go stores represent a significant advancement in shopping as there are no cashiers. At the 1,800-square-foot Amazon Go store in Seattle, shoppers merely need to tap the Amazon Go app on their smartphones, and their virtual shopping carts will automatically tabulate what they owe, and deduct that amount from their Amazon accounts, sending them a receipt. If the item is put back on the shelf, Amazon removes it from their virtual basket.Amazon Go store shelves are packed with grocery essentials, ranging from staples like bread and milk to sodas, beer, potato chips, cheeses and locally made chocolates. It also has ready-to-eat breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack options. The checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning, Amazon said.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is a longtime member of IBD's exclusive list of Leaderboard stocks, which investors can use to track stocks and stay a step ahead of the market. The latest breakout was from a shallow flat base, with the stock currently out of buy range from a 1,213.51 buy point.Amazon has held serious talks with billionaire developer Rick Caruso about bringing a Go store to The Grove, his 600,000-square-foot popular outdoor shopping venue in the heart of Los Angeles, the Recode article said. And in Seattle, Amazon had identified at least three locations for additional Go stores as of last year, according to one source. Amazon did not comment on the report.Amazon shares were up 0.2% to close at 1,485.34 on the stock market today.Amazon has not said whether it might use the technology at Whole Foods Market, which Amazon acquired last year for $13.7 billion, making it the fifth-biggest player in the U.S. grocery space.

NVR shares lost another 3.3% Monday.Several other homebuilder stocks are testing or undercutting key support as well. Five earnings reports this week may tell investors if NVR is an outlier or not.PulteGroup (PHM) fell 3.2% to close at 33.43 on the stock market today, dipping below its 50-day moving average. Analysts expect PulteGroup early Tuesday to report earnings of 84 cents a share, up 25% vs. a year earlier, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue should climb 12% to $2.788 billion.D.R. Horton (DHI), which reports Wednesday, sank 4% to 48.32, losing sight of its 50-day moving average after closing below that level last week. The company sees EPS climbing 15% to 63 cents, with revenue rising 13% to $3.273 billion.Reporting early Thursday is M.D.C. Holdings (MDC), which held up against its 50-day moving average line despite Monday's 1.6% drop. The consensus earnings per share among analysts was $0.66, which would be a drop of 8% on the equivalent quarter of 2016. The estimated sales of $719 million would be a drop of 2% on the previous year.Meritage Homes (MTH), which also reports early Thursday, fell 3% after undercutting its 50-day moving average last week. Its consensus earnings per share among analysts is $1.25, which would be up 2% on the equivalent quarter in 2016. The estimated sales of $931 million would be a year-on-year increase of 6%.M.I. Homes (MHO) fell 2.9%, marking its seventh straight loss and falling further below its 50-day line. When M.I. Homes reports late Thursday analysts expect earnings of $1.04 per share, which would be a 55% jump. Sales are estimated to climb 13% to $592 million.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.In addition to Pulte, D.R. Horton and other builders reporting earnings, luxury homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) fell below its 50-day line intraday Monday, down 3.7% for its fifth straight loss.  KB Home (KBH) and Lennar (LEN) are approaching their 50-day lines.However in a research note JPMorgan analysts were confident NVR's performance would not be mirrored by other companies in the group.""We do not view these results as a read-through for the other builders and remain comfortable with our outlook for upside to orders and gross margins for the rest of the group this earnings season,"" the research note said.December new-home sales, released Thursday by the Commerce Department shortly after NVR's results, tumbled 9.3% in December to an annual rate of 625,000, far below views for 675,000. But sales were still 14% above a year earlier.Demand is strong as millennials start families and look to move to suburban areas. The economy has also been picking up steam, with job and wage growth solid. Mortgage rates are rising with the 10-year Treasury topping 2.7% Monday for the first time in nearly three years. But they are still at relatively low levels historically. The financial benefit of owning rather than renting is also a boon for demand.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED INEarnings Calendar, Analyst Estimates And Stocks To WatchNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

Molson Coors Brewing (TAP) drafted a 3% gain after a stronger-than-expected report.Baidu (BIDU), China's largest search engine, powered up  6% after its late-Tuesday report showed fourth-quarter revenue and earnings above analysts' expectations.

The news comes on the heels of the proposed merger between CVS Health (CVS) and Aetna (AET) announced late last year.Inside the IBD 50, Weibo (WB) was the star of the day, soaring 9.7% on strong earnings.

The company operates a social-media platform in China.Sina (SINA), which spun off Weibo in 2014 but remains a majority shareholder, jumped 6%, also on solid earnings.Elsewhere, after a failed breakout over a 52.97 cup-with-handle buy point, IBD 50 name HealthEquity (HQY) is still in buy range from a new handle entry at 52.53. Note that HealthEquity still has its recent high to contend with at 55.31.RingCentral (RNG) turned out to be a good earnings option play as shares jumped 7%. Late Monday, the enterprise software name reported another quarter of triple-digit earnings growth, along with a 34% increase in sales to $140.5 million.When shares were trading around 53.25 on Monday, a monthly call option with a 55 strike price (Feb. 16 expiration) came with a premium of around 1.40, presenting a trade with downside risk of 2.6% (1.40/53.25). One contract gave the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of RingCentral at 55 for a cost of around $140. If the company's earnings had disappointed, the most that could've been lost on a one-contract trade was $140, the amount paid for the contract.RELATED:Weibo Earnings, Revenue Top; Parent Sina Reports Strong Top-Line GrowthMarket-Leading Cisco, Hotel Earnings On Tap, But Inflation Data Key: Investing Action Plan Twitter Short Sellers Keep Increasing Stakes Even As Stock Rises

179,TAP,"Al McGuire didn't coach the game of basketball as much as he reached and influenced his players.McGuire (1928-2001) was Marquette University's Hall of Fame coach who then went on to become a unique and popular television color commentator on college basketball games for over 20 years.""Coach McGuire was revolutionary,"" said former Marquette star center Jim Chones. ""He wasn't a traditional coach. He understood the times of the '60s and '70s. He knew how to get the most out of us on the court, and he was always teaching us about life off the court.""He'd make us form a circle around midcourt before practice and he would just talk about the current events and life, like how it was important to take care of yourself before you can take care of someone else. All that made him different.""The talks could go on for as much as an hour before a ball was bounced. He wasn't trying to be his players' friend; he was acting as their teacher and coach.Bo Ellis, a star on Marquette's 1977 NCAA championship team, said: ""Coach was an excellent people person and a master psychologist.""""I don't think too much about coaching,"" McGuire said, as quoted in ""I Remember Al McGuire: Personal Memories and Testimonials,"" by Mike Towle. ""I do that by instinct. I work upstairs, in the boy's mind.""""A player has to give all he has for you,"" McGuire added in ""Cracked Sidewalks and French Pastry: The Wit and Wisdom of Al McGuire,"" by Tom Kertscher. ""It has to be a personal thing. He has to feel a win and he has to feel a loss. He has to be willing to give up a dented nose or a tooth or a bent rib. He isn't playing basketball for you if he isn't willing.""""You didn't want to let Al down because he wasn't going to let you down,"" Chones said. ""You didn't want to embarrass him, so you go out there and try extra hard because he'll do whatever it takes for you.""At Marquette from 1964-1977, McGuire led the Warriors to 11 postseason tournaments while compiling a career record there of 295-80. His .739 winning percentage ranked among the top-20 all-time for Division I coaches at the time of his death. His .786 all-time percentage, which includes his seven years at Belmont Abbey College, a Division II school, is good for 11th place all-time.McGuire led Marquette to the 1970 NIT title, and in 1971 was named college basketball coach of the year by AP, UPI, the Sporting News and the United States Basketball Writers Association.In 1976-77, his final season at Marquette, McGuire led his team to the university's only NCAA men's basketball championship. He was elected to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992.""I know my profession,"" McGuire said. ""All my life I've worked at it hard.""""Coach knew how to manage the game,"" Ellis said. ""He knew preparation, and he was excellent at making adjustments once the game started.""Chones said McGuire wasn't as technical as some other coaches, ""but he understood that this game was about will, and whoever could sustain their efforts could break the other team's will.""Chones, who went on to have a successful NBA career, said what McGuire instilled in him most that helped him was to ""be tough, don't be afraid to compete.""Joseph Moran, author of ""You Can Call Me Al: The Colorful Journey of College Basketball's Original Flower Child, Al McGuire,"" said the coach ""was always true to himself. And whenever Al said something, he was always a man of his word.""McGuire championed civil rights and was a pioneer of making sure female sports writers had the access they needed to games and his team. While playing a game at Bradley University in 1965, an arena official decided that Barbara Roncke, the first female sports editor of the Marquette Tribune student newspaper, wouldn't be allowed to sit in press row. McGuire issued an edict: ""She doesn't sit in the press row, we don't play this game."" She sat and they played.After he retired from coaching, McGuire went on to a new profession, that of a ""hoops-savvy television analyst whose unique mix of humor, candor and uncanny insights brought a whole new dimension to sports broadcasting. … It made him one of the sports world's most enduring icons,"" Towle's book says.When watching USC's Harold Minor's ritual before shooting his free throws, McGuire quipped: ""He goes through so many things at the foul line, I think I'm watching 'Macbeth.' ""McGuire also philosophized: ""The only mystery in life is why kamikaze pilots wore helmets.""Born in New York City, McGuire grew up in Rockaway Beach, N.Y., where his family ran a tavern. He said his family was so poor that ""when we tossed the dog a bone, he'd call for a fair catch,"" referencing a football term.The 6'3"" McGuire was a star at St. John's University from 1947-51. The New York Knicks selected him in the 1951 NBA draft. He played with the team from 1951–53.McGuire then went on to play one year with the Baltimore Bullets in 1954 before beginning his coaching career as an assistant at Dartmouth in 1954. He coached the freshman team there, before freshmen were varsity eligible, to a 19-4 record in two seasons.In 1957 McGuire was named head coach at Belmont Abbey College in North Carolina.During one game McGuire was so irritated by the refereeing he took off his coat and handed it to one of one them, adding ""Here, take this, you've taken everything else from me tonight.""McGuire compiled a 109-64 record, good for a .630 winning percentage, in his seven years at Belmont. While his last two years produced only a 12-37 record, he was highly recommended to Marquette by big-name college and pro basketball people. McGuire aced his interview and was named Marquette's head basketball coach in 1964.McGuire leaned heavily on and delegated to assistant coaches Hank Raymonds and eventually Rick Mejarius, who both became successful college head coaches.""Coach McGuire always gave Coach Raymonds his props for how important he was to him,"" Ellis said.McGuire ""lived for the games, leaving practice regiments to his assistants to run,"" Moran said.During games ""stalking the sidelines, McGuire was as intense a game coach as there was,"" Kertscher wrote.He also left no doubt to anyone who was ultimately in charge: ""I don't discuss basketball,"" McGuire said. ""I dictate basketball. I'm not interested in philosophy classes.""I'm the boss. The players know it. There's give and take, but in the end I'm the dictator.""Off the court, McGuire would tell his players to ""use basketball but don't let basketball use you,"" Moran said. ""He always reminded them, 'Take advantage of your education here at Marquette because it's a short basketball career. It's only a sliver of your life.' ""McGuire announced early in the 1976-77 season it would be his last, even though he was only 48 years old.In the first round of the NCAA tournament, Marquette played the University of Cincinnati, who they'd lost to in the regular season. At halftime Cincinnati led 31-28, and McGuire had a physical confrontation with Bernard Toone about playing time.""I didn't think coach would play Bernard anymore, but it turned out he played him in the second half,"" Ellis said. Marquette outscored Cincinnati 38-20 in the second half to win 66-51. ""Bernard was a very significant role in that game and the four next ones.""Coach never had anything to say about it until right before the national championship game. He told us that he felt the team needed a spark and that was his way of getting us going, having that little altercation with Bernard and challenging him.""Marquette beat Dean Smith's North Carolina Tar Heels 67-59 to win the 1977 title.""Dream big,"" McGuire said. ""Don't be just another guy going down the street and going nowhere.""Career record as head coach at Marquette of 295-80, a .739 winning percentage. Elected to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992.Overcame: Unconventional coaching and leadership style.Lesson: Decide what you believe in and be yourself.""My personal style is not negotiable.

184,TAP,"Canadian marijuana company Cronos Group (CRON) and MedMen, a large U.S. cannabis retail chain, said Monday that the two companies had agreed to form a cross-border joint venture — the first of its kind between two companies in the rapidly growing marijuana industry.XThe 50/50 partnership, called MedMen Canada, would bring branded products and new stores to Canada, potentially by the end of the year, according to a release. The deal also would combine the retail knowledge of MedMen and Cronos' 350,000 square feet of production facilities. MedMen Canada will also be focused on research and development, the release said.The joint venture's research and development efforts would go toward developing new products, Daniel Yi, a MedMen spokesman, told IBD.As derivatives of the cannabis plant – from infused pretzels to vaping concentrates to bath products – become more widely available and draw new customers or bring back old ones, they have made up a greater share of cannabis products overall.""People still prefer flower, because that's what they know,"" Yi said, referring to the term often used in the industry to describe loose, dry buds. ""But they're also discovering new products – the edibles and the concentrates – and the trajectory shows that pretty soon, if it hasn't happened already, the non-flower products will constitute a majority of the market sector.""MedMen, a Los Angeles-based company, has 18 facilities across the U.S. and employs nearly 700 people. The company's stores — whose display tablets and clean, minimalist layout resemble an Apple (AAPL) Store for marijuana — are located in California, Nevada and New York.

Gorenstein, in an interview on Friday, said the move was intended in part to destigmatize cannabis for investors — by showing that a company could meet the standards required to trade on a major U.S. exchange.""It's something that we wanted to push ourselves to do, to make sure we have something that's investable, and let Americans know that this is a real industry and it's OK to invest in,"" he said.Shares jumped 12% to 8.75 in the stock market today on the announcement of the joint venture.Constellation Brands (STZ) last year took a stake in Canopy Growth, another Canadian medical marijuana company.

185,TAP,"Financial advisors spend much of their time coaching clients to manage their financial lives. But sometimes, it's the advisor who needs a coach.X Many financial advisors, especially those who launch their own practices, see themselves as lifelong learners. In addition to listening and learning from clients, they often seek to improve their business savvy.That's when they turn to someone like John Bowen.Bowen, 62, is founder and chief executive of CEG Worldwide, which provides coaching and training to help advisors adopt best practices and produce better results. He founded the San Martin, Calif.-based firm in 2000 after more than two decades as an advisor and head of an investment company.His experience led him to conclude that financial planners could increase their odds of success by applying the right data and extracting lessons from top performers in their field. He realized that while elite advisors face the same obstacles as their less accomplished peers, they're somehow able to identify and implement solutions to race ahead of the pack.In this interview with IBD, Bowen discusses what separates the best advisors from the rest.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!IBD: Many advisors do well, but a few do exceptionally well. What distinguishes the top tier?Bowen: Advisors sign up for being a great technician. Many of them are good at helping clients and solving a range of situations for them. But all of a sudden, we're asking them to be entrepreneurial. Many wind up struggling with the entrepreneurial model. They didn't sign up for that. They may be forced into it.IBD: Is that how you felt when you were an advisor?Bowen: I started in 1978. I sold my practice in 1998. You're learning on the fly. When I started, you were handed a phone book and told to start prospecting.IBD: So how did you learn to think like an entrepreneur?Bowen: I decided to focus on a narrow niche instead of the phone book. I thought I could add value by helping affluent people with complicated financial situations. So I had to market myself to affluent people. Cold calls or direct mail wouldn't work to reach them, so I had to find another way.IBD: What other way?Bowen: I developed relationships with CPAs, attorneys and others who worked with affluent people. It's about forming strategic partnerships with centers of influence. And I started to tap the power of thought leadership. I started writing articles and books and they helped me be perceived as a financial expert. My first book, ""The Prudent Investor's Guide to Beating the Market"" (co-written with Carl Reinhardt and Alan Werba), sold around 100,000 copies.IBD: You make it sound easy!Bowen: It wasn't easy. We teach four keys to success. Client focus — knowing whom you are going to serve. Second is practice management. Third is creating management systems. And finally you need to have a systematic process to attract the right clients. I struggled with all four.IBD: You built a business around affluent individuals. But some advisors think less wealthy people represent an overlooked niche. Do you agree?Bowen: Remember that movie, ""Jerry Maguire""? (The characters) yell, ""Show me the money."" Well, the money is with the baby boomers on up. It's blindingly obvious. I'd go where the money is. And there are more wealthy people than ever.IBD: Aside from encouraging advisors to pursue affluent clients, how do you coach them to be successful?Bowen: There are financial advisors who net $250,000 a year. And there are superstars who make over $1 million (a year). It comes down to one thing that these superstars are doing better than the others. And that is the ability to source wealthy clients.IBD: You mentioned thought leadership. Is that an important part of attracting wealthy clients?Bowen: Yes, because these clients want to work with an expert. So advisors need to establish themselves as thought leaders. Writing books is a good way to do that.IBD: How can an advisor cultivate lasting relationships with the affluent?Bowen: Advisors need to master the art of framing. Some advisors treat all clients the same. Top advisors, by contrast, understand the psychographics of their clients so that they can appeal to them more effectively.IBD: Psychographics?Bowen: The mental driving forces that drive their decisions. You have to focus on what each client wants to achieve, like a focus on the family or freedom to live a certain lifestyle.IBD: So top advisors listen better and are more attuned to each client's hot buttons?Bowen: It's more than that. (Most) advisors spend 80% of their time with clients talking about process and 20% on the results. I recommend that they shift that around. You want to spend most of your time talking about what the client will gain rather than the process on how to get there.IBD: But what if advisors want to educate prospects and clients about their investment philosophy? That can take time.Bowen: Most advisors think they need to differentiate themselves by telling clients how great they are. But it's better to make an emotional connection first with clients — and then discuss the logic of what you bring and your technical skills. When talking to prospective clients, design a series of questions so that you make your meeting all about them and not about you.IBD: Full-service advisors offer both investment management and financial planning. As the business gets more complex, are they overextending themselves?Bowen: When I started out, investments were the No. 1 concern. But today, clients look to their advisors on the advanced planning side to help them mitigate taxes and do estate planning. And then there's asset protection: Clients don't want their assets unjustly taken through litigation or divorce. Most advisors know the investment side, but don't have expertise in all these other areas. So they need to create systematic processes with a professional network (of experts).RELATED: Coaches Help Advisors Sharpen Their Processes And Woo ProspectsMillennials, Other Investors: Avoid This Costly 401(k) MistakeWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?

After finding support at the 50-day moving average earlier this month, shares are now trading 6% below the pivot. Square is due to report earnings on Tuesday, making it a potential stock for an earnings option play.Square jumped 3.8% to 46.55 Monday .PagSeguro, considered by some as the Brazilian version of Square, is continuing to extend its gains after a breakout from an IPO base with a 30.03 buy point on Feb. 16. With its strong performance, Pagseguro is the subject of this week's New America.The stock edged up 0.3% to 32.46 Monday.After testing support around the 50-day line amid the market volatility we saw earlier this month, Visa is now back above that level and trading just 3.1% below its all-time high of 126.88 reached on Jan. 29.

188,TAP,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq 100 rose Wednesday morning after the major averages rallied from morning losses for a third straight gain on Tuesday. Inflation data before the open could be a big market mover.X The market is not in a confirmed uptrend, but here are software stocks to consider for your watch list: Microsoft (MSFT), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Paycom (PAYC), Workday (WDAY) and LogMeIn (LOGM).As for the overall stock market, the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite have now climbed for three straight days. Over the next several days, the major averages could confirm a new market uptrend. But corrections often have short-lived rally attempts, followed by renewed selling. The next objective is for the key indexes to retake their 50-day moving lines, with the Nasdaq closest to that key level.Before the market open, investors will get January readings on the consumer price index and retail sales. The CPI will get close attention given the renewed inflation and Federal Reserve fears stemming from rising bond yields and accelerating wage gains. The CPI is expected to show a 0.1% monthly rise, or 0.3% excluding food and energy, according to Econoday. Year over year, the CPI is seen climbing 2%, with core CPI up 1.7%.S&P 500 futures climbed 0.4% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.5% higher. Dow futures rose 0.55% above fair value.Remember that overnight trading often doesn't translate into where stocks will open or close the next market day.Adobe Systems, Paycom and Workday are all in buy range, though no stock is a buy in the current market. Microsoft arguably is a buy. LogMeIn is setting up in a cup-with-handle base with earnings on tap Thursday. All are highly rated: Adobe Systems, Paycom and LogMeIn have best-possible 99 Composite Ratings. Workday has a 97 Composite Rating. The Composite Rating is an overall score for stocks based on a variety of fundamental and technical factors. All-time stock winners often have CRs of at least 95 near the start of their runs.Microsoft's CR is just 89. That reflects a lackluster 67 EPS Rating, but investors have rewarded the software maker for its rapid growth in cloud computing.All five stocks have relative strength lines at or near highs. The RS line — the blue line in the charts below — tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.IBD'S TAKE: Don't try to guess where the market will go next. Focus on what the major averages and leading stocks are doing right now. Read the Stock Market Today columns and The Big Picture to keep you in sync with market trends and turns.Microsoft stock rose 0.8% to 89.83 on Tuesday after reclaiming an old 86.30 entry and its 50-day line on Friday. But is that buy point still valid? Microsoft erased an 11% gain from the entry during the market sell-off. Normally, a stock that round-trips a double-digit gain means that the entry no longer applies. But given the stock's relatively strong performance in the correction it would be understandable if investors bought it in a hypothetical confirmed market uptrend.Adobe stock edged up 0.7% to 193.48 on Tuesday, reclaiming a 186.37 entry on Friday. The stock hasn't closed below its 50-day line during the recent market correction.Workday advanced 0.9% to 116.63 on Tuesday after moving back above a 114.98 entry on Monday. Shares tested their 50-day line last Friday but rallied for a gain that day.Paycom shot up 5.2% to 88.90 on Tuesday, back above an 86.20 entry point. Paycom had sold off during last week's tumble, but didn't quite fall enough to invalidate the entry point.LogMeIn rose 1% to 125.95, closing in on a 128.45 handle entry. Shares tested their 50-day lines last week but never closed below that key support.On Thursday, LogMeIn is expected to report an 87% earnings-per-share gain to $1.16. Revenue should spike 216% to $278 million, in large part due to LogMeIn's merger with former Citrix Systems (CTXS) unit GoTo.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stocks Now Face These Key TestsSeveral Key Earnings Due, But Market May Swing On This: Action Plan Why The Stock Market Sold Off — And What You Should Do NowThese New Highs Hint At Shift To QualityHubSpot Swings To A Profit; Revenue Beats, Guidance Above Expectations

189,TAP,"A stock market correction kicked in last week, as the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite suffered their worst weekly losses in two years. But Dow Jones stocks Nike (NKE), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reclaimed their 50-day moving averages on Friday as the S&P 500 index rebounded from a dive to its 200-day line.X When a stock market correction is underway, investors should focus on creating watch lists of quality companies. Focus on top-rated companies that are holding up well. During a stock market correction they may form bullish bases. When a new market rally kicks in, they may be among the first to break out.A good way to spot outperformers in a stock market correction is via the relative strength line. The RS line tracks a stock vs. the S&P 500 index. Look for stocks with rising RS lines at or near new highs.The 4 Dow Jones stocks — Nike, Microsoft, Cisco and JPMorgan — all have RS lines at or near record highs. The RS line is the blue line in the charts below.IBD'S TAKE: Here's how the stock market correction unfolded, and what your investing game plan is now.Nike stock rose 4.8% to 65.49 in Friday's stock market trading, easily retaking the 50-day moving average. Shares are about 4% below their 68.83 peak on Jan. 31.Shares rose 0.75% to 65.98 Monday as the Dow industrials and other major averages rallied more than 1%.Nike's RS line has been rising for the past four months, but it was only on Friday that it hit a 52-week high.Microsoft stock jumped 3.7% to 88.18 on Friday, closing slightly above the 50-day line. After gradually trending higher from mid-April to late-October, Microsoft's RS line moved sideways until the second half of January, when it began trending higher. The RS line ended the week just below highs on a daily chart and at a new peak on a weekly chart.Shares were up 1.1% Monday to 89.13.Cisco stock climbed 2% on Friday to 39.54, pennies above its 50-day line. After going sideways for several years, the networking giant's RS has been rising since mid-August, hitting a multiyear high on Friday.Shares of Cisco jumped 2.7% to 40.60 Monday, helped by a pair of price-target hikes and an Instinet upgrade to buy.Cisco's stock has improved as a long turnaround effort to shift from legacy hardware to software and services has started to bear fruit. Cisco earnings are on tap Wednesday.Fiscal second-quarter revenue should rise 1.9% to $11.82 billion, which would be the first year-over-year gain in eight quarters. Earnings per share is expected to climb 3% to 62 cents.JPMorgan stock advanced 2% to 110.04 on Friday, modestly retaking the 50-day line. Bank stocks have benefited from rising interest rates, so they were a little insulated from the stock market selling due to rising bond yields. JPMorgan's RS line has gradually been rising since early June, hitting new highs frequently.JPMorgan shares advanced 1.5% to 111.74 Monday.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Don't Panic, It's Just A Correction: Here's What You Do NowThe Big Picture: S&P 500 Leads Rebound; Now Watch For This SignalThese 5 Defense Stocks Stand Out In Market CorrectionThe Next Move For Traders?

190,TAP,"Stocks punched higher at Monday's open, launching a spirited rebound from what was the Dow's worst week in eight years.X The Dow Jones industrial average opened up 1.1%, with the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 ahead 0.9% each.The market last week slipped into a technical correction, down more than 10% from recent highs, as the Dow booked its worst weekly loss since February 2009. The S&P 500's drop was its largest since May 2010.  The last time the Nasdaq took this large a loss was at the end of January 2016.On global markets, China's markets were mixed as they prepared to head into their weeklong Lunar New Year holiday later this week. The Shanghai Composite jumped 0.8%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slipped 0.2%. In Japan, the Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed for a national holiday.In Europe, stocks hammered out considerable gains in afternoon trade. Frankfurt's DAX led with a 1.4% advance.A quiet day of economic news and a slow start to the week's earnings calendar leaves Monday's unveiling of President Trump's infrastructure in sharp focus. Trump has previously said he aims to leverage $200 billion in federal funds into a $1.5 trillion building program.Infrastructure stocks likely to move on the news could include a wide array of construction names and materials suppliers. Among the most pure-play infrastructure stocks are the big engineering names such as Jacobs Engineering (JEC), Mastec (MTZ) and Quanta Services (PWR), as well as aggregates suppliers including Martin Marietta (MLM), Vulcan (VMC) and Summit Materials (SUM).Oil and commodities could also factor into Monday's trade. Crude posted an early rebound, as U.S. benchmark oil jumped 1.2% to trade just below the $60 per barrel mark. Silver and copper both rose more than 1% in early action.IBD'S TAKE: A correcting market is not a time to buy growth stocks, but it is the perfect time to build a watch list of leading stocks, near buy points in valid bases. The market will eventually post a follow-through day and launch a fresh uptrend. When it does, you want to have your shopping list of well-vetted stocks ready to go.Nearly all 30 Dow components rose at the start of trade. Cisco Systems (CSCO) led, up 3%. The company received a price target increase to 46, from 33, and an upgrade to buy from neutral, from Instinet. RBC Capital raised the stock's price target to 44, from 40.American Express (AXP) advanced 1.7% after an upgrade to buy, from neutral, by Nomura.Earnings news stirred some action early Monday, as payment solutions provider First Data (FDC) bolted 4.7% higher after its fourth-quarter earnings met analysts' views, and revenue was slightly higher than expected. The stock took an 8% loss last week and broke support, killing a three-month basing effort.Restaurant Brands International (QSR) popped 6.9% following mixed fourth-quarter results. The owner of the Burger King and Tim Horton's chains as well as Popeye's, the company's smallest chain, reported a surprise 11% gain in revenue, and the company announced a $742 million deferred tax benefit.China-based Vipshop Holdings (VIPS) jumped 2.9% before the open, and ahead of its fourth-quarter report which is due after the close. The online retail leader has pulled back 13% from its Jan. 26 high, leaving its Relative Strength line a notch off its high.Other China-based names were also positive, with Weibo (WB), TAL Education (TAL) and Sina (SINA) all posted early gains near 2%. Sina and Weibo report earnings this week.Apple (AAPL) pounded out a 1.4% advance and Netflix (NFLX) led the FANG stock tech leaders with a 2.3% gain.Computer tech services contractor CSRA (CSRA) spiked 31% after General Dynamics (GD) agreed to buy the Falls Church, Va., company in a $6.8 billion deal.  The deal allows General Dynamics to better tap a pending surge in federal upgrade of IT security and cloud-computing operations. General Dynamics was down 1%, and just below a 211.85 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.21st Century Fox (FOX) climbed 2.9% following news reports that Comcast (CMCSA) was contemplating a refreshed bid for the company's film and television assets. Fox accepted a $52.4 billion takeover bid from Walt Disney (DIS) in December, after rejecting Comcast's offer of more than $60 billion, on grounds that regulators would block the combination. Comcast shares rose 1.1%.Disney shares rose 1.5% after the company announced it was raising the admission price to its Disney World and Disneyland theme parks. Theme park revenues provided the bulwark gains that led to the company's fourth-quarter earning beat. Disney shares ended Friday down 9% below their Jan. 3 high, but still in a valid cup-with-handle base.Oracle (ORCL) climbed more than 1%, after announcing plans for 12 new massive data centers in a move to better compete with Amazon.com, Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) in the cloud-computing market.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Don't Panic, It's Just A Correction: Here's What You Do NowThese 5 Defense Stocks Stand Out In Market CorrectionThe Big Picture: S&P 500 Leads Rebound; Now Watch For This SignalThese 4 Dow Stocks Reclaimed Key Support In Tough MarketThis Shock Economic Outlook May Keep Stock Market On Edge

191,TAP,"Apple (AAPL) is expected to deliver solid earnings growth for the December-ending fiscal first quarter on Thursday. But several analysts expect Apple to guide lower for the current March quarter due to weakening iPhone X demand. But what is the stock chart telling us right now?X Apple should report a 14% earnings per share gain to $3.82 with revenue climbing 10% to $86.02 billion. For Q2, the consensus is for year-over-year growth to accelerate, with EPS up 38% to $2.10 and sales swelling 26% to $66.54 billion. But some see sales as low as $62 billion.Shares of the Dow Jones industrial average component fell 3.9% in last week's stock market trading to 171.51. The stock fell below a flat-base buy point of 176.34 and its 50-day moving average in the heaviest weekly volume since the week ended Nov. 3.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index advanced 2.2% last week to a record high. That big divergence between the S&P 500 and the world's most valuable company underscored Apple's current status as a lagging stock, not a leader. Apple shares fell 2.1% to 167.96 on Monday, turning slightly negative for 2018.The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been trending lower since early November. Even as the stock cleared its buy point several times in recent weeks, the RS was well off its highs. The RS line (the blue line in the chart below), sank to its lowest level since June.Apple retreated 0.6% Tuesday to close at 166.97, falling intraday to its lowest level in nearly three months. The RS line rose slightly as Apple fell a little less than the S&P 500, which fell 1.1%.Investors should be looking for stocks with RS lines that lead or confirm breakouts.Apple's weakness is backed up by trouble with iPhone-related stock plays, including Apple chipmakers and companies involved in the OLED screens used in the iPhone X and other high-end electronic devices. However, Qorvo (QRVO) shares did jump 3.6% on Tuesday, retaking its 50-day moving average ahead of its earnings Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Apple bulls are hoping that the iPhone giant will deliver standout holiday quarter results and offer guidance that's strong or at least not as bad as many analysts fear. If so, Apple shares could rally. But it's dangerous for investors to try to prove that they know better than the collective knowledge of the market. The way to outperform the broader averages consistently is to listen to what the market is saying right now.And right now — not last year, not two weeks in the future — the market is cool on Apple.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stocks Soar; These 5 Mega-Cap Techs Are On DeckThese 7 Stocks With 99 Composite Ratings Have Earnings This WeekFacebook, Apple, Amazon To Grab Earnings Spotlight: Investing Action PlanThese 3 Top Stocks Are Near Buy Points; This Leader Just Broke OutThese Four IBD 50 Tech Stocks Are In Buy RangeEarnings Preview: Will FANG Names, Other Hot Growth Stocks Deliver Stellar Results?

195,TAP,"The major stock indexes were modestly higher heading into the close after briefly turning negative following the Federal Reserve's policy meeting. The central bank left its key lending rate unchanged at 1.25% to 1.5%, but made slightly more hawkish comments about inflation.Before the meeting futures traders saw a 75% chance for a quarter-point hike at the March meeting to 1.50% to 1.75%. After the decision and statement, traders now see an 82% chance.

About two-thirds said yes.El-Erian pointed to synchronized global economic growth, with deregulation and tax reform in the U.S., improvement in Europe and emerging markets' continued strength. Given these factors, he thinks there could be further growth ahead.But there are potential risks, he warns, including geopolitics, central bank policies and possible liquidity issues in emerging markets and high-yield bonds.

199,TAP,"BlackRock (BLK) isn't satisfied being a titan among asset managers. It seeks to follow Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) strategy, by buying and holding stakes in other companies.X BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is looking to raise more than $10 billion in its first-ever attempt at such direct investments, following a model laid out by Berkshire's Warren Buffett, The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday. BlackRock has more than $6.29 trillion in global assets under management.The move would come as Berkshire plans for the eventual retirement of investing icon Buffett. Two longtime insiders, Gregory Abel and Ajit Jain, were appointed to the board last month, with Buffett signaling that one of them may eventually succeed him.Making direct investment would also pit Fink against private-equity giants — including his former company, Blackstone Group (BX). Fink co-founded BlackRock as a unit of Blackstone in 1988 but separated from the firm in 1994, the Journal added.BlackRock's growing iShares ETF business has more than $1.5 trillion in assets under management. While exchange traded funds are traditionally low-cost and index-tracking, they have seen further drops in fees in recent years, compelling firms like BlackRock to attempt to look for new sources of revenue, the Journal said.Against that backdrop, private equity firms and asset managers are seen competing for higher-fee investing products.On the stock market today, shares of BlackRock fell 4.25% to 509.63, tumbling below their 50-day moving average as the stock market sold off sharply Berkshire's class B shares dropped 4.2%, Blackstone lost 0.6%, Carlyle Group (CG) sold off 4.6%, and Apollo Global Management (APO) skidded 5.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Don't try to guess the market's next move. Read The Big Picture every day to understand the action of the major averages and leading stocks.BlackRock is tapping sovereign-wealth funds, pensions and other wealthy investors to launch a new vehicle, BlackRock Long-Term Private Capital, sources told the Journal, which reviewed a fundraising document that says the ""best example"" of BlackRock's approach with this new vehicle is Berkshire Hathaway, famous for its long-term ownership of companies.BlackRock plans to make investments ranging from $500 million to $2 billion in companies that tap ""long-term themes"" such as diverging global demographics, a growing middle class in emerging markets, and changing patterns in millennial spending. The vehicle is targeting annual returns in the low to mid teens, and plans to hold its positions for more than 10 years.Potential acquisitions include minority stakes in publicly traded companies, as well as family-owned businesses and spinoffs. Mark Wiseman, a potential successor to Fink, is overseeing the new venture.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Will Market Repeat Its 2011 Bear Market?How To Spot The Next Major Stock Market Peak: Here Is The Easy WayDow Jones Suffers Worst Point Drop Ever, But Percentage Loss Is Not HistoricTime To Review Your Stock-Selling SmartsAnatomy Of A Chart: Breaking Down The Buy And Sell ZonesIs It Time To Get Into — Or Out Of — The Stock Market?

201,TAP,"Boeing (BA) on Tuesday announced more than $900 million in service orders with Asian airlines and other companies at the Singapore Airshow, while the jet maker was reportedly competing with Airbus (EADSY) for a massive order from the Indian airline Vistara.X The jostling comes as the aviation industry tries to tap a rapidly growing and competitive travel market in Asia and more carriers weigh options for additional long-haul flights. Those moves could pit other carriers against the likes of global airlines like Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) internationally.Demand for Asia-Pacific carriers jumped 9.4% last year, as the economy expands and travelers enjoy a broader array of route options, the International Air Transport Association said last week. The region makes up a third of Airbus' new business, the company said.Vistara, an affiliate of Singapore Airlines, was negotiating with the two jet makers to buy up to $8.5 billion worth of new planes — an order likely to consist of 50 narrow-body, short-haul jets and as many as 10 wide-body jets, sources told Bloomberg.The new jets, according to the report, would allow Vistara to offer flights to areas like New York and London.For the narrow-body planes, Bloomberg said, Vistara would likely be deciding between the Airbus A321neo and Boeing's 737 Max — the companies' more fuel-efficient, single-aisle workhorses — and Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A330neo for the wide-body planes.Airbus, at the airshow on Tuesday, also said it was looking ""very, very closely"" at whether it should boost production rates of its single-aisle A320s as air-travel demand jumps in nations like China and India.Shares of Boeing were up 3.7% on the stock market today, and Airbus rose 3.3%. Delta gained 1.1%, American 2.85% and United 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Meanwhile, the orders announced by Boeing were for parts, engineering and maintenance, training and professional services, and digital aviation and analytics, the company said.Among them, Royal Brunei Airlines signed an agreement for five overhead flight crew rest retrofits on 787-8 Dreamliners. The modifications, Boeing said, ""will allow the carrier to fly the 787-8 airplanes on long-haul routes, providing increased operations flexibility to the fleet and operator.""China Southern Airlines (ZNH), Malaysia Airlines, Singapore Airlines and All Nippon Airways were among the regional airline or aviation firms that placed orders with Boeing.

206,TAP,"Defense earnings are on tap this week after the Pentagon announced a shift in focus from fighting terrorism to near-peer threats but quarterly results and guidance will be dominated by recent tax cuts.X General Dynamics (GD) will kick off Q4 results on Wednesday with Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN) on tap for Thursday and in an unusual move Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) will report the following week.""In general this quarter will be fairly noisy with tax reform, with companies coming out and providing information on how that will impact them going forward,"" said Jeff Windau, senior equity analyst at Edward Jones. ""There will be some charges (to earnings) and some noise that will be a little challenging to look through that to see what the outlook is for the rest of the year.""Last week, the Pentagon released the 2018 National Defense Strategy with a shift in focus to ""great power competition"" instead of terrorism, prioritizing high end weapons like Lockheed's F-35 fifth-generation fighter and the nuclear recapitalization program.""I think clearly the fundamentals still remain longer term very positive and .... the National Defense Strategy release last Friday points to helping build the political foundation for budget increases in highly specialized areas of investment"" like space and unmanned systems, said Ken Herbert, managing director at Canaccord Genuity.While the strategy lays out long-term spending priorities, the Defense Department still doesn't have a budget yet for 2018 and Congress continues to lurch through short-term budgets that carry over prior spending levels. Herbert expects ""timing around fiscal '18 budget will continue to be a headwind and negative overhang.""On Wednesday, General Dynamics reported adjusted EPS, excluding the impact of tax reform, up 32.3% to $2.50, beating analyst exceptions.  Revenue rose 8.1% to $8.3 billion, but fell short.Northrop reports early Thursday, and EPS is seen climbing 3.4% to $2.75 with revenue dipping 0.4% to $6.37 billion. Analysts would like to get answers about the failed deployment of Northrop's Zuma satellite, but so far the company has kept quiet about the launch earlier this month, citing the classified nature of the mission.Little is known about the Zuma satellite except that Northrop made it for a government customer and it was supposed to be launched into low Earth orbit. But sources told Bloomberg that the Falcon 9's second stage failed, with both the satellite and the second-stage booster falling into the ocean.Raytheon also reports early Thursday, and analysts see EPS up 7.4% to $2.02 with revenue climbing 9.6% to $6.83 billion. Missile defense sales are in the spotlight as international partners like Romania and Poland look to beef up defenses against Russia with new Raytheon-built Patriot systems.In general, ""international sales will be asked about a lot because that's been very strong,"" Canaccord's Herbert said, as the Trump administration has pushed for more foreign sales vs. prior administrations.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.While Lockheed is typically the first defense contractor to report, its results come out next week, on Jan. 29. EPS is seen jumping 25% to $4.06 with revenue up 7.3% to $14.75 billion.With international demand for Raytheon's missile-defense products rising, sales of Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system will also be scrutinized.Windau also expects more commentary on F-35 production, as it ramps up to full tilt, as well as progress on cutting costs. Last week, the State Department gave Belgium approval to purchase 34 F-35s valued at $6.53 billion to replace its Lockheed F-16s.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

207,TAP,"In the true spirit of an entrepreneur, Chris Rondeau followed his passion for hard work and risk taking to help build Planet Fitness (PLNT) into a company that has turned the health club industry on its head.Rondeau, who became CEO of Planet Fitness in January 2013, joined the company while he was in college working at the front desk of the gym in 1993, a year after the company was founded by brothers Michael and Marc Grondahl.And he's been at Planet Fitness ever since, working his way up as a club manager, then regional manager of several locations. In 2003, he became a partner with the founders and chief operating officer. When Rondeau became CEO, he replaced Michael Grondahl, who has since left the company.Drawing on the leadership principles shaped by his various positions at Planet Fitness and by lessons he gleaned from his father, Rondeau played a major role helping the founders develop and refine the business model that has helped grow the business into a mighty contender in the fitness industry.Rondeau learned about being an entrepreneur from his father, who dropped out of high school but eventually owned and operated several pharmacies throughout Massachusetts while Rondeau was growing up.""As a child growing up I saw him working hard,"" Rondeau told IBD. ""I got my work ethic from him.""""The one thing my father taught me is I could do anything I set my mind to,"" he added. ""Coming from him without a high school education, he was living proof.""That lesson came into play when Rondeau and the Planet Fitness founders revamped the traditional health club environment aimed at fitness buffs to one that caters to first-time gymgoers with a non-intimidating, low-cost business model.Rondeau says over 40% of current Planet Fitness members had never gone to a gym before signing up at Planet Fitness.""The key to success in business is not to be afraid of doing things differently,"" said Rondeau. ""Don't be afraid of going against the grain. When you think of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone, people didn't realize there was anything better than the flip phones that were offered to them by every phone company out there. Apple wasn't afraid to abandon the flip phone and the competition by creating something new.""Similarly, Rondeau and the founders of Planet Fitness went against the grain and created a completely different gym experience than what was in the industry. People didn't realize the experience and affordability they were missing until Planet Fitness created it.Rondeau and the founders not only created an innovative new business model, they also transformed Planet Fitness into a major force in its space.""Planet Fitness is exceptionally competitive because of its national footprint and growing awareness of its different approach to the market aimed at non-gymgoers,"" Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen told IBD. ""It's a business model that's revolutionized fitness because of the attractiveness of this model to a wide market and low price. It's offering a very premium gym experience at a low price.""Planet Fitness is one of the largest owners and operators of health clubs in the U.S. in terms of the number of members and locations, Dorvin Lively, president and CFO of Planet Fitness, told IBD.It boasts over 10.5 million members, up from 7 million at the end of 2012, just before Rondeau took the helm. And it has 1,500 locations nationwide. Over 95% of its stores are owned and operated by franchisees.""We are clearly opening more health clubs in the U.S. at a faster rate than anyone,"" Lively said. ""We've opened roughly 200 stores a year for the past three years.""On the financial front, he adds, Planet Fitness has had 43 straight quarters of positive same-store sales.""That's 10 years plus three quarters,"" Lively pointed out. In the 2017 third quarter, same-store sales jumped 9.3% from a year earlier and revenue climbed 12.1%.Another reflection of Planet Fitness' financial success is that over 95% of its stores opened in the last three years were opened by existing franchisees and more than 90% of all of the new territory being sold has been sold to existing franchisees, Lively says.""That proves that the brand is growing and the profitability is there, and franchisees want to continue to invest in their businesses in their local markets to grow the brand,"" he added.Rondeau, 44, grew up in Methuen, Mass. He started busing tables and dishwashing at age 14, and at 16 he got a job working at his father's pharmacy business. But at age 19 Rondeau told his father he didn't want to work for him anymore because he decided he wanted to work at a gym — Planet Fitness.Eventually, Rondeau dropped out of college — the University of New Hampshire — to work full time at Planet Fitness, and earned an associate degree rather than a bachelor's degree.Why did he opt to stay at Planet Fitness?""Unfortunately, I was never one for school, yet I loved to work, and haven't stopped since my first job busing tables and dishwashing at the age of 14,"" Rondeau said. ""Planet Fitness is only the third job I ever had. I liked fitness and I liked the work environment at a gym, meaning it's a positive atmosphere, and we were doing good things. I believed we were onto something special with making fitness affordable and comfortable for the masses. So I stayed, followed my passion, and chose not to pursue my bachelor's degree.""Moving up through the ranks at Planet Fitness helped Rondeau become a better leader.""The lesson I learned from being in various jobs at Planet Fitness is being able to put yourself in the mindset of your customers and understand how they're thinking. And that allows you to service them better and market the business better,"" Rondeau said.That lesson helped Rondeau and the founders design the new business model.""In high school and college, exercise was my passion,"" he said. ""As I continued to get older into my late 20s it started to become more of a chore that I had to do for health and wellness vs. a hobby.""Rondeau says that the founders shared his feelings about exercising becoming a chore as they got older with more ""responsibilities on their plates.""As they built the business, that attitude about exercise helped the three of them better understand what the average person goes through when joining the gym, he adds.Today, given his responsibilities, Rondeau says he works out more for ""mental focus and energy.""Rondeau came in on the ground floor of building the business.When he joined Planet Fitness, it was struggling as it faced heavy competition for the same customer as the other gyms in their small town in New Hampshire — those who already had a gym membership.Rondeau and the founders saw an opportunity to move in a different direction than the rest of the pack.As Rondeau and the founders looked at the industry, they saw that 80% of the population didn't have a gym membership.""We thought to ourselves 'how do we come up with a model that is affordable and comfortable that would motivate the 80% to give fitness a try?' ""The answer: Change the gym environment and create what the company calls a ""Judgement Free Zone,"" where there was no ""intimidation"" and members are accepted and respected for who they are.""The founders are truly visionaries,"" he adds. ""We didn't have juice bars or heavy free weights. We have free pizza once a month for members and free Tootsie Rolls at the front desk. We have a very unorthodox business.""They unveiled the judgment-free philosophy and the discount business model with a $10 monthly membership in 1997. In 2003, they started franchising. Over 95% of its stores are owned and operated by franchisees.""Today, with our size and scale, we are a marketing machine that happens to be in the gym business,"" he said. ""We're a franchise business, and the franchisees are required to spend 7% of their membership dues on marketing locally and an additional 2% of membership dues support the national marketing efforts. When you think about the marketing spending, every incremental member is 9% more dollars spent on marketing. Our budget continues to expand. Every day we sell memberships, it allows us to tap into the 80% of the population that doesn't have a gym membership.""Rondeau has nurtured a culture where both corporate and franchisees share the same passion for the brand and the company's goals.""It's truly important that both the corporate staff and franchisees wholeheartedly believe in the judgment-free zone,"" said Rondeau. ""A lot of our staff and franchisees have been members of our clubs, and they've seen and experienced the judgment-free zone firsthand and they believe in it. That culture keeps us grounded and doesn't allow us to get diluted as we continue to scale. We all have a common belief to make fitness comfortable, affordable and accessible to the first-time gym user.""Added Lively: ""He has developed and built a corporate culture where he's able to bridge the gap and be the leader of the franchisees at the same time.""Rondeau says he looks at the franchisees as part of the team.""If I can gain their respect and they have my passion, then they'll do right for our members,"" he adds. ""I always tell my staff we're in a unique business with two sets of customers — our franchisees and our members. If we can make our franchisees a happy customer, then that will trickle down to our members. I have a very collaborative and open relationship with franchisees. We have about 200 different franchisee groups. I look at that as an asset. Our franchisees bring me ideas and thoughts on how to fine-tune the business and we work collaboratively.""Rondeau says an important part of his growth strategy since becoming CEO, one that's been even more important since he took the company public in August 2015, is the use of more data analytics than before.Rondeau points out that Planet Fitness has locations in every state, every demographic and every ethnicity and over 10.5 million members.""The data we're able to hone allow us to fine-tune the business, drive same-store sales, drive store openings and better service the franchisees.""For example, because Planet Fitness is membership based, by analyzing certain data they know how far people are willing to drive to a gym.""This insight allows us to know where the next gym location should go,"" he added.Through data analytics, the company can better segment its marketing according to certain demographic groups. For example, because the company knows the names, ages and sex of its members, it knows that 49% of its 10.5 million members are millennials.Analyst Chen rates Planet Fitness stock an outperform.""We feel Planet Fitness is 'un-Amazonable' because health and wellness can't yet be purchased online,"" Chen said. ""Looking forward, we expect Planet Fitness to execute on creative digital innovation, including predictive analytics and big data.""Helped revolutionize the fitness industry with a business model geared to first-time gymgoers. He helped turn Planet Fitness into one of the largest owners and operators of health clubs in the U.S. in terms of the number of members and locationsOvercame: Competition from traditional gyms and skepticism from naysayers who didn't take their approach seriously.Lesson: You can do anything you set your mind to.""The key to success in business is not to be afraid of doing things differently. Don't be afraid of  going against the grain.""

208,TAP,"In 1930, John Maynard Keynes was worried, but not about the unpleasantness that had begun the previous year and would linger long enough to become known as the Great Depression. What troubled the British economist was that humanity ""is solving its economic problem.""XIn his essay ""Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,"" Keynes, seeking to dispel pessimism, predicted that, ""assuming no important wars and no important increase in population,"" the ""permanent problem of the human race"" — the ""struggle for subsistence"" — ""may be solved."" This, Keynes warned, could discombobulate the human race's neurological wiring, because mankind has evolved through many millennia for toil and stress. Basic ""habits and instincts"" are unsuitable for a future of leisure and abundance. Because we have evolved as creatures designed by nature ""to strive and not to enjoy."" So, work would have to be apportioned, perhaps in three-hour shifts and 15-hour workweeks, to keep people preoccupied.Then history's worst war came, as did a huge increase in population — and an enormous, planet-wide enrichment. And today people still toil and strive. In 1943, Paul Samuelson, who would become one of America's leading economists and win a Nobel Prize, anticipated peace with foreboding. Good things — demobilization of more than 10 million from the armed services, the economy no longer busy producing instruments of destruction — would cause bad things. There would be ""the greatest period of unemployment and industrial dislocation which any economy has ever faced."" Any economy. Ever. What actually happened is remembered as the Postwar Boom.This stroll down memory lane suggests this rule: All news is economic news, because everything affects the economy, or reveals attitudes or behaviors that soon will affect it. And all economic news is bad — especially good economic news, because it gives rise to bad behavior.Consider this recent Wall Street Journal front-page headline: ""Americans Save Less As Good Times Roll."" The story began: ""Soaring stock prices and improving job prospects"" — good news? good grief — ""have set Americans off on a spending splurge that is cutting into how much they sock away for retirement and rainy days."" Between 2008 and the third quarter of 2017, the net worth of U.S. households surged from $56 trillion to $97 trillion (good news? remember, that's an oxymoron) but ""previous busts — in the mid-2000s and the late 1990s — were preceded by periods of rising asset values and especially low saving.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveIn December, America's household savings rate was the lowest (2.4% of disposable income) since the negative savings rate in 2005 and 2006, before the housing bubble burst. Many Americans, forgetting the most intractable fact — that nothing lasts — turned the equity in their homes into cash to fund immediate consumption. Today, 104 months after the recovery from the Great Recession began in June 2009 (when the savings rate was 6.6%), 2.5 million homes are still worth less than is owed on their mortgages.As of 2013, 45% of working-age households had no retirement savings. Social Security (average annual payment, $15,500), which provides 33% of seniors' annual income, and 90% for the bottom third of retirees, but only about 35% of a typical household's pre-retirement income, last year became America's first trillion-dollar-a-year program. Absent reforms, its trust fund will be exhausted by 2035 and benefits will have to be reduced 23%.A 2015 Federal Reserve study revealed that half of those surveyed said they could not gather $400 to cope with an emergency; one-third said they could not sell assets, tap retirement savings or turn to family and friends to pay three months of expenses. By 2017, median household savings ($14,500) for those near retirement age had declined 32%t in a decade, and for the first time, older Americans had more credit card debt than younger Americans. Between 2003 and 2015, the indebtedness of those between ages 50 and 80 increased 60%. Today, those between 65 and 74 have five times more debt than that age cohort did two decades ago.Do you wonder how such behavior became to seem normal? A partial answer might be:Americans consider deferral of gratification unnatural, which it is. Time was, however, thrift was considered a virtue. People sat at kitchen tables, calculating how to bring their outlays, for living and retiring, into alignment with their incomes. But eventually many people decided: This is no fun. Instead, let's disconnect enjoyable spending decisions from tiresome facts about resources, thereby living the way the federal government does.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

Sources told the paper that the talks could still fall through, but that the end result of the plans would not turn Amazon into a bank. Any effort by Amazon to formally become a bank would require capital rules and other restrictions as well as likely opposition.Amazon is also partnering with JPMorgan, along with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), to find new ways improve health care for U.S. employees.Monday's news comes weeks after a report from CNBC saying that Amazon Lending had partnered with Bank of America (BAC) to provide loans to small businesses.IBD'S TAKE: As Amazon looks to apply its technological and logistical expertise to more lines of business, here's a look at how transportation-logistics companies are trying to adapt.  Big banks, and their branch locations, have faced an insurgency from the rapid growth of financial technology — from robo-advisors to fintech startups that have brought banking to peoples' smartphones to blockchain, the shared record-keeping technology that could eliminate the interoffice paper-shuffling needed to settle trades and other transactions.Goldman Sachs (GS) and Apple (AAPL) were also reportedly discussing ways to offer financing for people who want to buy Apple's products.

212,TAP,"The federal tax overhaul put in place by Republicans has produced an unusual show of bipartisanship now that tax season is here: We are a nation united in befuddlement.X One bit of confusion to dispel quickly: The changes don't affect taxpayers for the 2017 filing season, which officially began Jan. 29 when the Internal Revenue Service accepted its first returns. That's news to about 41% of the 2,000 Americans recently surveyed by tax prep chain Jackson Hewitt — they thought the tax law President Donald Trump signed on Dec. 22 would affect their filings this season (among millennials, it was 50%).It should come as no surprise then that tax preparers and financial advisors are girding for a barrage of questions from clients about what they should do right now. As these experts scramble to educate themselves, the opaque nature of the new law and its unanswered questions — it was rushed through Congress so fast some changes were scribbled on the margins — have even left them confused.Nevertheless, there is some consensus as to what you can do now. Below are some early thoughts from wealth managers on strategies taxpayers can start thinking about to avoid unpleasant surprises a year from now.Advisors suggest having an accountant run mock 2018 returns after this year's forms are finished. TurboTax's TaxCaster tool was recently updated to be able to forecast a 2018 tax refund based on the new law. Users enter their basic 2017 tax information, and it will spit out a 2017 estimated refund and a forecast for 2018 side by side, according to the company. H&R Block preparers have a ""pretty detailed"" tool that allows them to go over a finished 2017 return, line by line, and preview the new tax law's impact on next year's return. TaxAct Holdings expects its calculator to be updated such that it can preview next year's taxes. Running those future numbers can flag potential issues. That said, state revenue departments and the Internal Revenue Service have had little time to process the changes, so much remains in flux. ""The IRS and states haven't decided how some provisions of the new tax law will be calculated yet,"" said Jagjit Chawla, general manager of Credit Karma Tax. ""For example, they only recently shared guidance with tax preparers about the current 2017 tax season. The IRS and states will share their 2018 guidance later this summer.""The new law means that the W-4 you filled out, however many years ago, may need to be recalibrated. The IRS came out with new withholding tables on Jan. 11 that reflect changes such as the elimination of personal exemptions in the new tax law, and on Feb. 28 released an updated withholding calculator and a revised W-4 form.If workers leave their W-4s as is, they could wind up withholding too little, which can bring penalties, or they may get a smaller-than-expected refund next year. Workers in higher tax brackets who receive large bonuses could see a higher tax bill next season if they don't tweak W-4s, since one of the ways employers can set the withholding rate on ""supplemental income"" such as bonuses in the new law is to use a flat rate of 22%.""A large percentage of our clients will see a tax increase due to being in a high-property and high-income tax area,"" said Evan Beach of Campbell Wealth Management in Alexandria, Va. ""My fear is that the new withholding tables will have them under-withhold and then they will have to write a check in April."" The only solution he sees to deal with that now is for clients to make quarterly estimated payments. H&R Block expects its new tool to help people figure out if they need to change their withholding, and Liberty Tax Service is crunching on a new calculator to let those who get W-2 and 1099 forms make sure their withholding is appropriate. The goal is for the calculator to be ready for the later part of the filing season, which starts around March 1, said Martha O'Gorman, the company's chief marketing officer.A big change that could affect many taxpayers is the tax overhaul's controversial cap on state and local income tax (SALT) deductions, a provision Democrats have labeled a war on blue state Americans. The deduction, which used to be unlimited, will be capped at $10,000 next year. The new law's near-doubling of the standard deduction to $12,000 for single filers and $24,000 for married couples filing jointly does mean fewer will itemize, but residents of high-tax, high-income states such as California, New Jersey and New York could wind up paying thousands of dollars more. A report by New York state's Department of Taxation and Finance pegged the cost to New Yorkers alone at $14 billion.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!States are busy devising workarounds to try and keep those residents from seeing a big spike in federal taxes next year — or moving to a lower tax state. Strategies being explored include plans to replace a state income tax with an employer-side payroll tax, and/or a system of tax credits for charitable donations made to state funds that support areas such as education and health care. It's not clear whether the attempts will prove administratively or legally feasible, however, especially since the Trump administration has pledged to fight such efforts.To try and get around that new SALT limit, one strategy advisors suggest for people who regularly donate to charity is to bunch up into one year what they would have given over multiple years. For those who itemize, charitable donations remain deductible on federal returns and can help lift married taxpayers who file jointly above the $24,000 standard deduction hurdle. By putting a few years' worth of donations into a donor-advised fund — many financial services firms have units that offer them — you can take the deduction the year you put the money in, but distribute the money to charity over multiple years.The deductibility of interest on home equity loans and lines of credit (HELOCs) is a big area of confusion, said Tim Steffen, director of advanced planning for Baird Private Wealth Management. The new tax law lowered the amount on which interest expense on so-called ""acquisition indebtedness"" could be deducted — from $1 million to $750,000 for new loans made after Dec. 14, 2017. It also eliminated the interest deduction on loans that are not used to 'buy, build or substantially improve' a home, he said.""Sometimes people buying a home don't have money for the down payment, so take out a loan for 80% of the price and a home-equity loan out for 20%,"" said Steffen. ""Because the home equity loan was used to buy a house it's still considered deductible."" Going forward, though, if you take out a HELOC and use some of the money to buy a car, you cannot deduct that interest. If you use the money to put an addition on your home, however, that may still be deductible.The new tax law expands the allowable use of tax-exempt 529 college savings plans for education costs that accrue while your child is between kindergarten and high school graduation. But while some states automatically follow the federal code, others choose to decouple from certain parts of it. So while the U.S. government may say you can use 529 money for K-12 expenses, a state may consider such a withdrawal a non-qualified distribution and could charge you penalties, said Steffen. So be careful.A question Scott Bishop of STA Wealth Management in Houston is hearing is whether the tax law does anything good or bad for a client's retirement strategy. For those retiring before age 70 ½ — the age when withdrawals from tax-deferred retirement savings plans such as 401(k)s become mandatory and thus raise your taxable income — lower tax rates could present a reason to convert a standard pretax IRA into a Roth IRA, which consists of after-tax money. Or clients may consider taking distributions from standard IRAs, which they can tap without penalty starting at age 59 ½, to take advantage of lower tax brackets and avoid a ""tax time bomb"" of having to take large required minimum distributions (RMDs) while in retirement. Those bombs can bump you up into a higher tax bracket.""You can get your knickers in a knot and worry about something no one knows enough about yet, or you can chill and prepare your questions and concerns for when the answers surface,"" said Jon Ten Haagen, of Ten Haagen Financial Group in Huntington, N.Y. ""Breathe in, breathe out, and repeat as necessary until your heart rate is back down to normal.""RELATED:Tax Overhaul Seen Spurring More Hostile Divorce NegotiationsIs This Trump Tax Loophole Open For Interpretation?In A Volatile Market: Go To Cash Or Stay The Course?

Analysts expected $2.05 and $14.57 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Richfield, Minn.-based Best Buy said its same-store sales rose 9% in the period.""The comparable sales growth of 9% in the quarter is the result of the strong execution of our strategy combined with better product availability, a continued healthy consumer confidence and positive macro conditions, strength in the gaming category, and a favorable competitive environment, as we benefited from the exit or decline of certain competitors,"" Best Buy Chief Financial Officer Corie Barry said in a news release.Best Buy has gotten a boost in appliance sales from the decline of Sears, analysts say.

Nasdaq 100 futures reversed sharply, with Amazon (AMZN) still booming on Q4 results but Apple (AAPL) giving up most of its post-earnings gains.X The 10-year Treasury yield traded at 2.79%, continuing its strong 2018 rise. The 30-year yield topped 3% for the first time in years Thursday. The Bank of Japan said it would buy 5- and 10-year government debt after the 10-year Japanese yield threatened to top 0.1%. German bund yields are multiyear highs.S&P 500 index futures fell 0.6% vs. fair value. Dow futures sank 0.8%, or more than 200 points. Nasdaq 100 futures, up solidly Thursday night, lost 0.7%.Separately, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continued to plunge as regulators and Facebook (FB) crack down and euphoria fades following a climax-type run that peaked in December. Bitcoin dipped below $8,000 Friday morning, currently down 12% to $7,968.23, according to CoinDesk. Bitcoin crashed below $9,000 on Thursday.The January employment report is due at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect to see nonfarm payrolls up 175,000 and the jobless rate holding at 4.1%. But the focus may be on average hourly wages, which are seen up 0.3% vs. December and 2.6% vs. a year earlier.Apple reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the holiday fiscal first quarter, though iPhone shipments missed forecasts. Apple guided current-quarter revenue forecasts sharply lower. Shares rose more than 3% late Thursday, but with futures tumbling Apple was up just 0.6%.Extended trading often doesn't translate into the following session. There is a strong case that Apple's bad news was already priced in the stock price. Several analysts warned of weaker iPhone production and demand leading up to the earnings report. That sent the stock below a recent buy point and its 50-day moving average, even as the broader market was soaring in January.But on the other hand, Apple's news wasn't great. And the AAPL stock chart is still in bad shape. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging for months, and recently hit its worst levels since mid-June. Technically, a 176.34 buy point is still valid, though you'd want to see the RS line top at least short-term highs to provide some confirmation.Apple, which is the biggest member of the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow industrials, also gave a boost to iPhone-related stocks such as Broadcom (AVGO), Applied Materials (AMAT) and Universal Display (AVGO).Broadcom rose 0.5% early Friday. But the chipmaker, which set a four-month closing low Thursday, is stuck below its 50-day and 200-moving averages.Applied Materials is a chip- and display-equipment maker. It is not an Apple supplier, but some analysts have pegged it as an iPhone X play due to its involvement in OLED displays. Applied Materials rose 1% late Thursday but reversed to down about 1% early Friday. Applied Materials is in a cup-with-handle base, but the stock is finding resistance at its 50-day moving average.Universal Display also is not an Apple supplier, but as its OLED ticker suggests, makes technology used in producing the high-end screens for premium smartphones. Universal Display rose 3.9% early Friday. The stock had closed at its lowest level in almost three months after a January breakout broke down.Qorvo (QRVO) is an iPhone chipmaker, but shares weren't that active overnight. They might be tired after skyrocketing 16% to close at 83.34, clearing an 81.30 cup buy point. Qorvo guided lower late Wednesday, but touted a big Apple contract win that will increase its iPhone business, at the expense of Broadcom.Amazon reported blowout earnings, helped by a big tax-cut benefit, while revenue also topped. Shares rose 5.7% early Friday after falling 4.2% Thursday. Amazon has been a huge winner so far in 2018 after clearing a late-stage base.Meanwhile, Amazon's upside was offset by Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amgen (AMGN), which both missed on earnings.

227,TAP,"Stocks stepped into mild gains at Tuesday's open, as earnings news moved Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Macy's (M) and Toll Brothers (TOL), and as investors reacted to text released from the new Federal Reserve chief's testimony before Congress.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 booked narrow early gains. The Nasdaq Composite opened in the red, freighted with a heavy early loss from Comcast (CMCSA).The focal point of a busy day of economic news will be the semiannual monetary policy statement from new Fed Chief Jerome Powell. His first official testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. ET, though prepared comments said upside and downside risks were relatively balanced in the economy, and that the Fed aimed to avoid ""an overheated economy,"" while bringing price inflation up to the 2% target level. Powell follows up on Thursday with testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.Investors also will be tuned in at 2 p.m. ET, when former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke will discuss the economy and monetary policy with recently retired Fed Chair Janet Yellen at the Brookings Institution.Commerce Department data showed a larger-than-expected reversal in durable goods orders growth. Orders dived 3.7% in January, after a 2.6% gain in December. Economists had called for a 2% decline. Orders for core capital goods dipped 0.2%, better than December's 0.3% slip, but below views for a 0.5% rise.Housing price growth held relatively steady in December, according to indexes released by Case-Shiller and by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The Case-Shiller 20-City Home Price index rose 0.6% month-over-month, vs. a 0.7% rise in November and in line with estimates. The FHFA House Price Index also rose 0.3%, down from 0.5% and shy of forecasts for a 0.5% advance.Most overseas markets did not take up where the U.S. rally left off Monday. In Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 did jump 1.1% to take a third straight advance. China's markets closed lower as the country continues to grapple with Sunday's proposal by the ruling Communist Party to eliminate political term limits. The Shanghai Composite dropped 1.1% Tuesday, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.7%.Trade was tightly mixed in Europe, with investors possibly holding fire ahead of Powell's comments. Frankfurt's DAX was off 0.3%, with Paris' CAC-40 and the FTSE 100 in London holding narrow gains in afternoon trade.Merger news gave Tuesday's premarket action a stir.Comcast fell 4%, Walt Disney (DIS) dipped 1.7% and 21st Century Fox (FOX) was unchanged as news reports detailed a $31 billion takeover offer from Comcast for certain assets of U.K.-based satellite broadcast Sky. Comcast's offer topped a prior bid from Fox. In addition, Disney had agreed earlier to buy Sky and certain other assets from Fox in a $52 billion deal.Macy's spiked 12% in opening trade. The department store chain's fourth-quarter earnings easily cleared consensus estimates, with its revenue growth of 1.8% stopping just short of forecasts. Management raised its full-year earnings guidance to well above consensus views.  The stock was back above key levels of support, after climbing 58% from a November low.On the IBD 50 list, Palo Alto Networks leapt more than 3% after fiscal second-quarter results reported after Monday's close easily topped expectations. Shares are extended, up nearly 12% since clearing a cup base in January.Tenet Healthcare (THC) bolted 15% higher. The hospital operator reported stronger-than-expected results for the fourth quarter late Monday.

The stock rose 2% Monday, despite the weak new-home sales data. Shares are up 12% from an early February low, testing resistance at the 10-week moving average as the stock builds the right side of a possible base pattern. YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stock Gains Impress, But Here Comes PowellNew Fed Chief, These Top Earnings Are On Tap: Action Plan These Stocks Hit New Highs Monday And Are Still In Buy RangeNew Buy Points Emerge As Market Uptrend Extends GainsWarren Buffett Stocks: These Are The Top Berkshire Holdings

228,TAP,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average turned mixed Tuesday morning ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony on Capitol Hill.S&P 500 index futures were just below vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.1% vs. fair value. Dow Jones futures were a fraction above fair value. All had been modestly positive earlier.Powell will testify before the House Financial Service Committee at 10 a.m. ET, though his prepared written testimony will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. It's Powell's first big appearance as Fed chairman, so he's unlikely to try to rock the boat. But given markets recent sensitivity to Treasury yields and the always-watchful eye toward Fed policy, investors will be paying close attention.During Monday's session, the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite all rose more than 1%. Micron Technology (MU) and Applied Materials (AMAT) both broke out from double-bottom bases, at least intraday, though trading volume wasn't impressive. Meanwhile, fellow chip plays Lam Research (LRCX), Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) also are setting up in this bullish ""W""-shaped pattern.Micron Technology and Applied Materials both boast Composite Ratings of 97 out of a possible 99. The Composite Rating combines several IBD proprietary ratings into a single score. All-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of their big runs.Lam Research has a strong 96 Composite Rating and Monolithic Power a 94. Marvell Technology has an OK 79 CR,  in large part due to previously spotty earnings, but recent earnings and profit estimates show an improving trend.All three chip groups — Electronic-Semiconductor Equipment, Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing and Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless — were among the top 15 out of IBD's 197 industries on Monday.The double-bottom pattern tends to form in volatile markets, which we've seen over the past several weeks. You have one down leg, then the stock tries to rally but hits resistance and ends up pulling back to form a second down leg. The peak of the initial rally must be above the midpoint of the consolidation. The second down leg must undercut the first low of the consolidation, shaking out weak holders. The buy point is 10 cents above the peak in the middle of the W. Sometimes a double-bottom base will form a handle that could create a lower or alternative entry.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersMicron stock rose 3.1% to 47.98, moving above its 47.08 buy point from a shallow double-bottom pattern. Volume was 2% below normal. You want to see volume rise at least 40%-50% above normal on a breakout as a sign that big institutions are adding to holdings.The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is well off its levels from the left side of the consolidation, but it has moved above where it was at the middle of the ""W,"" thus providing some breakout confirmation. The RS line is the blue line in the charts below.Look to see if the stock can power higher in strong volume, boost the RS line and indicating that mutual funds are buying in bulk.Applied Materials climbed as high as 58.99 intraday Monday, briefly clearing a 58.83 buy point. Shares closed up 3.2% at 58.81, two cents below that entry. Volume was just 4% above average. Look for the stock to close above the buy point in rapid trade.Applied Materials, a leading chip-equipment maker, has surged since undercutting its 200-day line on Feb. 9. The RS line is not at a high, but is at its best levels in near three months.Lam Research, another big chip-gear firm, rallied 2.8% to 198.43, continuing to rebound from its 50-day line. The stock is still a ways off from a 218.58 buy point.Marvell Technology rose 0.9% to 23.46. The stock is in a shallow double-bottom base with a 24.31 buy point. Marvell is in the process of buying rival chipmaker Cavium (CAVM).Monolitich Power Systems climbed 1.5% to 119.82 on Monday, making its way toward a 124.54 buy point.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stock Gains Impress, But Here Comes PowellNew Fed Chief, These Top Earnings Are On Tap: Action Plan These Stocks Hit New Highs Monday And Are Still In Buy RangeNew Buy Points Emerge As Market Uptrend Extends GainsWarren Buffett Stocks: These Are The Top Berkshire Holdings

229,TAP,"Shares of Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) imploded after fiscal first-quarter results missed expectations Tuesday, with the garden-care company also saying the ""slower-than-expected pace of regulatory changes in California"" was harming its hydroponics business.The company cut its full-year sales outlook to 2%-4% growth, from expectations laid out in November for a 4%-6% gain, due to the ""slow start"" at Hawthorne Gardening Co., its hydroponics subsidiary, which sells the same nutrients, lighting and other products often used in growing marijuana.""We've told you in the past that this business could see significant quarterly short-term swings,"" CEO Jim Hagedorn said on the company's earnings call, ""and this is one of those times.""X The results come as more companies — from Constellation Brands (STZ) to GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) — try to tap the rapidly growing but still-precarious marijuana industry in the U.S. Scotts has snapped up other companies to deepen its business in hydroponics — in which plants are grown without using soil.But even as legal recreational sales of the plant took hold in California this year, the rule-making and permitting process has taken time to sort out across the state, which is set to become one a stronghold for the nation's cannabis industry.Some counties in the state have banned selling the plant; others are still trying to lock down their own regulations. The Justice Department's decision to scrap an Obama-era measure that encourages states to legalize could add to the confusion.""Only California could screw up a great market,"" Hagedorn said on the call, quoting a remark made by another senior company official. ""While it's a little bit of a pain in the a--, it's what needs to happen as the country moves toward normalization of this product.""Fiscal Q1 losses widened to $1.08 a share from 96 cents a year ago, while analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expected the loss to narrow to 92 cents a share. Revenue of $222 million fell short of estimates for $240 million.Scotts raised its full-year EPS forecast to $4.60-$4.80 as a result of a lower expected tax rate for the year. That's higher than Zacks estimates for $4.30.Sales at the Hawthorne Gardening Co. fell by roughly $12 million when excluding acquisitions.Shares of Scotts Miracle-Gro crashed 14% to finish at 91.96 in the stock market today, hitting the lowest point since July and diving below their 50- and 200-day averages. GW Pharmaceuticals edged down 0.6%, and Constellation lost 0.3%. The cannabis-tracking ETF ETFMG Alternative Harvest (MJX), whose holdings include Scotts and G Pharma, sank 5.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Even as investors in the cannabis industry try to get in on the ground floor, investing in the space in the U.S. can be tricky.Scotts Miracle-Gro expects full-year organic sales at Hawthorne to be flat, ""assuming a return to normal market conditions in the second half of the year,"" Hagedorn said in a statement before the call. The slowdown in that business, which it viewed as temporary, had nonetheless spilled over into the second fiscal quarter.""Our long-term prospects for this business remain unchanged and we continue to see Hawthorne having strong long-term growth,"" he said in that statement.More broadly, he said, ""As we prepare for the start of the lawn and garden season, our core business is on pace with our internal expectations and we continue to expect solid consumer and retailer engagement once the weather breaks.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Cannabis Has A Long Ways To Go Before Making It Into ESG ETFsThis Merger Will Create The World's Most Valuable Pot Producer

231,TAP,"Republicans' recent tax reform could unleash local tax revolts rivaling 1978's Proposition 13.  Limitations on local tax payments' deductibility could ignite resistance to excessive levies — not just in one state, but across Democrat-dominated localities. It is therefore a low-risk, high-reward gambit that could make tax reform an even bigger political winner for Republicans.X Recently enacted tax reform legislation lowered individual income taxes; it also eliminated many targeted provisions.  Rather than reducing taxes for specified purposes, the goal was to do so generally. Following this intent, the standard deduction nearly doubled, while many longstanding deductions were reduced or eliminated.The most focal ""deduction reduction"" was that for state and local taxes. Previously, such tax payments were deductible. Under tax reform, the SALT (in tax reform parlance) deduction fell to $10,000; any payments above this become included in taxable income.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveWhile the increased standard deduction ($12,000/$24,000 for individual/joint) could certainly provide additional coverage for SALT payments, the deduction limitation gets tougher as income and SALT tax burdens increase. The result: Many taxpayers will feel an increased cost from their localities' high taxes. Those burdens are highest where localities are bluest.Forty years ago, Proposition 13 rocked California and America. Stagflation hit California property owners especially hard. Rapidly rising tax assessments, but stagnating real earnings, meant increasing tax levies could force owners from their homes.""The People's Initiative to Limit Property Taxation"" used the initiative process to lock tax relief into California's constitution. Over 70% of the electorate voted, passing it 2-1. It spawned 29 copycat efforts nationwide.  Many credited this wave for further lifting Reagan's candidacy.Proposition 13 has become California's political ""third rail."" Its untouchable status is a reminder of local tax issues' potency. Tax reform's SALT deduction limitation threatens to tap this.Capping the SALT deduction increases already high tax burdens' cost. It also turns the tables on such states, which disproportionately deny tax deductions for federal taxes paid in their jurisdictions.The conservative Heritage Foundation used fiscal year 2012 data to study state-local tax burdens, ranking the ten highest states: New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Illinois, California, Maryland, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Oregon. Last October, Kiplinger's produced its list of least friendly tax states: Seven of Heritage's list joined Maine, Vermont and Washington, D.C.These 12 share two things. First, only Oregon allows its taxpayers to deduct their federal tax payments. Yet this is exactly what these states now cry foul over — New York's governor Cuomo calling it ""economic civil war.""Their other commonality: They are overwhelmingly Democratic.Nationally, Republicans control 31 of the 49 state houses, 36 of 49 state senates, and 33 of 50 governorships (16 are Democrats and one Independent) — roughly 2-1 overall. However in the twelve highest SALT states, Democrats control eight governorships, eight state senates, and ten state houses — and all three in six. In Congress, the balance is even more skewed: Democrats control each state's House and all but ME's Senate delegation.Tax reform's SALT deduction limitation exacerbates state and local taxes' impact here. Historically, local tax increases have often triggered local backlashes. The new limitation could replicate these.Particularly affected local governments will blame Republicans in Washington. However, the SALT limitation is an effect, not a cause of a high tax problem.If local tax burdens were not out of step with America's, there would be no problem. The federal deduction has helped mask it; its removal does not cause it. Washington's action only mimics how these states treat their citizens' federal tax payments. Solutions to both lie in the states themselves: Reduce their tax burdens.Focus on the local cause of these states' predicament leaves Democrats exposed. Their control in these states is as noticeable as their tax burdens are divergent. This dual divergence gives Republicans a low risk and high reward opportunity — leaving Democrats with the opposite.Certainly, Republicans in Washington could be tagged in the affected states. Yet their minority status reduces Republicans' electoral exposure.Conversely, Democrats' vulnerability is heightened by heavy majorities. Locally, they have power to reduce constituents' tax hit by simply reducing the taxes triggering the problem. Heavy majorities also mean heavy exposure electorally. Unsurprisingly, they are exploring creative ways to undo the SALT limitation hit — except of course, lowering their citizens' tax burden.There is no guarantee the limitation on SALT deductions will engender tax revolts like Proposition 13's 40 years ago. However, local taxpayer revolts over excessive taxes occurred dramatically then and regularly since. Should such repetition occur, Democrats stand to lose on tax reform … again, and even more than they already have.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

242,TAP,"Mark Kantrowitz planned very early for his kids' college education. Even before the children were born, he opened college savings accounts for them, starting with a lump sum and contributing $250 a month to each account. He and his family cut living costs to help afford the outlays.X Once the children, now 11 and 14, obtained Social Security numbers, he opened 529 college savings plans for them and transferred their existing savings into these accounts.The plum results so far: ""We're on track to cover one-third of the future costs of college for both children at an in-state public school,"" says Kantrowitz, who is the author of several books on planning for college and is the publisher of privatestudentloans.guru.But evidently, such saving regimens are no breeze, as many parents such as Kantrowitz, find. And data suggest for some the strain could be worsening: Amid the squeeze of other financial demands — from daily living costs to rising debt levels to parents' need to save for retirement — signs suggest families are seeking ever more ways, beyond their own pocketbooks, to cover current or future college costs.Consider the trend in saving via tax-advantaged, 529 college savings plans: According to financial research firm Strategic Insight, assets in 529 savings plans (not including assets in 529 prepaid tuition plans) reached $282 billion in 12.1 million accounts, as of 2017's third quarter. Data show the number of those 529 accounts grew 2% over the same quarter a year earlier. That growth rate in the number of accounts is down from about 4% for the year ended September 2016 and about 5.5% between the third quarters of 2014 and 2015.And yet, 529 college savings plans have notable draws, proponents note. For instance, assets in these state-sponsored vehicles grow tax-free, and withdrawals are tax-free when used to cover qualified college costs.Some states also offer tax benefits for plan contributions. (And, as per the new tax legislation, up to $10,000 a year of an account's assets will be able to be used for elementary and secondary school expenses, including at private schools, as well as for college costs.) If 529 accounts are opened when children are very young, investments in them can compound, building savings potentially for upward of 18 years before college begins.Overall, because of their benefits, ""529s are one of the best ways to save for college,"" concludes Deborah Goodkin, managing director, savings plans, First National Bank of Omaha.But evidently personal savings go just so far. Indeed, a 2017 report by Sallie Mae showed that, in the 2016-17 academic year, scholarships and grants covered 35% of college costs — the highest percentage in the report's 10-years history — while parents' income and savings covered 23%, down from 29% the year before. In fact, in Sallie Mae's latest such report, 13% of families surveyed were using 529 plans, the lowest percentage in five years.(In addition, during the 2016-17 school year, students' income and savings covered 11% of college costs, while students' borrowing covered 19%, parents' borrowing 8%, and contributions from friends and relatives accounted for 4%, the report showed.) As Sallie Mae spokesperson Ellen Roberts observes, ""More people are using scholarships to help pay for college.""To be sure, there are more ways families pay for college. According to 2016 Sallie Mae data, Americans save for college more commonly through general savings accounts than through 529 plans. Moreover, some families tap Roth IRA savings to help pay for college, even though this may be ill-advised, since, experts say, it reduces parents' retirement savings.And of course, for families that are saving for college, there's the question of how much to put away. This past year, Fidelity Investments introduced one way to help figure it out: a so-called 'college savings 2K rule of thumb.'The way it works: For those using a 529 savings plan, multiply your child's age by $2,000. That tells you roughly how much should be in the child's 529 plan at the child's current age to eventually cover 50% of his or her cost of attending a four-year public college. But bear in mind: ""This rule of thumb assumes you make annual 529 contributions, and that the plan is consistently invested in a mix of asset classes,"" says Keith Bernhardt, Fidelity's vice president of retirement and college savings products.RELATED:Tax Reform Killed A Key Roth IRA Legal Loophole — Here's What To Do3 Principles Of Good Financial Advice

That, plus output curbs from OPEC and its allies, has translated to a tighter market, easing the supply glut that had weighed on prices.""This means the oil market is now in balance and the previous oversupply discount is gradually being replaced by a market tightness premium, which makes us increasingly positive on the global outlook for our business,"" Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard said in a statement.International markets are especially important to Schlumberger where management said it has four to five times the earnings power than in North American land operations.Shares closed up 0.1% at 76.43 on the stock market today after falling as much as 3% as U.S. crude prices dropped 0.9% to $63.37 a barrel.  Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg said while Schlumberger's outlook comments were generally positive, markets may have been disappointed by lack of a dividend increase.Halliburton (HAL), which is scheduled to report Q4 results Monday and is more exposed to North America, rose 1.3% and Baker Hughes (BHGE), on tap for Wednesday, closed flat.

National Oilwell said 2017 results should come in at or above prior expectations.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Schlumberger's adjusted earnings jumped 78% to 48 cents per share while revenue climbed 15% to $8.179 billion. Revenue from North America rose 59% to $2.81 billion during the quarter. Analysts were expecting EPS of 44 cents on revenue of $8.12 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.But Schlumberger took $2.7 billion in charges, with nearly $1 billion related to investments in Venezuela.The company also said it is exiting the marine and land seismic acquisition market, booked a $938 million charge on a Venezuelan investment, and signed a memorandum of understanding with Occidental Petroleum (OXY) for a five-year service project in New Mexico's Delaware basin for 700 wells.Also in a monthly report out Friday, the International Energy Agency raised its outlook for growth in U.S. oil production by 240,000 barrels a day to 1.35 million barrels, enough to top Saudi Arabia and Russia.""Relentless growth should see the U.S. hit historic highs above 10 million barrels a day (in production), overtaking Saudi Arabia and rivaling Russia during the course of 2018 — provided OPEC and non-OPEC restraints remain in place,"" the IEA said.In its own monthly report out Thursday, OPEC said U.S. shale producers lowered break-even costs between 2015 and 2017 but now service companies are raising rig and labor costs so break-even prices are rising.Despite increased costs, OPEC cited a JPMorgan report that found U.S. shale exploration and production companies could achieve ""decent rates of return"" at $60 per barrel even if costs rose by another 15%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalDividend Hikes, Largest IPO Ever Lead 5 Oil Stories To Watch This Year

256,TAP,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq 100 rebounded strongly Wednesday morning after the major averages suffered a bearish reversal from all-time highs on Tuesday, closing modestly lower.X Chip-equipment giant ASML Holding (ASML) surged before the open on strong earnings and guidance. ASML is one of several leading stocks, including Atlassian (TEAM), Align Technology (ALGN) and Scientific Games (SGMS) that tried to break out Tuesday but closed below buy points.But all four stocks closed higher, giving these stocks a day of outperformance vs. the S&P 500 index.Separately, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) nearly reached a buy point, closing near the top of its range.Keep in mind that several of these stocks are in late-stage patterns. Atlassian reports earnings on tap Thursday. So is Taiwan Semiconductor.S&P 500 futures rose nearly 0.6% vs. fair value. Dow futures jumped 0.8% against fair value, while Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.6%. Keep in mind that stock futures were even stronger Tuesday, with the major averages booming at the open, before selling off.Dutch chip-equipment giant ASML reported a surprise earnings gain and better-than-expected revenue for the fourth quarter. ASML also hiked its dividend set a new stock buyback program. ASML is the leading maker of hugely expensive lithography machines, which help chipmakers make ever-smaller chips.Shares shot up 6.2% to 197.95 in early Wednesday stock market trading, suggesting a decisive gap-up above a 186.47 cup-base buy point.On Tuesday, ASML also gapped higher, rising to a record 189.38, but shares pulled back to close up about 3% to 186.38. Aggressive investors might have used 184.27 as an alternative entry just above a too-short handle.ASML's relative strength line rose above a short-term high Tuesday, though it is still well below its highs from the left side of the base.The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. You want to see a stock's RS line lead or confirm a breakout by rising to at least short-term highs.Assuming ASML gaps higher in Wednesday's regular session, the RS line should confirm that move with a short-term high and a solid move toward longer-term highs.ASML is important because it's the first chip-equipment maker to report earnings for the latest quarter, really the first company from the broader chip sector to do so.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. Here's how to apply that earnings options strategy with Atlassian.The collaboration software maker surged to 55.25 Tuesday morning, powering above a 53.55 cup-base entry. Shares then reversed sharply, briefly turning negative before closing with a 0.5% gain at 52.82. That was not a good afternoon for Atlassian. Still, the RS line is right at a short-term high and made up some ground vs. record highs from two months ago.Atlassian earnings are expected to rise 33% with revenue up 37%.Align briefly got to 268.17 on Tuesday, moving slightly past a 266.51 cup-base entry. Shares closed up 2.2% at 263.88. The Invisalign braces maker's RS line has been rising sharply in recent weeks, though it's still off its consolidation's peak.Scientific Games, which makes lottery-related products, edged up 0.5% to 54.10 on Tuesday after touching 55.15 intraday, eking past a 55.05 flat-base entry intraday.Taiwan Semi rose 2.5% to 42.23 on Tuesday, approaching a 42.67 buy point from a short cup-with-handle base.

257,TAP,"Stocks and exchange traded funds tied to cannabis, from Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) to ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJX), skidded on Thursday on news that Attorney General Jeff Sessions will roll back the measure that has encouraged more states to legalize using and selling the plant.X The move comes just days after recreational marijuana became legal in California, the biggest potential market for cannabis. And it comes as scores of small businesses — increasingly confident that Sessions wouldn't crack down on the plant despite his vocal disdain for it — open up shop to sell marijuana candy, cannabidiol tinctures, THC coffee, and lighting, security and technology products related to the plant.While the move by the Trump administration may make federal prosecutors take a harder stance, Cowen analyst Vivien Azer shrugged it off by noting that state and local officials in top cannabis markets remain more open.""We don't view this as terribly disruptive, as enforcement decisions will seemingly be left to state-level AGs,"" she said in a research note. ""In legal adult use cannabis states, given the tax revenue generation, we believe local governments and AGs are largely onboard with legalization.""Lawn-care company Scotts Miracle-Gro, which has been bulking up its hydroponics business, closed down 2.3% in the stock market today, but had dropped as much as 5.2% earlier. Insys Therapeutics (INSY), whose shares jumped late last month after the FDA gave fast-track designation to a cannabidiol drug it was developing, plunged 26%. Cannabidiol, or CBD, has been used broadly as a relaxant.ETFMG Alternative Harvest, an ETF tied to such stocks as GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) and Canopy Growth Corp., tumbled 6%. AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT), which allocates 20% of its holdings to the cannabis industry, reversed higher to finish up 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Even as investors in the cannabis industry try to get in on the ground floor, investing in the space in the U.S. can be tricky.The Justice Department said it plans to rescind 2013's so-called Cole Memo, which essentially said the federal government would take a lighter enforcement approach to states that legalized marijuana, provided they kept the market under control. The Associated Press reported the move earlier.U.S. prosecutors in states that have legalized the plant will determine how much they want to enforce federal law. Marijuana is still illegal on a federal level.Cowen & Co. has estimated that cannabis could become a $50 billion market by 2026, potentially threatening the beer and wine industry and helping the fast-food industry — particularly restaurants concentrated in California.But alcohol companies like Constellation Brands (STZ) and Molson Coors (TAP) have signaled interest in pot-related products.Meanwhile, Jack in the Box (JACK) will be working with Merry Jane, a cannabis-focused media company co-founded by rapper Snoop Dogg, to launch a campaign to promote a late-night ""Merry Munchie Meal"" this month in parts of Southern California.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:This Beer Giant, Like Constellation Brands, Is Eyeing The Pot MarketThese Hard Liquors Are Gaining Popularity Now As Tastes Shift

262,TAP,"Bitcoin began 2017 trading under $1,000. Then it got much bigger. Investors big and small arrived, sometimes bailed hard — as they did on Friday — then arrived some more. Concerns were raised that Bitcoin barely qualified as money. Concerns were raised that its immense transaction volumes were swallowing up the world's energy. Comparisons to Dutch tulip mania piled up, and a securities regulator in December said ""We've seen mortgages being taken out to buy Bitcoin.""X Which all leads to one question for 2018: Is there any chance Bitcoin's jagged, face-melting run for the stratosphere might become a bit tamer?The advent of Bitcoin futures from Cboe (CBOE), CME Group (CME) and, eventually, Nasdaq (NDAQ), has the potential to reel Bitcoin back into orbit. A Bitcoin ETF in 2018? Certainly not impossible. Greater attention from regulators could help inform investors and stamp out fraud.After a week of some moderation on spot market, volatility has roared back in recent days. Shares of Bitcoin-related stocks like Riot Blockchain (RIOT), Marathon Patent Group (MARA) and Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) are also seeing big daily moves, while companies looking to rebrand themselves with blockchain such as Long Island Iced Tea (LTEA) and Net Element (NETE) keep jumping in. And other cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum and Litecoin, have shot up in price recently.But most big banks are unlikely, for now, to gorge on the tulips, and it's still debatable whether treating Bitcoin like a normal investment will make it behave like one. Others wonder if investors are prepared for the more complicated world of investing next year that the futures will bring — to a market where 40% of all Bitcoins are reportedly in the possession of 1,000 holders who could, on a whim, lop thousands of dollars off its price.""So, someone who put in $10,000 now has $2 million in his account — does he know how to protect it when trading might go against him?"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, a managing director at financial analytics firm S3 Partners.IBD'S TAKE: Are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies a speculator's game? Individual investors should be extremely cautious about diving into this new area. Read this feature about Bitcoin risks and potential gains.Those questions were perhaps underscored on Friday, when Bitcoin's price crumbled below $12,000, then picked up another $1,000 later in the day, after a week of warnings from financial officials abroad and worries about possible insider trading. Bitcoin futures contracts from Cboe and CME were tracking close to the price of Bitcoin itself.Futures contracts will allow investors to wager on whether Bitcoin's price will rise or fall without owning the cryptocurrency directly. If more investors, possibly anticipating a bubble, use the futures to bet on a drop in Bitcoin, that might help tap the brakes on cryptocurrency's feverish price increases, the reasoning goes.That short-selling would also allow investors to hedge against their long bets on Bitcoin and make plays in the market more easily.""So if I bought Bitcoin at $200, and it's trading at $15,000, I might want to hedge out some of that without actually selling my Bitcoin,"" Dusaniwsky said. ""And this might be much easier with futures, to get in and out of that position intraday.""The contracts would also have trading and price limits, and could open a pathway for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund that would trade on the stock market — a development Dusaniwsky said was likely in 2018. Cboe this filed with the SEC to list six Bitcoin ETFs. The more securities available overall, the more opportunity to short. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the company that owns the New York Stock Exchange, also wants to offer a Bitcoin ETF.The massive retail brokerage TD Ameritrade (AMTD) said this month that it will let some clients trade Cboe's Bitcoin futures, and rival E-Trade Financial (ETFC) followed days later. Also this month, Interactive Brokers (IBKR) said it would allow customers to make some bets against those futures.Last week, there were some indications that short-sellers may have moved in and tempered the markets. Bloomberg reported at that time that the price of Cboe's Bitcoin futures, which cost up to 13% more than Bitcoin itself, had over a few days drifted much closer to the spot price of the cryptocurrency.But not everyone is convinced that Bitcoin futures will mellow out cryptocurrency markets.""While the futures markets help bring traditional financial institutions into the space, they do encourage speculation rather than owning the underlying asset and are unlikely to dampen volatility,"" Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research, said in an email, noting that a Bitcoin ETF or mutual fund would instead be more helpful in easing volatility.Any short-sellers would also be betting against a cryptocurrency whose price has ballooned more than 1,300% since the beginning of 2017. While short-selling seems likely, there might not be as much of it as many are anticipating.""Number 1, short-sellers aren't gluttons for punishment,"" Dusaniwsky said. ""With Bitcoin going up $1,000 a day some days, I don't see these guys jumping into the short side, just doing outright short positions, on a whim.""Financial institutions might be fine with letting their customers make futures trades, but the big banks are largely staying away from doing it themselves.But Goldman Sachs (GS) is setting up a trading desk for cryptocurrencies and hopes to have it running by the end of June, sources told Bloomberg Thursday.That would make Goldman the first of Wall Street's top trading firms to jump into the crypto-mania. Peers like Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) are waiting to see what what happens.Bitcoin futures are too new and too small, with too little regulatory underpinning, for the banks to get into right now, said CFRA analyst Ken Leon before the Goldman news broke.The volatile cryptocurrency isn't exactly fodder for banks' wealth management divisions, either. Banks, who have tried to detox from the high-risk investments that battered them during the financial crisis, would also have to calculate the potential loss risk of any asset tied to Bitcoin.""I wouldn't expect to see JPMorgan (JPM) involved anytime soon,"" said Clyde Tinnen, a corporate-finance partner at the law firm Withers Bergman, which advises clients on cryptocurrency markets.But hedge funds are getting in the game. Fortress Investment Group and Horizon Kinetics have purchased Bitcoin recently, while executives from firms like Quantbot Technologies and Steven Cohen's Cubist Systematic Strategies recently met to discuss how they could profit from cryptocurrencies, according to the Wall Street Journal.Still, as Bitcoin's price has scorched higher, and as startup entrepreneurs attach the ""crypto"" prefix to whatever's trending, the Securities and Exchange Commission has started to notice. The agency in December stopped at least two initial coin offerings — a form of digital fundraising — that it deemed suspicious or in violation of securities laws.The SEC has also issued advice to investors to avoid getting conned, and even urged caution when considering celebrities' promotions of things like ICOs — an announcement that came after Floyd Mayweather, Jr., Paris Hilton and a few others have thrown their support behind them. ""Any celebrity or other individual who promotes a virtual token or coin that is a security must disclose the nature, scope, and amount of compensation received in exchange for the promotion,"" the agency warned in November, later adding that those celebrity endorsers ""often do not have sufficient expertise to ensure … compliance with federal securities laws.""But as Bitcoin exchanges strain under the weight of more interest and more serious money, disputes among developers over how best to speed transactions through the network seem likely to resurface in 2018.Disagreement over how to proceed has led two ""fork"" currencies that have formed out of Bitcoin: Bitcoin Cash, in August, and Bitcoin Gold, in October. Those cryptocurrencies use different algorithms and equipment and have different sizes of the blocks of code that store transaction information.As that debate goes on, or as Bitcoin's price drifts out of reach, investors could turn their attention to lower-profile, lower-drama currencies such as Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Ethereum, Litecoin and others.""Some of them could even gain advantage in the future by offering better compliance with regulatory requirements,"" JPMorgan analysts said in a research note in December.As more people have piled into Bitcoin, the doubt from bigger names in the financial world has built up on a daily basis. Most recently, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said Bitcoin's presence in the payments landscape was still very small. But she said, as others have, that it was ""not a stable store of value"" and ""highly speculative."" UBS' global chief economist called Bitcoin the ""bubble to end all bubbles"". Brian Armstrong, the co-counder and CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, said in a December blog post: ""Please invest responsibly.""""Most of the investors that I talk to, they look at Bitcoin truly as a commodity,"" Tinnen said, adding that they tend to guard against the cryptocurrency's occasional stabs downward with defensive investments elsewhere. ""I have to say that they are very enthusiastic, and sometimes that enthusiasm means that they are not always taking as clear-eyed a view as they should in order to hedge it.""Others, Dusaniwsky said, might not be the kind of traders you typically see on the stock market. They might not be familiar with the investment vehicles that are coming into the market. They might not know how to use, say, stop-loss orders, he said, or otherwise trade their positions more professionally, if the up-market this year heads south.""You've got a lot of sheep that are long Bitcoin,"" he said, ""and the wolves might be starting to get into the market.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:SEC Has This Advice For Investors In Bitcoin, Other CryptocurrenciesBefore You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

263,TAP,"Energy-drink maker Monster Beverage (MNST) reported mixed third-quarter results Wednesday after the market close.Estimates: Earnings per share growth of 21% to 40 cents, on revenue of $901 million, a 14% pop.Results: EPS rose to just 38 cents. Net sales rose 15% to $909.5 million.Stock: Monster Beverage fell 5.5% to 54.80 in after-hours trading, suggesting the stock will undercut a flat-base 57.35 entry. During the regular session, shares closed up 0.1% at 58 in the stock market today.Wall Street will likely be looking for signs indicating whether the company can keep growing internationally. Results in the U.S. could also be a focus as that segment laps easy comparisons.Monster's biggest growth prospects lie outside the U.S., analysts say, in large part through the expanded access to Coca-Cola's (KO) bottling and distribution network that the company gained via a deal announced in 2014.The company earlier this year began distributing through Coca-Cola bottlers in parts of the Caribbean and in nations like Jordan and Pakistan. In August, Monster said it would expand in Africa and that it continued to ""make progress"" toward a relaunch in India planned for this year.Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said she'd be watching for updates on those regions as well as plans to begin distribution via Coca-Cola bottlers in Taiwan and Vietnam. Trends surrounding Mutant, an ultra-caffeinated response to PepsiCo's (PEP) Mountain Dew, and Hydro, an ultra-caffeinated response to water, are also points of interest.Monster's results also come as soda demand wanes amid a wellness boom. Cannabis also appears likely to grow as a rival to alcohol and caffeine in the beverage industry. Some companies already use THC and CBD in coffees, teas and sports drinks. Cowen cites ""emerging access to legal cannabis"" as an investment risk for Monster.IBD'S TAKE: Even as investors in the cannabis industry try to get in on the ground floor, investing in the space in the U.S. can be tricky.Some alcohol companies have begun to stir as marijuana-related startups proliferate. Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ) late last month announced plans to buy a portion of a Canadian marijuana company Canopy Growth.

Divulge bite-size bits of detail in response to the audience's queries.If it's impractical to take live questions from the crowd, organize your speech as a series of commonly asked inquiries — and then answer them.""The problem with data is it's hard to digest if the speaker spits it out at you without stopping for 20 minutes,"" said Joey Asher, president of Speechworks, an Atlanta-based communication-skills training firm. ""If the audience can drive the process by asking questions, they're more likely to understand it better.""Tell a story. Before you plunge into the weeds, give people a reason to listen. Pose a riddle that you promise to solve. Build suspense as everyone wonders how you'll resolve a dilemma. Describe how a long-suffering individual or group can benefit from what you're about to propose.""Present data as part of a larger story that listeners care about,"" said Asher, author of ""Riveting Data."" ""Start with the big issue — what big concern people have — and use your story to put the data in context.""Invite feedback. Many speakers subject their audience to dozens of slides packed with graphs, statistics and bulleted lists. But don't feel obliged to march through a long slog of slides.""Don't overwhelm the audience with data,"" Asher said. ""Smart business folks have a tendency to be blind to the audience's ability to grasp this stuff.""To gauge the group's receptivity to hearing more details, solicit input. For example, invite listeners to vote on whether they want you to share supporting data — or skip ahead.Lighten your tone. If you're reciting reams of data, you may assume you should speak with dispassionate authority. And that can lead you to deaden your enthusiasm and adopt a detached, robotic delivery.But if you want people to retain facts and figures, turn your voice into an asset. Inject a dramatic flair into your speech, modulating your tempo and volume to emphasize the story behind the numbers.""Speak like you're speaking with intensity to a friend,"" Asher said. ""Avoid the corporate monotone and flat affectation that so many business people use.""Tap the power of silence. Separate your core message from the details by altering how you speak. Pause just before you make your most crucial points to signal that what's coming next carries special weight.""I speak slowly, look at the audience and use the power of the pause,"" said Molly McPherson, a communication consultant in Portsmouth, N.H. ""That way, they know what I'm about to say is important.""Pick a captivating visual. Start with the conclusion that you want everyone to reach. Then cite details to flesh out your case.A professional speaker and trainer, McPherson begins her presentations with what she calls a ""BLUF slide"" (bottom line up front) — a compelling visual image that encapsulates her overall thesis.Before presenting research data to marketers, for instance, she showed a timeline of a company's sales before and after it experienced a public relations crisis. From there, she analyzed how viral media can cause reputational damage to an organization.""It's the kind of slide where you don't have to write anything down,"" she said. ""It just sticks in your head.""MORE SECRETS TO SUCCESS:10 Steps To Overcoming Setbacks And Moving Ahead7 Essential Ingredients For Fueling A Product LaunchHow Lifelong Learning Lays The Path To A New CareerEmbrace Your Talents And Start A Moneymaking Venture

266,TAP,"Spirits have chipped away at beer's popularity for several years, but executives at Brown-Forman (BFB) see an even faster-growing kind of booze than spirits: straight-up hard liquor.X The owner of Jack Daniel's, Herradura tequila, Chambord and other kinds of liquor also ratcheted up its full-year profit and underlying net sales guidance and easily topped fiscal second-quarter forecasts on Wednesday. The results, as one analyst suggested during the company's earnings call, stood out as other companies in the consumer-staples industry struggle.CEO Paul Varga attributed that success, in part, to what the company has been doing for decades.""Our categories, where we're focused – American whiskeys, bourbons, increasingly tequilas, Irish – these are categories today that are growing ahead of even the distilled spirits category in the United States,"" he said during the company's earnings call. ""We think we're particularly well positioned.""The premium ends of those kinds of liquor, he said, tend to be the categories that are growing ahead of the market.Management also said that it was positioning its new Tennessee Rye for ""long-term success,"" and expected it to help sales for the rest of the year.That strategy could echo the way it has treated its Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and its cinnamon-flavored Tennessee Fire — both of which have been rolled out in recent years in attempt to draw millennial drinkers. Varga said ""it was a conscious choice to treat those more like brands,"" rather than novelty flavors.The company, in a statement, attributed the gains in the second quarter to ""improving economies in the emerging markets,"" and the appeal of Jack Daniel's, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester and Herradura tequila. Growth in Poland and Mexico was strong. Varga, during the call, singled out what he described as the rapidly-increasing popularity of Herradura Ultra in Mexico, where tequila isn't exactly in short supply.While the company suggested it was satisfied with its strategy to drive tequila sales, management said it might need to refine how it sells its single-malt scotch, which tends to be sold more uniquely, and at a higher price, than other kinds of liquor.The company said its Scotch brands aren't performing up to plans right now due to hiccups related to timing on bringing them to market.Shares were up 6.5% at 65.82 on the stock market today, a record close after surging as much as 9.6% intraday.IBD'S TAKE: On the search for even more stocks with actionable trading opportunities? Check out our Stock Lists page, where you can find stocks near buy zones, stocks hitting new highs, sector leaders, tech leaders, IPO leaders and more. Brown-Forman's fiscal Q2 earnings per share jumped 23% to 62 cents, while reported net sales rose 10% to $914 million. Wall Street expected EPS of 53 cents and revenue of $868 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.The company boosted its full-year EPS outlook to $1.90-$1.98, up from a prior view of $1.85-$1.95, with the midpoint above the consensus for $1.92. Brown-Forman now sees underlying net sales growth of 6%-7%, up from an earlier view for 4%-5%. The EPS forecast was helped by better sales, a slightly lower tax rate, and expectations for lower inventories.The company said it expects more modest growth in emerging markets for the rest of the fiscal year.Brown-Forman faces stiff competition from other big booze companies like Constellation Brands (STZ) — whose portfolio includes Corona, Kim Crawford wines and other spirits — and Diageo (DEO), whose brands include Smirnoff, Tanqueray and Captain Morgan. News surfaced earlier this year that Brown-Forman rejected a takeover offer from Constellation.But shares of Brown-Forman have climbed since late August, when the company raised its full-year EPS forecast and delivered estimate-topping first-quarter earnings, marking what Zacks analysts called a rebound from a ""dismal"" prior quarter.A lower tax rate and an easier foreign exchange environment influenced the full-year forecast at that time, but the company also held to its sales outlook despite troubled economies outside the U.S.Brown-Forman's results also arrive as the alcoholic beverage industry tries to figure out what to do with marijuana, around which a rapidly growing industry has formed as more U.S. states legalize the plant.Constellation in October said it agreed to take a 9.9% stake in the Canadian marijuana company Canopy Growth, while Molson Coors (TAP) said last month that the company had a team to gauge ""potential impacts and/or the opportunities"" of the cannabis industry.Brown-Forman last month said it was ""continuing to monitor"" the cannabis industry's development, without offering further detail. The subject did not come up during Wednesday's conference call.RELATED:Monster Beverage Tumbles Below Buy Point On Low-Energy EarningsAs Investors Eye Marijuana Industry, These Products May Go Mainstream

268,TAP,"Oil prices have started the new year at the highest levels since 2015, raising hopes for a sustained rally after more than three years of ups and downs that saw drastic role reversals among the industry's top players.X As investors sort out how much the industry will return to business as usual and how much a new normal will take root, here are five issues to watch:After prices crashed in 2014, oil giants took the unusual step of cutting dividends or halting buybacks to conserve cash. But they appear to have turned a corner last year after reining in investments and selling some assets. U.S. tax cuts will also free up more capital that could be returned to shareholders.In November, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) announced it would pay its first full dividend since 2015 and said that it would buy back at least $25 billion. In October, BP (BP) said it would buy back shares for the first time in three years. Look to Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) to see what they will do on dividends and buybacks.Collectively, oil companies aren't expected to dump cash into oil fields even if prices rebound. Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said investment in exploration will fall 7% this year to $37 billion vs. 2016 and will be down 60% from a peak in 2014. Spending by oil majors is expected to fall 4% but drilling is expected to rise slightly.Shale producers could make or break oil's rally after their emergence as market disrupters prompted OPEC in 2014 to step back from its swing producer role by allowing prices to sink.This past fall, U.S. exploration and production companies signaled that they are shifting their focus to cash-flow discipline rather than increasing spending to chase rising oil prices.""Investment community wants to start seeing a bit more upside. They are interested in profits rather than production. I would expect that to continue,"" said Jim Krane, an energy analyst at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.But Tom O'Donnell, a senior energy analyst at the consulting firm Wikistrat, doesn't think shale will remain disciplined for long, despite assurances from Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm.""When it looks like OPEC is getting control of the market that's when the other guys come back and the spotlight will be on them,"" O'Donnell said.Either way, output will keep rising, testing OPEC's plans to curb its own production to prop up crude. The Energy Information Administration expects U.S. production to hit 10 million barrels per day by the second-half of the year as companies like EOG Resources (EOG), Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Apache (APA) cut costs and improve well output.The world's top oil exporter is preparing for an IPO of its state-run oil giant and changed Saudi Aramco's status to a joint stock company at the start of the year to get it ready for a listing.The company's $2 trillion valuation would make it the world's largest publicly traded company and a 5% offering would make the IPO the biggest ever in proceeds generated. While exchanges in London and New York are jockeying to get a piece of the action, watch for a private placement of Aramco shares with China playing a major role.A private placement is easier than jumping through all the hoops the SEC would demand from a U.S. listing and it will also save the kingdom a lot of embarrassment if the company doesn't fetch it's lofty IPO price, said the Baker Institute's Krane.""It also links them up, creates a mutual dependence between Saudi Arabia and China, which is exactly what Aramco needs if it wants to stay in the game as oil demand starts to slip in the developed world,"" he added.Also be on the lookout for additional moves in U.S. shale. Saudi Arabia is reportedly looking at natural-gas assets in the Permian and Eagle Ford shale formations and is in talks with Tellurian (TELL), a U.S. liquefied natgas producer, as it looks to break into U.S. shale, according to the Wall Street Journal.Investing in shale would give Saudi Arabia access to the U.S. industry's ability to quickly start and stop production projects and use that knowledge back at home.""Saudi Arabia has a lot of shale, a lot of tight gas,"" Krane said. ""Aramco needs to get to the gas because Saudi Arabia is very short on natural gas. The only way to get to it without imports is to tap into shale.""The oil group will have a tricky balancing act this year as it tries to keep U.S. shale at bay, its own members in line and oil prices in a sweet spot.At OPEC's November meeting, Saudi Energy Minster Khalid Al-Falih said that ""the contribution of shale is going to be very much manageable"" next year.But the International Energy Agency has said 2018 ""might not be quite so happy for OPEC producers"" as U.S. output increases.Still, OPEC sees markets rebalancing late this year after agreeing in November to extend its production-cut deal to the end of 2018.OPEC's resolve will be tested if crude prices rise enough to trigger more shale growth and increasing calls from its own members to lift production cuts. In December, Kuwait's oil minister suggested that members will discuss an exit strategy at the biannual meeting in June.The Trump administration is making moves to roll back energy regulations. The Interior Department's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement wants to remove regulations that were enacted after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill that killed 11 people and released 4.9 million barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico.And on Thursday, the Interior Department issued a draft proposal to open about 90% of the U.S. outer continental shelf to offshore drilling leases between 2019 and 2024, in what would be the largest lease sale ever.Whether companies would actually boost offshore drilling is another story, as such ventures are typically costlier and require higher crude prices to be attractive.Despite the Trump administration's moves, the ending of the U.S. oil-export ban while Barack Obama was president will likely remain a bigger factor for U.S. energy producers.""The biggest energy steps were taken by Obama, the natural gas and oil exports, those were the big steps and now the opening of drilling and cutting some regulations on emissions is probably going to be small potatoes to legalizing exports,"" Krane said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

269,TAP,"Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ) on Friday said it has started building a team in Canada to work on marketing and research efforts with Canopy Growth Corp., a Canadian medical marijuana company it is investing in to develop non-alcoholic cannabis drinks.X While management said that investment would continue, what those drinks might look like and taste like — and when they might debut in Canada — remains unclear. Part of the company's uncertainty stems from how it's interpreting marijuana laws in Canada, particularly over whether Canada's government considers beverages ""edibles.""CEO Rob Sands said during Constellation's third-quarter earnings conference call that it was ""kind of unclear whether they're lumping beverages"" into the edibles category. Recreational usage of marijuana in Canada is set to become legal this year, possibly this summer. Edibles become legal in 2019.Even though no firm details were available on the kinds of products the companies roll out in Canada, Sands said that Tweed, a cannabis company that Canopy owns whose website showcases a small-town aesthetic, had ""a lot of potential."" Canopy would likely handle more of the sales side in Canada, Sands said.Constellation as of now does not have plans to invest in other cannabis companies, Mike McGrew, vice president of corporate communications at the company, said in an interview.Constellation's earnings come amid speculation about how marijuana, which more states have legalized in recent years, might affect beer sales. But when asked about how recreational legalization in California changed the landscape, Sands downplayed the possible impact.""We don't really expect to see any impact from that,"" Sands said. ""I think that one of the things that people don't necessarily appreciate is that cannabis has been generally available as medical marijuana and pretty accessible to almost everybody for 16 years.""The company reported mixed fiscal third-quarter results Friday and approved a new $3 billion share repurchase. Earnings per share rose 2% to $2, topping estimates for $1.87, while sales fell 1% to $1.799 billion, shy of expectations for $1.863 billion.Constellation also raised its full-year EPS outlook to $8.40-$8.50, with the midpoint above consensus for $8.43. Full-year beer sales are seen up 9%-11%.Management said the guidance didn't reflect the impact of the tax reform bill that President Trump signed into law last month. But they said they expected good things, generally, from the bill.Shares sank 2.75% to 219.59 on the stock market today, moving further from an end-of-year breakout buy point but closing above the 50-day moving average.Molson Coors (TAP) gained 1.1%, while Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) added 1%. Brown-Forman (BFB), the maker of Jack Daniel's, inched up 0.2%.Among pot-related stocks and ETFs, ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJX) advanced 2.8%, and AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT) dipped 0.6%. Cannabidiol drug developer Insys Therapeutics (INSY) popped 8.5% while Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG), which has been bulking up its hydroponics business, rose 1.4%.IBD'S TAKE: Even as investors in the cannabis industry try to get in on the ground floor, investing in the space in the U.S. can be tricky.Constellation in October said it would take a 9.9% stake in Canopy Growth Corp, and on Friday said it had a $217 million unrealized gain in reported basis results from that investment. Constellation would not sell products in the U.S. or any other area unless it was legal at all levels of government. Canopy Growth said Friday it won't operate in the U.S.And what, exactly, legal pot might mean for the alcohol industry got a lot cloudier on Thursday. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded instructions, issued during the Obama years, that advised U.S. authorities to lay off states that opted to make marijuana legal, as long as they kept it within the state and away from minors, gangs and criminal groups.""In deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute under these laws with the Department's finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions,"" the memo said.Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said the decision wouldn't radically alter the situation in states where marijuana is legal, with some states' attorneys general unlikely to crack down.And while legalized recreational use of cannabis is seen as a threat to alcohol consumption, Azer has argued Constellation is the least vulnerable, saying it is able to ""play across wine and spirits,"" which comprise roughly 30% and 5% of the company's sales, respectively.She added that its beers like Corona appeal more to Hispanic consumers — who, research shows, were found to be less likely to use cannabis than whites and African Americans — and to women, who were found to be less likely to use it than men.""We see this as an emerging global trend that has been emerging for years,"" McGrew said of the cannabis market, ""and we don't see that going back.""YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:This Beer Giant, Like Constellation Brands, Is Eyeing The Pot MarketStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

272,TAP,"Some of the world's biggest derivatives brokerages criticized plans by U.S. exchanges to offer bitcoin futures and options, saying the contracts have been rushed to market without proper consideration of the risks.The brokerages, who laid out their concerns in an open letter via the Futures Industry Association on Wednesday, said exchanges failed to get enough feedback from market participants on margin levels, trading limits, stress tests and clearing. Highlighting bitcoin's elevated volatility and reliance on unregulated venues for pricing, the brokerages also questioned whether exchanges had the tools to prevent market manipulation.Misgivings among the FIA's members, who include Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), underscore the controversy surrounding bitcoin as it moves from the fringes of finance toward the mainstream. CME Group (CME) and Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) both used an expedited self-certification process to approve the listing of bitcoin futures, hoping to tap investor demand after the cryptocurrency's more than 1,400% rally this year.""A more thorough and considered process would have allowed for a robust public discussion among clearing member firms, exchanges and clearinghouses,"" the FIA said in its letter, which was addressed to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and signed by FIA Chief Executive Officer Walt Lukken.IBD'S TAKE: Are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies real investments or a speculator's game? Individual investors should be extremely cautious about diving into this new area. Read this feature about Bitcoin risks and possible gains first.  While the letter is unlikely to change the exchanges' plans, it raises questions about how many brokerages will participate once bitcoin derivatives start trading later this month. Some dealers, particularly the so-called clearing members required to stand behind client trades, are concerned about their exposure if the cryptocurrency's extreme volatility leads to trader defaults. There should have been a public discussion about whether a separate guarantee fund — used to limit the impact of defaults — was warranted for the new contracts, the FIA said.The exchanges were allowed to offer bitcoin products after pledging to regulators that they comply with the law. Cboe will start trading futures on Dec. 10, while CME's contracts are set to debut on Dec. 18. The products will be subject to CFTC oversight.Bitcoin, which surged past $17,000 for the first time on Thursday before retreating Friday, has received mixed reviews on Wall Street. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has called the cryptocurrency ""a fraud,"" while Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, said recently that it's too early for his bank to need a bitcoin strategy. Franklin Templeton's Mark Mobius called it a bubble, but added that ""bubbles can last a long time."" Some hedge funds are waiting for futures to bet against it, more than half a dozen people trading the assets told Bloomberg News.The FIA said its members have reservations about the reliability of prices underlying the bitcoin contracts. Some of the venues on which the cryptocurrency trades have suffered hacks and breakdowns. Bitcoin plunged nearly 20% in less than 90 minutes on Nov. 29 after reports of intermittent outages at cryptocurrency exchanges struggling to keep up with user interest.Bitcoin is ""a commodity unlike any the commission has dealt with in the past,"" CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo said in a Dec. 1 statement. ""We expect that the futures exchanges, through information sharing agreements, will be monitoring the trading activity on the relevant cash platform.""CFTC spokeswoman Erica Elliott Richardson said that Giancarlo has been ""clear that market participants should take note that the relatively nascent underlying cash markets and exchanges for bitcoin remain largely unregulated markets over which the CFTC has limited statutory authority, and that investors should be aware of the potentially high level of volatility and risk in trading these contracts.""Some brokerages are skeptical.""We remain apprehensive with the lack of transparency and regulation of the underlying reference products on which these futures contracts are based and whether exchanges have the proper oversight to ensure the reference products are not susceptible to manipulation, fraud, and operational risk,"" the FIA said in its letter.RELATED:How To Decide If Bitcoin Is Safe For You To TradeBitcoin Tumbles From Frenzied Run; JPMorgan's Dimon Still 'Highly Skeptical'This Is When You Can Start Trading Bitcoin FuturesBitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And Trends

277,TAP,"Molson Coors (TAP) CEO Mark Hunter says the brewer has a team to evaluate the ""potential impacts and/or the opportunities"" of the booming cannabis industry, as other big beer companies like Constellation Brands (STZ) try to gain exposure amid questions about how marijuana's popularity might affect alcohol sales.XThe remarks about Molson's attempts to gauge the marijuana industry came during the company's third-quarter earnings call Wednesday.""And obviously, being based here in Colorado, we're very familiar with cannabis, as it's been legalized here,"" CEO Hunter said during the call.He added that Molson was developing ""a range of responses"" that would be discussed over time, but did not elaborate.""I think the important thing is to make sure we don't get caught in some kind of adrenaline rush,"" he said.His remarks followed Constellation Brands' announcement on Monday that it had agreed to take a 9.9% stake in the Canadian medical cannabis company Canopy Growth. Constellation CEO Rob Sands said the investment was part of its plans to identify ""early stage consumer trends.""IBD'S TAKE: Even as investors in the cannabis industry try to get in on the ground floor, investing in the space in the U.S. can be tricky.THC and CBD — the components in cannabis that make people feel what they do when they consume it — already appear in coffee, tea, candies, honey and other edibles and drinkables. Some bars even serve cannabis cocktails.However, Constellation, which owns Corona, as well as Jack Daniel's maker Brown-Forman (BFB) and Samuel Adams' maker Boston Beer (SAM), all cite increased pot use or legalization as a possible business risk.Brown-Forman told IBD that ""we are continuing to monitor the development of the cannabis market, but really don't have anything more to say about it at this time.""Boston Beer and Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) were not immediately available for comment on how they're approaching the cannabis market.Consumption of mass-market, ""shotgunnable"" beer like Bud Light, Coors Light and Miller Lite has slid steadily over the past several years, according to Beer Marketer's Insights statistics cited by the Wall Street Journal. Craft beer and spirits have become more popular over that time.Molson Coors fell 2.4% in the stock market today, not far from last week's two-year low.

The only way to get to it without imports is to tap into shale."" Tellurian shares were up 2.7% on the stock market today.Chevron (CVX), which is a major holder of Permian acreage, rallied 0.9% to 120.89. Exxon Mobil (XOM), which is doubling its Permian holdings, added 0.5%. EOG Resources (EOG), a big Eagle Ford player, climbed 2.1%. Cheniere Energy (LNG), which owns the Sabine Pass export terminal in Louisiana, rose 1 cent.Chevron closed just shy of retaking a 120.99 buy point. Exxon, EOG and Cheniere are all approaching entries in bullish consolidations.U.S. crude rose 0.9% to $58.09 a barrel on a bigger-than-expected drop in domestic inventories. Brent crude climbed 1.2% to $64.56.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Saudi Arabia uses roughly 1 million barrels per day of oil in the summer months to produce electricity to run air conditioners, but the kingdom is looking at using natural gas for electricity production and send its oil overseas.The kingdom would need up to 12 million tons of LNG a year if it switched to natgas for electricity production, energy consultants Poten & Partners said, according to the Journal.But Saudi Arabia is also looking at importing natgas from closer to home as Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said Riyadh was considering  gas from the Mediterranean Sea and East Africa. Russia is also eyeing sales to the kingdom.Any shale acquisitions would diversify Aramco as it looks to place 5% of the company on a global stock exchange or put up shares in a private offering.Saudi Aramco won't be the first Middle Eastern country to invest in U.S. shale; the UAE's Mubadala sovereign fund has invested in a private equity firm in U.S. shale, the report said.RELATED:U.S. Oil Inventory Drops But Output Continues Record-Setting StreakEnergy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

296,TAP,"For years, the talk around China is how the world's most populous country is moving from a manufacturing-heavy base to a consumer-focused economy. The Global X China Consumer ETF (CHIQ) is betting on that long-term trend, having among its top holdings such stock market leaders as Alibaba Group (BABA) and Melco Resorts (MLCO).XThe exchange traded fund owns some of the largest and most recognized consumer brands in China. Many of the 40 stocks in the ETF are traded in Hong Kong or mainland China, but some are well-known names to U.S. investors.Alibaba Group, the giant online retailer and digital media company, is the largest holding, with more than 5% of the fund's weighting. The stock has been a winner, up more than 75% from a 104.67 buy point in February.Casino operator Melco Resorts, online retailer JD.com (JD) and tutoring schools New Oriental Education (EDU) and TAL Education (TAL) also are among the major holdings. Most have performed well in 2017, but some such as TAL are cooling off after huge runs.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for actionable stocks?

It's primarily a large-cap fund, with an average capitalization of $23.5 billion.Looking at the most recent economic reports, you might think it's time to tap the brakes on China. GDP growth slowed to 6.8% in Q3 from 7.5% a year earlier, and is well off the peak 15% growth under previous President Hu Jintau.Economic policies introduced in 2015 ""called for a slower pace of growth as the country's economy matures and transitions from a production-oriented focus to a services-based and consumption-oriented economy,"" analysts at Wells Fargo Investment Institute wrote in a report. ""While we expect Chinese economic growth to slow in the coming years, we also anticipate that policymakers will actively utilize credit levers to help cushion the slowdown.""The slowdown has not kept China equities from rallying. The MSCI China index surged nearly 50% from Jan. 1 to the end of October, according to Bloomberg data cited by Global X.Global X's own take on China is that the strongest economic theme is the rising spending power of China's middle class. Jay Jacobs, a Global X analyst, wrote in a Nov. 8 report that holiday and travel sales reflect that growth.China's Singles Day saw $17.8 billion in total sales on Nov. 11 last year, 32% above 2015's figures and six times more than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined in the U.S.The ETF also appears to be forming a flat base, but still has a way to go before it climbs back to the all-time high of 21.23 seven years ago. The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

297,TAP,"Walt Disney (DIS) fell notably short of revenue forecasts, posting a surprise decline, as Sports Illustrated reported that over 100 more layoffs are set to take place at ESPN after Thanksgiving.XBut a slew of breaking news on the conference call helped reverse the stock's late laggard action on Thursday, as Chief Executive Bob Iger announced the launch of a brand new ""Star Wars"" trilogy, said the new Disney-only streaming platform would be priced ""substantially below"" Netflix (NFLX), and gave the new ESPN direct-to-consumer service a name: ESPN Plus.Though analysts no doubt had some major questions, chief among them, ""What's going on with the reported talks to buy the bulk of 21st Century Fox (FOXA)?"", Disney management would only say that it does not comment on press speculation.The Mouse disappointed analyst forecasts for growth to $1.12 in per-share earnings on revenue of $13.15 billion, unexpectedly reporting 3% declines on both the top and bottom lines to $1.07 in earnings per share, excluding items, on $12.78 billion in revenue.Shares initially sank, then reversed higher for a 0.8% gain in late trading in the stock market today, after ending the regular session up 1.5% to 102.68. Disney had logged a solid rise going into earnings, prompted by a CNBC report Monday that 21st Century Fox had held now-inactive talks to sell most of itself to its larger media peer.Iger offhandedly unloaded a number of juicy bits of breaking news, telling those on the call that Disney had struck an agreement with ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" director Rian Johnson for a new three-picture deal. Johnson will write and direct the first of the new ""Star Wars"" trilogy, said Lucasfilm.The new Disney-only streaming platform, which is set to rival Netflix when it rolls out in 2019, will feature Disney, Pixar and Marvel content for a total of ""thousands"" of hours of content, he said.Netflix shares dipped slightly late after closing down 1.3% to 193.90. Fox, which had reportedly held talks to sell most of itself to the House of Mouse, rose 2.2% Thursday, adding to its big weekly gain after reporting solid quarterly results late Wednesday.The upcoming ad-supported ESPN Plus service will launch in the spring, announced Iger, adding that Disney will discuss pricing at a later date.Some analysts have argued that Disney's studio hits and theme parks are enough to offset weakness at ESPN. Operating income from Disney's Media Networks segment, which houses ESPN, dropped 12% to $1.475 billion as subscribers and average viewership declined.But Studio Entertainment Q4 operating income skid even more sharply, dropping 43% year over year. Consumer Products & Interactive Media fell 12%, while Parks and Resorts rose 7%.Only the theme parks segment topped operating income expectations, according to CNBC, citing StreetAccount estimates.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.Disney took some heat this week for its decision — then reversal — to ban Los Angeles Times film critics from press screenings after the outlet's investigative unit published an expose on Disney's contributions to the city of Anaheim, where Disneyland is located. Critics groups banded together to boycott Disney films in response.

303,TAP,"Discount carrier Frontier Airlines is set to get a whole bunch of new jets that could give it more options as it skirmishes with United Airlines (UAL) over cheap fares.XBoeing (BA) rival Airbus (EADSY) on Wednesday announced a deal to sell 430 jets to Frontier Airlines and three other partner airlines of Bill Franke's Indigo Partners, a big investor in discount airlines, in a deal valued at as much as $49.5 billion.The memorandum-of-understanding agreement, which Airbus said was its ""largest single announcement ever,"" was announced at the Dubai Airshow. It would hand Frontier 100 A320neo jets — a narrow-body jet that usually seats around 150 people — and 34 A321neos, which typically seat around 185 people.The remaining A320s and A321s would go to other ultra discounters when the agreements with each are finalized: Wizz Air in Hungary, JetSmart in Chile, and Volaris in Mexico.""This significant commitment for 430 additional aircraft underscores our optimistic view of the growth potential of our family of low-cost airlines, as well as our confidence in the A320neo Family as a platform for that growth,"" Franke, managing partner of Indigo, said in a statement on Wednesday.United Airlines closed up 0.5% on the stock market today, Delta Air Lines (DAL) rose 0.9%, while American Airlines (AAL) climbed 3%, and Southwest (LUV) added 1.6%. Ultra low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) rallied 2.7%, and Alaska Air (ALK) jumped 4.5%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The deal comes as new types of jets give budget carriers more ways to make their business models work.Frontier, a carrier known for the ""National-Geographic""-esque portraits of animals on its tail fins, this year has made more of a push into Denver, a big, profitable United hub. United, which has tried to match Frontier and Spirit on some fares in its biggest markets, this summer said Frontier's move amounted to a tacit admission that cracks were forming in the ultra-low-cost model.United President Scott Kirby, during the carrier's second-quarter earnings call, said that in moving into a hub, Frontier was taking on the much more complicated duties of handling connecting flights. He added the battle was one that ""I guarantee United will win.""But Airbus' fuel-efficient A321 jets have made low-cost long-haul flights more viable. Such flights have become particularly common between Europe and the U.S. The cheaper airfares offered by the likes of Norwegian Air and WOW air have chipped away at the stronghold Delta, American and United had built up over the Atlantic.JetBlue (JBLU), which has been considering whether offer flights to Europe, has added A321neos to its fleet and has an option to take delivery of the Airbus A321LR — an alternate version of the A321neo.On its website, Airbus says the A321LR is ""ideally suited to transatlantic routes, and enables airlines to tap into new long-haul markets that were not previously accessible with current single-aisle aircraft.""RELATED:Boeing Reportedly Mulls 767 Passenger-Jet Reboot As '797' LoomsWill Delta Air Lines' Spat With Boeing Weigh On Massive Plane Order?American Signals Higher '18 Capacity; Another Carrier Warns On CostsUnited Airlines Dives On Disastrous Earnings Call; Rival Carriers Fall

The latter pointed the Nikkei toward its first weekly loss since the first week of September. The benchmark gained 23.1% from Sept. 8 through an intraday high on Tuesday.The selling carried over into European trade, where Frankfurt's DAX dived 1.1%, while the CAC-40 in Paris slumped 0.7% and London's FTSE 100 was down 0.5% during their afternoon sessions.Blackstone Group (BX) President and Chief Executive Hamilton James told Politico that stocks have built in some expectation for tax cuts included in the federal tax package heading toward a vote in the House on Thursday.

Blackstone shares traded down 4% in early action.Wal-Mart led the Dow's declines, feeling some early pull following Target's (TGT) third-quarter report. Target opened 9% lower after reporting a smaller-than-expected third-quarter earnings decline and revenue growth in line with analyst forecasts. But management warned of a ""highly competitive"" holiday season. Shares ended up 15% from a June low, attempting to climb out of an 18-month consolidation.Apple posted an early 1.5% loss, possibly due to quarterly results reported in Taiwan Wednesday by Hon Hai Precision, also known as FoxConn, which assembles Apple's iPhones and other products. Hon Hai earnings fell 39%, almost to half of analyst expectations, largely owing to iPhone X production problems.The decline put Apple's shares less than 5% above the 160.97 buy point cleared on OCt. 27. Investors may want to review rules for stocks that give up gains above buy points. Oil-related names posted some of the S&P 500's biggest early declines, as oil prices backed off 1% and threatened a second day of declines. Drilling contractors Ensco (ESV), Transocean (RIG) and Diamond Offshore (DO) all dropped more than 4%.Sorl Auto Parts (SORL) rocketed 36% higher after reporting a 159% earnings gain and a 59% advance in revenue for its third quarter. The move follows Tuesday's 16% gain by rival Advanced Auto Parts (AAP), following its third-quarter results. Advanced Auto dipped 2% at the open.Car lot operator CarGurus (CARG) drove ahead 7% in opening trade after reporting a 56% sales gain and earnings of two cents a share in its third quarter, and raising its fourth-quarter revenue guidance above consensus views. The new issue ended Tuesday 86% above its October 12 IPO price.IBD 50 stock YY (YY) swung up 7%, as Jefferies upgraded shares to buy from hold. YY reported a healthy third-quarter beat late Tuesday. The gain put the stock in a buy range, on a rebound from support at its 10-week moving average.Consumer price data were mixed for October, with the Labor Department putting its Consumer Price Index up 0.1%, for the month — down from September's 0.5% gain, but in line with estimates. Core prices, minus energy and food, rose 0.2%, above the prior month's 0.1% gain and also in line with forecasts.Manufacturing growth slowed sharply in November, leaving the New York Federal Reserve's Empire State Manufacturing Survey at 19.4 for the month. That was down from the unexpected spike to 30.2 in October, and well below expectations for a more mild slowdown, to a reading of 26.Retail sales also slowed, edging up just 0.2% in October, according to Commerce Department estimates. That was still better than the downshift to a 0.1% gain expected by economists. Sales had jumped 1.9% in September. Minus auto sales and gas, sales rose 0.3%, just below projections for a 0.4% advance.September business inventories estimates, also from the Commerce Department, arrive at 10 a.m. ET, followed by the Energy Information Administration's weekly oil stockpiles report at 10:30 a.m. ET.Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Sally Beauty (SBH) are among the few companies scheduled to report after today's close.RELATED:The Big Picture: Stocks Fall Modestly As A Few Warnings Lights AppearThese 5 Key Earnings Are On Tap: Investing Action PlanIt Just Took 10 Days For This Stock To Trigger A Rare Hold RuleTrump Is Close To Big Wins On Tax Cuts And ObamaCare

305,TAP,"The Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate steady on Wednesday, but left little doubt that the next hike is on tap for December.The post-meeting statement signaled no change from the Fed's policy of continuing to gradually adjust rates higher.""Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2% in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee's 2% objective over the medium term,"" the statement read.The status quo, at least according to Fed members' projections in December, called for one more rate hike this year and three in 2018. While the latter is far from clear, markets see a December hike as a virtual certainty.President Trump said Wednesday that he will announce his nomination for Federal Reserve chief on Thursday afternoon. He praised current chief Janet Yellen, but is expected to pick Fed Gov. Jerome Powell.Treasury yields slipped ahead of the Fed statement, possibly related to a delay in Republicans releasing tax legislation. After the statement, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped further, while major stock indexes moved higher.Financial stocks, which can benefit from higher interest rates, held onto gains after the Fed news. Wells Fargo was up 0.1% at 56.21 after briefly crossing a buy point at 56.70.IBD'S TAKE: A buy point is the point at which an investor has the best opportunity for near-term gains. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks poised for near-term gains.Despite inflation undershooting the Fed's 2% target, policymakers are still expressing confidence that inflation will eventually reach that goal in the medium term. The vote to leave rates unchanged was unanimous.Competitive factors have contributed to low inflation in a wide array of industries, and that may be slow to change. However, the Fed expects that upward pressure on wages will eventually feed through to price pressures.There is pretty clear evidence that wage pressures are building. Daily Treasury statements show that federal income and employment taxes withheld from worker paychecks are now growing at 6% from a year ago, according to an IBD analysis. That's the best sustained rate of growth since early 2008. and a signal that 3% wage growth may finally have arrived.The tax receipt data, which offer the broadest, most timely read on the health of the labor market, are consistent with what companies are saying and doing. Target (TGT) announced last month that it's hiking its minimum wage to $11 an hour this month as it recruits 100,000 seasonal workers. Target eventually plans to raise its minimum wage to $15.RELATED:This Surprising Economic News May Move Fed And MarketsHurricanes Hit Payrolls, But Wage Gains May Speed Up Fed Rate HikesDid Target's Wage Hike Just Prove Fed Hawks Right — Or Wrong? Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

307,TAP,"Walt Disney's (DIS) answer to Netflix (NFLX) won't have as much content, but it will be priced ""substantially below"" the streaming entertainment service, and that — in combination with a few other major announcements Thursday — has been enough to make investors happy enough to dismiss the media titan's surprise drop in profit and revenue.XThe rival platform, which is set to include an impressive roster of content from Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, will make its debut in the latter half of 2019, said Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger on the call.In addition to ""thousands of hours"" of Disney movies and TV shows, there's also a live-action ""Star Wars"" series, a TV spinoff of ""Monsters, Inc.,"" a ""High School Musical"" series and a Marvel show in the works.Having also decided to pull Marvel and Lucasfilm movies off Netflix, the moves signal that Disney is not afraid to draw upon its vast well of intellectual property to lure in new subscribers.Furthermore, the studio will produce ""four or five"" movies a year, exclusively for the Disney service.""We continue to believe Disney's IP will drive significant value over the next five years despite the decelerating pace of growth at ESPN and recent investments into direct-to-consumer products,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers, calling Disney the ""best positioned"" to leverage its content amid a fragmented media terrain.Even as Iger played down talk of Disney's streaming platform aiming to be a ""Netflix killer,"" calling the company ""a good partner of ours,"" he made his goals for content quite clear.""As I've said earlier, we're going launch this thing pretty aggressively,"" he said on the call Thursday. ""But I think what you'll see is a ramp-up over time of production spending that will start with a product that we believe is representative of the great brands and franchises that we have, between Marvel and Disney and Pixar and 'Star Wars,' and then grow from there.""Management declined to comment on media reports that 21st Century Fox (FOXA) had explored a sale of most of itself to Disney, but some are wondering if Disney will look to bulk up its library of content even further as it seeks to attract viewers of its stand-alone service.Needham analyst Laura Martin said the success of previous acquisitions and the lower streaming-service price point ""could be a key strategic driver for the acquisition of FOXA or another large and diversified film and TV library.""Disney rose about 2% to 104.79 in the stock market today. Iger's newsy bombshells late Thursday sent slumping shares reversing higher, despite the media conglomerate's unexpected profit and revenue declines that initially hit the stock. Disney shares climbed 6.2% for the week, mostly on the reported Fox talks.Netflix investors are taking notice of the Disney threat. Netflix fell 1% to 192.02 on Friday after falling as low as 189.50, briefly undercutting a 190.05 buy point. The streaming internet giant broke out of a cup-with-handle base on Oct. 5, with the catalyst being its plan to hike subscription rates.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.News that there will be a whole new ""Star Wars"" trilogy sent the internet rippling, and the films are no doubt expected to be blockbusters unless audiences start to feel Lucasfilm fatigue — which they haven't, so far.ESPN, the focus of many an earnings call past, largely escaped scrutiny Thursday, thanks to Iger's announcement that the new direct-to-consumer, ad-supported streaming platform will be called ESPN Plus and will be set to debut in the spring of 2018.RELATED:Disney To Price OTT Service Below Netflix, Announces New Star Wars Trilogy21st Century Fox Loses A Prince As Disney Buzz Continues; Earnings On Tap'We Can't Believe This Is Serious': Does A Disney-Fox Deal Make Sense?Walt Disney Held Recent Talks To Buy Most Of 21st Century Fox: CNBCAT&T To Hold DOJ Pick To His Word Amid Trump CNN PressureNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

309,TAP,"Regulations: Few people following ObamaCare paid any attention to section 4205 of the law, which requires chain restaurants and vending machines to post calorie labels. But this little-noticed provision is a testament to the folly of central planning.XThis Tuesday, the FDA released a ""guidance document"" on its calorie count regulations that is meant to help restaurants, delis, pizza joints, buffets and the like figure out how to comply with this ObamaCare mandate. All it did was show how ridiculous the whole effort is.Democrats added the calorie mandate to ObamaCare on the assumption that forcing restaurant chains to put calorie counts on their menus would help tackle the nation's obesity problem. Sounds simple enough to enact.But life is always far more complicated that Washington bureaucrats think.In fact, it took the Obama administration more than four years to hammer out the regulations. First it had to figure out things like ""what is a menu""? Is a flyer a menu? How about an ad in a newspaper? The resulting definition was 171 words long. They had to define what a ""restaurant-type food"" and a ""combination meal"" is. And so on.Once the rules came out, Obama officials twice delayed their implementation after various businesses complained that complying with them was impossible. How, for example, is a pizza joint supposed to provide calorie counts on more than a billion different pizza combinations?Soon after taking office, the Trump administration delayed the rules yet again — they're now set to take effect in May 2018 — and promised to help businesses by making them more flexible and less burdensome.Tuesday's guidance document is supposed to show how the FDA is doing that. But it just muddies the waters further.Is a newspaper insert a menu that would require calorie listings? The FDA says it ""generally"" isn't. Generally? What about specifically?""If the primary purpose of these materials is to 'entice' customers into the covered establishment, then we would not consider them to be a primary writing, and they would not require calorie declarations."" So simple.Does a restaurant have to post calorie counts on draft beer? ""It depends,"" is the FDA's ""guidance."" Is the beer poured from a tap that isn't listed on the menu? Then no. Is it a seasonal beer that's on the menu more than 60 days a year, then yes. Less than 60 days, no.What about ""chef's creations""? Seasonal offerings? Soups of the day? It all depends.Will anyone actually use this calorie information? Will it change anyone's eating habits? Or cut down on the obesity epidemic? Who knows. Some research has shown that posting calorie counts doesn't have much impact on what people eat. So, except for keeping the FDA's food police busy, the requirement will likely all be for naught.This is madness, but it's what always happens when Washington bureaucrats try to stuff inordinately complex private sector arrangements into neat little regulatory boxes. The rules become hopelessly complicated, endlessly lobbied and tweaked, create new costs and hassles for business owners, and rarely achieve whatever goal was intended.If calorie label regulations are this hideously onerous, just imagine what it must be like for businesses that have to comply with really complicated and costly rules.RELATED:Trump's $33 Billion Tax Cut You Didn't Know You Just GotRegulations Cut: Another Yuuuge Trump Promise FulfilledKilling Small Business With (Regulatory) KindnessClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

312,TAP,"Futures for the S&P 500 index fell modestly vs. fair value Thursday morning. That follows a wave of reports late Wednesday, including from Facebook (FB) and Tesla (TSLA). Investors already are turning their eyes to Apple (AAPL), a new Federal Reserve chief, and the GOP tax plan on tap for Thursday.Apple's earnings are crucial not only because it's the world's most valuable company, but because its results and guidance will influence a wide array of suppliers and other iPhone-related companies. Apple chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) and OLED technology specialist Universal Display (OLED) closed below buy points on Wednesday.S&P 500 index futures lost 0.2% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.2%. Dow futures retreated nearly 0.1%. In addition to Facebook and Tesla, cybersecurity and fiber-optic stocks were notable overnight losers.Facebook earned $1.59 a share, crushing views for $1.28, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue surged 47% to $10.3 billion, ending a four-quarter string of decelerating growth. Facebook also sees slower expense growth going forward.The social media giant routinely beats EPS views, but even by that measure Q3's results were outstanding. Earnings topped the consensus by 24%. In the prior four quarters, Facebook beat by 4%, 11%, 18% and 17%.But Facebook said that revenue growth will slow in 2018, while expenses surge 45%-60%. The social giant plans to double capital spending next year. Facebook will beef up security in the wake of pro-Russia forces exploiting its network, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg said would affect profitability. It also wants to keep expanding video.So shares fell 0.6% early Thursday to 181.60, off modest overnight lows. Facebook closed up 1.4% to 182.66 in Wednesday stock market trading, part of a 7.1%, four-day surge that included Friday's breakout past a 175.59 flat-base buy point.Overnight action often doesn't translate to how a stock will perform in the next trading session.IBD'S TAKE: The latest wave of top stocks flying or crashing following quarterly releases drives home this point: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Tesla lost $2.92 a share adjusted in the third quarter, worse than the $2.45 billion expected. Revenue growth narrowly topped views, but the electric car maker burned through $1.4 billion in cash in Q3. Tesla has $3.53 billion in cash, up from the end of Q2, after raising more capital for the Model 3 ramp up.Tesla now says it'll produce 5,000 Model 3 sedans per week by the end of the first quarter, pushing back from earlier claims that it would reach that level by the end of 2017. Tesla produced just 260 Model 3 cars in Q3, far below the 1,500 that CEO Elon Musk had promised.Musk, on the earnings call, now says ""I don't want to get into the week to week (production rate) stuff.""Tesla tumbled 5.9% to 302 in premarket trading, which would be a six-month low and a plunge through its 200-day moving average. Tesla, which fell 3.15% to 321.08 on Wednesday, has been finding support at its 200-day line recently. It hasn't closed below that level this year.Apple is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.87, up 12% vs. a year earlier, as revenue rises 9% to $51.17 billion. But analysts' focus will be on production of the iPhone X, which will be in short supply when it goes on sale starting Friday.Apple shares closed down 1.3% to 166.89, still in range from a 160.97 cup-with-handle buy point cleared last Friday. Apple rose a fraction Thursday morning.But various iPhone plays had more trouble: Universal Display sank 2.6% to 142.70, back below a 145.40 entry after breaking out on Tuesday. Universal Display is not an Apple supplier. But it makes technology and parts used in making OLED screens, which are on the iPhone X. Universal Display reports earnings late Thursday.Chipmaker Broadcom fell 1.75% to 259.29 on Wednesday, finishing just below a 259.46 buy point surpassed on Monday. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), another iPhone chip supplier, sank 2.2% to 111.32, closing above a 110.71 entry after undercutting it intraday.Meanwhile, Qorvo (QRVO), another Apple chipmaker, late Wednesday topped quarterly views but gave weak guidance. Qorvo fell in late trading after retreating 1.8% on Wednesday, failing to close above a buy point once again — despite topping it intraday for a third straight session.President Trump is expected to name Fed Gov. Jay Powell as the next Federal Reserve chairman. He's considered a status quo pick in terms of monetary policy. The Fed left rates unchanged Wednesday, but is expected to raise by a quarter point at its December meeting.Meanwhile, Republicans are expected to release their tax proposal after a one-day delay, but they're struggling to fit their wish list of cuts within a budget framework of $1.5 trillion over 10 years.

314,TAP,"Cheaper flights to Hawaii may be coming soon, as Southwest Airlines (LUV) confirms it will finally fly to the Pacific islands with help from the latest Boeing (BA) 737 jets.XSouthwest has long hinted at — and passengers have long hoped for — such a move. The airline, which recently became the first in North America to fly the 737 Max 8, linked its decision to this new and upgraded Boeing model.""For us, it's the perfect fit for Hawaii,"" Chief Revenue Officer Andrew Watterson told Bloomberg. ""The Max has got 14% better range and 14% better fuel burn"" than the model it succeeded.The discount carrier plans to kick off services to Hawaii within the next two years, initially from California.Flights to Hawaii can be logistically challenging, but the 737 Max 8's flying range of about 3,500 nautical miles is enough to comfortably cover most flights from the West Coast to Hawaii.For Southwest, an advanced new reservation system is also making the flights there possible. It expects to lower fares to Hawaii, one of the most popular destinations for travel within the United States. Regulatory approvals are pending.Southwest shares closed up 0.4% at 58.81 on the stock market today, eyeing a 59.67 entry off a first-stage, cup-with-handle base. Hawaiian Airlines (HA) dived as much as 6% on the news, before trimming losses to 2.5%.

315,TAP,"Here's Your Investing Action Plan: what you need to know for Wednesday and beyond.Earnings season gets underway in earnest with reports from Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday and banking giants such as Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) later this week.XFor the third quarter as whole, S&P 500 earnings are expected to grow 2% from the same period last year on a 5% revenue gain, according to Zacks Investment Research. That follows double-digit profit growth in the first two quarters of 2017.The technology sector should earnings up nearly 10% as revenue grows 7%. While flagship names Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) will step up to the dock as November dawns, smaller names like Barracuda Networks (CUDA), out Tuesday night, are on tap this week.Estimates for the financial sector have notably worsened over the last two months, as last quarter's back-to-back hurricanes weigh on corporate profits, especially on insurers and reinsurers such as Travelers (TRV), American International Group (AIG), Chubb (CB) and Everest Re (RE).Insurers, who account for a quarter of the finance sector's total earnings, are expected to see earnings decline 25% vs. a year ago, contributing to a dip in Q3 earnings for the broad financial sector, according to Zacks.But both Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are estimated to grow adjusted profits and sales in the September quarter when they report Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.The impact of the storms on insurers may already be priced in, with AIG moving back toward a buy point of 67.57 after bottoming in early September and Progressive (PGR) crossing a 49.11 buy point off a flat base.Transporters and air carriers are also likely to see a hurricane-related knock on profit growth, but Delta Air Lines added 1.9% on the stock market today as the stock moves toward a 55.85 buy point ahead of the carrier's report on Wednesday.Analysts call for Delta earnings to shrink 9% to $1.54 as revenue rises 5% to $11.04 billion, Zacks said. Delta already has reported strong preliminary Q3 unit revenue figures, with United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) following suit on Tuesday.Finally, small-cap companies, which are not part of the S&P 500, should see earnings growth return in Q3. For the S&P 600 index as a whole, earnings are expected to be up 11% vs. a year ago on 5% higher revenue, snapping a run of earnings declines in three of the last four quarters.Small-cap stocks also have been leading in recent months.The finance, technology and energy sectors are likely to drive small-cap growth. Without the finance sector's contribution, small caps' Q3 earnings would drop 0.3%.RELATED:American, United Airlines Jump On Strong Q3 Unit Revenue; Delta On TapWal-Mart Sees 40% Online Sales Jump, Sets $20 Billion BuybackMove Over Techs, There's A New Sector Leader On Wall StreetNvidia Shares Jump As It Debuts Computer For Self-Driving Cars

318,TAP,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday said that the trans-Atlantic market would see the biggest quarter-to-quarter improvement in Q4, as business travel strengthens on Europe's emergence from a recession.XThat forecast comes even as low-cost, long-haul carriers in Europe have proliferated in the airspace above the Atlantic Ocean. Competition from those carriers has added a layer of stress for Delta, American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL), which have tried to shore up sales by adding a wider variety of high-end and low-end seating classes to their cabins.But the resilience in Delta's international business overall, management said on Wednesday's conference call to discuss the carrier's strong Q3 results and Q4 outlook, has been a bit of a ""surprise"" and a key aspect in driving positive unit revenue.Management said domestic performance would see the second-highest level of improvement. President Glen Hauenstein noted that the carrier hadn't seen any ""material decline"" in traffic to and from Las Vegas following last week's mass shooting which killed at least 58 people.""That was a surprise, and I hope it's not a sad commentary on the human state that we're getting used to this,"" he said.The company expects the Pacific region to see the third-best level of sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, followed by the Latin America region, where a string of hurricanes and an earthquake have ravaged the Caribbean and Mexico.Delta forecast Q4 passenger unit revenue — a key industry metric that looks at revenue as it relates to an airline's total flight coverage — to rise 2%-4%, with operating margins of 11%-13%. Wall Street expected Delta to forecast a roughly 1.5% unit-revenue gain for Q4, according to a Cowen research note last week. Meanwhile, CEO Ed Bastian vowed not to pay import duties on Bombardier's C Series jets, of which Delta has agreed to buy 75 worth $5 billion at list prices, after the U.S. imposed a 300% tariff amid claims the Canadian companies received illegal state aid. The airline may delay delivery of the jets, which are due to next year.Delta reported Q3 EPS of $1.57, down 8%, on revenue of $11.1 billion, up 5.5% — topping Zacks estimates for $1.54 and $11.037 billion.However, the carrier said non-fuel unit costs for the full year would be up roughly 4% as a result of a new profit-sharing plan, a depreciation of narrow-body jets and of flight cancellations resulting from bad weather. Management called that rate ""not sustainable"" but said that moving away from its cap on growth would help.""Capacity will play a part,"" CFO Paul Jacobson said on the call. ""We made a decision to cap capacity at 1% this year to improve revenue performance. But this also put pressure on costs. Returning to a more normalized growth rate next year will further benefit our CASM.""Shares of Delta closed up 0.7% at 53.07 on the stock market today, making its way toward a 55.85 buy point of a cup base. American Airlines (AAL) dipped 0.4% to 52.83 and United Airlines (UAL) eased 0.5% to 67.40. On Tuesday, American rose 4.8%, nearing a 54.58 buy point of a cup base, while United Airlines jumped 4.7% as both carriers said Q3 unit revenue would be better than expected.Southwest (LUV) gained 0.9% to 58.55. That stock is forming a base with a 64.49 buy point.JetBlue (JBLU) shares climbed 1.5% to 20.53 despite estimating that hurricanes reduced revenue by $44 million in Q3 and $70 million-$90 million in Q4, with adjusted EPS seeing a hit of 6-7 cents in Q3 and 10-13 cents in Q4.IBD'S TAKE: As investors fret over airlines' pricing and expansion plans, Elon Musk is looking way, way beyond. Here's a look at how SpaceX could upend companies like Boeing and the airlines. In recent months, many airline stocks have either threatened to undercut their postelection gains or actually undercut them. In recent days, however, those stocks have rebounded.Wall Street this summer has worried that an airfare discount battle between United, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Frontier Airlines in some of United's big airport hubs would swallow the rest of the industry. Those fears were followed by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria along with earthquakes in Mexico, which forced thousands of flight cancellations and prompted airlines to pull back on their financial forecasts.However, guidance this week and last from the big three airlines has indicated to analysts that airlines have kept airfare prices high enough to appease Wall Street.American, in an investor update on Tuesday, cited ""stronger than anticipated yield performance"" on airfares in raising its outlook for unit revenue.In a research note on Tuesday about United, Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said that ""Houston appears to have recovered a bit faster from Hurricane Harvey than United had originally anticipated"" and that ""drags from the (ultralow-cost carrier) pricing competition and lower demand in Guam appears to have stabilized (not better, but not worse).""Still, Southwest on Tuesday began a 72-hour sale of reduced-price tickets, some of which are advertised for as low as $49 one way. JetBlue, meanwhile, has announced a one-day sale for one-way fares as low as $31.Further out, Delta's recent decision to increase profit-sharing for its employees — by moving them all to a single, higher-paying plan from the existing two — could temper earnings.""Although we acknowledge the slight cost increase, part of our thesis on an improved airline industry rests on culture improvement and employee engagement in driving better operational outcomes,"" Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski said in a research note. ""With Delta's recent changes, we suspect the carrier has the most generous payout of the large airlines, begging the question whether others will follow.""Delta, on the call, said that it had always intended to have a single profit-sharing plan and that it would be good for employees.RELATED:Delta Air Lines Earnings: 3 Things To WatchAmerican, United Airlines Jump On Strong Q3 Unit Revenue; Delta On TapHere's Why Delta, JetBlue And Other Airlines Are Surging TodayUnited, American Both Wage Fare War, But Analyst Sours On One Airline

319,TAP,"A big day for shares of Wal-Mart (WMT) on Tuesday helped push the Dow Jones industrial average to another record high, while Nvidia (NVDA) helped the Nasdaq composite's cause with a record high of its own.XAt the close, the Dow added 0.3%, the S&P 500 rose 0.2% and the Nasdaq edged up 0.1%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in more than 20% Monday's levels, but keep in mind volume was light Monday due to the Columbus Day holiday.Oil drillers outperformed as crude oil reclaimed the $50 level with conviction. Benchmark WTI crude oil futures for November delivery settled at $50.92 a barrel, up 2.7%, ahead of weekly inventory data WednesdayIn the stock market today, Wal-Mart was a big winner in the Dow, up 4.5% to 84.13, after the company at its investor day forecast a 40% jump in e-commerce sales in fiscal 2019. It also declared a $20 billion share buyback. Wal-Mart is still in buy range after a breakout from a flat base with an 82.09 buy point.Elsewhere, airlines took flight after United Continental (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) offered up strong Q3 unit revenue and margin guidance. Shares of United jumped nearly 5%, but it's still 18% off its high with its 200-day moving average around 71 looming large as a potential resistance. American Airlines, however, offers up a much better chart as it works on the right side of a cup-shaped base with a 54.58 buy point.

322,TAP,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials were little changed early Monday morning. Facebook (FB), Electronic Arts (EA), Workday (WDAY), Ferrari (RACE) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) all start the new week in flat bases.Most are highly rated. Facebook and Ferrari boast best-possible 99 Composite Ratings, meaning they outperform 99% of all stocks based on a variety of fundamental and technical factors. Electronic Arts has a Composite Rating of 98. Workday is at a strong 93 CR while Maxim Integrated is at a decent 83.Futures for  the S&P 500 index and Dow industrials were virtually unchanged vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.1%.The S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow industrials closed last week at or near record highs.XA flat base must be at least five weeks in length, but can be much longer. Within the base, the decline from the stock's high to low usually ranges within 10% to 15%. That minimal correction is typically a sign of strength, showing that the stock has resisted a large pullback.Facebook has been in a flat base since July 27, when the Nasdaq hit a short-term peak. The social networking giant traded tightly for several weeks. On Sept. 25, Facebook tumbled through its 50-day moving average, as many big-name techs were hit hard. That acted as a shakeout for weak holders. Shares bounced back, moving over its 50-day line by the end of that week. Facebook closed Friday at 172.23, about 2% below its 175.59 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: Flat bases, which require a minimum of five weeks, have been especially common in recent months. Learn more about this super growth stock pattern.Electronic Arts broke out on July 26 from a flat base with a 116.14 entry. Since then EA has largely moved sideways, just above or below the buy point. The video game maker currently is at 120.08, still in range from that old entry. But it's also now formed a flat base just above the prior consolidation. So it's a base-on-base pattern with a 122.89 buy point.Workday broke out of a 92.10 cup-with-handle on May 15. Since then the maker of cloud-based human resources and financial software has advanced, sometimes in choppy action, but never pulling back long enough for a proper consolidation. That is, until now. Workday has a new buy point of 111.55. Shares have risen 7 of the last 8 sessions, closing Friday at 110.23.Workday has become consistently profitable over the past year, with strong growth seen for several years.While Tesla (TSLA) always gets a lot of attention and General Motors (GM) has come in focus as stock surges, Ferrari has quietly been the top-performing auto stock all year, nearly doubling so far in 2017. The luxury car maker has a buy point of 118.20. Ferrari ended last week at 112.60, finding support so far at its rising 50-day moving average.The chipmaker has the longest flat base of the five stocks highlighted, going back four months. Maxim Integrated Products has a 49.80 buy point. Shares have been closing on that entry, settling Friday at 48.57.RELATED:The Big Picture: Stocks Keep Winning; These Bank Earnings Are On TapTracking These 5 Stocks At New Highs; 4 Are Still In Buy Range5 Dow Stocks Courting Buy Zones As Earnings Season BeginsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

323,TAP,"The stock market erased some of its small gains, and the Nasdaq composite was barely higher in afternoon trading Wednesday.XThe Nasdaq, up only 0.2% earlier, was up a fraction. Facebook (FB), a major Nasdaq component, was one to watch because it is trying to climb back above the 50-day moving average. It could be a key threshold for the social media stock as it tries to complete a base.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average held on to 0.1% increases. Dow component 3M (MMM) climbed past the 214.67 buy point of a flat base.The Russell 2000 was off 0.3% and at risk of ending an eight-day win streak. As The Big Picture noted, the small-cap index has been rallying sharply for weeks and seems due for a rest.Volume was tracking lower compared with the same time Tuesday. Advancers and decliners were about evenly split on the NYSE and Nasdaq. Automakers, utilities and homebuilders, one of the hottest industry groups, were leading today's market.Corning (GLW) broke out of a cup with handle. But volume was running at only about half its usual pace and the price increase also lacked power. The specialist in fiber optics, ceramics and other high-tech materials has turned itself around, posting EPS gains of 24%, 47%, 39% and 14% after several quarters of declining earnings.Boston Beer (SAM) cleared the 163.75 buy point of a cup with handle as volume climbed 30% more than average. Last month, Credit Suisse upgraded the maker of Samuel Adams beer to neutral from underperform and noted that Boston Beer could be acquired by private equity firms or Molson Coors (TAP).In the same industry, Constellation Brands (STZ) climbed 1% in some of the heaviest volume above average. The stock is finding support in a pullback to the 50-day moving average.Among stocks down in unusual volume, the two leading RV stocks slid as they cool off from rapid gains. Thor Industries (THO) fell nearly 2%, on track to end a seven-day win streak, and Winnebago Industries (WGO) gapped down to a loss of more than 6%. Stifel Nicolaus downgraded Winnebago to a hold rating, citing concerns that the stock has gotten overheated, reports said.Both stocks remain well-extended from their breakouts several weeks ago, but the abrupt break in their price uptrends warrants attention.RELATED:Thor Beats Fiscal Q4 Forecasts, Sees More Production Capacity GrowthTop RV Maker In Buy Range, But Will Hurricanes Help Sales?FANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google

332,TAP,"Last year, tennis great Venus Williams made news by becoming one of the financial backers of Ellevest, a new robo-advisor aimed at women. And more good news for the digital company followed: An SEC filing in August showed that Ellevest, which became fully operational last year, had raised a hefty $32.5 million in its latest round of funding.XImpressive? Most certainly. But evidently, no cause for alarm among traditional financial advisors who court women clients. To many of them, the new women-focused digital advisors, including Ellevest and WorthFM (SheCapital folded last year), still aren't a threat to their target market of typically upscale women, 50 or older, who prefer the human touch.Where the hunt for women clients is intensifying: Among traditional FAs themselves, who increasingly eye the long underserved but now hot market for women clients. And as more FAs zero in on this opportunity — advising women who control anywhere from $5 trillion to $14 trillion of wealth — they're creating new ways to tap into this perceived gold.""Financial advisors are strengthening their marketing, not because of robo-advisors, but because these traditional advisors are aggressively competing. And they believe they have a strong value proposition for women,"" says Dan Sondhelm, CEO of Sondhelm Partners, a growth strategist for financial advisors and asset managers.Among the steps financial advisors are taking, Sondhelm says: 1) spending more time with clients, either in-person or via videoconferences; 2) seeking more media exposure to build credibility and visibility; 3) creating more content, via blogs and social media, such as LinkedIn and Facebook; 4) seeking partnerships with influential women, such as lawyers and accountants; and 5) considering adding their own robo-service to accommodate smaller accounts and clients needing less personal attention.Among the steps advisors are taking is a broadening of their financial practice into a more holistic approach. Moves by specific advisors, especially over the last couple of years:Financial advisor Ellen Jordan, of Bryn Mawr Trust, about 16 months ago designed a program called Inspired Women's Wealth. It became Bryn Mawr Trust's first focused appeal to women as potential clients. To start, Jordan and associates compiled a list of women to contact, and early this year, began emailing them informational items of interest to women. Jordan also posted these items on social media. This September, Jordan will launch a series of free luncheons, featuring speakers on topics aimed to help women gain more sense of control over their finances. The results so far: The new program already landed the firm several new clients, says Jordan, senior vice president and women's wealth advisor at Bryn Mawr Trust.Resource Consulting Group, in Orlando, Fla., boasts an advisory team that's now 50% women — a fact that the firm is publicizing in local media, says Kimberly Sterling, vice president, shareholder and wealth advisor at the firm. This summer, Sterling was a presenter at a Minneapolis forum aimed at helping other firms better attract women clients and advisors. In addition, over the past two years, Resource Consulting has created events, including luncheons and workshops, with themes that address the issues of higher net worth women, among them, work-life balance and informing children about how to handle their expected inheritance. And that's not all: For the past eight years, the firm has been sponsoring a quarterly networking program for area professional women, called Intimate, Intelligent and Intentional, where participants can make business contacts, Sterling says.About two years ago, Kathy Fish, of Fish & Associates Financial Services, in Memphis, Tenn., began offering a free class entitled, Savvy Social Security for Women, that's now available four times a year. And last year she began teaching a seven-week, $400 course, called Wild Money (based on the book by that title), which Fish describes as a ""money coach,"" covering a gamut of personal finance issues for women. Since last year, the firm also has been sponsoring free Wine and Words get-togethers, featuring wine-tasting and a speaker addressing a financial topic.What's more, Fish's daughter, Kerry Jackson, who is an advisor at the firm, recently launched a young professionals' networking group for women — to help them meet each other and learn about financial planning issues. Says Fish, ""My daughter is targeting 25- to 40-year olds. And even she hasn't yet come up against robo-advisors.""But Barbara Friedberg, a freelance writer who publishes the website, Robo-Advisor Pros, points out that ""women are a huge market. There's room for women-focused robo-advisors in the marketplace.""Among the pluses of women-focused robos: Besides lower cost vs. fees charged by traditional advisors, experts cite ease-of-use and systems that factor in women's financial situations. Among the fortes of Ellevest, co-founded by Sallie Krawcheck, are broadly its goals-based investing and algorithms that take into account women's typically longer life spans than men's and earnings that on average peak earlier than men's.In turn, WorthFM's digital investing platform includes such features as an integrated Money Type (personality) assessment tool and financial education. Indeed, ""a core part of us is education,"" says Amanda Steinberg, founder and CEO of Worth Financial, the parent of WorthFM and Daily Worth.But Lauren Klein, of Klein Financial Advisors, evidently isn't awed. ""Women-focused or not, robos are not sufficient,"" holds Klein, of Newport Beach, Calif. ""At their kernel, robos focus particularly on the tech side of money. But that is not where decisions are made, comfort levels achieved and knowledge owned. The essence of a robo is what can be mapped. But a map,"" she says, ""doesn't always describe the territory.""RELATED:Financial Advisor Differentiates Himself Behind The MicGood Listening Skills Separate Human Advisors From RobotsLooking For Actionable Stocks, Check Out The Stock Lists Page

341,TAP,"WASHINGTON — At this shank end of a summer that a calmer America someday will remember with embarrassment, you must remember this: In the population of 325 million, a small sliver crouches on the wilder shores of politics, another sliver lives in the dark forest of mental disorder, and there is a substantial overlap between these slivers.At most moments, 312 million are not listening to excitable broadcasters making mountains of significance out of molehills of political effluvia.Still, after a season of dangerous talk about responding to idiotic talk by abridging First Amendment protections, Americans should consider how, if at all, to respond to ""cheap speech.""That phrase was coined 22 years ago by Eugene Volokh of UCLA Law School. Writing in The Yale Law Journal (""Cheap Speech and What It Will Do"") at the dawn of the internet, he said that new information technologies were about to ""dramatically reduce the costs of distributing speech,"" and that this would produce a ""much more democratic and diverse"" social environment.Power would drain from ""intermediaries"" (publishers, book and music store owners, etc.) but this might take a toll on ""social and cultural cohesion.""Volokh anticipated today's a la carte world of instant and inexpensive electronic distributions of only such content as pleases particular individuals. Each person can craft delivery of what MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte called (in his 1995 book ""Being Digital"") a ""Daily Me.""In 1995, Volokh said that ""letting a user configure his own mix of materials"" can cause social problems: customization breeds confirmation bias — close-minded people who cocoon themselves in a cloud of only congenial information. This exacerbates political polarization by reducing ""shared cultural referents"" and ""common knowledge about current events.""Technologies that radically reduce intermediaries and other barriers to entry into society's conversation mean that ignorance, incompetence and intellectual sociopathy are no longer barriers. One result is a miasma of distrust of all public speech.Although Volokh leans libertarian, what he foresaw — ""the demassification of the mass media"" — led him to conclude: ""The law of speech is premised on certain (often unspoken) assumptions about the way the speech market operates. If these assumptions aren't valid for new technologies, the law may have to evolve to reflect the changes.""He warned about what has come about, odious groups cheaply disseminating their views to thousands of the likeminded. Nevertheless, he stressed the danger of letting ""government intervene when it thinks it has found 'market failure.'""Now, Richard L. Hasen of the University of California, Irvine offers a commentary on Volokh, ""Cheap Speech and What It Has Done (to American Democracy),"" forthcoming in the First Amendment Law Review.Hasen, no libertarian, supports campaign-spending regulations whereby government limits the quantity of campaign speech that can be disseminated. Given, however, that ""in place of media scarcity, we now have a media firehose,"" such regulations are of diminished importance. As, Hasen says, using the internet to tap small donors has ""a democratizing and equalizing effect.""But, he correctly says, cheap speech is reducing the relevance of political parties and newspapers as intermediaries between candidates and voters, which empowers demagogues. Voters are directly delivered falsehoods such as the 2016 story of Pope Francis' endorsement of Donald Trump, which Hasen says ""had 960,000 Facebook engagements.""He cites a study reporting approximately three times more pro-Trump than pro-Hillary Clinton fake news stories, with the former having four times more Facebook shares than the latter.Hasen says that during the 2016 election, digital advertising revenue reached $1.4 billion, a 789% increase over the 2012 campaign, with Facebook and Google receiving 85% of it. Courts have rejected the idea of government bodies declaring campaign statements lies; besides, as Hasen delicately says, this is ""an era of demagoguery and disinformation emanating from the highest levels of government.""But because ""counterspeech"" might be insufficient ""to deal with the flood of bot-driven fake news,"" Hasen thinks courts should not construe the First Amendment as prohibiting laws requiring ""social media and search companies such as Facebook and Google to provide certain information to let consumers judge the veracity of posted materials.""Hasen errs. Such laws, written by incumbent legislators, inevitably will be infected with partisanship. Also, his progressive faith in the fiction of disinterested government causes him to propose ""government subsidizing investigative journalism"" — putting investigators of government on its payroll.The most urgent debate concerns the First Amendment implications of regulating foreign money that is insinuated into campaigns. This debate will commence when Robert Mueller reports.

342,TAP,"The battle for digital dominance in the smart home continues to intensify as Amazon (AMZN) reportedly is developing more new products that pose another threat to Alphabet (GOOGL), in one of the hottest categories of consumer electronics.XAmazon is developing a pair of smart glasses and a new camera security system, both of which tap into its Alexa virtual assistant and expand its growing presence in the smart home, according to the Financial Times Wednesday.The Amazon devices in development and related products now available are a threat to Alphabet and its line of virtual assistants, centered on Google Home, along with Apple (AAPL) and its HomePod device.The focal point of the Amazon devices in development is Alexa, the voice of the Amazon Echo artificially intelligent virtual digital assistant. Through Alexa's speakers and microphone, users can play music, create shopping lists, get information on weather, traffic and sports, in addition to using the device for ordering products on Amazon and controlling household devices such as lighting.Amazon's pair of smart glasses would allow Alexa to be summoned anytime and anywhere, the Financial Times report said, citing people familiar with the plans. A bone-conduction audio system would allow the wearer to hear Alexa without the need for headphones.The internet-connected camera security system Amazon also reportedly is developing would allow people to view the video feed on the Amazon Echo Show, a recently introduced device with a video screen.And on Tuesday, Amazon introduced a new tablet, the Fire HD 10, that also connects with Alexa. In June, Amazon announced its new Dash Wand, an Alexa-enabled device that can be used for scanning grocery bar codes and other household essentials to create a shopping list, among other features.Altogether, through Alexa, Amazon is embedding itself deeper into the smart home and in the process collecting batches of user data that can be used for generating more e-commerce and helping it to combat Alphabet in the digital assistant market.Apple joined the market in June with the HomePod digital assistant. Last month, Amazon and Microsoft announced a partnership that threatens the rise of Alphabet and Apple in one of the hottest categories in consumer products.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft are strengthening their connection to customers with mobile and in-home devices infused with advanced speech recognition and artificial intelligence. The devices could evolve into the next major disruption in computing and put the smart home on a fast track.Amazon shares inched up 0.4% to close at 973.21 on the stock market today.Amazon leads the market for digital assistants in the home by a large margin, followed by Google Home, then Apple. Alphabet also has Google Assistant, a smartphone app that functions like Google Home, while Apple has Siri. And while it's believed that Google Home and Google Assistant are superior to Alexa in terms of having better artificial intelligence, Amazon still has the upper hand, says Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor.""The two weaknesses of Amazon in the digital assistant space are that it is inferior to Google and that Google Assistant is present by default on every Android smartphone that ships,"" Windsor wrote in a blog post. But Amazon holds the stronger hand by being first to market and seeding the market with multiple devices that are like spokes surrounding the Alexa hub, before Alphabet can get its act together.""If a large number of households have Alexa, which is working nicely with the other smart devices they have at home, it will be increasingly difficult for Google to win them back even with a superior product,"" Windsor wrote.RELATED:Amazon Gets Big Boost For Echo As Microsoft Readies A Rival DeviceAlexa, Why Did Morningstar Rate You As A Durable Business Pillar?No Need To Ask Jeeves When You Can Ask Apple, Amazon, Facebook, GoogleWhy Being Late To Market Doesn't Hurt Apple HomePod

343,TAP,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — Defense Secretary James Mattis said Wednesday he has talked to the Air Force chief of staff about ""new ways"" to perform a key airborne command and control ""mission,"" following recent questions about whether the $7 billion program would go forward.XThe Air Force opened the competition late last year on the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) recapitalization program to replace Northrop Grumman's (NOC) E-8.Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop are leading teams with bids for the aircraft, which would perform airborne command and control and conduct ground surveillance.But the Air Force acknowledged last week that it's evaluating ""alternative approaches for battlefield command and control that could be more effective in high-threat environments,"" according to Defense News.Top service officials have said an alternative approach to having a single aircraft would be to instead network various aircraft, drones and sensors as a temporary measure until a more survivable system is developed.On Wednesday, Mattis didn't directly address the JSTARS program but noted different ways of doing the JSTARS mission.""I just talked to chief of staff of the air force; we are standing here in front of the room talking about new ways to do the JSTARS mission,"" said Mattis at the Air Force Association's annual Air, Space & Cyber conference. ""I'm eager to hear these efforts to help one another, the other services.""Northrop shares climbed 0.7% at 280.18 on the stock market today, still in buy range after breaking out Monday. Lockheed edged up 0.8% to 307.96, nearing a 308.58 entry, and Boeing rose 1.2% to 255.46, heading toward the high end of its buying territory.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Mattis also called for more communication with industry partners, especially in Silicon Valley, to ""find the best bang for the buck.""He told service leaders to ""find the most far-reaching innovations out there"" by being open to talking to industry leaders, ""within the bounds of ethical regulations.""""Make certain the lines of communication are open in a way that we can aggressively and swiftly take advantage of opportunities that we see developing around us in the private sector,"" Mattis said.He said the Pentagon is working to reform business practices inside the Defense Department and is taking a look on how to quickly take advantage of technology such as software development.""Do we really need the same process when we're doing small programs vs. a major aircraft program?"" Mattis asked.The Pentagon has been embracing Silicon Valley with its Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) program, which seeks to tap into the tech sector to help keep the Pentagon on the cutting edge.Mattis recalled his time living in Silicon Valley after he left the Marine Corps, saying that ""nothing is more reminding of just how innovative America is than to live in Silicon Valley and see how they are changing the world we live in.""RELATED: Air Force Eyes Light-Attack Plane But This Is 'Job One'Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsWhy The Orbital ATK Buyout Is So Important For Northrop Grumman

344,TAP,"Wiretapping: The U.S. government under President Obama wiretapped former Trump campaign Chair Paul Manafort in New York's Trump Tower under ""secret court orders before and after the election,"" CNN reported, citing ""three sources familiar with the investigation."" Assuming CNN's report is true, it means President Trump, who was ridiculed earlier this year for claiming that his iconic building had been wiretapped, has been massively vindicated. But don't hold your breath waiting for an apology.Just months ago, Trump was called a liar and worse for his tweets alleging that Obama had Trump Tower wiretapped.""Terrible!"" Trump tweeted on March 4. ""Just found out that Obama had my ""wires tapped"" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!""Some suggested he was paranoid, had lost his mind or was flat-out lying, and CNN — which, to its credit, broke the wiretapping story — was among the worst in the mainstream media.Actor James Woods, active on Twitter, compared the shifting headlines from CNN on the allegations over the past six months:CNN, Sunday, March 5, 2017: ""Trump's baseless wiretap claim""September 5, 2017: ""Donald Trump just flat-out lied about Trump Tower wiretapping""September 18, 2017: ""Exclusive: US government wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman""That about says it all. And on that last headline, it's important to note that not only was Manafort working out of Trump Tower, he was living there. So the claim, again if true, means Trump was 100% correct about being wiretapped.This is more than just ""I told you so."" The entire investigation into alleged Trump campaign ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election appears to center on the wiretaps of Manafort, whose consulting work included some foreign political groups, including in Ukraine.Even so, top U.S. intelligence officials have steadfastly and adamantly denied any wiretap of Trump.""With respect to the president's tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those tweets, and we have looked carefully inside the FBI,"" former FBI Director James Comey told the House Intelligence Committee last March. Comey was under oath.National Intelligence Director James Clapper also denied any wiretap, telling NBC in March that he would have known about a ""court order on something like this."" Clapper denied to Congress that any of the intelligence agencies he oversaw wiretapped Trump, and said the FBI did not get a court order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) — the only court that can grant a domestic wiretap on grounds of national security — to tap Trump's phones.A host of others, including some Republicans in Congress, likewise publicly dissed Trump's claims.If CNN's report proves true, those who lied will no doubt say, ""We didn't wiretap Trump; we wiretapped Manafort."" But that cutesy, specious logic comes up short, both legally and ethically. In tapping Manafort, they knew they were getting Trump's many intimate conversations with him. That's how they could go to FISA and say it wasn't about Trump, but about Manafort. It was in fact a roundabout way of getting Trump in trouble, possibly even impeached.As the CNN report said, ""The government snooping continued into early this year, including a period when Manafort was known to talk to President Trump.""And the wiretaps were used to feed the ongoing investigation of Robert Mueller of the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russian interference in the 2016 election.This, by the way, puts a new gloss on why President Obama did nothing at all when first presented with evidence in the summer of 2016 that the Russians might be hacking our election. It was a way to take down the Democrats' biggest threat, the unpredictable Donald Trump.As has been noted previously, President Obama didn't have authority on his own to request a wiretap of a U.S. citizen. That requires the Justice Department. But that doesn't mean he didn't make it happen.The Justice Department was then headed by Loretta Lynch — one of the most politicized Attorneys-General in U.S. history, known for repeatedly bending the truth in her public comments. So it's not a stretch to think that, with a nod and a wink, Obama encouraged Lynch to go after Trump. He had every reason to do so, given that Hillary Clinton at the time seemed to be the only hope for Obama's progressive legacy to live on.""It was the Comey-led FBI in the Lynch-led DOJ, in the Obama presidency, that reportedly used the FISA Court to obtain a warrant, quite possibly based on the phony (Russian) dossier, that has provided material to get Manafort and pressure him to find something to squeal about and catch a higher-up,"" wrote Thomas Lifson at the American Thinker. ""The legitimacy of that warrant now is in question.""We'll take that a step further. The entire Russia investigation, which was manipulated into being by Obama administration holdovers working with congressional Democrats, now appears to be a fraud. More than a year after the government began looking into the charges, no proof of any wrongdoing or crime has been produced.This is a tragic turn in American democracy, when a sitting president has a political foe spied upon by our own intelligence agencies. It's time to wind down the Russia probe and begin looking into the real scandal: Whether the Obama administration illegally used the intelligence apparatus of the U.S. to try to neutralize a political opponent. If it did, it's a serious crime that warrants a real criminal investigation — not Mueller's political witch hunt.RELATED:Now Hillary Wants To Challenge The Election?

346,TAP,"Shares of American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) led carriers higher after both forecast third-quarter unit revenue and margins that were better than prior expectations.The forecasts mark a rebound for American, United and Delta Air Lines (DAL), which during the third quarter saw their stocks fall following steep fare competition, higher fuel prices and hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Delta Air reports third-quarter earnings on Wednesday.But investor sentiment began to improve last week, when Delta's Q3 outlook for the key metric held up, in analysts' views, when factoring out the impact of Irma. The guidance lifted the carrier and its rivals and signified to some analysts that Delta was better able to shore up prices.American on Tuesday indicated that it had been better able to keep airfares high as well — a practice that dismays travelers but boosts airlines' top and bottom lines.American said third-quarter unit revenue was up roughly 0.5%-1.5%, better than an earlier outlook for flat to up 1%. In raising its outlook, the carrier cited ""stronger than anticipated yield performance,"" referring to an airline's ability to charge customers more money.The carrier said it expected adjusted pretax margin of 9%-11%, better than its previous outlook for 8.5%-10.5%.Shares popped 4.8% to 53.03. The stock is forming a base with a 54.58 buy point.United, meanwhile, said it expected third-quarter passenger unit revenue, which measures sales from passengers in relation to an airline's flight capacity, to be down 3.5% to 4%. But that was better than earlier expectations for a 3%-5% decrease.United said it expected adjusted pretax margin of 10%-10.5%, up from an earlier outlook of 8%-10%.Shares surged 4.7% to 67.72 in the stock market today, coming closer to their 200-day line, which remains above the stock's 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: As investors fret over airlines' pricing and expansion plans, Elon Musk is looking way, way beyond. Here's a look at how SpaceX could upend companies like Boeing (BA) and the airlines. Delta rose 1.9% to 53.10.

347,TAP,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose strongly early Wednesday with stocks already at or near record highs. That's despite disappointing sales guidance late Tuesday from several top-rated tech companies, including Electronic Arts (EA).XAlong with Electronic Arts, Paycom (PAYC), FormFactor (FORM) and Check Point Software (CHKP) gave sluggish revenue outlooks, sending their shares lower in late trade. EA, Paycom and FormFactor have Composite Ratings of 97, 98 and 98, respectively out of a best-possible 99. Check Point has a solid 87.Looking to Wednesday's session, Lumentum (LITE) and Qorvo (QRVO), both Apple (AAPL) suppliers, are close to buy points ahead of their earnings Wednesday as well as Apple's results Thursday. Apple is now slightly extended while Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and iPhone X play Universal Display (OLED) are in range after clearing buy points this week.S&P 500 futures rose 0.4% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.5%. Dow futures advanced 0.6%. Key economic data, U.S. auto sales, a Federal Reserve policy meeting decision, as well as earnings from Facebook (FB) and Tesla (TSLA) are on tap today.Lumentum is a fiber-optic components maker. But in recent months it's gotten more attention as a presumed supplier of 3D sensors for the Apple iPhone X.Lumentum reports before Wednesday's market open. Analysts predict an 8% per-share profit gain to 53 cents, with sales dipping 1% to $255 million. But Lumentum's outlook and commentary about 3D sensor demand may be more important.Shares reversed lower to close down 2.5% to 63.17 on Tuesday, but that's after running up nearly 16% from Oct. 20 to Oct. 30. Lumentum has a potential cup-base buy point of 68.73.The chipmaker reports after the market close Wednesday. Analysts expect a 12% EPS gain to $1.44, with revenue declining for a second straight quarter, off 6% to $811 million. Qorvo has a cup-with-handle buy point of 76.57. For a second straight session, Qorvo crossed that entry intraday, but closed below it, falling 0.6% to 75.81 on Tuesday.Even if Lumentum and Qorvo have good results and guidance and stocks acted well, there's still the little issue of Apple's earnings out late Thursday. The iPhone X officially goes on sale Friday, which means there will be teardowns that reveal which Apple suppliers are winners and losers.Meanwhile, Broadcom and Skyworks extended Monday's breakouts, but are still in buy range.Universal Display, which makes key technology for OLED screens, rose 5.7% on Tuesday to 146.50, clearing a 145.40 entry. Universal Display is not a direct Apple supplier, but the iPhone X does use an OLED screen. Samsung Electronics said Tuesday that OLED demand is strong, while initial iPhone X reviews were positive.Universal Display reports earnings on Thursday, Skyworks is out Nov. 6, while Broadcom is several weeks away.Apple rose 1.4% to 169.04 on Tuesday, just beyond the 5% chase zone from a 160.97 entry cleared Friday.RELATED:The Big Picture: Indexes Cap October With Halloween TreatUniversal Display Breaks Out After Samsung Earnings ReportApple Gets Price-Target Hike After Notching Record HighElectronic Arts Guides To Holiday Sales Below Views

348,TAP,"The big news in health care last week was the disclosure that CVS Health Corp. — owner of a vast network of drugstores — is considering buying Aetna Inc., one of the nation's largest health insurers, for roughly $66 billion. It's undeniably important, but why?Clearly, economic concentration in health care is growing. The possible CVS-Aetna hookup is just a gigantic example. Hospitals have been consolidating; so have physician groups. A study published recently in Health Affairs, a journal of public policy, reported that hospitals were ""highly concentrated"" in 90% of the country's metropolitan areas.The consequences, warns Alan Weil, Health Affairs' editor, include a ""narrowing of (consumer) choices"" and ""outsized market power"" of hospitals and physician specialists. But are there also benefits? Could we be glimpsing the future of health care? Could the changes ultimately overshadow the significance of ObamaCare?To make some sense of all this, I turned to Dan Mendelson, the president of Avalere, a health care consulting company that he founded in 2000. I submitted questions to Mendelson; his replies, edited for brevity, are printed below.Q: Why is a major retail drug chain (CVS) thinking of merging with a big insurer (Aetna)?A: Health care is increasingly about the ability of medical enterprises to deliver improved patient care through technology. All insurers are interested in developing a strong presence in data analytics. This in turn encourages mergers and acquisitions. Why? CVS is a diversified health care company with operations in pharmacy benefit management, post-acute care and a strong network of health care clinics — it's not just a drugstore chain. By merging with CVS, Aetna gains access to these rich data sources to drive better health care practices. The same is true for CVS in reverse. It gets to tap Aetna's databases and discover, say, which of its policyholders haven't received their flu shot and could be solicited by CVS.Q: Do you expect more big mergers and acquisitions?A: Yes. The pace of big combinations will accelerate in coming years. All health care companies will need to reposition themselves to accommodate the fundamental trends of the health care system — which will continue irrespective of political change.Q: What are those trends?A: First, payers — private insurers and government through Medicare and Medicaid — are paying more for value (good patient outcomes) as opposed to the volume of services (the number of tests and procedures). Medicare and Medicaid have led the way, but private insurers are catching up. This has driven consolidation in the provider sectors (hospitals and doctors), because it's easier to measure and improve quality as a system as opposed to influencing sole proprietor or small group practices. This has also driven the acquisition of providers by insurers, because the key to improving quality is getting a better alignment between the interests of patients and providers.A second major trend is related: the increasing role of information technology and data analytics in improving patient care. A lot of the basic wiring of the health care system is now complete — a result of federal investment and lower technology prices. The need now is to harness the power of analytics to improve care. As noted, this drives mergers and acquisition.A final trend that seems likely to continue is the looming threat that some of the large tech firms — Amazon, Google and the like — will enter the health care markets. The existing health care providers and payers think they need to get larger to compete with these mega-firms.Q: Will consolidation help cost control by eliminating duplication and by creating new economies of scale? Or will the loss of competition and the market power of the survivors boost prices and health care spending?A: Of course, regulators will scrutinize proposed combinations to answer that question. But the increasing focus on patient outcomes also has the possibility of controlling costs. We've seen this in the Medicare Advantage program, where quality-based payments have also improved patient well-being with lower cholesterol levels and better blood sugar readings for diabetic patients. There is no question that increased consumer access to health care and new technology have a tremendous potential to take inefficiencies out of the system. Still, we should not be naive. At the local level, regulators need to ensure that provider networks remain competitive. A hospital with monopoly power can be expected to raise costs for consumers.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

349,TAP,"Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) beat estimates for U.S. October car sales on the back of robust utility vehicle and truck sales. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) saw a sharper slide than projected while Toyota Motor (TM) missed sales views.XOther automakers are also on tap, with analysts expecting more signs of shrinking demand and further production cuts to production.After the market close Wednesday, Tesla (TSLA) reported mixed Q3 results, while sports car maker Ferrari (RACE) reports Thursday.The annualized pace of sales was 18.09 million, according to Autodata. That's down from 18.6 million in September, which saw a surge in post-hurricane replacement demand.""Some of the strength can be attributed to replacement demand that continues in Texas and Florida, but perhaps more importantly, higher incentive spend is playing a role,"" said Tim Fleming, analyst for Kelley Blue Book. With incentives for shoppers reaching 11% of average transaction prices, Fleming noted that this could be an indicator that new-vehicle demand is still contracting and that more production cuts could be on the horizon to prevent oversupplies.As expected, SUVs, crossover utilities and trucks saw strong demand in October. The passenger car segment continued to decline.GM and Ford have already announced factory layoffs and production cuts for some sedans, and Wednesday's sales reports for October may point to future cuts.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can greatly reduce risk and capitalize on stocks making breakaway gains on earnings reports.Here's how many new vehicles the major automakers sold or are expected to sell in October, with the percentage change vs. October 2016:Kelley Blue Book sales estimate: 260,000; +0.5%Edmunds.com sales estimate: 239,775; -7.3%Results: GM sales fell 2.3% to 252,813, with the automaker citing strong demand for trucks and crossovers. GM also cited progress in reducing inventories vs. a year earlier.Pickup deliveries rose 9%, led by the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra; crossovers rose 12%, driven by the Chevrolet Equinox and Traverse, the GMC Acadia and the Buick Encore and Enclave.GM reported strength in the retail auto market and signaled optimism about sales in the fourth quarter. New models of top-selling utility vehicles ""are arriving in showrooms at the same time consumer confidence is at its highest level since 2000. Small business optimism has also stayed very high since last fall, and that bodes well for pickup and van sales,"" said Kurt McNeil, U.S. vice president of sales operations.GM shares rose 0.35% at 43.13 on the stock market today. The stock has pulled back on valuation and profitability concerns in recent days, after rallying since September on its perceived technological edge over rivals in emerging automotive technologies like electric vehicles and autonomy.Kelley Blue Book sales estimate: 195,000; +3.9%Edmunds.com sales estimate: 196,556; +5.1%Results: Sales rose 6.2% to 200,436 vehicles.

Goldman Sachs (GS) jumped 3% after announcing plans to boost annual revenue by $5 billion.Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), which has Apple (AAPL) as its top holding, was flirting with the flat line. Apple reversed higher as its much anticipated product launch event got under way. The iPhone maker's shares remain in buy range from a 156.75 flat-base entry.A market pullback can set up potential buy opportunities at the 50-day or 10-week lines, while a rebound can yield a breakout from a base.As such, two dividend funds are in or near breakout territory, given the stock market's solid bounce during Monday session.WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth (DGRW) cleared a 37.60 flat-base buy point on Monday to close at an all-time high.

Is it worthy of your watch list? One way to find out is to consult IBD Stock Checkup. It tells you how a stock ranks in its industry group.ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Arisocrats (NOBL) closed just shy of a 59 buy point, also of a flat base, on Monday. The fund was featured in the July 11 ETF column as it sought support near its 50-day moving average. It advanced 2% from that bounce before pulling back along with the broader market to form a flat base.The $3.1 billion fund tracks the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which is made up of companies that have increased their dividends every year for 25 consecutive years. Consumer staples, industrials and health care were its three biggest sector weights at 26%, 17% and 14%, respectively.

351,TAP,"Nintendo (NTDOY) shares shot up Monday after the video game heavyweight said it nearly doubled its profit outlook and said it expects to sell millions more Switch consoles than previously thought.XThe ""Super Mario"" maker now expects to sell 14 million units of the unique $300 console, which can be configured to be played at home or as a portable system. That's a significant bump up from a prior outlook for 10 million units for the fiscal year, and would translate to a total of 16.7 million units sold come March 2018, per The Verge.Ahead of the holiday season, Nintendo is promising more Switch consoles on store shelves. Further, ""Super Mario Odyssey"" was released last week in Japan and abroad.""We've boosted Switch production to meet strong demand as it was difficult for customers to buy the consoles at retail stores,"" said Nintendo President Tatsumi Kimishima, according to Reuters.Shares of Nintendo soared 6.8% to 50.90 on the stock market today.On the back of greater-than-expected Switch demand, management for Japan-based Nintendo also increased its full-year operating profit guidance to the equivalent of $1.1 billion, nearly double previous targets for roughly $571.7 million. It now expects the U.S. equivalent $8.4 billion in revenue for the year vs. previous guidance for $6.6 billion.IBD's TAKE: Tech stocks are leading Monday, with FANG stocks Facebook and Apple still in buy range. Publishers Electronics Arts (EA) and Activision (ATVI) are the next video game bigwigs on tap to report earnings results this week.

361,TAP,"If you only had a day to get a sense of where Facebook (FB) stands with Wall Street and the nation, you might look no further than Wednesday.XThe multibillion-dollar, compulsively checked social-media platform is set to report third-quarter earnings on Nov. 1. But the real drama that day could come out of Washington, D.C., where Facebook's general counsel is set to face lawmakers eager to learn the extent to which Russia might have exploited the company to agitate the nation's cultural divides and troll last year's presidential election.The events likely will revive a bigger debate about whether Facebook should be thought of as a media powerhouse-to-be rather than a tech icon, and whether it needs to be the former for its stock to continue its galactic rise. Analysts interviewed for this story argue that Facebook is more of a tech company, saying that it doesn't create content on its site. Instead, its core product is its strata of algorithms and artificial intelligence, they say.They add that Facebook doesn't need to crank out the original TV shows or other features on which fellow FANG stocks Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) have banked.""I'm not sure that's why I want to go to Facebook,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said. ""I do want to go to Facebook to have my friends tell me 'Blade Runner 2049' is good.""Those in the Facebook-is-a-media-company camp, however, might point to its financials. Digital ad sales are expected to drive a 41% surge in revenue in the third quarter. Any financial outlook that the company offers for next year could be tempered by its decision to hire 1,000 people to vet those ads, after Kremlin-linked accounts allegedly planted thousands of them in an attempt to inflame tensions in the U.S. around wedge issues.In addition, they might argue, the company offers video content from Major League Baseball, the National Football League and National Public Radio. It recently put up an unsuccessful $610 million bid for the rights to broadcast Indian Premier League cricket games. And lots of people get their news, real or fake, from the site.Many observers say a company that does all that should own up to the responsibilities and regulations that cover the rest of the media business.But would a play for more media be good for Wall Street? Analysts say that creating or buying media content itself could gut Facebook's margins and the investor excitement that has helped its stock more than quadruple since its splashy initial public offering in 2012.""There are so many other growth opportunities ahead of the company, we doubt it would have to have media become a major piece of the story,"" SunTrust analyst Youssef Squali said.The company's longer-term opportunities include augmented reality, in video games or even distance learning. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg wants to develop glasses that digitally impose objects over the user's actual surroundings and, in effect, declutter the world of physical objects.""You want to play a board game? You snap your fingers, and here's the board game,"" he said, according to a Recode story this year. ""You don't need a physical hardware TV, you buy a one-dollar app 'TV' and put it on the wall.""There's also a lot more room for Facebook's Messenger and Whatsapp messaging platforms to tack moneymaking widgets onto the messages that users already send to one another. Mention a location and that could trigger a bot from Uber that would allow you to arrange a ride through Messenger.Others say there's a chance for those services to be more like WeChat, the multifaceted messaging service based in China.""That's not just a text messaging app, it's a payment app, it's a commerce app. You can do a lot of different things,"" Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson said. ""It's really a platform in and of itself.""IBD'S TAKE: Facebook touched a buy zone out of a flat base in the middle of October but has since retreated and is near its 50-day moving average. Still, it remains second in IBD's Internet-Content Group, right behind No. 1-ranked YY.He adds that Facebook has a long way to go before it fully mines its own assets — Whatsapp, Messenger and the photo-sharing site Instagram — for sales and profit.How about what's already making money for Facebook? Start with site's roughly 2 billion monthly users, or somewhere around half the people on the internet. People spend close to an hour, and counting, each day within the Facebook infrastructure. That's thanks in part to the slow drip of birthday and event reminders — and the bump that comes from being notified of an abrasive comment or a 'Like' — that keep people on the site.The more people use the site, the better Facebook can serve up precise consumer analytics for advertisers across its core site and its other platforms.""They've got close to half of the users of the internet on their platform, and they can target them with scary accuracy,"" Olson said.With size, accuracy and familiarity come trust. Sixty-six percent of respondents to an RBC/Ad Age marketer survey in September said they planned to increase their ad budget with Facebook. The percentage was 63% for Instagram.That beats Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Google's YouTube, Amazon, Snap's (SNAP) Snapchat or Twitter (TWTR).With the exception of tweeting, Facebook also has adopted features similar to those on other social media sites. You can send money and order food.Instagram's Stories feature, in which users stitch together photographed and recorded things that happen to them during the day, largely does what Snapchat does. Pachter called Instagram Stories a good ""defense"" against Snapchat.""That keeps 40-year-old women from befriending their kids on Snapchat,"" he said.But as more moms storm Facebook's news feeds, a recent survey from Piper Jaffray found that ""the youngest of teens are simply not adopting"" the platform, favoring the more photo-and-video-centric Instagram and Snapchat.The company this year continues to invest, hiring engineers and building out data centers, which is keeping operating expenses elevated. And its advertising technology has been porous enough for some major errors.By midday Friday, shares of Facebook were up 3.4% to near 176.40 on the stock market today.Since last year, reports have also surfaced that Facebook overestimated how long people watched its videos or it otherwise miscalculated user engagement with marketers and publishers.Then there's the matter of Russia, which has compromised the trust of the public and, to an extent, investors. But analysts say any regulatory consequences — Facebook might have to provide more information about who's behind a political ad — would be minimal on a financial level.More significant financially, they say, is the possibility of antitrust action and scrutiny in Europe over privacy protections. Facebook and Google dominate the digital ad landscape; how the companies use consumers' data has been a concern in Europe for years.Facebook's ability to expand globally remains one of its biggest advantages. Most of its daily active users access the site through a mobile device and, outside of first-world nations, the phone is ""often the first (or only) connected screen,"" Needham analysts said a research note in October.But analysts' views are mixed over whether Facebook can tap the largest economy outside the U.S.: China. And any move into China would follow Russia's own infiltration of the social network.""I think the last thing the Chinese government wants is to have some kind of rogue platform that they can't control,"" Squali said.RELATED:How Does Facebook Compare To Amazon, Netflix And Google?Here's What Facebook Messenger Can Do For Your Stock PortfolioCould Facebook Virtual Reality Spending Hit $5 Billion A Year?FANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google

362,TAP,"There appears to be only one way for Republicans to overcome the budget hurdles and make their tax-cut dreams come true, but it's out of touch with the populist mood of the country and might spark a political backlash.XThe GOP faces a seemingly impossible math problem in trying to make corporate tax cuts permanent. Cutting the corporate income-tax rate to 20% would alone cost $3 trillion in the second decade, yet their tax framework only spells out about $400 billion in savings from repealing business tax breaks, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis.Yet, as IBD has explained, the math only gets harder — and the prospects for passage slimmer — if Republicans settle for making corporate tax cuts temporary.If business tax cuts are written to be temporary and yield a $1.5 trillion increase in federal debt, as allowed for under the GOP budget resolution, official budget scorekeepers will likely find that the cuts do little to grow the economy or, perhaps, even shrink it. Slower growth would follow an abbreviated economic boost, so there would be no revenue windfall from dynamic scoring to make the job of passing tax cuts easier. At the same time, if businesses fear that the loss of tax deductions and loopholes will be permanent, while tax cuts will be temporary, they'll dig in their heels even more fiercely to try and preserve their valued tax benefits that could help offset the cost of a lower tax rate.Republicans would appear to be boxed in by Senate budget rules that require 60 votes for any tax cuts which would increase deficits after the first decade, but there is an escape hatch. There's good reason to think the GOP is planning to pay for permanent corporate tax cuts, in part, by raising taxes on individuals after 2027.In other words, much of the tax relief for individuals is likely to go away after the first decade, but some offsetting revenue-raisers are likely to stay on the books.While Republicans haven't come right out and said this, there have been subtle hints that this might be the ultimate plan. In fact, the GOP tax framework studiously avoided any mention of the words ""permanent"" or ""temporary.""But House Speaker Paul Ryan has been clear that corporate tax cuts must be permanent. ""Businesses aren't doing multibillion-dollar, multiyear capital decisions if they see a tax code that's unpredictable,"" he said in August.""The big decision-making provisions in the tax code — that stuff's got to be permanent,"" Ryan told CNBC, while adding that other policies could sunset ""to make sure that the numbers work.""If Republicans are going to get anywhere close to the 20% corporate rate in their plan, they'll have to bridge a $2-trillion-plus cost gap in the second decade, and they've signaled they're not all that serious about targeting business tax benefits to pay for the rate cut.The other hint about this likely GOP strategy comes from their tax framework, which includes long-term tax reforms such as ""the use of a more accurate measure of inflation for purposes of indexing the tax brackets and other tax parameters"" and ""simplification"" measures such as merging personal exemptions into a larger standard deduction.The Tax Policy Center's best guess is that adopting a less-generous inflation measure would raise nearly $500 billion in the second decade, while the larger standard deduction would net $1.2 trillion in additional revenue. Unless such reforms (including, perhaps, the state and local tax deduction) are written to be temporary, sunsetting much of the GOP's individual tax cuts could provide $1 trillion or more in revenue to offset the cost of making corporate tax cuts permanent.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 23,400 on Tuesday, up more than 1,500 points since IBD changed its market trend indicator to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a yellow light turning green. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Republicans will surely take care to preserve popular items like an expanded child tax credit, which might help deflect political criticism that they are using future individual tax hikes to help fund corporate tax cuts. They'll also make the case that they intend to eventually make all individual tax relief permanent, noting that George W. Bush-era middle-class tax cuts were eventually extended. That also might defuse criticism. But the implication is that the plan would produce bigger long-run budget deficits, and the budget trajectory is a lot more concerning than it was when the Bush tax cuts were passed in 2001.Prospects that the GOP will rely on individual tax hikes beyond 2027 to help pay for a corporate rate cut have grown as Republicans repeatedly signal their reluctance to tap the corporate tax code for savings. First, Senate Republicans teamed with the White House, Wal-Mart (WMT) and other retailers to kill Ryan's plan for a 20% border-adjustment tax that would have raised more than $1 trillion by taxing business imports.Eliminating the deduction for interest paid on business borrowing could raise as much as $1.2 trillion over 10 years, but the GOP framework says the deduction will be only ""partially limited"" for corporations, with more favorable treatment implied for noncorporate borrowers. Goldman Sachs expects ""no substantial changes"" to the interest deduction.Republicans also are looking at a minimum tax on foreign-earned profits to lower the incentive for shifting profits to tax havens, but their tax framework would apply the tax on a global basis. That means a 15% global minimum tax wouldn't raise anything from a company whose average foreign tax rate is 15% — even if half of its income comes from a tax-haven country with a 10% tax rate.The difficulty of imposing a minimum tax on international earnings helps explain why Republicans are so determined to cut the corporate tax rate to 20%. Goldman, for example, is predicting that the GOP will settle for a 25% corporate tax rate and a global minimum tax of 12% to 15%, although that doesn't exactly sell itself as an ""America First"" type of policy. Currently, U.S. companies must pay the difference between the federal tax rate and foreign tax rate, but they can defer payment indefinitely unless they bring the cash home, which is why companies like Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL) have amassed such large cash holdings overseas.Even if the GOP can make a 20% corporate rate permanent by letting some individual tax cuts expire after 2027, they still aren't close to being home free. The challenge now is to make the numbers work in the first decade, giving irresistible tax relief to individuals as well as businesses. That's why House Republicans aren't ready to let go of their idea for limiting upfront tax breaks on 401(k) deposits.RELATED:Here's Why Trump's Tax Cuts Could Easily CollapseHouse Continues To Toy With 401(k) Contribution Cap$100 Billion Question: Will Trump Let Alphabet, Pfizer Keep Tax Havens?These Are The Biggest Losers From Trump's Tax ReformStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

379,TAP,"The price of copper has jumped to the highest since November 2014. Aluminum and other metals are rallying also. Mining stocks are looking more appealing.XFor investors trying to tap into the strength in the mining sector, iShares MSCI Global Metals & Mining Producers (PICK), part of IBD's ETF Leaders screen, is near an enticing entry point in its chart.Shares of the ETF are near the 30.85 buy point of a saucer pattern. The ETF poked above the entry Aug. 7 and dipped back into the pattern shortly afterward. It's again advanced above that buy point and remains in a buy zone.The chart has a close resemblance to those of BHP Billiton (BHP), Anglo American (NGLOY) and the British-traded shares of Switzerland-based Glencore. Those companies are some of the major holdings in the ETF, and several of the top 10 holdings are near buy points or forming bullish chart formations.IShares Global Metals & Mining has a beefy portfolio of about 180 stocks. Most of them are in resource-rich countries such as Australia (which crowds the portfolio with 25% of holdings), the U.S., Brazil, South Korea, Canada and South Africa.Gold prices also have been rallying, but the fund avoids gold and silver miners. The iShares family has other funds that own gold or silver mining stocks or bullion. Instead, Global Metals & Mining focuses on companies involved in the extraction and production of diversified metals, aluminum, steel, precious metals and minerals.Because so much product is produced abroad, currency fluctuations are one risk of owning the fund. Of course, the metals markets have their own risks.Copper, for example, is up nearly 20% this year — the best start to any year since 2009, Bloomberg reported. But the news agency quoted analysts at Natixis and Bank of America Merrill Lynch who see copper prices vulnerable to a sell-off because of indications that supplies are ample. For example, copper for immediate delivery is trading at a sharp discount to futures contracts.

383,TAP,"Several initial public offerings scheduled for this week are receiving strong interest from institutional investors, with the largest IPO being China-based Qudian (QD), a provider of loans and credit vehicles that is backed by China e-commerce leader Alibaba (BABA).XAlso coming is Singapore-based internet company Sea Ltd. (SE), which is backed by China gaming leader Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), and database software provider MongoDB (MDB).Qudian, which has a close relationship with Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, looks to raise $769 million by offering 37.5 million American depositary shares at a price range of $19 to $22. Ant Financial is a principal shareholder and the online finance arm of Alibaba.Qudian says it's the largest online provider of small-cash credit products in China in terms of active borrowers and the amount of transactions. It facilitated approximately $5.6 billion in transactions to 7 million active borrowers in the first half of this year.For the six-month period ended June 30, Qudian reported revenue of $270.4 million, up 393% from the same period a year ago, with net income of $143.6 million, according to the Qudian IPO prospectus. IPO research and advisory firm IPOboutique.com said that, based on underwriter guidance, the Qudian offering is ""exponentially oversubscribed.""Qudian is scheduled to price Tuesday and begin trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker QD.

Everspin is not yet profitable, but sales growth has accelerated for the past two quarters, though from a low base.Everspin came public at 8 a share in early October.

That would took hold, with shares exploding in late May.Everspin closed Friday at 21.30, up 166% from its offering price.Ichor Holdings makes fluid- and gas-delivery subsystems for semiconductor capital equipment. Ichor is profitable, delivering huge growth while revenue has doubled in the past two quarters.Ichor came public in early December at 9 a share.

398,TAP,"Every day, legions of economists dismiss Donald Trump's economic agenda and forecast of 3% growth as a wild-eyed fantasy. The consensus is that the economy ""can't possibly grow at 3%,"" according to The Wall Street Journal. ""Slow growth is the new norm, so get used to it,"" wrote Rucir Sharma, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley, in Foreign Affairs magazine this month.Question: Why does anyone bother to listen to economists anymore? The profession has become an embarrassment, and the most respected economists have shown themselves to have as much predictive power as a deck of tarot cards.Almost everyone in the economics field — with a few, ahem, exceptions — bought into the Keynesian idea that massive government spending, a ""stimulus package,"" would revive the economy after the Great Recession of 2008-2009. The trillions of dollars of government borrowing here and abroad created a decade-long anemic recovery. The number of jobs created under President Barack Obama's stimulus turned out to be fewer than the number we would have had if the government had done nothing — according to the Obama administration's own analysis. So we got $9 trillion of debt with almost nothing to pay for it.Amazingly, every Obama budget forecast that annual growth would reach 3.5 to 4.5%. Bullish growth was just around the corner. (Remember Joe Biden's ""Recovery Summer"" tour?) Consider how these bullish forecasts squared with reality.In 2009 they said we would get growth up to 4.6%.In 2010 they said we would get growth of 4.3%In 2011 they said we would get growth of 4.4%.In 2012 they said we would get growth of 4.1%In 2013 they said we would get growth of 3.6%.In 2014 they said we would get growth of 3.4%We never got growth above 3% under Obama, and the average growth was 2%, ending at 1.6%. The reality was, on average, about 1.5%age points below the projection, which was about an 80% overestimate of growth. Maybe we should have just hired the tarot-card readers. Their predictions couldn't have been any worse.So now the very people who made these preposterous forecasts are telling us 3% growth is a fantasy under Trump. Under their model, tax increases create 4% growth, but tax cuts can't get us to 3% growth.The major reason that we can't get growth, we're told, is that we have so many millions of baby boomers retiring. But we have 100 million people over the age of 16 outside the labor force today or unemployed, and that's a giant labor pool to get workers from. Most of them are young, not old. This is a gigantic pool of workers we could tap into — if Washington would stop spending $1 trillion a year paying people not to work.Another fallacy is that this long recovery means the economy is due for a recession. No. For much of America this has been a long recession, not a long recovery. We are suffering from a severe growth deficit. The economy is $3 trillion behind where it should be because of the shallow recovery. It's teed up for a boom, not a bust.
"
399,TAP,"How do we ignite that boom? Nearly every policy during the Obama years was anti-growth: tax increases; minimum-wage hikes; ObamaCare; Dodd-Frank regulations; massive debt spending; the Paris climate change accord; an EPA assault against American energy; massive expansions of food-stamps programs and more. If Trump is able to shift those policies into reverse — especially by getting tax rates down, not up — then 3 to 4% growth is easily achievable, and the economics profession will be proven dead wrong again.

Internet firms are upgrading cloud data centers to faster communications.Ciena's main customers, though, are telecom firms such as Verizon Communications (VZ).""We think expectations for Ciena's fiscal Q2 are reasonable given the health of North America service provider spending and upside from new Waveserver wins, combined with a slowdown in government spending,"" Meta Marshall, a Morgan Stanley analyst said in a report.""Overall, we think that Ciena's WaveLogic could help drive some revenue upside for the company, but expectations are not high enough to change numbers, particularly given other headwinds,"" Marshall added.Ciena stock edged down 0.7% to 23.59 in the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Ciena stock is down about 2% in 2017 and is trading near its 50-day moving average. The stock has a technical buy point of 26.94. Ciena has a Composite Rating of 85, a CAN SLIM investing metric,  the fifth highest in IBD's Telecom-Fiber Optic group. The often-volatile fiber-optic group is ranked No. 32 out of 197 industry groups. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.In the July quarter, analysts estimate that Ciena will report profit of 48 cents a share, up from 42 cents a year earlier, with revenue rising 8% to $723 million.A Citigroup report last week said Ciena is gaining traction in the DCI market vs. Infinera (INFN) and Germany's Adva, a customer of Acacia Communications (ACIA).Data centers are packed with computer servers that whisk internet content to mobile devices.RELATED:Ciena Merchant Chip Strategy Targets Acacia, Inphi And ChinaApplied Optoelectronics, Finisar Rise On Data Centers, ChinaFiber-Optic Group Stages Easter Rally, But Can It Sidestep Consolidation?

401,TAP,"Moderate growth and low inflation in the U.S. have led to much discussion among pundits about the so-called Goldilocks Economy.Unemployment and interest rates remain low, yet GDP growth is steady and stock prices have been rising. A too-hot economy can cause inflation, while a too-cold economy can result in a recession.We are currently treading water somewhere in between, says Philip Blancato, CEO and president of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management, which manages about $2.2 billion. He sees room for continued earnings and economic growth — particularly if President Trump can follow through on his campaign promises.Here are Blancato's three best ETF investment ideas, in his own words:The current market environment is similar to the Goldilocks children's story. The economy is not too hot, not too cold, but continues to be in the middle. Overall economic data continue to ebb and flow as with each trend higher, there is a subsequent move lower.Click Here To See A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017The current P/E ratio of the S&P 500 is roughly 21.5 times, while the historical 10-year average P/E ratio is roughly 17.5 times. And prices tend to be mean-reverting, so we would not be surprised to see a sell-off at some point this year if investors become uncertain of Trump's ability to implement his planned pro-growth policies. As of last quarter, earnings are improving and if this trend continues will likely move higher.Now, with more investment opportunities presented in the international developed markets, although not without potential volatility due to the numerous uncertainties, it is prudent to enter and add to the space via a less risky channel. In our opinion, JPIN is a channel to enter the international space to participate in the upside from economic recovery without taking on excessive risks. The year-to-date performance as of April 30, 2017, is 10.35% vs. the MSCI EAFE index, which is up 9.97%.Political uncertainty in the U.S. also make diversifying internationally more compelling. For instance, Trump is the first president post-WWII with a net negative approval rating: 39.1% approve/54.8% disapprove (in the first few weeks in office). Much of the optimism that fueled the ""Trump rally"" was centered on the belief in the new administration's ability to enact its aggressive agenda. This is now being overshadowed by the perceived shortcomings of the administration, such as failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.There are also geopolitical events such as the bombing in Syria and the change in rhetoric toward North Korea.The ETF seeks to track the price and yield performance of the Dow Jones Emerging Markets Consumer Titans 30 Index, which measures the performance of 30 leading emerging-market companies in the Consumer Goods and Consumer Services Industries as defined by S&P Dow Jones Indexes.  This ETF is up 14.48% year-to-date through April 30, 2017, while the MSCI Emerging Market index is up 13.88% over that same time period.Lackluster U.S. economic data include real GDP growth coming in at an annualized 1.2% in Q1. Developed markets are expected to grow GDP 1.9% in 2017 and 2% in 2018. GDP growth forecasts for emerging markets is even higher at 4.5% for 2017 and 4.8% for 2018.FBND has navigated volatile fixed-income markets, and we believe its actively managed approach can adapt to future rate hikes. Year to date through April 30, 2017, FBND has returned 2.11%, outperforming the Barclay's Aggregate Bond Index, which is up 1.59% over that same time period.Interest-rate futures are pricing in more rate hikes this year, with a 85.9% probability of the fed funds rate ending the year between 1% and 1.5%None of the recent data has fundamentally changed our view on the economy. We're still positive on domestic equities, and we believe there will be modest earnings growth this quarter. Earnings looked strong this past quarter with 487 of 498 companies reporting. Earnings growth came in at 14.75% and sales growth at 7.93%. GDP growth should be modest moving forward, between 2% and 2.5%. The labor market remains tight, as unemployment is at 4.5%, and inflation remains contained.We still think there is room to grow, especially if the new administration can deliver on some of its campaign promises, such as tax reform and increased infrastructure spending.RELATED:3 Best ETF Ideas Tap Earnings Growth, Dividends

402,TAP,"The rapidly growing e-sports market is likely to be a hot topic at next week's E3 video game conference in Los Angeles, and one broker thinks the stock plays in that realm to watch heading into the show are Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT).About 190 million people watch e-sports regularly, up 19% from 160 million in 2016, Pacific Crest Securities said in a note to clients. Global e-sports revenue is expected to climb 46% this year to $600 million, including advertising, sponsorships, media rights, merchandise and tickets, it said.""Although eSports is still a frontier market, we believe its high growth, large audience, and attractive demographics warrant investor attention,"" Pacific Crest analyst Evan Wingren said in the report. E-sports will create opportunities for video game publishers, streaming video services, and hardware makers, Wingren said.Among the major game publishers, he likes Activision best. He rates the stock outperform with a price target of 60. Activision stock rose a fraction to 60.55 on the stock market today.Activision stock ""is the most direct public investment in eSports that you can make, in our view."" The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company owns the ""Overwatch,"" ""Hearthstone"" and ""Call of Duty"" franchises, which are already popular in competitive gaming.Other publishers targeting e-sports include Electronic Arts (EA), mostly through its FIFA soccer game, and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO), through its ""NBA 2K"" basketball game.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes two video game companies: Activision and NetEase.The leading publishers in e-sports now are Activision, Tencent (TCEHY)-owned Riot Games with ""League of Legends,"" and privately held Valve with ""Counter-Strike: Global Offense"" and ""Dota 2.""Wingren thinks Facebook has a chance to take on Amazon.com (AMZN)-owned Twitch as a streaming video platform for e-sports tournaments. Twitch is the market leader in the segment with about 10 million daily active users. Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube is another big player in the e-sports streaming space.Finally, Microsoft is best positioned among the console makers to become a major player in e-sports, Wingren said. It has its Xbox game consoles, Xbox Live service, first-party games and royalties on third-party publisher sales on its platform, he said.RELATED:NetEase Hits Record High Despite Sell Rating; E3 Show On Tap'Star Wars,' 'Call of Duty,' Scorpio Vying To Be Top Guns At E3 Show

403,TAP,"Stock wrestled to a positive finish Wednesday, overcoming an energy sector meltdown brought on by multiple global factors.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 climbed 0.2% apiece. The Nasdaq surged 0.4%, as NetEase (NTES), JD.com (JD) and American Airlines (AAL) led the Nasdaq 100 with gains of more than 2% each. Apple (AAPL) and the FANG stocks also had their say, with Apple up 0.6% and Amazon.com (AMZN) rising 0.7%.Preliminary data showed volume mixed, higher on the NYSE, lower on the Nasdaq, than end-of-day trade on Tuesday.In a day of whirling global news and events, oil took center stage as a Platt's survey outlined a surprise production increase of more than a quarter-million barrels per day by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, followed by a weekly inventories report from the Energy Information Administration that showed a 3.3 million-barrel increase in U.S. supplies. That number was almost 8 million barrels above the American Petroleum Institute's estimate released Tuesday, which showed a 4.6 million decrease during the same week. That estimate had helped send oil prices up nearly 2% on Tuesday.Oil was already being closely watched early Wednesday, as tensions rose in the Persian Gulf where Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain had effectively blockaded Qatar, and after reports of multiple armed attacks on official buildings in Tehran, Iran, that reportedly left at least 12 dead. News reports said the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Tehran attacks.As a result, U.S.-based oil benchmarks led the declines, with West Texas Intermediate crude ending down nearly 5% to below $46 a barrel, its lowest mark since early May.On the stock market, oil-related groups took six of the session's 10 worst losses among industries. Drilling, U.S. E&P and field services were hardest hit.Airlines had one of the day's best performances, with Hawaiian Holdings (HA) surging 12% to break out above a 56.25 buy point. The owner of Hawaiian Airlines reported stronger-than-expected passenger traffic in May. Brazil-based Gol Intelligent Airlines (GOL) jumped 5% in weak trade.Oil plays took nine of the 10 hardest falls among S&P 500 stocks. Newfield Exploration (NFX) and Helmerich & Payne (HP) each fell about 6%. Also among those tumbles was beer-maker Molson Brewing (TAP), which tanked 6.5%.Near the top of the list, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) swung up more than 3% in moderate trade. The move was enough to clear a 62.08 flat-base buy point, but volume was only 20% above average – not enough to qualify as a breakout. Volume can sometimes kick in a day or two after a stock passes a buy point, confirming a breakout after the fact.Nike (NKE), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and American Express (AXP) were among the Dow industrials to rise 1% or more. UnitedHealth hiked its quarterly dividend to 75 cents a share and Morgan Stanley initiated coverage on the stock with an overweight rating and a 202 price target.Coca-Cola (KO) dropped to the bottom of the list, down 1%, pressured by a downgrade from BMO Capital Markets to market perform from outperform.China-based stocks posted a strong session, with NetEase leading the Nasdaq 100 with a 3% gain in powerful trade. Standpoint Research trimmed the stock's rating to reduce, from buy, but also upped its price target to 360 from 345.On the IBD 50 list, New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU) and TAL Education (TAL) led, up 9% and 5% respectively. New Oriental remained extended and working on its eighth-straight weekly gain.

Solid earnings news sent Thor Industries (THO) and G-III Apparel Group (GIII) to powerful early gains.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 posted early 0.3% declines. The Nasdaq dipped 0.1%. Small caps led the early losses, with the Russell 2000 starting down 0.6%.Wal-Mart (WMT) dropped 01.2%, diving to the bottom of the Dow industrials, possibly hurt by Amazon.com's (AMZN) announcement that it would reduce its Prime membership fees for several low-income consumer groups in a bid to more directly compete with Wal-Mart.

Shares rose 1% to end at 174.73. Shares broke out of  a cup-shaped base with a 178.81 entry in early May 3, but shares quickly gapped down sharply. The stock is still above its 50-day moving average.Costco is raising its annual membership fees starting next week. The bulk of Costco's operating profit stem from membership fee revenue.Estimates: EPS up 10% to 99 cents with revenue up 4% to $5.29 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: EPS of 98 cents on revenue of $5.29 billion as same-store sales rose 0.5%.Outlook: Q2 EPS of 80-88 cents, below consensus views for 90 cents, on sales of $5.18 billion-$5.28 billion, with the midpoint below views for $5.26 billion, and a comp sales rise in the low single digits. Full-year EPS of $4.17-$4.43, below consensus for $4.49, on sales of $21.95 billion-$22.25 billion, falling short of Wall Street views for $22.41 billion.Stock: Shares finished 0.9% higher at 78.80 on the stock market today after tumbling soon after the open to 76.Shares breached their 50-day moving average Wednesday in heavier-than-average volume.

After clearing a 91.77 entry point from a cup-shaped base in early March, shares became overextended past a 96.36 ceiling (5% beyond the buy point). The off-price retailer's stock then tumbled through its 50-day moving average earlier this month. Shares fell 2% on Wednesday after finding resistance at the 50-day.IBD's TAKE: A pullback in light volume is preferable to a pullback in heavy volume, since the former points to still-strong institutional support. As IBD markets writer Ken Shreve has noted, ""Even when a top-quality stock is extended in price — specifically, more than 5% past a proper entry — sometimes it will pull back into a buy range. And when the market is in a confirmed uptrend, it's OK to buy."" Because retail is in a rut, or so goes the headline narrative. Apparel stores such as The Limited, Wet Seal, Rue21, Vince Holdings (VNCE) and Bebe (BEBE) are either defeated or struggling, and consumer electronics retailers such as HHGregg are shuttering stores as Amazon (AMZN) gobbles up more market share.Now each retailer report that is released is subject to scrutiny as investors and analysts assess the state of the brick-and-mortar landscape.RELATED:Sears Loss Swells And Sales Plunge, But Less Than Feared

413,TAP,"As we move through May, the old Wall Street adage ""Sell in May and go away"" comes to mind, a reminder that stocks historically tend to underperform during the May-to-October period.But does that mean ETF investors should liquidate their holdings, take the summer (and a few extra months) off, and resume buying stocks in November?That's one investment strategy. But, as with most old sayings, it doesn't have to be taken literally. Even if the market's return tends to be bigger in the November-April period, investors sitting out the other six months miss out on intermediate rallies and on the power of reinvesting dividends and compounding returns.That's why Oliver Pursche, chief executive of Bruderman Brothers and Bruderman Asset Management, doesn't think the adage proves advantageous for most investors.""It is at best unreliable and inconsistent and amounts to market timing,"" he told IBD. ""When taking into account possible tax consequences, missed dividends and trading commission, the math doesn't bear out.""But Pursche, who oversees the New York-based firm's investment banking and wealth management divisions, thinks May is a good time for investors to reassess their portfolios.Click Here To See A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017Bruderman Asset Management is a registered investment advisor (RIA) with more than $1 billion in assets under management.Here are Pursche's three best ETF investment ideas, in his own words:""Sell in May and walk away"" is not a strategy we feel is particularly smart or beneficial to investors. However, as we enter the summer months and the second half of the year, there is a need for investors to revisit their investment thesis and potentially reallocate their portfolios. After a solid double-digit run by the S&P 500 since Mr. Trump was elected president, a portfolio risk assessment is certainly due. Investors should expect a continuation of the current positive sentiment, even though the Trump administration is unlikely to pass any major legislation, in particular tax reform. Nonetheless, there are several key factors that are benefiting our economy and consequently, corporate earnings.The United States economy, as well as the world as a whole, is benefiting from a cyclical rebound in growth and consumer demand that is helping drive corporate earnings higher, and could help boost U.S. GDP growth by 4% or more in the second quarter. One phenomenon that has been interesting to observe in the current earnings cycle is the strength of earnings coming from outside the United States. Of the companies within the S&P 500 that have reported earnings so far, those companies that earn more than 50% of their revenues offshore have seen EPS growth of nearly 20%, while companies that derive all of their earnings domestically are experiencing low- to middle-single-digit EPS growth.One last note: Expect a correction at some point, but don't let that change your long-term investment strategy. The ETFs named above should perform well if the current environment persists through the end of the year and into 2018, as we expect it to.RELATED:This ETF Is Knocking The 'Socks' Off The Tech Sector

The S&P 500 ticked up 0.2%. The Nasdaq powered ahead 0.3%, as Apple (AAPL) rose 0.2% and Netflix (NFLX) advanced 0.5% in early action.After a turbulent session driven largely by data and news releases Wednesday, Thursday starts out with even busier earnings and economic schedules.Researcher Markit rolled out its country-by-country manufacturing indexes today, beginning with a weak overnight reading on small and midsize businesses in China. The report showed slowing output and new orders, and quicker staff reductions in May, pressuring the sector into contraction for the first time in nearly a year. Markit releases its U.S. manufacturing index at 9:45 a.m. ET.In the U.S., the monthly Job Cuts Report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed layoffs up 41% in May, to 51,692. The numbers were skewed by restructuring plans from Ford (F), which accounted for 40% of the announced layoffs, the report said.Private, nonfarm employers added 253,000 new workers in May, ADP estimated in its National Employment Report. That was 45% above April's disappointing tally and a country mile above expectations for a decline to 170,000 new hires. Services sector employers accounted for 205,000 of the new jobs.

Building supplies is an area where Amazon has not made huge inroads for now.TJX, an off-price apparel and home goods retailer, also is set to report before the opening bell early Tuesday. TJX and other off-price chains were seen as relatively safe from Amazon because they offer branded goods at deep discounts with a treasure hunt aspect.TJX stock broke out past resistance in a consolidation on May 10. But shares have sold off sharply since then in the wake of brutal reports from Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN) and J.C.

416,TAP,"When you leave home, do you worry that you left a door unlocked or forgot to set the alarm, and subsequently wasted large portions of your life driving all the way back to double-check?Alarm.com (ALRM) thinks it has a fix for you.XThe company, which develops cloud-based security and automation technology for homes and businesses, has brought in a lot of sales taking on the anxieties and the obsessive-compulsive urges that have worn on homeowners' minds since, well, homeownership was a thing. So shares of the company, which analysts say was an early adopter of smart-home technology, have risen roughly 150% since they began trading in 2015.The stock's charge also has been helped by a deal, announced last year and closed this year, that has made home-security giant ADT among Alarm.com's biggest clients. And as the business of alarm service moves to the cloud from the phone line, analysts say Alarm.com has gotten more revenue from existing customers by offering them an increasing number of ways to monitor their properties, many with the tap of a smartphone.""It's not a new problem that you just drove down to Florida and realized, 'Oh man, I may have left my garage door open,'"" Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt said. ""People were stupid 30 years ago, too, but now we have the technology to fix it.""Along with closing a garage door remotely, Alarm.com customers, through the company's apps, can lock and unlock doors, view who comes to their home's front door and adjust its lights or thermostats. They can adjust devices according to preset or customizable ""scenes"" to increase comfort when they go to bed or want to save energy when they leave the house. A drone that watches over your property? That's also in the works through a collaboration with Qualcomm (QCOM).""Consumers today view home security as a technology solution that's far more useful and valued than traditional systems,"" company spokesman Matt Zartman said in an email.The market research firm Parks Associates estimates that as many as 16 million North American households will have smart-home security by 2021, compared with 10 million forecast for traditional security platforms. As security gets smarter, analysts also see a greater opportunity for Alarm.com to take share in small to medium-sized businesses, vacation homes and medical monitoring — and eventually in overseas markets.""Any type of sensor-based application you can think of, these guys have gotten involved in and they are increasing their capabilities now toward (security of) family, wellness protection, health care, things that the alarm guys didn't think about years ago,"" Imperial Capital analyst Jeff Kessler said.Customers usually are one of the many smaller security-system providers in the country. When one signs on, Alarm.com provides the sensors and software that bring the thermostats, water meters and other parts of a property online. The security company pays a portion of the revenue it gets from customers back to Alarm.com.That approach, in which the provider can use the panels and smart devices they want on top of Alarm.com's software, has proved advantageous. As the company grows and incorporates new features into its system, it has kept support services abundant and operations easy for installers, service staff and users who might not be tech-savvy, Kessler said.In a recent research note, Kessler described a visit to a smart-home demonstration house in Falls Church, Va., noting how easily a ""new associate"" at the company was able to outline the technology's functionality. And he noted its potential compatibility with other existing smart devices.He said that with the touch of a button or a simple command to a virtual assistant, such features could be used to adjust the lighting, temperature and other functions to create ideal environments for sleeping, dinner or watching sports.Shares of Alarm.com also bounded higher this month after it reported second-quarter earnings, helped by 40% growth in its licensing and software-as-a-service sales. Gains in the hardware it sells — including cameras and video-camera doorbells — helped too.Acquisitions have also played an important role for the company. The company in March said it closed the acquisition of a part of Icontrol Networks. That purchase gave it Connect, a company that offers a home-security and automation platform used by ADT Pulse, ADT's own smart security system.""When the company announced the acquisition of Icontrol (last year) the valuation really improved materially,"" McCourt said.Nearly all of Alarm.com's business is in the U.S., but it has expanded its offerings to Latin America, Australia, Turkey, South Africa and elsewhere. Its wellness business, Kessler said, has the potential to become massive. In that segment, the company's services help family members remotely monitor the conditions and activity of loved ones — whether daily routines have changed or if they've been in bed for an abnormally long period — and respond quickly if there's an emergency.IBD'S TAKE: Alarm.com finished in a buy zone Aug. 4 and has kept climbing ever since. The company has a best-possible Composite Rating of 99. To learn more about where the stock and its industry group stand, visit IBD Stock Checkup.However, Kessler said, more established procedures between health insurers, end users and others — among them, who pays for what — would be needed before Alarm.com's wellness business can further take off. And even as the company churns out earnings growth, McCourt said the company is still focused on investing in growth. Analysts see earnings-per-share growth slowing in the next two quarters and declining into the first half of next year before picking back up.But a bigger threat to Alarm.com is, in part, the nature of home security itself, which easily lends itself to do-it-yourself projects. Consumers can buy security cameras, thermostats and lights themselves at a store.""In other words, there are plenty of ways to get home automation in your home,"" McCourt said. ""You don't need to subscribe from an alarm-monitoring company.""However, even amid increased advertising for DIY security setups, property security dealers that work with Alarm.com hadn't seen a major dent in demand during the second quarter, William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri wrote in a research note.""Some of the advertising has actually helped Alarm.com through educating the market about functionality, including video doorbells, which have been a driver of new Alarm.com activations and have had better traction than anticipated,"" he said.Also looming over Alarm.com's prospects are Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google. Alarm.com already allows someone to control home functions in their home via an Apple Watch, and its technology also integrates with the Google's Nest thermostats. But the tech giants' plans for their smart-home technology remain unclear.More directly, the company also faces competition from Honeywell (HON), which has a smart-home service, and bigger threats from telecom giants like Comcast (CMCSA) and AT&T (T). Comcast's XFinity and AT&T's security services allow people to manage their home security via mobile device.The company's Zartman said in his email that he sees ""a lot of partnership opportunities"" with the telecom and tech giants in the near-term. Still, those far bigger companies have more ability to drop into a market and cut prices to draw customers.But amid a broader cord-cutting movement, attrition rates for the cable companies remain high. Building a network that can work with police and paramedics also isn't easy, and false alarms can kill emergency responders' confidence, Kessler said.""Police and medical people and responders are overstressed to begin with, with all these new systems out there,"" he said.Shares of Alarm.com were up 1% in recent trades to 42.63.RELATED:This No. 1 Ranked Security Stock May Unlock New BreakoutComcast Could Partner With Altice To Acquire Charter, Says CitigroupBig Media Just Gave Sports Fans Another Reason To Cut The Cord

You don't know how the stock will report and how the market will react, and you don't have enough time to build a profit cushion.

420,TAP,"If you're in the National Basketball Association playoffs, you want Steph Curry or LeBron James on your team. If you're managing a retirement account or taxable portfolio, why not tap into the Fidelity Investments' brain trust, which includes an army of analysts? Knowing cumulative stock moves in Fidelity's many mutual funds can help you choose your own buys and sells.Not all Fidelity funds make the same buys and sells, but it's instructive to see which leading stocks Fidelity overall bet more of its shareholders' money on the first quarter and where it lightened its weightings. Normally you'd have to track down and then sift through Securities and Exchange Commission filings by each of Fidelity's 358 stock and balanced funds. But CFRA, an independent research firm, has done that and crunched the numbers for you already.What CFRA found is that Fidelity's biggest sector weights were in information technology and consumer discretionary. By the end of Q1, Fidelity had nearly 27% of its shareholders' money at work in tech. It had more than 15% of its shareholders cash placed in consumer discretionary stocks.""Heading into 2017, economically sensitive information technology stocks were poised to benefit from a risk-on environment,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA's director of ETF and mutual fund research. ""Further, Fidelity offers a number of growth-oriented strategies that tend to favor tech stocks.""Among Fidelity's 75 largest stock positions across all of its stock and balanced portfolios, PayPal (PYPL) and Qualcomm (QCOM) were tech-sector stocks in which the Fidelity complex increased its Q1 share-count percentage the most.Fidelity added 6.4 million shares of PayPal, for a 16.8% increase. It added 4.3 million shares of Qualcomm, for an 8.3% hike.Fidelity's $110.7 billion Contrafund (FCNTX) — the firm's largest stock mutual fund — and $15.5 billion Magellan (FMAGX) were among the funds investing in PayPal as of their latest disclosures.Fidelity's $14.8 billion OTC (FOCPX) and $30.5 billion Balanced (FBALX) funds were holders of Qualcomm.Still, Fidelity made an even bigger percentage increase in its share count in LyondellBasell Industries (LYB). Adding 5.2 million shares across its funds, Fidelity's share count jumped nearly 31%.The Netherlands-based company makes chemicals and polymers that are used packaging, home furnishings and automotive components. A materials manufacturer like that stands to benefit from any global expansion in GDP, such as the one that appears to be underway.Fidelity's Magellan, Balanced and OTC funds were investors in LyondellBasell.Drugmaker Amgen (AMGN) had the third-largest Q1 percentage boost in share count by Fidelity funds. The 2.7 million share boost was a 9.9% increase.Amgen is a leading seller of LDL cholesterol-battling drugs. A judge recently sided with Amgen in a patent lawsuit against Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY). The ruling is under appeal.Fidelity's $9.4 billion Select Biotechnology (FBIOX) and $21 billion Blue Chip Growth (FBGRX) funds were Amgen holders.Fidelity's fourth-largest share-count percentage hike was for Charter Communications (CHTR). Fidelity's increase of nearly 800,000 shares was a 9.8% boost.Charter is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Telecom Services-Integrated industry group. Earnings per share rose 131% in the latest quarter on a 302% rise in sales. Its three-year sales growth rate is 54%.IBD'S TAKE: See how Charter's additional, easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against that of rivals at IBD's Stock Checkup.Fidelity's $7.4 billion Dividend Growth (FDGFX) and $1.6 billion Trend funds were Charter investors.Fidelity's build up of Qualcomm shares was the fund family's fifth-biggest increase. Its boosts in Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were its next two largest percentage increases.Fidelity boosted its share count in Citigroup by 5.9 million shares, a 7.5% increase. Its step up of about 550,000 shares in Goldman Sachs was also a 7.5% increase.RELATED:Are Fidelity's Recent Stocks Buys And Sells Retirement Account Hot Sauce?P-s-s-st!

That followed a 20-year IPO anniversary for Amazon.com (AMZN) and a five-year anniversary for Facebook (FB) earlier this month. (Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) came public in August 2004.)Looking ahead to Tuesday, hot Chinese internet stock Momo, video game maker Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) and luxury builder Toll Brothers are due to report earnings before the opening bell.Momo advanced 1.4% to 43.42, paring initial gains in early trading after crushing Q1 views. Toll Bros. reported better-than-expected Q2 EPS and sales growth, sending its shares up 2.55% to 39.All three leading stocks are extended from proper buy points, but Momo and Toll results could affect related stocks such as NetEase (NTES) and Lennar (LEN) that are consolidating near buy points.Meanwhile, Take-Two Interactive shares tumbled 8% in early trading after its Rockstar Games label confirmed late Monday that the release of ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" would be delayed from this fall to Spring 2018.Netflix came public on May 22, 2002. The IPO price was 15 (1.07 split adjusted). Since then shares have skyrocketed 14,568%.Much as Facebook had a costly, expensive shift to mobile, Netflix transitioned from its DVD-by-mail origins to streaming, which substantially raised content costs. But booming subscriber growth, including a near-global expansion, and more homegrown content have offset that.Increasingly, Netflix is seen as a ""necessity"" rather than a luxury. Even as Amazon Prime Video and Hulu have become more-viable rivals, many Americans are signing up for multiple streaming services, rather than picking just one.Netflix has made a big bet on exclusive comedy specials in 2017. Some analysts have speculated that Netflix could decide to expand into exclusive sports content. Facebook, Amazon and Twitter (TWTR) have ventured more into sports (Facebook has begun live-streaming a Major League Baseball game every Friday, with Amazon recently getting the rights to the NFL's ""Thursday Night Football,"" taking over from Twitter.)Netflix shares rose 0.1% to 157.16 in Monday stock market trading, up 27% so far in 2017.

422,TAP,"Worried about going broke after you retire? Then join the crowd: In this era of longer retirements, fewer pensions, choppy markets and low savings rates, evidently many are vexed.  People wonder: Will Social Security be enough? Will savings last? What if inflation roars, or stock prices plunge? Or you need long-term care?""Americans across all demographics are deeply worried about maintaining their standard of living in retirement,"" says Kelly Kenneally, communication advisor at the National Institute on Retirement Security. According to a new NIRS report she co-authored, fully 76% of those surveyed fear economic conditions ""will affect their ability to have a secure retirement.""But as unnerving as it all may be, experts say there are solutions: roadmaps to guide financial planning through the golden years. Key points range from budgeting, to the timing of when to tap which funds, to paying for what could become pricey health care. Here's how some financial pros explain these points that can help keep you solvent:1. Make a financial plan that starts with a budget. To help gauge your costs, figure that for retirees, spending tends to run 20% to 30% lower than pre-retirement earnings, says David Laster, managing director and head of retirement strategies at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC). The math could work this way: If your annual pre-retirement salary was $80,000, and of that you'd saved $10,000, you'd be left with $70,000. When you trim the new total 20% to 30%, you get a retirement spending amount of between $49,000 and $56,000, Laster says.From there, you classify spending as either essential, such as for food and housing, or discretionary for, say, entertainment and travel. Preferably pay for essential needs with guaranteed income, such as a pension and Social Security, Laster recommends. But if possible, wait to start collecting Social Security until age 70, when you can claim the largest possible benefit.2. Determine how much you can safely withdraw from savings.  Evidently, many new retirees haven't done the math: According to a 2014 survey of spending by new retirees, only 48% of respondents had a withdrawal plan for their investable assets. What should it be?Judith Ward, senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price, recommends withdrawing a maximum of 4% from retirement savings in the first year you need the money. ""That conservative rate guards against overspending in the earlier years of retirement,"" says Ward. In subsequent years, you can adjust that 4% to account for inflation and/or swings in your investment returns.3. Identify which retirement sources to use when. Many experts agree: Start by using any guaranteed income.If you still need money before age 70-1/2, tap your taxable accounts, starting with their cash flows, such as dividends or interest, recommends Colleen Jaconetti, senior investment strategist in Vanguard's Investment Strategy Group. As Jaconetti explains, typically you'll owe taxes on these funds whether they are spent or reinvested. (Reinvesting them and then liquidating holdings later to meet spending needs will likely incur additional taxes.)Plan to use up taxable assets before moving to your tax-advantaged funds.At age 70-1/2, you'll have to start taking required minimum distributions (RMD) from your tax-deferred retirement accounts. (These funds will be taxed at the ordinary income tax rate.) Use RMD money, along with taxable assets if needed, until the taxable funds are gone. Then, decide between using assets in tax-deferred, or in tax-free Roth, holdings. As a rule of thumb, advises Jaconetti: First spend from the Roth accounts if you'll likely pay a lower tax rate in the future. If the opposite is true, first tap your tax-deferred accounts, such as your traditional IRAs.4. Set your asset allocation. Although experts' advice differs, many pros echo this theme: Given your potentially long time in retirement, your portfolio will still need growth assets, such as stocks. But ""you also need to temper your downside risk,"" says Vanguard's Jaconetti. ""In talking to retirees, I commonly hear a preference for 40% to 60% weightings to stocks — depending on people's risk tolerance and goals."" Later, rebalance the portfolio if assets rise or fall out of their target range.5. Figure out how to pay for medical costs. Indeed, much of Medicare's costs can be added up and included in your overall budget, holds Garrett Ball, owner of 65 Medicare.org, an independent Medicare insurance brokerage.  Bear in mind that Medicare's monthly Part B premium, which covers outpatient services, is deducted from your Social Security payment. Beyond that, if you choose traditional Medicare — vs. a Medicare Advantage plan — you'll pay for both supplemental insurance and for your Medicare Part D drug program. In contrast, with Medicare Advantage you'll pay the plan's premium, if there is one, and then estimate likely out-of-pocket medical costs, such as co-pays and deductibles, Ball explains.However, Medicare generally doesn't cover long-term care. Experts suggest planning for it via a long-term care insurance policy, best purchased before age 60 — or by creating a set-aside, in the order of about $100,000 to $200,000.RELATED:Here's How Much $20 A Week In Retirement Savings Can Mushroom Into

425,TAP,"Here is your Investing Action Plan for Thursday: What you need to know as an investor.XIPOs and competition from FANG stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) factor into a variety of earnings reports due Thursday, from Snap (SNAP), Blue Apron (APRN), three big department stores and digital advertising platform The Trade Desk (TTD). Nvidia (NVDA) and highly rated Chinese internet stock YY (YY) also report.Estimates: Wall Street expects the parent of the messaging site Snapchat to report a second-quarter per-share loss of 14 cents on revenue of $187 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.Shares of Snap have tumbled since it began trading in March on concerns about user engagement and competition from Facebook (FB).Instagram, the photo- and video-sharing site that Facebook bought in 2012, has introduced Instagram Stories, a feature that does much of what Snapchat allows its users to do. That is, string together photos and videos and decorate them with messages and other images over the course of the day. Instagram Stories now has more users than Snapchat overall.A ""lockup period"" for Snap's IPO also ended last week, allowing early investors to sell shares.Shares rebounded 4.3% to 13.58 in the stock market today after hitting a record-low 11.91 last week.Estimates: Wall Street expects the maker of graphics chips to report a 57% surge in second-quarter EPS to 69 cents, as revenue jumps 36% to $1.948 billion.Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis said in a research note Wednesday, according to CNBC, that he expected the company's PC gaming business to get a lift from the demand for the Nintendo Switch, as well as from digital-currency mining — the verifying and recording of transactions, for currencies like bitcoin, done with graphics-processing units.Firmer pricing from Intel (INTC) and AMD (AMD) also bode well for Nvidia, he said.Shares rose 1.1% to 172.11.

The company, whose digital advertising platform locates and buys online multimedia advertising space in a fraction of a second, relative to customers' budget and strategy, began trading in September.The Trade Desk in May said its Q1 earnings had doubled, and it reported ""incredibly strong customer wins"" and ""exceptional"" international gains, and it said the results pointed to ""a strong 2017 for our business.""However, analysts have expressed concern about Trade Desk's much bigger rivals, like Facebook and Google-owner Alphabet, which also run their own ad platforms.Shares sank 1% to 53.99. The stock has tried to break out of a consolidation with a 57.67 entry.Estimates: Wall Street expects the Chinese live-streaming and social platform to report Q2 EPS of $1.34, climbing 34%, as revenue charges 22% higher to $364 million. Shares rallied 2.2% to 77.97.

That would be its best earnings growth in five quarters and best sales growth in six quarters.For the June quarter, analysts expect Apple to earn $1.62 a share, up 14%, on sales of $45.57 billion, up 8%.Apple shares finished the day at a new high, up 2% to 146.58, hitting an intraday high of 147.20. Apple's previous record was 145.46, reached on April 5.Wall Street is predicting quiet quarterly results from Apple before the rumored September launch of the company's highly anticipated iPhone 8.Many investors will be more focused on the company's cash return plan than on near-term sales and earnings growth. Apple updates its capital return program every spring with its second-quarter results. Analysts expect the iPhone maker to raise its cash dividend and share buybacks.""Apple is currently in the seasonal doldrums for the iPhone as the March and June quarters have historically been the seasonally weakest quarters of the year,"" Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said in a report Monday. ""However, we believe investors will continue to support the stock ahead of the iPhone 8 cycle that is expected to begin this fall.""IBD'S TAKE: Apple is on IBD's Leaderboard list of actionable stocks with the potential for big gains.White rates Apple stock as buy with a price target of 185.Apple's fiscal second-quarter report is unlikely to be a meaningful catalyst for the stock, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves said in a report.Critical questions will remain unanswered related to profit growth in the iPhone 8 cycle and for possible repatriation of foreign cash, he said.Hargreaves rates Apple stock as overweight with a price target of 150.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani expects in-line results for Apple's March quarter and sees some downside to June-quarter expectations.He rates Apple stock as outperform with a price target of 157.""While investors clearly and rightfully remain focused on second-half 2017 dynamics we think there could be several levers to monitor this quarter,"" he said.They include increased dividends and stock buybacks, gross margin pressure in the face of rising Nand chip prices, iPhone inventory ahead of the fall product refresh, and continued services growth.RELATED:Apple iPhone 8 To Lay Groundwork For Augmented-Reality HeadsetApple iPhone 8 Upgrades May Lag As People Hold On To Phones Longer

432,TAP,"Advisors wear many hats. They can double as teachers, social workers and consumer advocates.Yet one of their most overlooked roles is also crucial to their success: trend-spotter.Top advisors stay one step ahead of trends, both within their industry and society at large. Because they anticipate what's ahead, they can develop farsighted strategies and act on their hunches at the right time.Their keen awareness of consumer behavior, demographic shifts and other big-picture developments enables them to grow their business and serve clients more effectively. The tricky part is stepping back from the day-to-day operations of the business to spot larger trends.Keeping up on trends can come through throwing around ideas with staff meetings, tapping feedback from clients and networks, enlisting input from peers and vendors, and staying in tune with your kids.""It's extremely important to pay attention to trends,"" said Jeff Powell, an advisor in San Rafael, Calif. ""We're constantly evolving our business to be better all the time,"" and identifying incipient changes in the marketplace helps lay the groundwork for improvements.In monthly meetings, Powell and about five colleagues compare notes on their ideas and observations. They often start by asking, ""Are we doing our best to stay ahead of best practices in our industry?""They share insights on new products and services that might benefit the firm. They also discuss input they've gathered from clients and others both within their practice and beyond.""Our clients provide us with the most meaningful feedback on how to serve them best,"" Powell said. Consumers can act as your eyes and ears to the larger world as they open up about their purchasing patterns, favorite new activities and use of new technologies.Spotting trends is easier when you can tap a rich network of well-informed friends and colleagues. They can help you assess new developments in your field and make better strategic decisions.With over 20 years of experience in financial services, Powell has cultivated friendships with other advisors around the country. His peers keep him plugged into relevant trends.When his human-resources manager sought to update the firm's compensation and benefit package, Powell enlisted the help of his peers. They discussed their pay structures, and their data and input enabled Powell's team to maintain a competitive edge in terms of attracting and retaining top talent.Powell also solicits input from his firm's custodian, TD Ameritrade (AMTD), along with his vendors. For example, he periodically asks his advertising firm, ""What are you seeing out there that's working for other advisory firms?""Some advisors find that the sharpest trend-spotters reside closer to home. In fact, they live at home.Chris Orestis, who specializes in life insurance and helping seniors with financial planning issues, stays on top of trends by learning from his four teenage sons. Over dinner, he often poses questions such as, ""What's cool out there?"" and ""What new websites are up?""""They tease me by calling it 'Dad's daily download,' "" Orestis said. ""They've left behind traditional media, and sometimes what they tell me keeps me ahead of my peers.""Orestis learned about the latest advances in podcasts from his sons. They also introduced him to the proliferation of YouTube channels that present content that appeals to younger audiences who spend much of their time on mobile devices.""Based on what I've learned, we modified our video content for marketing, educational and outreach purposes,"" he said. ""Before, we featured three- to five-minute talking heads with PowerPoint (slides). Now, we post two-minute hip, animated, all-music videos with infographics and no voice-over.""Orestis says he's receiving ""great feedback"" on the new videos, even from baby boomers and seniors. Better yet, the new online content only cost ""a couple thousand dollars,"" he adds.""All of our social media metrics have increased for us,"" he said. ""That's led to higher brand awareness. And I had no idea about all this until I talked with my teenage boys.""Building on his video success, Orestis is rolling out a podcast in the same catchy style. He urges other advisors to expand their horizons to capitalize on consumers' ever-changing habits and preferences.When advisors engage in target marketing, they may not realize the importance of narrowing the scope of their audience. Orestis emphasizes that a key to tracking trends is identifying narrow niches and building loyal followers within those well-defined clusters.""You've got to be a keen observer of your environment,"" he said. ""Go beyond mainstream media. Talk to your kids and grandkids. Show interest in what they're doing. It's a great way to reconnect with them and to spot trends that can help you in your business.""RELATED:Reliable Ways To Recruit Stars To Your Firm

436,TAP,"Tesla (TSLA) is going back to investors for more cash to fund its rapid Model 3 rollout, announcing Monday that it will offer $1.5 billion in debt set to mature in 2025.X""Tesla intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to further strengthen its balance sheet during this period of rapid scaling with the launch of Model 3, and for general corporate purposes,"" the company said.The news didn't come as a huge surprise. Elon Musk had said on last week's earnings call that Tesla might tap debt markets again. Tesla's cash holdings fell to $3 billion at the end of Q2 vs. $4 billion at the end of Q1.Tesla shares fell 0.8% to 354.11 before the opening bell on the stock market today. Tesla jumped 6.55% to 356.91 last week on its better-than-expected Q2 results, pushing the stock back above its 50-day moving average.

438,TAP,"Las Vegas is getting an NFL team, gaming revenue is returning to Macau, and economic improvements in both China and the U.S. are bringing people back to the casino table.For a sprawling resort operator like MGM Resorts International (MGM), whose hotels, convention spaces and casinos line the streets Macau, Vegas, and increasingly in other U.S. cities, things could be worse.""Usually when you see those kinds of factors taking place, that bodes well for our industry as a whole,"" MGM Chief Financial Officer Dan D'Arrigo told Investor's Business Daily.In Las Vegas, MGM has more exposure in the city than any other rival. Thus, the company stands to gain as more businesses attend conventions, gamers attend ""League of Legends"" tournaments, tourists plot their buffet strategy and people come from L.A. to party or blow their savings from behind poker sunglasses.""MGM is the best positioned operator to capture the growing trends in Las Vegas and faces many growth catalysts over the next few years that should generate stock price appreciation,"" Barclays analyst Felicia Hendrix said in a recent note to clients.Those catalysts were likely on display when the company reported strong first-quarter earnings last month. It was helped by Vegas, Macau, the December opening of MGM National Harbor outside Washington, D.C., and the company's moves to bring Atlantic City, N.J.-based Borgata, under its umbrella. Management said it remained optimistic about the ""market's recent uptick"" in lucrative VIP gaming.And in Macau, now the world's biggest gambling hot spot and the only place in China where it's legal, MGM plans to open a location this year on the casino-gilded Cotai Strip, its second in the region. The extra location, loaded with some 1,400 hotel rooms as well as spas and meeting spaces, would help the company offset some of the regulatory crackdown there, analysts say.""There is a VIP rally underway in Macau,"" Telsey Advisory Group analyst David Katz told IBD.The casino glare tends to divert attention from an ongoing shift in Las Vegas' economy on which MGM has capitalized. That is the evolution away from the casino business toward hospitality, making the city one of the premiere destinations for conventions.MGM already controls much of the Las Vegas Strip. Gabelli & Co. estimated in an October research report that MGM and Caesars Entertainment (CZR) owned 70% of hotel rooms there and accounted for the same slice of the area's net sales. Rivals Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and others control the rest, Gabelli said.""MGM has pulled away as a clear leader in the (meetings and conventions) category with its expansion at Mandalay Bay and forthcoming expansion of Aria,"" Gabelli analyst Adam Trivison wrote in the report, referring to two of the company's casino resort properties. The company's larger operations dedicated to bringing in group businesses have helped on that front, he said in an interview with IBD.And in March, NFL owners OK'd the Oakland Raiders' plans to move to Las Vegas, where the team is set to begin playing in a new $1.9 billion stadium in 2020. Bringing a big sports franchise could shore up business across the city on slower weekends and during the holidays, Trivison said.But there's a particular benefit for MGM: Plans, as of now, would put the stadium along I-15 — right across from MGM's Mandalay Bay Resort.""Everyone wins,"" Trivison wrote in another recent research note, ""especially MGM.""A new highway linking Las Vegas and Phoenix, Interstate 11, could also decongest travel between the two expanding cities once complete. The two metro areas had been the largest adjacent U.S. cities not connected by freeway, and this move could bring more gamblers to Vegas from the southeast. Construction is still in the early phases.Meanwhile, Trivison estimates, there won't be any significant new hotel-room additions to the Las Vegas Strip for potentially three years, keeping new competition at bay for MGM and giving them more control over prices.IBD'S TAKE: In late April, MGM broke out of a flat base that lasted nearly five months and is now hovering in a buy range in the low 30s. MGM has a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99 and is the top-ranked stock in the Leisure-Gaming Equipment sector.The shoring up of fundamentals comes as the industry, once populated by an array of smaller casino operators, has consolidated over the years. Along the way, it has also taken a more sophisticated, analytics-oriented approach to measuring business trends.MGM Resorts International — the product of a sandwiching-together of the legacy MGM business, Mirage and Mandalay — is no exception. The company has gotten better at watching costs and invested in technology that can gauge customer demand and labor needs.MGM's profit growth plan has helped. Under that plan, begun in mid-2015, the company carried out scores of initiatives, including tying its businesses together. It even made sure more of its properties all carried the same kinds of towels.""There was a view that the company could be improved,"" Katz said. ""They were leaving money on the table.""Even as MGM works to keep Wall Street happy, the industry faces a bigger, generational problem: how to keep the younger people coming into Vegas happy as well amid concerns they're not yet interested in gambling.D'Arrigo says Baby Boomers are still MGM's ""bread and butter"" customer. While he said millennials weren't shy about buying bottle service and dropping thousands at a venue in Vegas, they were more interested in the social component of gaming.""We've seen that more with the millennials than we do them sitting down at a three-reel slot machine at video poker,"" he said.The gaming industry, including MGM, has also begun tinkering with technology that allows people to gamble away from the casino floor, perhaps by the pool but not off-premise completely.Seeking to tap the growing popularity of e-sports, MGM's Mandalay Bay Events Center last year also hosted a ""League of Legends"" tournament. It also plans to host Evo 2017 World Finals, the fighting-game tournament, in July. And the company plans to turn a nightclub at its Luxor property into an e-Sports arena, potentially next year.The industry also is experimenting with so-called ""skill-based"" games, first approved in the U.S. last year. Those games function like the shooters or pinball games found on consoles or at arcades, except a player places a bet and gets paid according to how well they do.Trivison says it could take time before the industry develops games that effectively juggle the length of a turn at a game, payout and profitability. And he said it would be difficult to create something as profitable as the slot-heavy regional casinos of decades past.""What business can you think of where people will literally come into your place and drop money into a machine and walk out?"" Trivison said.MGM also has widened its exposure to parts of the U.S. outside of Vegas — with locations like MGM Grand Detroit and National Harbor. The company also plans to open a location in Springfield, Mass., in the second half of next year.Sales from those locations are unlikely to match those in Vegas, and newer, smaller markets can be harder for a casino operator to predict, Telsey's Katz says. Even as Detroit and Springfield pick up the pieces after years of struggle, Katz says locations in smaller cities can turn customers on to MGM's bigger resorts in Las Vegas.That may be helpful, since China is seeking to to curb the flow of cash from its borders. Ultimately, Macau still wields considerable influence over shares of MGM and rivals there — Wynn, LVS and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO).In recent years, China has accused junket operators, the middlemen who loan VIPs money to bypass cash the nation's cash limits, of money laundering. Macau authorities have also set limits on daily ATM cash withdrawals for China UnionPay cardholders — a big source of spending in the gaming hub — and recently said it would begin using facial recognition technology to verify the identities of those cardholders.After concerns VIPs would be scared away, business has picked up. But regulations in China remain hard to predict.""You can never relax about Macau,"" Katz said.MGM shares were up nearly 1% to 31.25 on Friday.

439,TAP,"X China e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings early Thursday that fell short of estimates. Shares initially tumbled but roared back as investors focused on strong revenue growth as well as a new stock buyback plan.Alibaba reported revenue of $5.61 billion, up 60% year over year and beating the consensus estimate of $5.2 billion (35.87 billion yuan). Adjusted earnings rose 37% to 63 cents a share, but missed the consensus of 66 cents (4.53 yuan).Shares fell as much as 5% intraday, but turned up 0.5% at 121.27 at the close on the stock market today. Alibaba stock is up about 35% this year.It appears that Alibaba earnings lagged estimates after it swallowed a higher tax bill and splurged on the entertainment and cloud computing businesses that are fueling revenue growth.""The March quarter is usually a slow season for e-commerce so margins usually come down a bit,"" said Ray Zhao, a Shenzhen-based analyst at Guotai Junan Securities Co. ""Alibaba is spending a lot to drive growth in video and entertainment.""Further, Chinese consumption remains strong, but the world's second-largest economy showed signs of cooling as retail sales and industrial output growth sputtered in April with regulators cracking down on swelling financial leverage.Alibaba has expanded into new areas in response to the deceleration, buying control of Lazada Group SA to gain a Southeast Asian foothold and waging a price-based war with Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) in cloud-computing services.""Our core commerce segment continued its significant growth and strong cash flow at large scale, enabling our aggressive investment in cloud computing, digital media and entertainment to drive the digital transformation of the economy and high-quality consumption across China,"" Alibaba Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said in a prepared statement.Alibaba is trying to appeal to a growing middle class demanding premium products from Alaskan salmon to New Zealand milk. Growing Chinese affluence is propelling billionaire founder Jack Ma's international expansion, which include helping a million American businesses tap Chinese consumers and reaching foreign shoppers through AliExpress.Income tax expenses soared 149% to 4.6 billion yuan in the March quarter. Its effective tax rate climbed to 29% from 23% a year earlier, when the company set aside a portion of its earnings as non-taxable reinvestment capital. Alibaba said it also incurred additional taxes from the sale of certain unspecified investments. The company Thursday green-lit a $6 billion share buyback program over two years.The strength of its e-commerce business is helping Alibaba weather losses in newer businesses of cloud computing and digital entertainment. While revenue in those nascent divisions is surging, they are yet to make money and costs are soaring as Tencent and Baidu (BIDU) vie with Alibaba for licensed content.""Over time the market will become more rational, although in the near term there's still going to be pretty fierce competition,"" Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told analysts on a conference call. Alibaba is ""working with talent and directors on proprietary content, so over time the cost should come down.""Alibaba's report follows the quarterly earnings of JD.com (JD), Alibaba's closest rival in the e-commerce field. JD.com topped estimates and guided second-quarter revenue above views.For other China internet stocks, it's been a good earnings season, with several market leaders reporting strong results, including Tencent. China-based Tencent reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter early Wednesday, beating estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Tencent is China's leader in mobile messaging and gaming. It also owns a strategic stake in JD.com.RELATED:Weibo Skyrockets As Earnings, Guidance Clear ViewsSina Earnings Trump Views, Stock Poised To Enter Buy ZoneTop Chinese Internets Autohome, YY Earnings Top Views

440,TAP,"XStock futures reversed lower Thursday morning as Brazil's political and market turmoil adds to Trump-related selling following New York's worst day of 2017.The Justice Department late Wednesday named a special prosecutor to take over the Russia-Trump probe and Cisco Systems (CSCO) plunged on weak guidance. Meanwhile, fellow Dow component Wal-Mart (WMT) gets a chance this morning to show if it can hold its own against Amazon.com (AMZN).That comes after the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite suffered their worst losses in months, following reports that President Trump pressured then-FBI chief James Comey to drop his investigation of short-lived National Security Advisor Mike Flynn.Bank stocks were big losers, with Citigroup (C) falling 4% and Bank of America (BAC) 5.9%. Citigroup dropped below an aggressive buy point. Bank of America plunged through its 50-day line.The DOJ late Wednesday named ex-FBI Director Richard Mueller to take over the investigation of links between Russia and President Trump's associates in the 2016 campaign.At minimum, Trump's escalating political troubles suggest that the president will struggle to pass tax cuts or other pro-growth initiatives. Stocks had soared on hopes for that agenda but soured Wednesday.Meanwhile, Brazil stock futures tumbled overnight following new audio disclosures linking President Temer to a massive corruption scandal underway. Huge protests took place Wednesday night vs. Michel Temer, who was vice president until his predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached for her ties to the same broad scandal. The iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ETF (EWZ) plunged 15.6% in the premarket after falling 3.2% Tuesday.S&P 500 index futures fell 0.3% vs. fair value reversing from gains of roughly 0.4% overnight. Dow futures were down 0.4% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures sank more than 0.4%.Over in Asia, investors continued the worldwide selloff. Japan's Nikkei sank 1.3% and Australia's ASX/S&P 200 retreated 0.8% Thursday. The Shanghai composite retreated 0.45%. European markets were lower in intraday action, with the U.K.'s FTSE down 1.4%, Germany's Dax 0.9% and France's CAC-40 1%.After Wednesday's market close, networking giant Cisco Systems reported better-than-expected earnings while revenue edged past views, though it fell vs. a year earlier for a sixth straight quarter. But Cisco sees larger-than-expected EPS and sales declines in the current quarter. Shares crashed 7.5% in premarket trading. Cisco had fallen 1.4% to 33.82 on Wednesday, better than the general market and not far from a 34.63 buy point.Looking ahead, Wal-Mart will report first-quarter earnings early Thursday. Wal-Mart has spent heavily to step up its online game, buying Jet.com last year and adding some niche e-commerce firms in 2017. The retail giant even stole a march on Amazon, cutting its minimum online order for free shipping to $35 earlier this year. That spurred Amazon to reverse its policy and cut rates twice, from $50 to $35, and then to $25.Wal-Mart is expected to report a 2% EPS decline to 96 cents, according to Zacks Investment Research, with sales up 1.5% to $117.63 billion. Wal-Mart shares actually rose 1 cent to 75.12 on Wednesday.Also Thursday, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) will report in the morning, while Salesforce.com (CRM) and Ross Stores (ROST) are on tap for after the market close.RELATED:Stocks Slide Fast As White House Focus Grows; Uptrend Under PressureCisco Sales Fall For Sixth Straight Quarter; Revenue Outlook MissesRun On Bank Stocks: Citigroup Loses Buy Point, Bank of America Breaks Key Level5 Key Earnings Reports Due: Investing Action Plan

441,TAP,"Remember when Greece was in shambles and it seemed the fate of Europe's economy rested on that country's debt crisis? You should look again.XGreece's stock market has rallied nearly 30% so far this year and more than 50% over the past 12 months. The Athens Stock Exchange General Index is near the highest levels in two years, though it remains about 85% below the peak in November 2007, when the global financial crisis caused Greece to start missing bond payments. The index plummeted from that point until it bottomed in June 2012, about two years after the International Monetary Fund and the European Union provided Greece with a bailout. Other bailouts would follow.ETF investors wishing to play the rebound can tap into Global X MSCI Greece (GREK), which has made a magnificent advance since it climbed out of a price consolidation in April. Shares of the ETF are now finding support after a pullback to the 10-week moving average, affording a secondary entry.The fund, the only ETF exclusively targeting Greece, gathers some of the largest and most liquid companies in the country. Not many large companies are based in Greece, so the portfolio has fewer than 30 stocks.All companies must be listed or headquartered in Greece and must have three-month average daily volume of at least $25 million. If there are fewer than 20 companies, the index can add companies with more than 20% exposure to Greece.The portfolio is more heavily weighted with financials: one-third of the portfolio is in that sector, and four of the largest holdings are banks. Hellenic Telecommunications — which provides mobile phone, internet, television and other consumer services — is 13% of the portfolio. Its Athens-traded shares are up about 14% since a breakout May 9.The country's debt crisis certainly hurt the ETF. Shares fell as much as 78% from a peak in March 2014 to the all-time low in February 2016.Greece still has a lot of work to do on its massive bailout. Creditors demanded dozens of reforms as conditions of keeping the country's economy afloat, and more than 100 of those conditions still need to be met, Bloomberg reported last week. That includes some of the most difficult reforms, including fixing a burdensome tax system.But Athens has made progress. The country started selling bonds again in 2014 and launched its first sovereign debt offering in three years last month. It has won pledges for $9.5 billion in new loans from European creditors. Certainly, Greece has higher country risk than other European nations, and the reforms have been unpopular with Greeks.""The economic recovery in Greece has been slow to materialize given the severity of the country's recession and strict austerity measures,"" Global X says. Greece has had to increase tax collections and cut spending, which have helped to shore up the country's finances, but has created headwinds for economic growth in the near term.Longer term, ""we believe these reforms are critical for returning Greece to more normal debt levels, stabilizing their banking system, and allowing for more sustainable growth in the broader economy. In other words, we believe Greece is on the right path forward, but an economic recovery under these conditions is likely to be slow.""The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

442,TAP,"On Thursday, Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) reported better-than-expected earnings, with Apple (AAPL) iPhone chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) on tap tonight.X Check Point was one of six cybersecurity stocks on the verge of breakouts as Tuesday night (including Fortinet (FTNT), Proofpoint (PFPT) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW)), with all but one crossing buy points intraday.Meanwhile, Skyworks will provide clues to Apple's business and those of other iPhone chipmakers, with Broadcom (AVGO) just below an entry point.During Wednesday's session, the Nasdaq composite rose 0.6% and the S&P 500 index 0.5%, both hitting record highs. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.3%.Futures for the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average rose about 0.1% vs. fair value early Thursday morning. So did Nasdaq 100 futures.Israeli-based Check Point Software reported second-quarter earnings of $1.26 a share excluding various items, a 16% gain, with revenue up 8.5% to $458.6 million. Analysts had expected a 12% per-share profit rise to $1.22 with revenue up nearly 8% to $455 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.Check Point fell 1.5% to 114 in Thursday's premarket action.During Wednesday's stock market trading, Check Point Software rose as high as 116.63, trading above a 115.97 flat base entry for much of the session. But shares closed up 0.9% to 105.72, just below that buy point.Stocks tend to move with their groups. Still, it was striking how many cybersecurity plays acted like Check Point. Fortinet, FireEye (FEYE), Imperva (IMPV) and Palo Alto Networks all cleared entries intraday, only to close just under those levels. Proofpoint closed near session highs, moving into position for a possible breakout. All six are within 2% of valid entry points.Fortinet and Proofpoint will report quarterly results next week.Skyworks Solutions reports fiscal third-quarter earnings late Thursday. Skyworks is one of the earlier chipmakers to report, and one of the very first Apple iPhone chipmakers to do so. (Qualcomm (QCOM) reported late Wednesday, but its ongoing royalties feud with Apple doesn't make it a great bellwether for the iPhone ecosystem.)Skyworks is expected to report earnings per share of $1.51 vs. $1.24 a year earlier. That would be a 22% EPS gain. Revenue should be $890 million, with the 18% yearly gain matching fiscal Q2's.Skyworks rose 1.5% to 105.41 on Wednesday, closing in on a 112.21 entry from a cup base. Skyworks retook its 50-day moving average last Friday.Apple shares finally regained their 50-day line on Tuesday, but they've risen for nine straight sessions now. Apple is nearing a 156.75 flat-base entry.Apple supplier Broadcom is much closer than Skyworks or Apple. Broadcom rose 1.4% to 254.40 on Wednesday, now within 1% of a 256.88 entry from a base-on-base pattern.Apple will release quarterly results on Aug. 1.In addition to Check Point and Skyworks, a slew of big earnings reports are due Thursday.

444,TAP,"X McDonald's (MCD) on Wednesday said it will widen its new delivery service to restaurants in Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix and Columbus, Ohio — the latest industrywide effort to tap a growing population that does business via their smartphones.Customers can order food on a mobile app or through UberEats, which McDonald's has partnered with for deliveries. The expansion now means that delivery is offered at some 1,000 U.S. McDonald's restaurants, including 300 in LA.""We are bringing a new level of convenience to more of our customers as we continue to transform the McDonald's experience,"" CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a statement.McDonald's, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, last month said it would expand deliveries from its trial run in Florida, which began this year, to other cities in the U.S. during this quarter. Jack in the Box (JACK) has also expanded delivery to Los Angeles and Phoenix via its delivery partner DoorDash.McDonald's has also said it would launch a mobile order and pay platform in 20,000 restaurants in the U.S. and other areas by the end of the year. The burger chain is also rolling out its new restaurant format, called ""Experience of the Future,"" which will have digital ordering kiosks and table service.Wendy's (WEN), which also has self-order kiosks at some restaurants, is also rolling out a mobile order and pay system. Restaurant Brands International's (QSR) Burger King wants to expand a mobile platform of its own.The digital expansion has the potential to make ordering food easier than ever, and analysts have said smartphone ordering marks the biggest change to the way people buy fast food since the drive-thru.But the technology raises questions about how restaurants will manage margins as they spend on technology and how they handle traffic-flow through their restaurants.IBD'S TAKE: Even as restaurants race to expand delivery, Restaurant Brands International has been growing by acquisitions.Starbucks (SBUX), which has its own mobile order and pay platform, had reported some knots in in-store customer traffic after launching the system.McDonald's, which is already testing fresh, cooked-to-order hamburger patties at some restaurants, reported minor slowdowns at the drive-thru that were later corrected.McDonald's edged down 0.6% to 146.41 in the stock market today after hitting a record high Tuesday.Wendy's fell 3.4% after setting a fresh decade high on Tuesday. Restaurant Brands retreated 1.1% from an all-time best. Starbucks dipped 0.4% to 59.73, holding just above a 59.64 buy point. Jack in the Box, which late Tuesday topped earnings views and said it would explore ""alternatives"" for its Qdoba Mexican Eats chain, rose 5.6%.The industry's delivery expansion also raises questions about competition for driver's. Domino's Pizza (DPZ), whose mobile-ordering technology has fit in well with its decades-old delivery service, is currently testing GPS technology. CEO Patrick Doyle, during the Domino's earnings call last month, also said his company was a better place for drivers to work."" ... for those drivers who are listening to this call,"" he said, ""my pitch is you're going to be more consistently busy and receiving tips at Domino's than working somewhere else, and that is ultimately what keeps drivers happy is that they're busy.""RELATED:Jack In The Box Finds A 'Forgiving' Late-Night-Delivery CustomerJack In The Box Beats Views, Eyes 'Potential Alternatives' For Qdoba

446,TAP,"X Futures for the Dow industrials, S&P 500 index and other major averages fell significantly on fresh negative headlines on President Trump. That followed a mixed session Tuesday in which the Nasdaq rallied, hitting fresh record highs, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 closed slightly lower.While the secular bull market is now 8 years old, quality stocks continue to break out of bullish patterns. Four that are in buy range right now: Apple chip supplier Qorvo (QRVO), Citigroup (C), Chinese search giant Baidu (BIDU) and Starbucks (SBUX).S&P 500 index futures fell nearly 0.5% vs. fair value. Futures for the Nasdaq 100 slid 0.35%. Dow Jones industrial average futures retreated 0.4% below fair value, or about 85 points. Dow futures signaled triple-digit losses for much of the night.Late Tuesday, the New York Times, followed by several other big publications, reported that Trump had asked then-FBI Director James Comey to drop an investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. The White House denied the reports.Trump, who abruptly fired Comey last week, is also under pressure over a Washington Post article claiming that he gave highly classified information to Russian officials the day after ousting the FBI chief. The political furor makes it harder for Trump and the GOP Congress to focus on pro-growth agenda items, notably tax cuts.Keep in mind that the major market averages have largely shrugged off various setbacks and negative media coverage for the Trump administration. But with key GOP lawmakers saying they plan to call Comey to testify and subpoena the memo that includes his account of Trump's alleged Flynn request, the political headache for the White House is intensifying.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.5% as the safe-haven yen continued to climb. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 1.1%. The Shanghai composite dipped 0.3%.In European trading intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE edged lower while Germany's Dax slid 0.4% and France's Cac-40 0.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Hours earlier, the odds of a big Trump tax cut were cut after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell set a high hurdle for tax reform.Let's take a look at four stocks that closed in buy range on Tuesday. Investors should be cautious with futures pointing to a lower open. Some of these stocks are only slightly above buy points, and could easily undercut those levels.Qorvo popped 4.6% to 74.84 in Tuesday stock market trading, clearing a shallow consolidation just above a prior consolidation. That followed the Apple iPhone chipmaker's 5.5% gain on Monday. This base-on-base action is bullish, especially when the overall market is moving sideways.Qorvo pulled back below its 50-day moving average in late April, then continued to slide modestly following earnings reports from Apple and then Qorvo itself. But the stock has risen for the last six sessions, capped by Monday's 5.5% surge and Tuesday's breakout.Apple shares closed fractionally lower for a second straight session after hitting a new all-time high intraday Monday.RELATED:Why This Recurring Pattern In The Stock Market Is A Bullish SignCitigroup cleared an aggressive buy point of 60.89 on Friday.

But it's also near a conventional 62.63 flat-base buy point, 10 cents above the 22-month intraday peak set March 8.Citigroup is among a handful of financials in or approaching buy points, while many others are in consolidation around or below their 50-day lines. Lower expectations for tax cuts and Treasury yields off their postelection peaks have cooled enthusiasm for bank stocks. But financial regulatory relief is still expected. That would boost bank profit and lending, analysts say, fueling dividend hikes and new buybacks.Baidu was part of the big China internet stock rally Tuesday, fueled by strong earnings and skyrocketing shares of Weibo (WB) and parent Sina (SINA).Baidu rallied 2.4% to 190.64, clearing a 118.70 buy point from a cup-with-handle pattern (starting in late February), as part of a larger consolidation (stretching back to late April 2016).Baidu is part of the China's ""BAT"" internet trio that also includes e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) and messaging giant Tencent (TCEHY). But while Baidu's growth and stock has stalled, Alibaba and Tencent (which have virtually identical market caps), have soared. Tencent reported 55% revenue growth Wednesday morning with Alibaba on tap Thursday.RELATED:Internet Giant To Join China Parade; Cisco Near Entry: Investing Action PlanStarbucks cleared a buy point of 59.64 on April 20, and moved up to 61.94 a week later.

Starbucks moved higher over the next couple of weeks but has pulled back again in light volume, slipping 0.8% to 59.98.Starbucks' action shows the importance of buying a stock as close to the entry point as possible.

448,TAP,"Apple (AAPL) stock ventured into record high territory on Wednesday after the company late Tuesday beat Wall Street's sales and earnings targets in the June quarter and guided higher for the September quarter.XThe Cupertino, Calif.-based company's sales guidance eased worries that Apple might miss its typical mid- to late September new iPhone launch window. For months, analysts have been speculating that the iPhone 8 could be weeks late and in extremely short supply initially.Apple shares rose 4.7% to 157.14 on the stock market today. The stock hit an all-time high of 159.75 in intraday trading Wednesday. Its previous record high was 156.65, reached on May 19. Apple stock had formed a flat base with a buy point of 156.75 over the past 12 weeks.During a conference call with analysts, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook gave tantalizing clues about what's coming from Apple in the fields of augmented reality and automation.Apple earned $1.67 a share, up 18% year over year, on sales of $45.4 billion, up 7%, in the quarter ended July 1. Analysts expected $1.57 and $44.89 billion for the company's fiscal third quarter.For Apple's fiscal fourth quarter ending in September, the company expects sales to rise nearly 8% year over year to $50.5 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Apple did not give an earnings-per-share target. Wall Street was modeling for Apple to earn $1.81 a share on sales of $49.21 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 74, meaning it has outperformed 74% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Apple's iPhone sales accounted for 54.7% of total revenue in the third quarter, making it by far the company's largest business. IPhone sales totaled 41 million, in line with expectations and easing fears the devices might not have met that number due to lower demand ahead of the iPhone 8 launch.Services were Apple's second largest business in the third quarter, generating $7.3 billion in sales, or 16% of total revenue. Services include iTunes, App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud and other offerings.Apple's Mac computer business was its third largest at 12.3% of revenue, followed by iPad tablets at 10.9%. The rest of sales came from ""other products,"" such as the Apple Watch, AirPods, Beats headphones and other devices.Apple ended the June quarter with $261.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, with 94% of the total located outside the U.S.Cook gushed about the potential for augmented reality and Apple's effort to spur the market with its AR Kit for software developers. Apple introduced AR Kit at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June.""I could not be more excited about AR and what we're seeing with AR Kit in the early going,"" Cook said. He sees uses for augmented reality spanning consumer, small business and enterprise apps.""I think AR is big and profound, and this is one of those huge things that we'll look back at and marvel on the start of it,"" Cook said. ""With hundreds of millions of people actively using iPhone and iPad today, iOS will become the world's biggest augmented reality platform as soon as iOS 11 ships"" this fall.Augmented reality overlays digital information on to a user's field of view using either mobile device displays or special glasses.""We think AR Kit will help the most creative minds in the industry tap into the latest computer vision technologies to build engaging content,"" Cook said. ""AR has broad mainstream applicability across education, entertainment, interactive gaming, enterprise, and categories we probably even haven't thought of.""Cook might have been hinting about possible AR products like smartglasses, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang said in a report Wednesday.""Tim's comments on AR suggest Apple might work on some AR device in addition to (the) 3D sensing module for the iPhone 8,"" Zhang said. ""We think the 3D sensing opportunity might be bigger than we have been expecting in 2018.""Cook also suggested that Apple's interest in artificial intelligence technology goes beyond self-driving cars.""In terms of autonomous systems, what we've said is that we are very focused on autonomous systems from a core technology point of view,"" Cook said. ""We do have a large project going and are making a big investment in this. From our point of view, autonomy is the mother of all AI projects. And autonomous systems can be used in a variety of ways, and a vehicle is only one. But there are many different areas of it, and I don't want to go any further with that.""Cook dodged a question about President Trump's claim that Apple planned to build three large factories in the U.S. Instead Cook focused on Apple's efforts to create jobs in the U.S. through support for app developers, U.S. manufacturers, and its own employee base.In a July 25 interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said Cook told him that Apple planned to open ""three big, beautiful plants"" in the U.S.

451,TAP,"If Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen shops at Amazon.com (AMZN) like most Americans, she might pick up insights from the e-commerce behemoth to help her set future interest rates.In fact, Yellen & Co. might want to include Amazon in the mix when discussing oil, housing, health care and other inflationary costs that can signal whether to tap the brakes or let the economy keep rolling.""Amazon is killing lots of businesses. In the process, it may also be killing inflation,"" Ed Yardeni, noted economist and president of Yardeni Research, said in a recent report.Using Chief Executive Jeff Bezos' playbook, Amazon has pummeled rivals with price cuts enabled by its smart logistics and relentless drive toward efficiency. Labor-displacing warehouse robotics give Amazon a cost advantage, and it aims to one day deploy delivery drones to extend its edge all the way to the customer's doorstep.Amazon's casualty list already is formidable. Over the years, Amazon has left consumer-facing retailers such as Borders, Circuit City and Sports Authority in the dust. Department chains have been closing stores, unable to answer the e-commerce challenge.Now Amazon is taking on gargantuan retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Costco Wholesale (COST). These big-box retailers are trying to fight back, and their main tool is cutting prices.And Amazon is impacting more parts of the U.S. economy as it expands from books, toys and electronics into apparel, groceries and entertainment. Cowen & Co. calls the ""$1.3 trillion U.S. grocery market Amazon's biggest potential source of revenue upside.""While Amazon's effect on the retail sector has grabbed headlines, there's also Amazon Business to consider. The online sales channel for business customers is sending prices down for industrial products, pressuring companies like W.W. Grainger (GWW).There's also Amazon Web Services, the fast-growing cloud computing business. A Citigroup report in April called the impact of AWS and cloud services ""deflationary"" on the information technology industry.For now, Fed officials say a tightening labor market has put upward pressure on wage costs. The Fed has hiked interest rates once this year, and is expected to do it twice more. The unemployment rate fell to 4.4% in April, below the structural rate and matching the lows of 2006-07.Yet some economists contend that Amazon's use of automation as it pushes into new markets looms as a long-term factor in restraining job and wage growth. Amazon's scale is unmatched. It's most conspicuous in the retail space.""Traditional retailers will struggle to compete with a business that generated an estimated $225 billion in global gross merchandise value in 2016, growing 29% year-over-year and has the discipline to operate at a 1% margin,"" said a recent Morgan Stanley report.The CEO of entertainment provider Liberty Media (LMCA), Greg Maffei, called Amazon a ""ridiculously scary"" rival at a financial conference May 9.Amazon ""has an ability, because of its scale, to invest at incredibly low or negative rates of return — because they can cross-subsidize, and the market is willing to suspend disbelief in future profitability,"" Maffei said.Economist Yardeni, meanwhile, compares Amazon's scale to that of China.""Amazon arguably has done as much as the Chinese to kill jobs and keep a lid on inflation by enabling fast and easy price discovery for anyone with a cellphone,"" he said.Amazon has quickly gained traction in apparel and is now the second-biggest retailer behind Wal-Mart. Now it's taking Wal-Mart head-on.A longtime price discounter itself, thanks to Chinese manufacturing partners, Wal-Mart has seen profits shrink amid Amazon's online onslaught.Wal-Mart in April began offering price discounts for 10,000 items that consumers buy online and then pick up in stores. By June, Wal-Mart plans to expand web discounting to 1 million items.Since it purchased e-commerce startup Jet.com last year, Wal-Mart has ratcheted up its battle with Amazon. Wal-Mart in January rolled out free, two-day shipping for orders over $35. Amazon last week cut its minimum order to $25.Another big-box retailer, Costco, is dealing with Amazon's push into new food categories. While Costco has a strong membership program, its best counterpunch is pricing, says a Piper Jaffray report.""Costco is cheaper than Amazon in consumables,"" the report said.Making competition intensify is the fact that consumers doing comparison shopping can do so on mobile phones as well as on home PCs.""Certainly online vs. in-store shopping has been a trend for over a decade. What seems new is the comparison shopping that is pervasive,"" said Don Rissmiller, economist at Strategas Research Partners.""This could be related to Amazon, but it's also that we have mobile devices with fast, readily available networks, and the apps to check the price of various items,"" Rissmiller said. ""What we do know is the retail deflator turned negative in recent years and the Fed should absolutely pay attention.""Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, says it's clear that Amazon's success is weighing on prices for many retail goods. ""But the impact on overall inflation is small,"" Zandi told IBD.""The retail goods that Amazon provides account for only about 15% of the consumer basket,"" Zandi said. ""So, if Amazon is responsible for reducing retail goods inflation by 1 percentage point per annum — an aggressive assumption — then this will reduce overall inflation by 0.15%. Not inconsequential, but not a game changer.""Meanwhile, Amazon's stock price continues to soar, having spent 20 years on the market as of Monday. Shares have grown roughly 64,000% from its split-adjusted IPO of $1.50 and doubled from an already formidable price of 474 a share, reached in February 2016. Shares ended trading Monday at 957.97, off a fraction.Analysts continue to see Amazon going well past the 1,000 level. On Monday, Oppenheimer was the latest, raising its price to 1,100 from 970, and calling Amazon a ""must own"" stock.In another part of the economy, information technology, Amazon also is a disrupter. Amazon's cloud-computing business is by far the biggest provider of computing resources via the internet, followed by Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and others.As corporate America outsources more computing work to AWS and other highly automated cloud services, companies buy less hardware and software for internal data centers and cut back on IT staffing.In the March quarter, IBM's (IBM) hardware business fell nearly 17% to $2.5 billion year-over-year, reflecting the impact of cloud adoption. How do the likes of IBM, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) fight back? By cutting prices.""Cloud is deflationary and collapses markets,"" said a Citigroup report in April.""Labor, with 85% deflation in the cloud, has the most significant disruption from cloud economics,"" says the Citi report. It says 15 IT staffers in a public, shared cloud service can replace 100 in a private data center.AWS will rake in some $37.5 billion in revenue by 2020, up from $17 billion this year, estimates Citigroup.Since 2006, AWS has been steadily cutting prices for cloud services, with Google and Microsoft following suit. Customers pay cloud service providers as little as pennies an hour per server or as much as $1-$2 an hour, depending on the type of workload. Even with low prices, AWS operating income doubled in 2016 to $3.1 billion, owing to massive scale.""Perhaps most importantly, AWS' juicy operating profit margin of more than 25% gives Amazon a way to fund its new ventures and a retail business that has notoriously skinny margins,"" said Yardeni. ""The cash and financial flexibility AWS provides ensure that Amazon will be a lethal competitor in the retailing industry for many years to come.""Long-range, Amazon's influence on job growth and the economy could grow if rivals duplicate its strategies to stay competitive.In fact, Amazon is pushing in the direction of its competitors, driving its automation beyond warehouses and into the retail space. Amazon hopes to eliminate store cashiers at Amazon Go convenience stores now being tested. Amazon Go stores use sensors to track items as shoppers put them into baskets. The shopper's Amazon account gets automatically charged.Amazon recently was granted a patent for automated, ""on-demand apparel manufacturing."" The patent highlights plans to go beyond clothing into other fabric-based products, such as footwear, bedding and home goods.Amazon is also bringing more of its logistics and delivery operations in-house.""We're in the early stages of drones disrupting the trucking industry and transportation costs,"" David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, told IBD. ""We're reaching an inflection point with robotics and automation, artificial intelligence and the shared economy. Most of these are massive supply-side deflationary developments.""Rosenberg says Amazon is part of a new industrial revolution that could push wages down.""Amazon and e-commerce are part and parcel of the fourth industrial revolution,"" he said.

459,TAP,"X Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 indicated tiny increases early Tuesday. That followed whisper-thin gains Monday as megacap Apple (AAPL) continued to ascend. Meanwhile, two companies with best-possible 99 Composite Ratings are on tap with earnings: graphics and AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), laser maker Coherent (COHR). Online travel giant Priceline (PCLN), with a 98 CR, also reports Tuesday.Apple rose 2.7% to 153.01 in Monday stock market trading, hitting yet another record high and becoming the first company to top an $800 billion market cap intraday. Apple has surged 32% in 2017, the best performer by far in the Dow Jones industrial average, as investors bet the upcoming iPhone 8 will be a huge success. Apple has added 255.7 points to the Dow this year, accounting for 20% of the Dow's total rise.Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures pointed to fractional gains vs. fair value. Apple was indicated about 0.4% higher.Apple, also the biggest component of the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite, pushed those two averages to record highs Monday. The Nasdaq and, to a lesser, extent, the S&P 500 are getting a boost from the FANG internet stocks of Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). That makes the current rally heavily reliant on a handful of big-cap techs.

Take a free Leaderboard trial today.Coherent and Nvidia have 99 Composite Ratings, which mean that they outperform 99% of all stocks based on a combination of fundamental and technical factors. While you should never buy a stock on ratings alone — these two 99 CR plays aren't close to buy zones — winning stocks in history often have a 95+ CR near the start of their runs.Analysts expect Coherent to report EPS of $2.55, up 155% vs. a year earlier, according to Zacks Investment Research. Keep in mind that Coherent's Q4 earnings crushed views by 44%, so investors may be expecting a big beat above official estimates.Coherent revenue should double to $404 million. The 104% estimated gain would be the fifth straight quarter of improving year-over-year changes.Among other applications, Coherent's lasers are used in the making of organic light-emitting diode screens, increasingly popular with TVs and smartphones. The Samsung Galaxy 8 has an OLED screen with the upcoming Apple iPhone 8 expect to use it as well. Coherent rose 4.6% to a record high Friday as Universal Display (OLED), with OLED ticker, skyrocketed on its blowout Q1 earnings and strong guidance.Coherent retreated 3.4% to 217.58 on Monday, but the stock is well extended from any proper buy point for now.Analysts expect EPS to increase 43.5% to 66 cents, as revenue grows 46% to $1.91 billion.Nvidia has expanded from graphics chips for PC gaming to widespread use in artificial intelligence and autonomous driving applications.Nvidia has been consolidating for three months, recently trading just above its 50-day moving average, closing Monday down 1% at 102.77. Nvidia has a potential 121.02 buy point.Wall Street forecasts EPS to drop 16.5% to $8.80 while revenue rises 13.3% to $2.15 billion.Priceline hit an intraday high on Monday, closing up 26 cents to 1903.91.

Beauty (ELF), Ichor Holdings (ICHR) and Presidio (PSDO) also are on tap.Snap is an innovative, fast-growing social media company, but it's unprofitable and is facing a withering counteroffensive from much-larger Facebook (FB).Snap actually has the lowest Composite Rating of the six IPOs reporting earnings. The Composite Rating, which goes from 1 to a best-possible 99, combines several proprietary IBD ratings, including the EPS Rating, into one measure.

Revenue should soar to $150 million vs. $38.8 million a year earlier.Snapchat is doing a better job of monetizing its users, but analysts and investors will want to know about the service's user growth and engagement. Heading into its IPO, Snap had noted slowing user growth. Since then Facebook has only accelerated its success at imitating popular Snap features. Facebook's Instagram now has 700 million users, with more than 200 million users for its Instagram Stories. Facebook, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger also are adopting Snapchat-like features. Snapchat said in its IPO prospectus that it has 158 million users, dominated by teens and young adults in North America.RELATED:Snap's Earnings Will Shed Light On Facebook Impact, User GrowthIf You Think Netflix, Amazon Disrupted Hollywood, You'll Love Snap, FacebookIBD'S TAKE: For data tables and analytical stories of top-rated new issues, check out IPO Leaders in IBD's Stock Lists.Acacia Communications has a Composite Rating of 63.

463,TAP,"President Trump's hint this month of a breakup of big Wall Street banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) hit their stocks hard — for maybe 30 minutes. Then the stocks recovered and finished higher for the day.Little wonder. Financial deregulation looks like it's one of the few Trumponomics planks that investors can count on. Despite all the headlines, chaining off commercial banks from investment banking is probably a nonstarter now in Congress. But Trump has the will — and the political wherewithal — to bust up heavy regulations clamped on banks after the financial crisis.Capital requirements, stress-test thresholds, fee limits and trading curbs are some of the weights that Trump likely will lighten. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also likely will lose much of its budget and authority. These changes could boost bank profits, shareholder returns and M&A activity, as well as boost lending to businesses and consumers that accelerates economic growth.Hope for such deregulation is the reason shares of JPMorgan, BofA, Wells Fargo and other banks large and small shot higher after Donald Trump's election.The stakes are huge: The excess capital that banks hold to comply with stress tests is estimated at well over $100 billion. They could return much of that money to shareholders via buybacks and dividends with the right reforms, such as reducing how many banks face Federal Reserve stress tests. If capital requirements are cut, excess capital could rise as high as $218 billion, Goldman Sachs analysts say.Regional banks also seek regulatory relief. Current rules imposed in the last eight years may discourage them from expanding beyond $10 billion in assets, where they'd face an additional regulator in the CFPB, more compliance and training requirements, and stress tests. Even small community banks face significant burdens, and they appear to have Trump's ear. Complaints include new mortgage-disclosure rules, caps on fees and heightened loan standards.Many local banks say they face unnecessary limits on whom they lend to and the products they offer. Their concerns are reflected in the declining number of banks. Only a few banks have been created since the financial crisis, suggesting that compliance costs and other red tape are too high and stifling new competition.""If I were the CEO of a small or community bank, an asset manager or an insurance company, I would be ecstatic"" over prospects for deregulation, said Douglas Elliott, a partner in Oliver Wyman's financial services consulting practice. ""There's virtually no downside.""For the largest banks, the regulatory outlook is ""more mixed,"" amid some high-level GOP support for Glass-Steagall and raising capital standards, but ""still overall a positive,"" Elliott said.Aligning oneself with big banks is still politically risky. The Republican Party platform molded by the populist Trump campaign endorsed reviving Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that split commercial and investment banking until its repeal in the late 1990s.But Trump's support for the idea was never strong or clear.In a Bloomberg News interview on May 1, Trump was asked if he wanted to break up the big banks. He made no commitment. Some people ""want to go back to the old system, right?"" he said. ""So we're going to look at that.""Those are hardly fighting words. And the reality is that even a tough fight would have a slim chance of winning in Congress, says KBW Washington analyst Brian Gardner. He figures Republicans opposed to Glass-Steagall would demand big concessions, such as killing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Democrats would reject that.By contrast, Trump clearly is serious about rolling back some Dodd-Frank provisions. The law is ""going to be very, very seriously changed so the banks can go back to loaning money,"" he told Bloomberg. Speaking to community bankers that same day, he blasted the law as being ""out of control,"" and ""not only for community banks — for banks, period.""Trump's diagnosis sounds a lot like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon's. In an April letter to shareholders, Dimon argued that big U.S. banks should be freed from post-crisis capital requirements that exceed Basel international rules. That would unlock $15 billion of equity capital at JPMorgan and support nearly $190 billion of loans, he wrote.Eliminating the capital surcharge for the eight biggest U.S. banks could boost earnings by 4.6%, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods have estimated.Part of the bank rally after Trump's surprise election was relief that more onerous regulations wouldn't come into being. Not only has the Federal Reserve's regulatory regime been fairly strict for the eight globally systemically important banks, constraining their dividends and buybacks, but it was set to get even tougher if Hillary Clinton had become president, notes Elliott.On tap was ""a significant increase in capital requirements"" for megabanks under a policy outlined in September by Daniel Tarullo, who headed the Fed's committee on bank supervision and regulation. Tarullo turned in his resignation in February in the wake of Trump's victory.""People are policy,"" said RBC Capital banking analyst Gerard Cassidy, and Trump's election is bringing ""an incredible amount of turnover.""Trump's people, Cassidy told IBD, are likely to be ""pro-bank people, pro-business people, which would inevitably lead to more sound, common-sensical"" regulations. ""We do expect to see more returns of excess capital this year and next year, even if the legislation is not changed,"" he said.A House panel on Thursday voted on party lines for legislation that would roll back much of Dodd-Frank. The legislation could clear the full House, but the Senate would be a much higher hurdle.Policy analysts see two legislative ideas with enough support to get to Trump's desk. Elliott expects Republicans to ax the CFPB's budget. Supporters say the CFPB is a long-needed watchdog, citing September's $100 million fine on Wells Fargo for employees illegally opening 2 million deposit and credit-card accounts for unknowing customers. But its crackdown on payday lending has reduced access to small, short-term loans, while its 1,659-page rules on prepaid debit cards could choke off a popular product.As the CFPB shrinks and loses authority in the Trump era, ""restrictions on banking fees will slacken for all banks, which should help boost earnings,"" Oppenheimer Funds portfolio manager Benjamin Ram and research analyst Christopher Mashia wrote in a March analysis.Meanwhile, solid bipartisan support exists for raising the asset threshold by which banks become subject to the Fed's annual stress test, Elliott says. The level could rise from $50 billion to ""between $150 billion and $500 billion,"" he says.In his outgoing speech April 4, Tarullo agreed that the $50 billion threshold was ""set too low,"" adding that Dodd-Frank's risk-based capital requirements are ""unduly complicated"" for small banks.While Tarullo is gone, his endorsement could help pave the way for freeing community banks from Dodd-Frank's additional safety and soundness provisions for ensuring that their risk controls and financial conditions are adequate. There also is broad support for raising the $10 billion asset floor that triggers additional compliance and oversight, including a requirement for banks to conduct their own stress tests.Many superregional banks would be happy to do their own stress tests. In the Fed's stress tests, the agency provides little transparency about how it determines whether capital is sufficient, spurring banks to be ultraconservative in setting dividends to avoid surprises. No bank wants to be in the position of Zions Bancorp (ZION), when it was the only one to fail the Fed's stress test in 2014.Raising the Fed stress-test asset threshold likely would spark consolidation, creating cost-saving opportunities without triggering a special regulatory headache.If Congress raised the Fed stress-test threshold to $250 billion, 21 more financial institutions would be exempt. They include KeyCorp (KEY), American Express (AXP), BB&T (BBT) and SunTrust Banks (STI). Some 13 banks would still face strict scrutiny, with a few superregionals such PNC Financial (PNC) and US Bancorp (USB) still grouped with the globally systemically important banking giants.Prospects for regulatory relief and higher net-interest margins helped vault superregional and regional banks to the top of IBD's 197 industry-group rankings after the election. They held five of the top 10 positions in mid-February. The money-center bank group, including seven of the eight ""systemically important"" U.S. banks, got as high as No. 15. Since then, most bank stocks have fallen below their 50-day moving averages as interest rates have fallen and doubts have grown about Trumponomics, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending.The big question facing Trump's financial regulators will be whether the pendulum has swung too far toward safety and soundness at the expense of access to credit and economic growth.Under the Fed's stress test, which assumes a severe recession comparable to the crisis that began in 2007, systemically important banks are seen losing a combined $195 billion. But that's less than 10% of their capital of $2.2 trillion.""It's clear that banks can use more of their capital to finance the economy without sacrificing safety and soundness,"" Dimon wrote. ""Had they been less afraid of potential CCAR stress losses (the Fed's capital review process), banks probably would have been more aggressive in making some small business loans, lower rated middle market loans and near-prime mortgages.""Dimon says JPMorgan has turned away $200 billion in deposits from large clients because of new rules requiring that ""capital in many cases must be held on these short-term, virtually riskless activities.""While the biggest banks may not get regulatory relief as quickly as smaller banks, KBW estimates that the giants' earnings could rise 13.5% if ultrasafe assets such as Treasuries and deposits at the Fed are excluded from the leverage ratio, or capital as a percentage of assets.Tarullo's final speech also targeted Dodd-Frank's much-criticized Volcker Rule aimed at barring banks from trading for their own accounts, while still allowing them to act as market makers. He called the rule ""too complicated."" He said it was affecting market making, ""particularly for some less liquid issues.""An outright legislative Volcker Rule repeal could lift big-bank earnings by 4.2%, Goldman has estimated. The chances of that appear negligible, though Trump regulators likely will try to ease compliance.RELATED:Markets Are 'Too Negative' On Trump Tax-Cut Odds: GoldmanBreakout Watch: Top Financial Stock Jumps Back Into Buy ZoneMorgan Stanley Beats Estimates As Fixed-Income Revenue DoublesGoldman Sacked: Wall Street Giant Blames Politics For Trading Woes

464,TAP,"X The major indexes retreated to session lows in early afternoon action as energy stocks tumbled with oil prices. Meanwhile, investors digested some key quarterly results from tech giants over the past few days, with the key monthly payrolls report on tap Friday.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 slid 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average, up more than 2.4% over the prior two weeks, gave up 0.4%. Dow components Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 1.3% and Chevron (CVX) 2.1% as U.S. crude futures fell 4% to $45.90 a barrel, their lowest readings since last November.The Russell 2000 sank 0.5% lower. Meanwhile, on the other side of the pond, major European bourses enjoyed solid advances; the CAC 40 jumped more than 1.3% while the Dax 100 of Germany added nearly 1%.Among other indexes, the Dow utility average edged up 0.1% after underperforming the major averages on Wednesday, losing almost 0.6%.From the birdseye view of IBD's 197 industry groups and subgroups, oil drilling led the downside with a 4.3% loss, followed by Canadian oil exploration (-4.1%), U.S. oil exploration (-4%), international oil exploration (-3.6%) and oil machinery (-3.6%).Oil and gas transport firms were not spared either, with the group getting trounced 3.4%. Oneok (OKE), a star performer in the Income Investor screen in 2016, took out its 200-day moving average in heavy volume as shares dove 5% to 49.53.The Tulsa, Okla.-based pipeline giant showed uncharacteristically wild action since a bad reversal on Feb. 1, causing the stock to spend more time below its 50-day moving average -- a key defensive sell signal. Oneok has also round-tripped its gains from a late-November breakout past a 51.82 buy point in a giant bottoming base. (Please see a long-term weekly chart at Marketsmith to fully view the deep first-stage cup with handle.) Apple (AAPL), one of the Dow Jones industrials' 30 components, continued to show a mild yet manageable decline after Wednesday's nice bounce off its intraday lows. The stock eased 0.8% to 145.90 in volume that is running above normal pace.Because the iPhone giant has now achieved a 25% gain from a Jan. 6-9 breakout from a cup-with-handle base at 118.12, an investor would be fully justified in taking the profit.However, with strong anticipation for the next iPhone series, a rising dividend, and CEO Tim Cook's intention to double service-related revenue within a few more years, an investor also has good reasons to build conviction and watch if the stock has more room to grow. But a report says iPhone sales are weakening in China.No defensive sell signals have been triggered recently.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Apple gets a solid 91 Composite Rating, a far cry from the low 60s to 70s several months back. The Composite Rating melds together IBD's most important measures of profit and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity, stock price strength, industry group strength, and other factors.The RS Rating has also vastly improved to a 90, meaning on a 12-month basis, Apple now beats 90% of all public companies in IBD's database.Snap (SNAP), meanwhile, continues to do constructive work on the right side of its base. The Snapchat operator rose 3.8% to 22.64, good for a five-week high.Watch to see if the new social media play on Wall Street can show more strength and possibly take out the 24.40 near-term high. However, that is not a proper buy point for now. Snap also has not formed a proper double bottom; the 19.73 low seen last month did not undercut the 18.90 low set on March 17.Snap's Relative Price Strength rating is irrelevant, since it lacks 12 months' worth of stock action. However, the up/down volume ratio is positive at 1.4, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup (go to the supply and demand section of this valuable timesaving tool). Keep in mind that the up/down volume ratio works best when there are at least 50 days' worth of daily price and volume action.Snap, which reports Q1 results after the close on May 10, is still 22% below its 29.44 peak.Some banks also worthy of watching include Comerica (CMA) and East West Bancorp (EWBC). But Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) continues to struggle as the stock, down 1 cent to 48.58, is still feeling selling heat near the 50-day moving average.Notice how the 50-day line, painted in red on an IBD or MarketSmith chart, has been sloping lower for at least four weeks.RELATED:More In Stock Market Today: Will These 10 Top Growth Stocks Keep Winning Big In 2017?The Big Picture: Are U.S. Equities Still Superior To Bonds Now?IBD Stock Spotlight: Why Is This Swiss Chipmaker Crushing It?The Case For A New Bull Run In GoldStrong Earnings, Hot Movers: 5 Growth Stocks To Consider

468,TAP,"Earnings for the second quarter kick off in earnest next week with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) on the docket. Early indications point to another strong season.XS&P 500 companies are expected to report 8% earnings growth on a 4.6% gain in revenues, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S as of July 6. That's a big reversal from a 2.1% profit decline in Q2 2016 as the energy-led earnings slump extended to a fifth consecutive quarter. And it solidifies the comeback that has seen S&P 500 profit growth of 4.3%, 8% and 15.3% in the last three quarters.Apple (AAPL), which has returned to growth in the prior two quarters, should continue to show EPS and revenue gains when it reports on Aug. 1. That's despite many consumers awaiting the Apple iPhone 8 later this year. Due to its massive size, Apple has an outsized impact on overall S&P 500 earnings and especially the S&P 500 technology sector. Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) should see fat profit gains.That 8% overall earnings target for the second quarter is down 2 percentage points from the start of April, but that's half the usual four-point cut typically seen.That is fueling optimism on Wall Street that Q1's momentum — which saw earnings growth hit its highest level since 2011 — will continue into future quarters.""There is a lot more confidence in what is expected for Q3 than at this time last year,"" Sheraz Mian, research director at Zacks Investment Research, told IBD.One downside to the modest revisions: The markets may already be pricing in strong results. Investors have been taking profits in leading tech stocks over the past month.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock heading into earnings offers the opportunity for big gains or big losses. You may want to adopt this earnings options strategy to capture any upside while limiting your losses.Beyond Q2, S&P 500 companies should grow earnings 8.6% and 13.1% in Q3 and Q4, according to Thomson Reuters. They are estimated to grow earnings 11.3% in 2017 as a whole and 11.7% in 2018 vs. 1.4% in 2016.Profits and revenues have been robust from the roughly 5% of S&P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results so far, including Nike (NKE), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Oracle (ORCL). Of those 23 companies, 78% have beaten EPS estimates and 87% have topped revenue forecasts.In a typical quarter, 64% of companies overall beat earnings estimates and 59% beat revenue views.The energy, technology and financials sectors are expected to drive earnings growth in Q2 — a period over which the S&P 500 advanced 2.6% and set a new all-time closing of 2,453 on June 19.Oil and gas companies earnings should reverse higher after an outright loss a year earlier. But oil prices are down significantly from the start of 2017, which has hurt shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM) and other energy stocks.Financials and technology, the two largest S&P 500 sectors, are expected to moderate earnings growth from the near-20% Q1 pace. But growth should still be solid, with financials up 7.6% and technology 11.2%, according to Thomson Reuters.Banks continue to see a deceleration in loan growth and unfavorable moves in bond yields, Mian said.Several Wall Street giants have warned of weak trading revenue in Q2, continuing the lackluster trend in 2017. That's a key reason why JPMorgan and Citigroup are expected to show little-to-no profit growth, while regional banks such Comerica (CMA) should see big EPS gains.Still, bank stocks large and small have been leading in recent weeks, helped by higher bond yields and massive buyback and dividend plans. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup have moved past buy points to long-time highs, while Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC) and others are in buy zones.Technology is the only sector outside of energy that is expected to best the overall 8% S&P 500 gain. The sector also has gotten a boost from Adobe, Oracle and Micron Technology (MU), which smashed quarterly expectations in late June, Mian said. Expect strong growth for Alphabet and Facebook, he added.Health care, which has seen shares of health insurers and many biotechs soar in 2017, is estimated to grow earnings a tepid 2.3%. Other laggards are likely to include materials (4.3%), consumer staples (3.6%), industrials (2.4%), real estate (1.9%), telecom (1.1%) and consumer discretionary (0.9%).The utilities sector should post a 2.8% earnings decline. Of the 11 S&P 500 sectors, only industrials has seen an upward estimate revision for Q2 since the start of April.Zacks, which tracks sectors differently, expects aerospace, construction and industrial products to shine, with earnings growth of 49%, 15.6% and 11.9% respectively.Multinationals such as Apple, Boeing (BA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet and Facebook, are expected to see less drag from a strong dollar on their earnings.""The dollar was only 4% higher year over year in the second quarter on average, so we don't expect a major impact to earnings because of that,"" said Lindsey Bell, a CFRA investment strategist. The greenback's continued weakness since then should provide a tailwind to multinationals' Q3 earnings.Mian also expects multinationals to benefit from a notably improved overseas growth outlook.""A dividing line in the last earnings season was that more internationally oriented companies had a more positive view of business than those that are domestically oriented,"" he said. ""I expect that trend to continue.""Q2 earnings growth should top current analyst estimates, in keeping with historical trends. But matching Q1's blowout performance will be a tough order, Mian said.The first quarter saw double the growth pace that was expected at the start of the reporting cycle — and that is unlikely to be surpassed for the next few quarters, in Mian's view.RELATED:Q2 Earnings Preview: Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Growth

469,TAP,"X The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 narrowed their early losses into Wednesday's close, after a no-surprise Fed announcement and an after-hours session featuring earnings reports from Facebook (FB) and Tesla (TSLA).Tesla shares rose slightly as the automaker reported a widening loss for Q1, but its sales of $2.7 billion topped estimates. Facebook fell modestly after its earnings missed expectations, but sales beat views.The Dow ended with the slimmest of gains, while the S&P 500 closed down 0.1%. The Nasdaq eased from its early crouch, ending down 0.4%.  Small caps outpaced on the downside, with the Russell 2000 taking a 0.6% loss.The Federal Reserve wrapped up a session of positive data reports, announcing at midafternoon no change to its target interest rate.  Earlier, April hiring data and two service-sector indexes came in better than expected by economists.But Apple (AAPL) put an early hurt on the Nasdaq, trading lower after delivering mixed second-quarter results late Tuesday.

Delphi Automotive (DLPH) topped the index, surging 10% and breaking out above an 83.33 flat-base buy point after reporting a stronger-than-expected first quarter performance and announcing plans to spin off its drivetrain business as a separate company.Straight Path (STRP) spiked 23%, lifting its gain to nearly 330% since March 31, as an unnamed ""multinational telecommunications company,"" reported to be Verizon (VZ), had topped a previous offer from AT&T (T).Economic news on Thursday includes the monthly job-cuts report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, weekly unemployment data and first-quarter productivity estimates from the Labor Department, ahead of its April payrolls report on Friday.Companies scheduled to report early Thursday include Kellog (K), AmBev (ABEV), Anheuser Busch (BUD), Siemens (SIEGY) and Ferrari (RACE), among many others.RELATED: Facebook, Tesla, Square Earnings On Tap: What To ExpectDow, Apple Cut Losses: Should You Sell These 4 Big Stock Winners?

470,TAP,"U.S. stocks were lower Tuesday morning as earnings reports kicked into full swing. The Dow Jones industrial average fell the most as Goldman Sachs (GS) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) weighed.The Dow shed 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite were down 0.2% each. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 0.5%. Volume was higher across the board vs. the same time Monday.Medical, bank and oil issues led the downside in today's stock market action. Airline, food and retail stocks were among the few gainers.Dow stocks were active as four components reported earnings. IBM (IBM) is slated to report after the close.Goldman Sachs gapped down and fell 3% in heavy volume to a four-month low after the big bank's Q1 results missed views on both the top and bottom lines.

The stock has also been consolidating below the 10-week moving average.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) dropped 3%, gapping below its 50-day line in high turnover and back below the buy point of its last base.

471,TAP,"XVideo streaming company Netflix (NFLX) could break the 100 million subscriber mark when it reports first-quarter earnings after the market close Monday.The consensus is for Netflix to show revenue of $2.64 billion, up 35% from the year-ago quarter, and adjusted earnings of 37 cents a share, vs. 6 cents in the same quarter a year ago.A Goldman Sachs report by analyst Heath Terry said Netflix could break the 100 million mark if it tops expectations for subscriber growth. Netflix ended the fourth quarter with 94 million subscribers. Terry forecasts that Netflix will report 4 million international subscriber additions in the first quarter and 1.7 million U.S. additions. In the fourth quarter Netflix added just over 7 million new streaming video customers after guiding to 5.2 million.Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves in a research note maintained an overweight rating on Netflix and price target of 170.""We believe Netflix has built an ideal model for video distribution in the internet era and will continue to see opportunity for significant long-term appreciation,"" he wrote in a research note.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Alan Gould has a neutral rating on Netflix and price target of 150.Netflix stock fell 0.6% to 142.92 in the stock market today. Netflix closed below its 50-day moving average, for the first time since late September, after finding support at that key level previously.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix is trading near its record high of 148.29 set on March 30, as the market for streaming video content grows. Video content would be one attraction that Apple would have were it to merge with Disney.In his report on Netflix, Gould said his primary concern is competition, particularly Amazon.com (AMZN), which provides its video service for free to Prime members. The response by Netflix has been its aggressive expansion into exclusive video content and international markets, Gould wrote.Comcast (CMCSA) plans to introduce an online video service offering hit shows from its NBCUniversal TV networks in the next 12 to 18 months, as part of an effort to compete with Netflix, Amazon and others.RELATED:Hollywood Writers Strike Threat: Netflix, Facebook, Amazon Seen As Winners

472,TAP,"Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings Tuesday, sending shares of the Trump infrastructure play surging.Martin Marietta earned 67 cents per share on revenue of $791.7 million. Analysts expected the Raleigh, N.C., provider of construction materials to earn 66 cents a share, down from 69 cents a year ago. Revenue was seen slipping to $724.7 million from $734.0 million. Year-earlier results were lifted by weather delays in late 2015 that lumped more activity in the first quarter of 2016.Outlook: Martin Marietta maintained the same full-year guidance it offered in February: $3.75 billion to $3.95 billion in revenue and an EBITDA range of $1.05 billion to $1.13 billion.Stock: Shares of Martin Marietta shot up 7.6% to 239.85 on the stock market today, the highest since late January and approaching a 244.08 buy point. Vulcan Materials (VMC), which reports earnings on May 10, popped 4.1% to 128.45.IBD'S TAKE: Markets may no longer be banking on President Trump's trillion-dollar national building program, at least in the near term, but infrastructure investors are excited about big state spending plans.Prior to the report, shares of Martin Marietta have climbed back above their 50-day moving average. The shares initially vaulted into a buy zone on Nov. 9, after the surprise election of Donald Trump. A follow-on breakout attempt in late January, after the inauguration, failed. The stock drifted lower after disappointing first-quarter earnings and lack of progress on Trump's big infrastructure plans.On Monday, IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates group rose 2%, sixth best among 197 industry groups. President Trump's comments that he would support a gas tax to fund infrastructure investment likely contributed to the gain. Summit Materials (SUM) hit a nearly two-year high on Monday.Monday's gains came despite news that a five-month budget deal in Congress won't include any funding for Trump's border wall, once seen as a potential boon to cement makers with facilities near the border.Martin Marietta noted that it saw ""broad-based pricing improvements"" across its aggregates product line, led by the Southeast group's 10.3% increase. The company's revenue gain was padded by acquisitions that added $27 million, with modest margin contribution. Management noted that it ramped up investment in the quarter on operations and staffing, adding that the investment should result in better operating leverage as growth continues.RELATED: Stock Futures: These 10 Big-Cap Earnings Are On Tap TuesdayHere's Why U.S. Concrete Shares Sank Like A StoneMartin Marietta 'Encouraged' By Trump Infrastructure Talk, But Earnings, Guidance Light

473,TAP,"Despite a strong debut Friday from newly minted Redfin (RDFN), weak showings this year from Snap (SNAP) and Blue Apron (APRN) in the stock market since the two came public in recent months is putting a damper on what was expected to be a strong year for initial public offerings.Redfin's first day on the market Friday proved profitable, as the online real estate brokerage ended trading at 21.83, up nearly 82% from its IPO price of 12. Trouble is, companies like Snap also gave strong indications at first, with that company priced at 17 and making two double-digit gains to run past the 29 level before a steady decline of more than 50%.XSnapchat-owner Snap was one of the most anticipated IPOs since the Facebook (FB) blockbuster in June 2012. Like Facebook, which has quadrupled in price since its IPO, the hope was that the Snap IPO would bring other unicorns — companies with a pre-IPO valuation above $1 billion, like Blue Apron — galloping out of the gate. It didn't happen that way.Snap and Blue Apron are both down sharply since their IPO debut. Snap, which came public on March 2, is down 18% from its IPO price of 17 and down 53% from its record high. Blue Apron, which started trading June 29, is down 25% from its IPO price of 10 and down 32% from its record high of 11.""Those deals did not treat IPO investors very well, which creates more caution,"" said Kathleen Smith, principal of Renaissance Capital and manager of the Renaissance IPO-focused exchange traded fund. ""I don't see the market getting more enthusiastic.""In other words, don't expect to see closely watched tech unicorn companies such as Uber, Lyft or Airbnb find any impetus to make a public debut. For one, these companies have had steady access to funding. Plus, they've not yet expressed a desire to tap the public markets with an IPO. There's also no word yet on the expected IPO filings of Flipkart, WeWork, Peloton and Pinterest.But music-streaming service provider Spotify has been active, with rumors that it is talking to IPO underwriters, said Smith. And despite some high-profile stumbles into the public markets, the IPO market this year looks relatively healthy compared with 2016.There have been 83 IPOs on U.S. markets thus far this year, up 73% from the same period a year ago, with total proceeds up 159% to $21 billion, according to Renaissance. Still, IPOs are coming to market at a slower rate than in previous years.""The question is can we get above 2015 levels. That might be a stretch,"" said Smith. ""It's definitely far better than last year but slower than we expected.""By standard measurements the IPO market should be stronger, Smith said. IPOs this year are, on average, up 12% from their IPO price, with an average first day pop of 9%, both considered healthy numbers for the market overall, said Renaissance. The primary growth engine for new IPOs is a strong stock market, major components of which are near record highs.""The IPO returns and market condition are good, yet activity is fairly subdued,"" said Smith. ""It's not as bad as 2016, but we're not seeing the exuberance you might see when markets are at all-time highs and returns are good.""She speculates that the subdued IPO activity could be due partly to financial advisors directing their clients into exchange-traded funds and indices such as the S&P 500, as opposed to buying individual stocks.And while the IPOs continue to come, they're not without challenges. To get out the door, some companies are having to drop the asking price on IPOs in order to entice institutional investors.Blue Apron cut its IPO price to 10, from previous plans to offer shares in the range of $15 to $17. It raised $300 million but had wanted to raise $480 million. The lowered offering price came after Amazon.com (AMZN) announced its $13.7 billion deal to acquire Whole Foods Market (WFM), indicating that it would enter Blue Apron's market of providing meal kits for home delivery.And some companies are reluctantly choosing to postpone their IPO after failing to get a desirable share price, such as Yogaworks, which withdrew IPO plans on July 20. The operator of 50 yoga studios had intended to raise $75 million via an initial public offering, before pulling its IPO, citing ""market conditions.""""The discounts have been painful for companies coming to market expecting to get a high market valuation,"" said Smith.IBD'S TAKE: The biggest stock market winners typically make their major price moves within a few months or years of their initial public offering. So it pays to identify and track companies that are getting ready to go or have recently gone public. Learn more at IBD's IPO page. IBD also focuses on the best-performing IPOs of the past three years in its IPO Leaders column.Sometimes, cutting the offering price to get out the door works.Akcea Therapeutics (AKCA), a biotech developing therapies for rare lipid disorders, cut its IPO price to 8, below the anticipated range of 12 to 14. Akcea came public on July 14 and currently trades near 13.75, up 72% from its IPO price. That makes Akcea one of the top-performing IPO stocks this year.Another strong performer is AnaptysBio (ANAB), with shares up 86% since its Jan. 26 debut. AnaptysBio shares were off 2.7% to 27.15 in morning trade on the stock market today. The company has a pipeline of antibody-product candidates designed to treat severe inflammatory conditions.Big-box retailer Floor & Decor Holdings (FND) is up 80% since its April 27 launch, making it the leading stock in the consumer goods sector. Floor & Decor, after a solid run from its April 27 IPO, has been pulling back recently. Given its fundamentals, including 96% average earnings growth over the last three quarters and 35% three-year annual sales growth, it's one to keep an eye on. Floor & Decor was recently featured in IBD's New America section.In the tech sector, Appian (APPN) is up 69% since its May 25 debut, making it one of the top performers. Appian provides a software-development platform that businesses use to develop applications. Appian reports quarterly results after the markets close Aug. 3.A number of large filers could be ready to launch this summer or early fall, says Renaissance. These include Alibaba (BABA)-backed Chinese logistics firm Best, food supplier Dole Food, meat processor JBS Foods International, U.S. airline Frontier, and sales and marketing firm Advantage Solutions.RELATED:IPO Stock News And Analysis: Find Today's Top New IssuesBlue Apron Saga 'Becoming A Horror Story' As Amazon Approaches

474,TAP,"Shares in Akamai Technologies (AKAM) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) took a hit on disappointing guidance in trading Wednesday, though June quarter earnings reported late Tuesday topped views.XAkamai fell 14.6% to 44.49 on the stock market today, falling to a 17-month low. Juniper shares sank 6.3% to 28.06.Akamai beat lowered earnings expectations, but current-quarter guidance disappointed. Akamai said it expects September quarter revenue in a range of $604 million to $616 million vs. consensus estimates of $619.4 million.Cambridge, Mass.-based Akamai is the biggest provider of content delivery network, or CDN, services, which increase the speed of e-commerce transactions, business software downloads and video streaming to mobile devices.""Lower traffic volumes, steep pricing declines and share loss continue to weigh on the remainder of the media business, while year-over-year growth in Performance and Cloud Security decelerated (in Q2),"" said Keith Weiss, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in a report. ""While management enacts new initiatives to shore up a leaking margin structure, investors must assess whether the pressures are cyclical or secular.""A rival of Cisco Systems (CSCO), Juniper had edged up in after-hours trading after the company reported second-quarter earnings but reversed after its earnings call. Juniper has been seeking a turnaround under its new chief executive, Rami Rahim. It's aiming to sell more networking gear to cloud-computing providers such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB).IBD'S TAKE: For an up-to-the-minute look at which good stocks are trading in heavy volume and making big moves, the place to check is IBD's Stocks on the Move. ""Company guidance of full-year revenue growth of about 5% implies a sharp second half slowdown on more difficult comparisons,"" said Steven Milunovich, a UBS analyst in a report.

475,TAP,"Futures for the S&P 500 index and especially the Nasdaq 100 rallied early Thursday, fueled by Facebook (FB) rallying late on its strong Q2 earnings. Facebook's fellow FANG stock Amazon.com (AMZN) is on tap Thursday evening, with Amazon shares currently in buy range. Electronic Arts (EA), Baidu (BIDU) and Mastercard (MA) also are in buy zones with earnings set for Thursday.XAmazon, Electronic Arts and Mastercard all have stellar Composite Ratings of 95 or above, while Baidu's is a solid 83. But three of the four stocks have already moved into the upper half of their 5% chase zones, with Amazon's chart offering additional reasons to be wary.S&P 500 index futures rose 0.15% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.55%, with Facebook trading 4% higher in the after-hours session. PayPal (PYPL) and Lam Research (LRCX) also contributed with after-hours earnings gains. Futures for the Dow industrials ticked 0.1% higher.All eyes will be on the e-commerce giant Thursday. Economists expect a 21% earnings per share drop to $1.40, with revenue up 22% to $37.214 billion.Amazon apparently had a successful Prime Day on July 10, with big sales of its Alexa-enabled Echo speakers as well as new Prime memberships. But those won't be included in Q2's results.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. That options strategy is highlighted in IBD's weekly Earnings Preview column.Amazon rose 1.2% to 1,052.80 in Wednesday stock market trading. That's above a 1,016.60 flat-base buy point. The 5% chase zone rises to 1,067.43, so Amazon is still buyable. However, it's always better to buy as close to the entry point as possible to minimize the potential losses. Amazon is 3.6% above the entry as of Wednesday, and was trading at 1,061.50 in premarket trading.Meanwhile, Amazon cleared a fourth-stage base. Late-stage patterns are more prone to failure. Also, Amazon's breakout came on lackluster volume.On the upside, Amazon's relative strength line is at new highs, a bullish sign and reflecting the stock's outperformance of the S&P 500.Amazon has a 98 Composite Rating, which means it outperforms 98% of all stocks based on a variety of fundamental criteria. Big stock winners often have 95+ Composite Ratings near the start of their big runs.The Chinese search giant has struggled in recent quarters, especially in comparison to many other Chinese internet giants. Baidu is making a big throw on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence. In the meantime, analysts expect Baidu to report Q2 EPS of $1.42, up 16%, on revenue of $2.78 billion, up 1%.Baidu climbed 2.1% to 201.17 on Wednesday. The stock was still within buy range from a cup base at a 193.84 entry, though it's nearly 4% above that point. You could also view Baidu as being within a pattern going back into 2016, but the buy point would remain the same.Baidu has the opposite problem of Amazon. Baidu is in a first-stage base, but because the stock has largely gone sideways over the past year, its relative strength line is lagging.Electronic Arts is expected to report EPS of 28 cents, up 300% vs. a year earlier. Revenue should climb 12% to $766 million.The video game publisher's stock broke out on Wednesday, rising 3.8% to 118, clearing a 116.14 flat-base buy point with volume that was 41% above normal. Electronic Arts has a 95 Composite Rating and a strong RS line.Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is at new-high ground, while Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) cleared an entry point on Tuesday.Mastercard reports before the market open. Analysts expect an 8% EPS gain to $1.04 with revenue up 10.5% to $2.978 billion.Mastercard rose 0.8% to 130.99, its 14th straight gain, mostly in small doses. The stock cleared a flat-base entry of 126.29 on July 14 and is now 3.7% above that level. Mastercard has had a few above-average-volume days in its breakout move, but not many.Visa (V) and American Express (AXP), which reported earnings last week, are in the upper end of buy ranges. PayPal, which topped views late Wednesday, and Square (SQ), are among the other recent stock breakouts in the finance-payment group, though they are both extended.RELATED:Facebook Earnings Soar; Users Hit New Milestone4 Big Earnings You Can't Miss Thursday: Investing Action PlanVideo Game, Chip Stocks Climb To New Buy PointsHere's What Analysts Are Saying About Amazon Ahead Of Earnings

479,TAP,"Expectations of higher ad prices and volume led Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju to raise his price target on Facebook (FB) Monday.Ju reset estimates on Facebook after recalibrating his product-by-product model following advertiser checks and looking at the latest foreign exchange rates. Ju raised his price target on Facebook to 175 from 170 and maintained an outperform rating on the stock.Facebook is set to report first-quarter earnings after the market close May 3. The consensus on revenue is $7.8 billion, up 45% from the year-ago quarter and maintaining a streak of double-digit growth going back more than four years. The consensus on adjusted earnings is $1.12 a share, up 45%, but that represents the third quarter in a row of deceleration.Facebook stock rose 1.5% to 141.42 in the stock market today.Ju thinks the consensus estimate on advertising growth is overly conservative. He also thinks Facebook will show an increase in ad prices, based partly on ads for mobile. Long term, Ju wrote, Facebook will be able to drive revenue growth without a material lift in ad loads, with near- to medium-term growth drivers including Instagram and Premium Video.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook recently received an encouraging endorsement in an expansive report that said market momentum and trends favor the company. Facebook shows a strong IBD Composite Rating of 93, meaning it is outperforming 93% of stocks in the past six months based on a variety of metrics.Ju said his conversations with advertisers in the travel business show strong interest in dynamic ads, which are ad placements that target users based on their interests and likes. He said dynamic ads for travel are gaining traction as marketers like their return on investment.""These factors should allow Facebook to tap a vertical (market) where it has had relatively lower traction,"" Ju wrote.RELATED:This Is The Key Test That Netflix, Facebook And Apple Are FacingFacebook Stock Quotes, Company News And Chart AnalysisInstagram Stories Passes Snapchat As Facebook Assault Continues

485,TAP,"America faces dire labor shortages. From commercial airline pilots to machinists to primary care physicians, concerns swirl around a shrinking labor pool.What about financial planners?The oldest baby boomers turn 71 this year. As aging advisors retire, newcomers must enter the pipeline to serve a rising generation of earners in search of financial planning expertise.The financial advisory industry peaked at about 325,000 in 2008 but has since shifted downward, according to Cerulli Associates, a Boston-based research firm. There were roughly 310,000 advisors in 2015 — with 41% over age 55.It's not as if the industry lacks a young fan base. In 2015, about 36,000 ""rookie"" advisors (which Cerulli defines as having less than three years of experience) plied their trade. But nearly 30,000 advisors who had entered the business in the previous five years left the field.To address the potential shortfall, more colleges are launching financial planning programs. And advisory firms are offerings internships to give young people a taste of the business.Just as advisors are aging, so are many of their clients. While newly minted financial planners may inherit some of these high-net-worth individuals, there's no guarantee they'll be able to woo the next generation of wealth builders.""One challenge advisors will face is client demographics,"" said Kenton Shirk, director of Cerulli's intermediary practice. ""As midcareer advisors inch toward retirement, they need to replenish their (aging) clients.""He notes that 46% of advisors' clients have reached age 60. To nourish a sustainable practice, advisors must attract and retain younger professionals — and foster lasting relationships with them as their assets grow.By recruiting fresh-faced financial planners to their firm, seasoned advisors can solve two problems at once. First, bringing in young blood sets the stage for a smooth succession plan, as long as those newcomers learn and grow on the job.Second, young advisors can tap their peer networks for potential clients. Their ability to connect with high-earning millennials can diversify a practice's client mix.""When it comes time to sell your firm, those advisors who have built a large, multigenerational practice will have less of a problem,"" Shirk said.There are lots of potential buyers on the hunt for thriving advisory firms. Nearly two-thirds of independent advisors want to acquire a practice, but only about half of them are actively networking to find acquisition opportunities, Shirk says.""The other half aren't looking actively, but if the opportunity presented itself, they say they'd pursue it,"" he added.Advisors pondering their exit strategy should think ahead and hire trainees who can gradually learn the ropes and hone their skills, Shirk says. This also enables founders to pass along their values to the next generation.""Hiring advisors who can continue your philosophy and approach to serving clients can help you sustain your legacy,"" he said.Retaining early-career advisors can prove challenging once they hit their stride. A founder who plans to retire in the distant future may want to draft continuity agreements with younger associates that position them to gain some form of ownership in the event of the founder's death or disability.""These continuity agreements are often converted into succession agreements later on,"" Shirk said. ""It makes sense because they know each other pretty well at that point. They have a relationship. They've both done their due diligence.""Another step farsighted advisors can take to sustain their firm's long-term success is to reduce the odds of losing young stars. Retaining these financial planners — by offering them a promising career track and professional development opportunities — creates stability among your personnel.Rather than toss newcomers into a sink-or-swim situation, it's often better to provide training and support. Larger firms have the capacity to place new hires on teams with more experienced advisors.""There are fundamental shifts in onboarding of advisors,"" Shirk said. ""As a firm grows, the rainmakers have more constraints on their time as they service the bigger clients and do business development. So there's more room to hire nonproducing advisors who serve clients,"" but aren't under pressure to bring in sizable assets.These service-oriented advisors strengthen a firm's capacity to grow, Shirk says, especially as a grizzled wealth manager segues into retirement. But they might also throw some longtime advisors for a loop.""Older advisors can struggle if they want newer advisors to do it the way they did,"" he said. ""They may say, 'I don't want to pay salaries to junior advisors' or 'I want them to earn sweat equity.'""RELATED:Hungry For Talent, Advisory Firms Find Success In Attracting Star InternsSee How Experts Win In Leaders & Success

489,TAP,"Longtime media executive Jeffrey Katzenberg gave more details about his mobile video plans, telling Variety that he is actively seeking media and technology partners for his venture to create high-quality short-form video aimed at millennials via mobile screens.XThe effort, tentatively dubbed New TV, is seeking $2 billion to fund slickly produced videos with top-shelf talent that could range from two-minute news broadcasts to 10-minute serial videos.Media giants are receptive as they scramble to attract younger viewers who don't watch much content on TV but are glued to their smartphones, often watching hours of shorter videos on Snapchat, Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned YouTube and others. But much of that is viral amateur videos or low-cost productions.Variety notes that for-mobile content rarely costs more than $5,000-$10,000 per minute; Katzenberg wants to spend as much as $125,000 per minute.Katzenberg has been pursuing the idea since selling DreamWorks Animation to Comcast (CMCSA)-unit NBCUniversal, last year.CBS (CBS) and Walt Disney (DIS) are possible partners for New TV. (Katzenberg was fired as a top executive at Disney more than two decades ago, spurring him to co-create DreamWorks in 1994.AT&T (T) CEO Randall Stephenson wasn't cited as a possible partner. But he recently mused about creating a 20-minute ""Game of Thrones."" AT&T has a deal to buy cable giant Time Warner (TWX), which owns HBO.Others are already moving toward TV-quality short video. Comcast's NBC News on Wednesday debuted short broadcasts on Snapchat, with a 30-person crew. NBC and Snapchat-parent Snap (SNAP) will split the revenue.Meanwhile, Facebook (FB), Snap and Alphabet's YouTube are opening up their wallets for scripted content, much of which would be shorter form.New TV could be free to consumers as part of an existing brand or a subscription-service offering by an existing provider, Variety reported. Less likely is it teaming up with a streaming service such as Netflix (NFLX) or Hulu, which could easily move into shorter-form video to appeal to a new audience. Katzenberg could try to go completely alone, though he'd rather not.Shorter-form video also limits how many ads can be sold against it.RELATED:Snap Pops As New NBC News Show Debuts On Snapchat

496,TAP,"A political hit job was just carried out against the Trump White House, and the fate of the victims is yet to be determined.Last week, the far-left New York Times — which long ago abandoned any pretense of being unbiased or having journalistic standards — acted as the smear agent for unnamed ""American officials,"" and printed a piece that Pravda of the former Soviet Union could have only hoped to emulate.The article, titled ""2 White House Officials Helped Give Nunes Intelligence Reports,"" was meant to damage the credibility of Congressman Devin Nunes, who is the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, while specifically targeting two of President Trump's most loyal White House aides.As the New York Times noted, Chairman Nunes refused to identify his sources regarding his proof of Trump employees and campaign officials being under the surveillance of American intelligence operatives and then having the names of those employees and campaign officials illegally unmasked in violation of U.S. law.An ""unmasking"" former Obama National Security Advisor Susan Rice is now doing a tap dance all around.The New York Times was more than happy to break that confidence. But, as the newspaper makes clear in its own article, they were doing so in conjunction with those murky and unnamed American officials.Said the Times in leaking the names:  ""Several current American officials identified the White House officials as Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council, and Michael Ellis, a lawyer who works on national security issues at the White House Counsel's Office and was previously counsel to Mr. Nunes's committee.""It should be noted and stressed that, not by coincidence, Ezra Cohen-Watnick — described as ""a true American patriot and an outstanding intelligence analyst"" by several people I spoke with — had been the target of these same unnamed and murky ""American officials"" a few weeks earlier.As detailed on March 14 in an article titled ""Trump steps in to keep 30-year-old NSC aide,"" the left-of-center news site Politico outlines how on March 10 National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster allegedly told Cohen-Watnick that ""he would be moved to another position in the organization.""Politico then further reported that the ""conversation followed weeks of pressure from career officials at the CIA who had expressed reservations about the 30-year-old intelligence operative and pushed for his ouster.""The piece then cuts to the chase when it quotes another intelligence operative as to why certain individuals at the CIA wanted Cohen-Watnick removed.  It reports that Cohen-Watnick and his previous boss, Michael Flynn, saw ""eye-to-eye about the failings of the CIA human intelligence operations. … The CIA saw (Cohen-Watnick) as a threat, so they tried to unseat him and replace him with an agency loyalist.""If true, those would be the actions of a police state and should send chills down the spines of anyone in or out of government who still cares about ethics and our Constitution.For me personally, I don't believe there is any government agency more critical to the welfare of our national security than the Central Intelligence Agency.  Its field operatives are — anonymously — beyond heroic, and with Mike Pompeo as the new DCI, the agency could not be in more capable or ethical hands.That said, it would be foolish and professionally irresponsible not to acknowledge that there could be career operatives within the CIA — or any of our intelligence agencies — who, out of some twisted and misplaced loyalty to Barack Obama and his failed policies, are working in the shadows to damage the Trump White House and those tasked with carrying out the policies of President Trump.Surely, Director Pompeo will want to know if such unethical and potentially illegal actions are taking place on his watch.As detailed by Politico, three weeks ago, unnamed and murky ""American officials"" tried and failed to take Ezra Cohen-Watnick out.  Refusing to give up, they turned to the New York Times to assist them with their dirty work.According to the report, Senior White House Advisors Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner — with the blessing of President Trump — stepped in to personally protect Cohen-Watnick.Should that be the case, they need to do so again to protect not only Cohen-Watnick, but Michael Ellis as well.The New York Times story was nothing more than a vile political hit job carried out for partisan reasons, and if Cohen-Watnick and Ellis are not protected, then the deep-state operatives working out of the shadows will have won.The liberal mainstream media and their allies have long decried the creation of ""enemies lists"" and the punishment of those on such lists.Now, for their own partisan and ideological reasons, they employ them.RELATED:Did Susan Rice Commit A Crime?Is Susan Rice The Missing Piece In Obama Spy Scandal?Did Obama Spy On Trump?

499,TAP,"The CBOE Volatility Index, the market's fear gauge, fell to an all-time low on Friday, but investors shrugged as the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite barely declined. The last notable VIX low on June 9 helped trigger the big tech stock reversal, with Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) along with the FANG stocks of Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), leading the way.XThe Volatility Index estimates expected volatility based on S&P 500 index option prices. Commonly known by its ticker, the VIX highlights intense fear or complacency in the market. Low VIX readings are a sign that investors are especially bullish. Excessively bullish readings are often marked by at least short-term market tops.The VIX fell to 9.30 intraday, undercutting the 1993 all-time low of 9.31, before closing at 9.36.  The fear gauge didn't plunge on Friday — though it did make its move near the close — but had been moving steady lower since July 6.The market barely reacted on Friday, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 down less than 0.1%. Apple did test its 50-day moving average, but closed pennies lower. Meanwhile, Nvidia and Netflix hit record highs. Facebook and Amazon are right at record highs while Alphabet is setting up for a possible breakout.On July 9, the Nasdaq and many top techs were at all-time highs when low VIX reading of 9.37. Techs sold off hard that day and on June 10, and continued to drift lower over the next few weeks. The VIX hit a short-term high on June 29, when the S&P 500 index bottomed and a slightly lower top on July 6, when the Nasdaq marked a low.But the major averages didn't really fall that far or for long. The S&P 500 dipped 2% from its June 19 peak, while the Nasdaq lost just 4.1% from its June 9 top. Even the big-cap Nasdaq 100 only retreated 5.4%. And the major averages quickly bounced back to new highs.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases. It's understandable why investors have become complacent. The bull market is more than eight years old, with big gains coming over the last several months, especially since Election Day. They've heard so many dire warnings, from Brexit and Donald Trump to, yes, low VIX readings, that turned out to be nonevents or the catalyst for big market gains. Of the FANG+ stocks, Alphabet is up 25% in 2017, and it's the laggard. Apple is up 30%, Amazon 35%, Facebook 43% and Netflix 52%. Nvidia, meanwhile, is up a whopping 63% since May 9.But just as with the housing boom of the past decade, the idea that the stock market can only go up is dangerous.Consider the psychology: Stocks rally as investors turn upbeat and pull money from the sidelines. But if ""everyone"" is bullish and fully invested, who's left to buy? If the market assumes everything will go well, what news will propel equities higher?Consider history: Sometimes extremely low VIX readings signal much bigger market shifts. The VIX hit a low of 9.39 in December 2006. Over the next 22 months, the VIX surged to 89.53 in October 2008, as the global financial crisis peaked and stocks collapsed.The December 1993 VIX low also spurred a big rise in the fear gauge. The major averages had a big correction in 1994 as the Federal Reserve raised rates in a preemptive move against inflation.Extremely low fear is one more reason to be cautious. The current market rally has generally come on below-average volume, with indicates lackluster conviction by institutional investors. And it's the middle of earnings season, with Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet on tap next week, followed by Apple on Aug. 1.Is Friday's record VIX low a sign of a short- or long-term market move? Don't try to predict. Pay attention to the major indexes and leading stocks and act appropriately.RELATED:Fear Gauge Flashed Extreme Bullishness Just Before Tech SelloffThe Only Thing Investors Have To Fear Is No Fear ItselfPsychological Market IndicatorsThese Three FANG Giants Are Ready To Report EarningsFor Earnings Trades, These 4 Names Look The Most Actionable

500,TAP,"Some investors prefer to take the summer off to avoid those typically slow months, while others may see it as a chance to buy.Brian Rorick, partner and co-founder of Aveo Capital Partners, is in the latter camp this year. The wealth management firm, which is based in Greenwood Village, Colo., manages more than $500 million in assets.X""Given the strong rally in equities during the first half of the year, it would not be surprising to see a pullback in equities during the summer months,"" he told IBD. ""Barring any major geopolitical event or significant pullback in the economy, we would view this as a buying opportunity rather than the start of a major drawdown in equities.""But he advises caution, since it can be tough to find strong equity candidates due to current valuation levels. Here are Rorick's three best ETF investment ideas, in his own words:With U.S. equities trading near all-time highs and interest rates trading near historic lows, this is a challenging environment at current valuations for finding compelling, high-conviction investment ideas over the short- to medium-term time horizon. Equity and income investors need to be both creative and cautious, while also looking to other parts of the financial markets that are not trading at extreme levels.QuantX Risk Managed Multi-Asset Income (QXMI)With the 10-year Treasury yield stuck near 2%, investors have moved into higher risk income investments to meet their income needs. The downside risk in these parts of the market may be underappreciated by many investors.This ETF is designed to provide exposure to higher-yielding asset classes with downside protection by dynamically allocating to a wide variety of income-producing assets. The fund uses a proprietary methodology to select the best performing fixed-income and equity ETFs to maximize income and capital growth. Portfolio exposure to cash and fixed-income instruments is managed to provide downside protection during times of market stress.For investors that want to enhance their income beyond traditional fixed income but also want to have the ability to be defensive if rates rise, this is a solid long-term core holding.QuantX Dynamic Beta US Equity (XUSA)This ETF seeks to provide ""smarter beta"" exposure to domestic equities by using option data to select stocks from the Russell 1000 index that have the most favorable upside relative to downside potential. The overall portfolio beta is designed to dynamically adjust to changes in market volatility to optimize risk-adjusted returns. For investors seeking more asymmetric returns than a traditional index fund this is a solid long-term core holding.(Editor's note: Both QuantX ETFs, for which Blue Sky Asset Management is investment advisor, were launched in January. QXMI has about $11.6 million AUM and carries a 1.12% expense ratio, according to Morningstar Inc. XUSA has $39.7 million in assets and a 0.59% expense ratio.)I worked closely with Blue Sky in developing their initial Dynamic Asset Allocation separate account strategies. You could say I was the earliest adopter of their solutions for my clients — who are HNW investors wanting to protect and grow their capital in all market environments. As a result, we must use alternative strategies like the Risk Managed ETFs that Blue Sky offers to provide downside protection above and beyond what is possible with traditional asset allocation/diversification.As far as the expense ratios, the QuantX Risk Managed ETFs represent alternative investment strategies packaged in the lower cost, transparent and extremely tax-efficient ETF wrapper. Similar strategies have historically been packaged in alternative mutual funds or even hedge funds that have much higher expense ratios, lack transparency and aren't tax-efficient.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD)This is the largest physically backed gold ETF in the world. After posting consecutive years of negative returns in 2013, 2014 and 2015, GLD rebounded nicely in 2016 and continues to post strong returns so far in 2017.This is an asset that still trades well off its all-time highs, performed very well during the 2008 and 2009 financial crisis, and has shown positive momentum over the past 18 months. Given valuations in other asset classes, we believe this is an asset that investors should consider adding to their portfolio or potentially increasing their current allocation.RELATED:Strategist's 3 Best Picks Include These Bond, Emerging-Market ETFs3 Best ETF Ideas Tap Earnings Growth, Dividends

504,TAP,"XThe House pulled a Friday vote on the ObamaCare repeal-and-replace legislation shortly before the market close. Stocks rebounded somewhat from session lows as the bill seemed doomed to defeatThe Dow Jones industrial average pared its loss to 0.3% on the stock market today. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite is up 0.2%.Fading prospects for repealing ObamaCare seemed to kneecap Thursday's rally, when the major averages all finished in the red. Two days earlier, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all suffered their steepest one-day losses since the fall, as conservatives began to close ranks against Ryan's American Health Care Act (AHCA).The Dow industrials fell 1.5% for the week, its worst loss since Trump was elected.House Speaker Paul Ryan, speaking shortly after the market close, said he and President Trump agreed to scrap the vote after they ""came up short."" Ryan signaled the ObamaCare repeal effort is over for now, with attention shifting to tax cuts. He said tax reform is ""more difficult"" now after the health care defeat, but not impossible. Trump also said that tax reform is likely next on tap.If the ObamaCare repeal effort is dead, some analysts has predicted a continued rough spell for financials but a potential bounce for beaten-down hospital stocks. Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) and many other financials have sliced through their 50-day moving averages this week amid concerns that Trump's agenda of growth-fueling tax cuts and infrastructure spending could be sidelined by a failure to repeal ObamaCare. On Friday, Wells Fargo rose 1%, while Goldman Sachs lost 1.5% and BofA was up 0.2%.Meanwhile, hospital operators Tenet Healthcare (THC) and HCA Holdings (HCA) rose 7.4% and 3.4% respectively, Friday, adding to Thursday's rebound.Reports coming out of the White House had suggested Trump would be just fine to see it sink. Wall Street isn't sure, but it may soon come around.While Trump's morning tweet to members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus signaled he was still trying to round up votes, he's eager to move onto the more popular parts of his agenda — tax cuts and infrastructure spending — and reportedly regrets leading off with ObamaCare repeal.IBD'S TAKE: Up until now, financial markets have been happy with just the idea of President Trump's big tax cuts and infrastructure spending. That's because, with all that fiscal fuel in the slow lane, the Federal Reserve can take its sweet time raising interest rates.Those growth-fueling parts of Trumponomics are what primarily sparked the postelection stock market rally. Yet Wall Street has been worried that failure on health care would cast doubt on the GOP's ability to deliver on the rest of its agenda.""If they fail at this then the prospects for tax reform, infrastructure and defense spending will need to be rethought,"" wrote Steven Ricchiuto, Mizuho chief U.S. economist, in a Friday note. ""Failure to pass the GOP bill sets the stage for the equity markets to retest the 2250-2300 level (on the S&P 500) and move the yield on the 10-year back toward the 2.2% level. We believe passage will result in a relief rally in stocks back to the 2400 level, and a sell-off in the 10-year note to reverts toward 2.5-2.6% again.""Meanwhile, RBC Capital Markets sees the dollar weakening further if Trump's fiscal policy takes a loss on health care.While it's possible, maybe even likely, that markets would react negatively at first, if RyanCare dies, the gloom is unlikely to last for long. The reason: It's becoming increasingly clear that ObamaCare repeal is doomed, whether it dies today or in the Senate.""Our base-case is that the AHCA passes the House, with a likely thin majority, but is ultimately voted down by the Senate and/or placed on the back burner by the Republican leadership in order to focus upon tax reform,"" Citi analysts wrote in a Thursday note.The main question, then, is whether RyanCare fails quickly, allowing for a quick shift to drawing up tax cuts, or whether it dies a slow death, which would be the most negative outcome for markets.The reason that Wall Street is divided about the impact of ObamaCare repeal failure is that tax reform looks to be just as complicated as health care reform. Yet, if RyanCare crashes and burns, there's little chance that the GOP will have the stomach to tackle tax reform centered on Ryan's controversial border-adjusted 20% tax on imports.Expect a quick shift from tax reform to tax cuts. The real impact of failure on ObamaCare repeal would be to increase the urgency of tax cuts to save the GOP from a 2018 election debacle. With their backs to the wall, there's a strong chance that Republicans would relax their sense of fiscal responsibility to deliver a big, deficit-increasing tax cut. Acting quickly could allow the GOP to make some tax cuts retroactive to 2017, meaning the payoff for voters would come before Election Day in 2018.While Senate budget reconciliation requiring just a simple majority can only be used to pass legislation that is no worse than deficit neutral beyond the 10th year, the GOP could use President George W. Bush's strategy of letting tax cuts sunset after a decade. Or the GOP could decide to blow up the Senate filibuster and enact permanent tax cuts, rolling the dice that Democrats won't control both the White House and Congress for years to come.Neither of those options is a sure thing. Some Republicans may not be willing to shed their fiscal conscience, and the political left would surely holler about disastrous implications for Social Security and Medicare. It's also unclear how the Federal Reserve and financial markets would respond to a big fiscal stimulus and higher deficits. Higher rates and uncertainty over the future of tax rates also might reduce the effectiveness of tax cuts to a significant extent.RELATED:Stocks Fall On Health Care Vote Delay; CBO Scores Revised BillThe Bull Case For Tax Cuts If ObamaCare Repeal FailsTrump's 3 Little Words That May Sink Ryan's ObamaCare Repeal, Tax ReformTrump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

Here are a list of several notable biotech ETFs.IBM late Tuesday reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. But revenue fell 5%, worse than expected. It was Big Blue's 21st straight quarter of falling revenue vs. a year earlier. Analysts have called IBM's transition to faster-growth, higher-margin software and services ""tedious"" and ""painful.""IBM shares fell 2.9% to 149.60 in premarket action trade, threatening to open Wednesday at a nine-month low.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 0.6% while the Shanghai composite advanced 1.4%.

506,TAP,"Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) turned out earnings that beat analyst estimates on Tuesday, but concerns about net interest income and trading continued to cast a shadow over the financial industry.XJPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C) on Friday signaled caution on the trading environment, while JPMorgan cut its full-year outlook for growth in net interest income — or the difference between the money banks bring in on loans and other products and what they pay out. JPMorgan also tempered its expectations for loan growth.The results come as long-term optimism about the economy becomes more tempered, weighing on long-term interest rates, bond yields and, in turn, net interest income.Hopes that President Trump would charge into office and quickly deregulate have also dimmed amid investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Russia on the presidential election.Bank of America's second-quarter earnings per share rose 12% to 46 cents, beating by 3 cents, as revenue rose 7% to $22.8 billion, topping estimates for $21.915 billion.Net interest income was $11 billion, while net interest margin was 2.34%, though those figures were below some forecasts.The results, CEO Brian Moynihan said in a statement, came despite ""modest economic growth of 2%.""""The margin miss could weigh on shares today but ... should not be a surprise following peer results released last week, in our view,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a research note.Shares fell 0.5% to 23.90 in the stock market today, testing support at their 50-day average. The stock is also close to a buy point of 24.45 in a shallow cup-with-handle base. JPMorgan dipped 0.35% to 91.04, still in range from an 89.23 double-bottom buy point. Citigroup rose 0.1%, extended from its breakout in early June.Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, reported EPS of $3.95, up 6% and beating expectations for a drop to $3.51. Revenue edged lower to $7.89 billion but still came in above forecasts for $7.57 billion.Fixed-income, currency and commodities revenue plunged 40% to $1.159 billion, due to what the company said was ""a challenging environment characterized by low levels of volatility, low client activity and generally difficult market-making conditions.""Or, as a Nomura-Instinet research note on Goldman's earnings put it, ""Hair in the FICC Butter May Trump 2Q Beat.""Goldman shares fell 2.4% to 223.86, testing their 50- and 200-day lines. Morgan Stanley (MS), which reports earnings on Wednesday, eased 1% to 44.85 and is working on a 46.08 buy point.The big banks had already signaled that trading revenue, which makes up a good part of Goldman's business, would be lower for the second quarter, when there were fewer surprises to shock the market into action. Results Friday from JPMorgan and Citigroup confirmed that guidance.The current quarter may not provide much relief. Nomura-Instinet analyst Steven Chubak said potential seasonal weakness during the third quarter could weigh on some banks' results.And JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake on Friday said the bank was lapping what was a strong third quarter for trading last year.""And so while that isn't guidance, it is context, as this quarter has felt quiet, more like prior years,"" she said.RELATED:After JPMorgan Slips, Morgan Stanley Nears Buy With EPS On TapUnitedHealth Set For Record High After Strong Earnings, Raised Full-Year TargetThese 2 Drug Giants In Buy Range Just Beat Earnings ViewsThese 5 Top S&P 500 Stocks Near Buy Points Have Earnings This Week

508,TAP,"Stock futures rose modestly vs. fair value Monday morning, with the Nasdaq poised to retest a key support line that's turned into resistance.The Nasdaq composite will start the week just below its 50-day moving average — unlike the S&P 500 index and Dow industrials — continuing to struggle one month after reversing from record highs on June 9. Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) remain below that key support line. Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) retook their 50-day lines on Friday, along with the S&P 500 index. (The S&P 500 index just closed below that support level on Thursday.)XThe Dow Jones industrial average is less than 1% from record highs, even with Apple, Microsoft and outright laggards Intel (INTC) and Cisco (CSCO) as components.While it would be encouraging for the Nasdaq composite to regain the 50-day line, a longer period of declines or sideways action would allow more time for leading stocks to set up in bullish patterns, including Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and others. Apple and Microsoft are among Dow stocks consolidating in flat bases below their 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: Stocks tend to follow the general market. So with the major averages correcting modestly or moving sideways for a few weeks, flat base patterns are starting to pop up. Four top-rated payment stocks have just formed proper flat patterns. Unlike Apple and Microsoft, they are all above their 50-day lines.Futures for the Nasdaq 100 rose 0.35% above fair value. S&P 500 futures advanced 0.15%, while Dow futures climbed a fraction. Crude oil futures fell 1% to below $44 a barrel.In Asian trading Monday, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.8% while China's Shanghai composite dipped 0.2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 0.6%. In European trading intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE rose 0.2%, Germany's Dax 0.5% and France's CAC-40 0.3%.Corporate news is light Monday, but Amazon kicks off Amazon Prime Day and Barracuda Networks (CUDA) reports earnings.Amazon Prime Day is officially Tuesday, July 11th, but the 30-hour event will start at 9 p.m. ET on Monday. The first two annual Amazon Prime Day events were more about promoting Amazon Prime and Amazon products than great deals. But it works. Amazon racked up big Prime membership gains on Amazon Prime Day. This year, many offers are available only via Amazon's Alexa.Barracuda Networks reports fiscal first-quarter earnings after Monday's closing bell, the first cybersecurity firm to report in the current season. Barracuda, which offers email protection and next-generation firewall products, is expected to report a 5% revenue rise to $91 million, according to Zacks Investment Research. Earnings per share should dip 10% to 18 cents. But the company easily topped EPS forecasts in the prior four quarters, though by smaller margins: 9 cents, 7 cents, 5 cents and 4 cents.The stock is in a consolidation going back nearly nine months with a potential buy point of 26.79. Barracuda jumped 5.5% to 23.85 on Friday, moving back above its 200-day moving average.Several cybersecurity peers are acting well.Proofpoint (PFPT) is in buy range, while Check Point Software (CHKP), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), FireEye (FEYE) and Fortinet (FTNT) are in consolidations, near buy points.RELATED:What Amazon Prime Day Is Really About4 Top Banks Report Earnings, Amazon Prime Touts Amazon Prime: Investing Action PlanApple, Microsoft Lead 4 Dow Stocks Near Buys But Below This Key LevelEarnings Season On Tap: Here Are The 3 Top SectorsThe Big Picture: S&P 500 Retakes Support, But This Was Lacking

509,TAP,"Here is your Investing Action Plan for Thursday: what you need to know as an investor for the coming day.X Delta Air Lines (DAL) kicks off the airline industry's second-quarter earnings season, while Dow stock Visa (V) and archrival Mastercard (MA) are nearing buy points, following breakouts by other payment stocks, including an Apple (AAPL)-fueled move by PayPal (PYPL).Credit-card giants Visa and Mastercard are close to breakouts, following PayPal's breakout Wednesday and a move by Square (SQ) on Tuesday.Visa climbed 0.8% to 96.18 on Wednesday, approaching a 96.70 buy point from a flat base. The stock retook its 50-day line on Friday after testing support at the key measure a few days earlier.Mastercard was also nearing breakout territory in a flat base with a 126.29 buy point. Shares rose 0.85% to 125.28.Visa reports earnings on July 20, with Mastercard on tap July 27.PayPal rose 3.3% to 56.55 Wednesday , breaking out of a flat base with a 55.24 buy point after Apple (AAPL) enabled users in some countries to buy things on iTunes, the App Store, Apple Music and elsewhere using their PayPal accounts. It's unclear how large the Apple deal is. But it's the latest example of a payments rival agreeing to work with PayPal. PayPal also has alliances with Visa and Mastercard.Payments technology company Square rose 3% to 26.21, at the edge of the 5% buy zone. Shares broke out on Tuesday, surging 6.3% and clearing a 25.07 flat-base buy point as an analyst speculated that PayPal should buy Square.A sturdy economy and increased travel since the election have lifted the airline industry this year, even if airline stocks have waxed and waned over that time as Wall Street parses carriers' expansion plans and trends in demand growth.But in recent weeks, Delta suggested second-quarter unit revenue — the industry measure of an airline's operating efficiency that tends to move stocks — was on track to come in at the high end of its forecast range. Last week, the carrier confirmed those expectations, saying Q2 unit revenue had increased around 2.5%, in the upper range of an earlier forecast for a 1%-3% bump.Wall Street expects Delta to report second-quarter earnings per share of $1.65, up 12%, with revenue up 4% to $10.82 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.The unit revenue increase, Delta said, marked the first year-over-year quarterly unit revenue gain since the fourth quarter of 2014. In the roughly two years that followed, cheaper fuel cleared more room for profits. That tempted the airlines to add flights and reduce fares in a grab for airspace, hurting unit revenue before an oil-price rebound prompted more restraint.Delta last week also said that ""commercial initiatives and an improving revenue environment"" helped to make up for a barrage of thunderstorms in the Atlanta area that caused scores of flight cancellations.Delta shares rose 2.2% to 55.48 on Wednesday, buoyed by strong traffic and guidance from United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL). The stock is extended from a 50.28 buy point in a flat base.RELATED:Second Payment Stock Breaks Out, This Time On Apple DealThis Is Why Airline Stocks Have A Tailwind TodayApple iPhone 8 Expectations Too High, No 'Supercycle' Ahead: Analyst

513,TAP,"An already mounting trend toward greater use of health savings accounts (HSAs) could accelerate under Republican plans to reshape how Americans pay for their medical care, putting a spotlight on tax-advantaged HSAs, how they work and how they could change.HSAs, introduced in 2003 under former President George W. Bush, held nearly $37 billion in assets at the end of 2016, up 22% from a year earlier, according to a survey by Minneapolis-based consulting firm Devenir. Those assets were spread out over an estimated 20 million accounts, up 20%. Devenir projected that the HSA market will likely exceed $50 billion in assets — a 10-fold increase from a decade earlier — and 27 million accounts by the end of 2018.These accounts must be paired with high-deductible health plans, which often carry lower premium costs. For 2017, health plans with deductibles of at least $1,300 for single people and $2,600 for families qualify. The annual contribution limit this year is $3,400 for individuals and $6,750 for families. HSA members age 55 and older can contribute an additional $1,000. The account balance rolls over every year.Steve Neeleman, founder of HSA administrator HealthEquity (HQY), said that, ideally, most or all of the money a consumer saves on a low-premium health plan is put into an HSA. The substantial benefit of this route, he said in an interview, is that such money is saved pretax and, if used for qualified medical expenses, is withdrawn tax-free. By extension, an HSA member's overall tax liability is reduced. The idea is to strengthen HSA members' finances, giving them more to spend on the health costs they face before hitting their deductible limits.HSA members can tap their accounts tax-free to cover most common health costs, including doctor and outpatient services, hospital and inpatient treatments, prescription drugs and Medicare premiums. Employers that offer HSAs can contribute to the accounts on behalf of employees. Americans can also choose to manage HSAs on their own, separate from their employers. One can contribute to more than one HSA, but the total contribution cannot exceed the annual limit.Members own their HSAs and keep them when they change jobs, switch insurance plans or retire. Members can also invest HSA funds, and interest on invested balances is earned tax-free. These are the key ways in which HSAs differ from health reimbursement arrangement plans and flexible spending accounts. With HRAs and FSAs, one cannot invest the money and the employer owns the accounts.If a consumer structures an HRA as a high-deductible HSA-qualified plan, then that person can use both. There are several restrictions on using both an HSA and an FSA, but if a person has a limited-purpose FSA that covers only certain expenses, such as dental costs, then both accounts can be used simultaneously.One can use an HSA to pay for a dependent's qualified medical expenses as long as such costs are not reimbursed by another health plan.Neeleman, whose Draper, Utah-based firm administers 2.7 million HSAs with about $5 billion in assets under management, said business steadily grows every year as demand builds and employers are increasingly choosing to offer high-deductible insurance plans to minimize costs. HealthEquity reported HSA growth of 28% in 2016 and asset expansion of 37%, showing that not only are more Americans using HSAs but they also are investing more money in these accounts.Of the overall HSA market's growth, Neeleman added, ""We think it's a steady march every year.""Economists say HSA growth likely would hasten even more if Republican President Donald Trump and allies in the GOP-controlled Congress are able to revamp or repeal the Affordable Care Act — the sweeping health care law passed under former President Barack Obama — and create a new program that would curb federal spending on health care in favor of a system based more on tax credits.""That kind of change could well open a door"" for the expansion of HSAs, Christopher Probyn, chief economist at State Street Global Advisors, said in an interview. He noted that replacement plans are light on details to date, but Republicans in Congress have specifically called for raising the limit on tax-advantaged contributions that Americans can put into HSAs and easing qualifications for participation in such accounts.The goal, as House Speaker Paul Ryan posits in a reform plan he champions, is to put more control of — and responsibility for — health spending into the hands of consumers. The premise is this: When people are making decisions about care with their own money, they are more likely to thoroughly study their options and select plans that best suit their specific situations. They will invest in what they need, pushing insurance companies for more options. This, the thinking goes, will stoke competitive pressures and lead to more affordable options. Critics of the current system, known as ObamaCare, say it has failed to rein in soaring health care costs.Moreover, with more responsibility for their health spending, Americans also are more likely to opt for less-expensive generic drugs, for instance, and are more likely to seek low-cost preventive care in hopes of avoiding expensive treatments in emergency rooms and hospitals, further helping to contain overall costs.Paul Fronstin, director of health research and education at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan public policy research organization in Washington, said in an interview that it is ""highly likely"" that any Republican reform law would include efforts to grow HSA use. He said every GOP proposal to date calls for this.Speaker Ryan has called for raising the individual HSA contribution limit to $6,550 from $3,400 and the family limit to $13,100 from $6,750.President Trump wants to add an additional wrinkle — making HSAs part of a member's estate so that they can be passed on to heirs without a tax penalty. Currently, an HSA inherited from a spouse does not face a so-called death tax, but one passed on from someone other than a spouse is included in the heir's income and therefore taxed.Also of note, when HSA members turn 65, they can withdraw money for nonqualified medical expenses and pay only regular income taxes on that money. Before turning 65, they pay income taxes and a 20% penalty.In retirement, HSA members can continue to use their accounts tax-free for out-of-pocket health expenses, and when they enroll in Medicare, they can use their HSAs to pay Medicare premiums, deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. They cannot use HSAs to pay for Medicare supplemental insurance, but they can use these accounts to pay their share of employer-provided retiree medical costs.Sam Pappas, a portfolio manager for the Retirement Planning Company of New England Inc., said in an interview that HSAs are increasingly in use among an aging population, and retirees are watching the health care reform debate closely. He thinks retooling or replacing ObamaCare could take several months at a minimum, and likely will spill deep into next year, given the complexities of the health care system. But he agreed that any new plan is bound to include motivators to expand use of HSAs.""They will play an even more prominent role,"" Pappas said.

514,TAP,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow futures rose slightly early Friday ahead of the July employment report.Economists expect a rise of 178,000 nonfarm jobs with the unemployment rate ticking down to 4.3% and hourly wages climbing 0.3%. Signs of tighter labor markets, such as falling joblessness or accelerating wage gains, could spur the Federal Reserve to step up tightening.XSeveral leading stocks had double-digit percentage gains or losses on earnings released Thursday. The most important may be Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI), which cratered on weak guidance due to ""softer"" demand from a large customer, possibly Amazon.com (AMZN).Applied Optoelectronics, along with other negative opticals news, pressured the broader group, including Lumentum Holdings (LITE). Lumentum has benefited from speculation that its sensor technology could be part of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 8 as Apple pushes into augmented reality functions.During Thursday's session, the Nasdaq composite closed down 0.35% and the S&P 500 index 0.2%, though the Dow industrials edged higher yet again. Apple, which had soared nearly 5% Wednesday to break out of a flat base, dipped 1% to close below the buy point. Amazon lost 0.9%, continuing to find resistance at its 50-day moving average.S&P 500 and Dow futures rose 0.2% above fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.1%.Applied Optoelectronics said late Thursday that it sees third-quarter revenue at $107 million to $115 million in the September quarter vs. Zacks Research estimates of $126 million.The maker of optical equipment cited ""softer than expected demand for our 40G solutions with one of our large customers."" Amazon is seen as Applied Opto's No. 1 customer, accounting for more than half its business. Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT), which also have huge data-center needs, also are notable customers. There has been speculation that Amazon and other big techs would build or assemble some of their own optical gear.Applied Opto had raised guidance several times during the year and preannounced strong Q2 results on July 13, so the warning shocked investors.Shares fell 25.5% to 72.99 in premarket trading Friday. Applied Opto had risen 318% in 2017 through Thursday.Because of that huge run-up, the stock hadn't offered good buying opportunities for months, aside from a couple of pullbacks to the 50-day moving average. But it's never a good sign to have the No. 1 stock in a top-rated group. Fiber optics have just dropped to No. 3 out of 197 industries from No. 1.And it's not the only signs of trouble for the booming, volatile optical sector. Lagging group members Acacia Communications (ACIA) and Infinera (INFN) also had bad news late, with Acacia seeing weaker revenue and Infinera missing on sales. Late Tuesday, Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), a maker of chips used in optical fields, warned of weaker China demand, sending shares crashing.Lumentum, which has been setting up in a consolidation and finding support at its 50-day moving average, fell 3.1% to 60.50 in early trade Friday. Lumentum briefly crossed a 67.40 buy point in late July but pulled back. Lumentum, which will report earnings next week, has been seen as a winner because of upcoming smartphones adding 3D sensor components, including Apple's iPhone.The so-called optical ""super cycle"" has reflected booming growth in internet data centers, high-speed metro networks and Chinese telecoms. Weakness in opticals could suggest some slackening demand from and for those sectors as well.RELATED:Applied Optoelectronics Plunges On Weak Guidance; Opticals HitStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksThe Big Number For Stocks In Friday's Jobs Report Isn't JobsAcacia Communications September Quarter Guidance Light, Stock SlipsHere's Why Optical Stocks Are Selling Off Today

516,TAP,"Mobileye (MBLY) and Nissan will cooperate on developing precise global maps, one of the most important elements needed in the area of driverless vehicles.Nissan joins Volkswagen (VLKAY) and BMW (BMWYY) in agreeing to integrate Mobileye's Road Experience Management software in its vehicles. The agreement will ""help develop and maintain a Mobileye map of drivable paths and lane boundaries that is updated with real-time data to reflect any changes to the environment,"" Mobileye said in announcing the Nissan deal. Mobileye said it expects other automakers to join over time.Mobileye's REM mapping technology was utilized in Nissan's recent autonomous vehicle demonstration in London. The agreement extends an alliance between the two, the most recent example being Nissan's ProPilot system that uses Mobileye technology for assisted driving features.Every major automaker — including Tesla (Tesla), General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) — have driverless-car programs. Alphabet (GOOGL) in December announced that it would spin out its self-driving car efforts from its research lab into its own business unit called Waymo, indicating that the technology is getting closer to reaching the commercial stage. General Motors is testing self-driving cars in Scottsdale, Ariz. Ford plans to have a fully autonomous car in five years.IBD'S TAKE: Safety questions or not, the era of the self-driving car is here, but moving up fast are self-driving trucks, which are also being tested on roads or are under development by leading truck manufacturers.Intel (INTC) last month announced that it would buy Mobileye for $63.54 a share, valued at $15.3 billion. Intel also recently acquired a stake in mapping-service Here Technologies, co-owned by BMW and other German automakers, including Volkswagen, Audi and Mercedes Benz. Mobileye already had a data-sharing alliance with Here.Mobileye was a longtime partner with Tesla, but the two companies had a public falling out last year following some fatal crashes involving Tesla's Autopilot systems.Mobileye stock was up 0.3% to close at 61.91 on the stock market today. Intel stock was up 0.3%, to 36.87.RELATED:Mobileye To Work With Volkswagen On Self-Driving CarsMobileye Earnings Growth Accelerates; Tesla On Tap

517,TAP,"For the throng of financial advisors attending the Morningstar Investment Conference, the event is a chance to learn practice-building techniques, soak in investment ideas, network with colleagues and, who knows, maybe explore practice mergers and new job prospects.Scheduled speakers at the 29th annual conference, which starts Wednesday, include Charles Pohl, chairman and chief investment officer of Dodge & Cox; Dan Ivascyn, who succeeded Pimco co-founder Bill Gross as Pimco group chief investment officer and who co-manages a number of funds, including $79 billion Pimco Income Fund (PONAX); and Michael Lewis, author of ""Liar's Poker,"" ""Moneyball"" and most recently ""The Undoing Project.""Other speakers that the estimated 1,230 financial advisors in attendance will have a chance to see include Vanguard founder John Bogle, Morningstar (MORN) CEO Kunal Kapoor and BlackRock (BLK) Chairman Larry Fink.The conference agenda is available online. Updates will be available via Twitter and at IBD's Investors.com.IBD'S TAKE: Are you a financial advisor who's on the lookout for practice-building tips? Check out this IBD report about what advisors offer vs. what wealthy clients want.Michael Kitces, a financial planner and personal-finance commentator, is scheduled to kick off the conference's first full day, Thursday, with a post-breakfast general session presentation, ""Future of Financial Planning in the Digital Age.""Kitces told IBD before the conference that he will make the case that robo-advisors will soon become a tool for human financial advisors, not a competitive threat to them. Robo-advisors will enable human advisors to cut the cost of providing many investment services, Kitces said, especially to younger clients with fewer assets and simpler planning needs.By harnessing robo-advisor platforms, human advisors will be able to expand their marketing beyond their local geographic area, Kitces said.Bogle — who is about to turn 88 years of age and who told IBD he does not enjoy airline travel — plans to provide a prerecorded video that will be shown on Thursday. His question-and-answer session is slated to be live from his office in Valley Forge, Pa.Much of his presentation will center on the benefits of low-cost index mutual funds.The popularity of index-oriented investing poses a challenge to active fund managers. Active mutual funds and ETFs excluding money market funds suffered $310 billion in net redemptions during the 12 months ended March 31, according to Morningstar Inc. A tsunami of $638 billion flooded into passive mutual funds and ETFs in those 12 months.But clients and financial advisors still want outperformance. Where can they seek it?""Passive funds guarantee underperformance,"" Matt Fruhan, an active manager of several Fidelity Investments funds, including $7.2 billion Growth & Income (FGRIX), told IBD before the conference. ""Their returns are the underlying index's return minus the fund's fees. So the only way shareholders can get outperformance is through an actively managed fund.""Fruhan is on tap to participate in a Thursday panel discussion titled, ""The Active Equity Challenge."" One of Fruhan's points will be that active-fund shareholders should take heart in the fact that just because passive mutual funds as a group have underperformed in certain periods, that does not mean that all active mutual funds lag. And many active managers fare better on average over longer periods than short periods. ""People should use mutual funds as long-term instruments anyway,"" Fruhan told IBD.One benefit of a long-term approach: a mutual fund that holds stocks many years should have lower transaction costs and should end up paying a lower capital-gains tax rate, Fruhan says.Fruhan also plans to cite Fidelity research that found that actively run mutual funds with low fees from large fund families on average outperformed their passive peer group from 1992 to 2016. Those atypically low fees cut an active fund's headwind in competing against its benchmark.""And fund families that are large have more resources and scale to apply to (reduce) trading costs and to invest in stock research,"" Fruhan said.One of the conference's final panels will be ""Absolute Return Funds: Absolutely Fabulous or Absolute Rubbish?""Absolute return mutual funds typically aim for a positive return in any kind of market. They appeal to shareholders who abhor volatility. They tend to pursue their return goal by tracking a benchmark that almost always gains ground over something like rolling five-year periods, such as Treasury bills or the Libor interest rate. Their usual procedure is to offer a return that is some fixed amount, such as 3 percentage points, higher than the underlying index's return. Libor is an interest rate that many banks charge each other for short-term loans.A knock on absolute return funds is that many make heavy use of derivatives, shorting and borrowing, which help make them hard for retail investors to understand, and many charge high fees.Panelist Suzanne Hutchins told IBD that the fund she helps manage, $1.4 billion Dreyfus Global Real Return (DRRIX), aims for a return of Libor plus 4 percentage points over rolling five-year periods. The fund has a modest 0.88% annual expense ratio. ""This provides a nice alternative to government bonds,"" she said. ""We are very much a sleep-at-night portfolio. This is not a core strategy for individuals who want a lot of growth. For a young person who has more appetite for risk, this would not be the core of their portfolio.""RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeAdvisors Prospect For Gold At Morningstar Investment ConferenceAdvisors Consult Crystal Balls At Morningstar Investment Conference

519,TAP,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) kicks off a busy week of defense earnings Tuesday as tensions rise in the Middle East and Asia.Analysts see an 8% increase in earnings to $2.79 per share, and revenue is seen rising 8.4% to $1.24 billion as F-35 production continues to ramp up.Deliveries from the ninth F-35 production lot began in Q1, after a $6.1 billion contract for 57 planes was signed in November. An $8.2 billion contract for the 10th batch, which covers 90 F-35s, was signed in February, though deliveries aren't expected until next year. Lockheed is planning to transition to full-rate production in 2019.Meanwhile, North Korea's recent missile tests are speeding up deployment of Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system to South Korea, highlighting the growing demand for air-defense systems.In the Middle East, the $5 billion sale of 19 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain was recently cleared as U.S. allies in the region face intensifying friction with Iran. Lockheed has set a goal to expand its foreign sales to 30% of total revenue in the next few years and the Trump administration has been supportive of sales to allies.Shares of Lockheed are back in buy range after clearing a 270 entry several times since late February. Shares rose 1.2% to 276.33 in the stock market today.Raytheon (RTN) reports Thursday. Analysts expect a 12.6% jump in EPS to $1.62 and a 1.2% increase in revenue to $5.83 billion.The Tomahawk maker's stock saw a bump after its cruise missiles were launched at a Syrian air base earlier this month. Each Tomahawk cruise missile costs over $1.5 million.Raytheon's Patriot air-defense system has also been in demand. After land big orders from Saudi Arabia in 2015, South Korea and Japan plan to upgrade their Patriot systems, and a contract topping $7 billion is expected soon from Poland.Shares are also back in buy range after clearing a 152.68 buy point initially last month. Rathyeon rose 1.3% to 156.02 on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed and Raytheon retook their buy points of 270 and 152.68 respectively, but did so in light volume. So look for a decisive move when earnings come out. Northrop is near its 249.53 buy point. To find other leaders near a buy point check out Leaderboard. Northrop Grumman (NOC) reports Wednesday, and EPS is expected to fall 3.6% to $2.92 but sales are seen up 2.3%.Northrop is a major subcontractor on the F-35 and also benefits from Lockheed's increased production. It makes the center fuselage, fire control radar, and the communications and navigation system, while also helping develop the mission system and mission planning software.Northrop is also building the secretive B-21 stealth bomber, which development dollars are flowing to that project though the company and the Pentagon have been reluctant to disclose specific cost figures on that program.Northrop Grumman advanced 1.1% to 24.14, just below a 249.53 buy point. Northrop hit 250 intraday.General Dynamics (GD) is on tap for Wednesday, and EPS is seen dipping less than 0.1% to $2.32 while revenue stays essentially flat at $7.71 billion.Shares have been gaining support at their 10-week average, a good entry point. Shares rose 1.5% to 191.81, making them slightly extended from an 181.19 buy point cleared in January.RELATED: Lockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of TruthSouth Korea To Deploy Lockheed's THAAD Missile Defense System Early

520,TAP,"Mobileye (MBLY) reported faster earnings and revenue growth early Wednesday that topped fourth-quarter expectations, sending shares higher.Former partner Tesla (TSLA) will wheel out its Q4 financials after the closing bell.Mobileye, a leading developer of advanced driver-assistance technology, reported revenue grew 46% vs. a year earlier to $104.6 million, beating the consensus estimate of $96.4 million. Earnings per share minus items rose 47% to of 22 cents, beating views for 20 cents, as polled by Thomson Reuters.That ended a four-quarter string of decelerating EPS and sales growth.IBD'S TAKE: Ultimately, earnings drive the stock price. So companies with increasing profit gains are likely to do well. Here are seven stocks with accelerating growth above 100%.Mobileye shares climbed 2.8% to close at 47.42 on the stock market today.  The stock, which closed Tuesday just above a cup-with-handle buy point of 45.03, has seen dramatic saw-toothed action since its August 2014 initial public offering, peaking at 64.48 in August 2015 and dropping to 23.57 in February of last year.Mobileye's core products are chip and software technology that provides image processing and analysis used in cars with camera-based systems for assisted driving.Tuesday, Mobileye announced it will partner with BMW (BMWYY) in the development of advanced mapping technology. It said BMW automobiles entering the market in 2018 will include Mobileye's camera-based map technology, called Road Experience Management.The road data will be shared with digital mapping company Here, owned by a consortium of German automakers, to develop a precise global map that can be used for hands-free driving and location services. Here poses a threat to Google Maps owner Alphabet (GOOGL).The Mobileye deal with BMW is similar to one that Mobileye and Volkswagen (VLKAY) announced last week. Digital maps are a crucial piece of technology for the development of self-driving vehicles.The three owners of Here are BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi, which together acquired the mapping business from Nokia (NOK) in August 2015 for $3 billion. Volkswagen is the parent company of Audi. Intel agreed to buy a 15% stake in Here earlier this year.Mobileye, BMW and Intel (INTC) have an alliance to build self-driving cars, with road testing set to begin this year. Mobileye and auto parts giant Delphi (DLPH) have been working on autonomous driving systems for other automakers. Mobileye is part of the IBD 50.Electric-car maker Tesla is set to report fourth-quarter earnings after the market close. Analysts will be looking for details on the production and deliveries of the Tesla Model 3 sedan, as well as progress on its newly opened battery-production Gigafactory in Nevada and more data on the company's acquisition of SolarCity.Tesla and Mobileye ended their partnership last year, reportedly because of technology differences regarding the development of self-driving cars. The split came after the death of a Tesla driver in Florida who was using Tesla's Autopilot feature, but the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in January announced it was ending its investigation of the accident, in essence determining that Tesla was not at fault.Tesla shares fell 1.4% to close the regular trading session at 273.51, but shares surged after hours by 2% to 279 in recent trades.RELATED:Tesla, Alphabet, Automakers Get Guidelines On Self-Driving VehiclesTesla, Mobileye Are In Buy Range Ahead Of Earnings: Investing Action PlanWill Tesla Get Run Over By China, GM, Ford, BMW In Electric Vehicles?

522,TAP,"Amazon.com (AMZN) has a potential megahit on its hands with the Echo smart-home device and its Alexa companion — a voice activated, digital home assistant — the combination of which could attain $10 billion in revenue by 2020, an analyst report said Friday.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said a survey of Amazon customers showed stronger awareness of the Amazon Echo than expected. Google Home, which Alphabet (GOOGL) introduced in November and competes with Echo, is also gaining strong traction. Google Home is powered by Google Assistant.Amazon and Alphabet are in a race for dominance in one of the hottest categories in consumer electronics. Both devices are voice-activated speaker systems connected to the internet that can answer a multitude of questions, play music on request, read books, tell jokes, provide weather and traffic information, and much more.Microsoft (MSFT) also is expected to enter the market, based on its Cortana platform. That's also true of Apple (AAPL), based on Siri.Microsoft in December gave a sneak peek at a new device that looks similar to Echo. The device has a label from speaker-maker Harman (HAR), but is voice-controlled through Cortana, Microsoft's artificial intelligence platform. Microsoft said the device will ship this year.Amazon has a big early lead with Echo, priced at just under $180. It was introduced in June 2015.Echo is voiced by Amazon's Alexa, which responds to questions and requests and lives in the Amazon cloud. It can also be used for buying products. Amazon also has a low-end version of Echo, called Dot, also voiced by Alexa, which sells for $50, and a midrange device called Tap.Google Home, which sells for under $130, didn't arrive until November but is quickly catching on. Mahaney said both products are ""dramatically gaining awareness, adoption and usage in the U.S.""IBD'S TAKE: Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are strengthening their connection to customers with mobile and in-home devices infused with advanced speech recognition and artificial intelligence. The devices could evolve into the next major disruption in computing and put the smart home on a fast track.The devices have the potential of being the central hub of a smart-home ecosystem. As to which device is better, that's open to opinion. Some analysts think Google Home will be the winner, based on its strength in artificial intelligence, while others think Amazon has a good shot at remaining the market leader with its Alexa line of products.Mahaney, drawing from survey results, thinks Amazon could pull in $5 billion in revenue from Echo device sales and an additional $5 billion in revenue from sales through the devices by 2020.By then, Mahaney thinks Amazon will sell 60 million Echo devices. Current estimates are that Amazon has sold about 6 million Echo and Dot devices. Mahaney said survey results indicate that Alphabet may have an installed base about one-third the size of Alexa's.""We are seeing strong traction for Google Home. That said, Google still has a lot of catching up to do,"" Mahaney wrote.RELATED:Amazon Could Win Big Battle With Alphabet If Google Home SputtersAlexa, Why Did Morningstar Rate You As A Durable Business Pillar?No Need To Ask Jeeves When You Can Ask Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google

523,TAP,"It is no secret that most active managers fail to pick stocks that beat the benchmark S&P 500, but some bright minds think investing in ETFs may do the trick. Wait, those boring old investments that ""passively"" match the returns of the stock and bond markets?Oh, yes.In the hands of select money managers, the humble exchange traded fund is a building block for sophisticated portfolio solutions that help their clients to become more successful investors. The bedrock of these ETF-based strategies is tactical trades to seize market opportunity and systematic risk management to limit losses. The hope is that these packaged portfolios of ETFs will outperform the bogey with less risk over a full market cycle.Vern Sumnicht was driven to develop an all-ETF strategy after the stock market rout of 2000, when the buy-and-hold approach failed investors.""Like many other advisors and their clients, we found that when the S&P 500 index went down, every asset class went down"" with it, said Sumnicht, the CEO of Wisconsin-based iSectors.He added: ""We developed the iSectors Post-MPT Growth Allocation strategy to achieve a better risk-adjusted return for our wealth management clients.""The pioneering tactical ETF investment strategy takes aim at the flaws in traditional asset allocation. It replaces the style-box method with what Sumnicht describes as nine ""clumps of sectors"" with low correlations, including stocks, bonds and gold. Managing downside risk of returns is key, hence the ""Post-Modern Portfolio Theory"" in its name.Over the past 11 years — including the stock market collapse of 2008 — the Post-MPT Growth Allocation strategy has outpaced the S&P 500, as discussed in more detail below.Sumnicht's best ETF investment ideas tap sectors poised to benefit most from President Trump's economic vision. Unsurprisingly, those sectors dominate the Post-MPT Growth Allocation strategy.He elaborated on the strategy's ""black swan rule,"" which buffers against unexpected downturns and thereby improves potential returns, in the interview that follows.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017IBD: How does the iSectors Post-MPT Growth Allocation strategy achieve growth and avoid drawdowns?Sumnicht: The traditional approach is to achieve growth and avoid volatility (standard deviation). However, standard deviation assumes that both upside volatility and downside volatility are bad.Although it shouldn't need to be said, upside volatility (meaning, unexpected positive return) isn't considered a negative by investors. Investors just don't want to lose money; they only consider downside volatility (unexpected losses) a risk to avoid.We use a proprietary mathematical algorithm to determine an ""efficient frontier"" from which we select an optimally allocated (risk/return optimized) portfolio. Our approach allows us to set a threshold of acceptable downside, which we define as zero.In effect, we are looking for the best return each month, allocating among nine, low-correlated sector indexes, without going below zero, that is, without losing money.IBD: How does the strategy enhance traditional Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)?Sumnicht: Our iSectors Post-MPT Allocations maintain optimal portfolio allocations by re-optimizing the portfolio's asset allocation monthly as the investment environment changes.The strategy does not reject any of the principles of MPT, but instead it catapults MPT to a new level of effectiveness. Its success and reduced drawdowns (risk) can be attributed to:IBD: Which sectors does it currently own and why are they attractive?Sumnicht: We are currently allocated among six asset classes. The four largest allocations are utilities, financials, technology and energy.We don't choose how to allocate the portfolio based on our investment committee's subjective opinions, but more importantly, we use an objective mathematical process. Optimal allocations and monthly reoptimizations are based on changes to 15 different economic and capital market factors.I can speculate that these four sectors are currently attractive because of stated policies coming from President Trump. He has clearly stated his intention to significantly improve infrastructure in the U.S., which would help U.S. utility stocks and other infrastructure equities.Economic stimulus from personal and corporate tax cuts could give the Federal Reserve more latitude in raising interest rates, and a rising interest rate environment is positive for the financial sector.President Trump has consistently committed support to the energy industry, including coal, pipelines, storage, drilling and reduced regulation, which supports boosting energy sector investments.The current administration has also proposed a tax amnesty to allow offshore cash (reported to be in excess of $3 trillion) to repatriate at a 10% tax rate. A large percentage of these offshore dollars are from the technology industry. Lower corporate taxes in general, repatriated capital and a more favorable regulatory environment should mean an increase in tech company profits.IBD: What are the big allocation changes between 2016 and now?Sumnicht: One of the most prominent differences in the allocation between 2016 and now is our allocation to Treasury bonds.Last year we were up to about 50% in 20-year Treasury bonds. By January 2017, we had zero in Treasury bonds.I don't think the election had a lot to do with this change in asset allocation. However, the prospect of higher interest rates does not bode well for long-term bonds.IBD: What exactly is the ""black swan rule"" in your strategy?Sumnicht: Great question! We designed ""black swan"" event protection into the iSectors Post-MPT Allocations. Simple but effective, we limited the allocation to any one asset sector to 30%, except for government Treasuries, which can be up to 50%.Certainly, diversification among low-correlated asset classes protects the portfolio from having everything go down at the same time as in 2008. The other type of black swan event would be an event that might cause a significant drop just in one or two industries or market sectors. Our policy of allocating only 30% to any one market sector was put in place to protect from this type of black swan event.IBD: How did the strategy perform vs. its benchmark in 2016 and since its Feb. 1, 2005, inception?Sumnicht: Our iSectors Post-MPT Growth Allocation gained 10.39% in 2016 vs. 11.96% for the S&P 500 benchmark index.From inception, it is up an average annualized 9.26% vs. 7.76% for the S&P 500 index.IBD: How did the strategy perform in the financial crisis of 2008?Sumnicht: In 2008, iSectors Post-MPT Growth Allocation was down 16.0% vs. a 37% decline in the S&P 500 index.IBD: What is key to the strategy's potential for outperformance in the long run?Sumnicht: Historically, iSectors Post-MPT Growth Allocation tends to outperform the S&P 500 in the long run by not losing as much in down markets and performing better in relatively flat markets.IBD: Who is the target investor?Sumnicht: We have investors of virtually every type in iSectors Post-MPT Allocations. This includes individual, IRA, 401(k), trusts, nonprofit and others.I consider iSectors Post-MPT my core portfolio, but because of low correlation to stocks and to bonds, it also adds diversification and improves risk-adjusted returns to any stock and/or bond portfolio.This strategy reoptimizes the asset allocation monthly, which can cause the accounts to realize some capital gains each year. Therefore, all things being equal, if I had a choice to own this investment in a qualified or a nonqualified account, I may be marginally better off owning it in a qualified account.IBD: What are its assets under management, investment minimums and fees?Sumnicht: Currently, iSectors has a total of $220 million in assets under management (AUM). The iSectors Post-MPT Allocations' AUM is about $123 million.Account minimums are $25,000, although various TAMP (Turnkey Asset Management Program) platforms can require different minimums. Our fees for Post-MPT are 0.50% of AUM.IBD: How can one invest in the strategy?Sumnicht: Investors can access iSectors Post-MPT Growth Allocation through their financial advisor as a separately managed account, and 401(k) plans can access it through several TAMP partners including Mid-Atlantic, Matrix and others.In addition, individuals, advisors and retirement plans can access the strategy through our ETF, iSectors Post-MPT Growth (PMPT).(Editor's note: The asset size, expense ratio and liquidity of this ETF warrant the additional scrutiny to which new ETFs are subject.)IBD: What key criteria determine whether you will invest in an ETF?Sumnicht: These are the three key considerations:We constantly monitor our ETF selections.Our selection analysis assesses the existing ETFs vs. potential alternatives, including their expense ratios, bid-ask spreads, index-tracking error, asset base, trading volume (liquidity) and tax implications, as well as those issues mentioned above.RELATED:Growth ETF Strategy Taps Rally That Trump Has Ignited In 7 S&P Sectors

524,TAP,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said Tuesday that much of the bank's post-Brexit fate in the U.K. was up to the European Union, and he noted the risk that could come from central banks' moves to put the brakes on quantitative easing.The remarks, made at a conference in Paris, came ahead of the bank's second-quarter earnings, set to be reported on Friday. Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also report then.""We've never had QE like this before,"" Dimon said in video available on Bloomberg, referring to the quantitative easing — or central banks' purchases of government bonds and other securities in attempt to shore up markets after the financial crisis and recession a decade ago. ""We've never had unwinding like this before. Obviously, that should say something to you about the risk that might mean.""IBD'S TAKE: Weaker trading seems likely to hurt banks when their second-quarter earnings kick off, but one analyst cites a few big longer-term catalysts investors can look forward to.""I think the reversal of the actual monetary, you know, selling securities in the marketplace, I think when that happens of size or substance, it could be a little more disruptive than people think,"" Dimon added. ""Again if the economies are growing, it's not that big a deal. But again, it's never happened before.""The Federal Reserve has signaled that it will soon start paring its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, perhaps as soon as September, by letting maturing bonds run off instead of reinvesting the funds. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is hinting that it may start reducing bond buys soon.At the conference, Dimon also said that the bank needed to ""be prepared for hard Brexit"" — or a full, clean divorce between the United Kingdom and the EU. The U.K. voted to leave the bloc last year.But he said that was easy to plan for that. ""Several hundred jobs or hundreds of jobs"" would have to be done through an EU subsidiary, he said. Locations in Frankfurt, Dublin and Luxembourg could carry out most of the bank's operations, he said.He said there were 16,000 JPMorgan employees in the U.K., but that three quarters of them serviced EU companies. And he said what the bank's operations ultimately looked like in the wake of Brexit, after an initial round of relocations, would be up to the bloc's regulators.""What happens next is totally up to EU. It's not up to Britain."" he said. He added: ""If the EU determines over time that they want to start to move a lot more jobs out of London into the EU, they can simply dictate that.""JPMorgan, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, fell 0.4% to 92.83 in the stock market today, still within a 5% chase zone of an 89.23 double-bottom buy point. Bank of America (BAC) slid 1.2% to 24.60, as it makes its way through a flat base.Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 1.1% to 45.48.

But one PowerShares strategist wants to know about Apple's shareholder returns and iPhone 8 hints, and whether Facebook has cloned its way to being cool again with young adults.John Frank, equity product strategist at PowerShares, discussed the upcoming Apple and Facebook results in a phone interview with IBD.PowerShares QQQ (QQQ) ETF, tracking the Nasdaq-100 index, allocates 17% of its assets to Apple and Facebook combined.It has jumped 15% year to date through April, more than double the gains of the S&P 500 index.Apple, the largest member of the Dow Jones industrial average, has been near the top end of its guidance for the past few quarters — but may struggle to repeat that in its late Tuesday release, Frank said.A successful quarter would mean roughly $53 billion in revenue, gross margin of around 39% and combined iPhone unit sales of more than 50 million. But Frank points out this time of year is typically a weak season for Apple.""I think they are going to be just shy of that guidance,"" he added. He is more focused on any clues in Apple's report about what to expect for the second half of 2017, when a ""supercycle"" year for phone upgrades, marked by a 10th anniversary iPhone, could have a big impact on the stock.As far as guidance goes, he hopes for insight into increased component pricing, if any, through Apple's gross margin outlook.The other big thing Frank is looking out for is return of cash to investors.He wrote in a follow-up email: ""Apple's current quarterly dividend is 57 cents and has been raised 5 cents this same quarter for the past two years. Another 5 cents at today's level equates to a 9% increase. Increasing the stock buyback is another item they could pursue. Currently they have stated total buyback of $175 billion through June 2018 (and have completed around $150 billion). I could see them bumping that to $200 billion or greater.""Apple is turning into a powerful dividend stock for income investors. It is now a top dividend payer alongside Exxon Mobil (XOM), Microsoft (MSFT) and AT&T (T). Dividends and buybacks have been key to the Cupertino, Calif.-based company's popularity and rising share price.What if Apple disappoints? ""Short term volatility will be a great buying opportunity"" given the company's long-term growth prospects, in Frank's view.Apple shares jumped more than 2% on the stock market Monday to 146.58, hitting all-time and closing highs. Apple shares rose 0.6% to 147.46 in Tuesday afternoon trade.Frank expects social media giant Facebook to deliver strong ad revenue growth, but his expectations are tempered with the knowledge that growth has been slowing over the past few quarters.In his view, Facebook's qualitative comments around growth will be more important than the actual numbers.""Investors will be listening for higher ad pricing to act as a buffer against any slowdown in ad loads,"" Frank said.He also believes the introduction of Instagram Stories — Facebook's Snapchat clone — may help the company show enhanced user metrics. (Instagram Stories now has more users that Snapchat, a unit of recent IPO Snap (SNAP).) Attracting the under-25 age cohort has been a soft spot for Facebook but is seen as key to its growth going forward.""Facebook needs to show it can be creative and innovative"" in growing its appeal with the under-25 demographic, Frank said.Lastly, he is hoping that Facebook is more willing to talk about capital expenditures, specifically spending on its own video content and vision training.The latter refers in part to algorithms that can help Facebook mine data from videos on its social networking platform.Facebook reports Wednesday after the close. Shares climbed 1.5% on the stock market Monday to an all-time closing high of 152.46. Facebook fell 5 cents to 152.41 Tuesday afternoon.RELATED:These Are The Buy Points For Apple Before Earnings: Stock Still In Buy Range?Facebook Price Target Hiked On InstagramApple Stock Hits Record High With Q2 Earnings On TapQQQ ETF: The Best Large-Cap Growth Fund Or Tech Sector Star?

530,TAP,"Cash-rich Cisco Systems (CSCO) reports earnings for its fiscal Q2 ended Jan. 28 after the close Wednesday, after a stock breakout Tuesday and with analysts expecting management will comment on profit margins, revenue growth, M&A and shareholder returns amid the companies continuing shift to software and services from its core business of selling network switches and routers.Analysts estimate EPS of 56 cents, down a penny from the year-earlier period, on revenue of $11.55 billion, down 3%. Some of the sales decline stems from Cisco's sale of its set-top box business.Cisco, with its stock hitting a buy point Tuesday and trading at more than nine-year highs, continues to make acquisitions, including its January announcement that it would acquire software provider AppDynamics for $3.7 billion.For the current quarter, analysts estimate EPS of 58 cents, up a penny from last year's April quarter, and revenue of $11.85 billion, down less than 1%, for the No. 1 maker of networking gear.IBD'S TAKE: Weibo, Netflix, Tesla and Alibaba are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.""We think sentiment is largely tepid as investors anticipate muted top-line results with EPS numbers that may come down a tad due to the AppDynamics purchase,"" said Mitch Steves, an RBC Capital analyst, in a research report.A year ago, Cisco hiked its dividend by 24%. Cisco's dividend yield is higher than dividends offered by such companies as Intel (INTC) Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL).Cisco's market-share losses in network switching have accelerated, mainly to competition from Arista Networks (ANET). An earnings call topic could be whether Cisco plans to step up acquisitions in data center infrastructure or security. The latter now accounts for 5% of revenue.Cisco has about $69 billion of cash on its balance sheet, with just over $60 billion of that overseas. The Trump administration has proposed a one-time tax cut for the repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas, which could provide Cisco with more ammunition to make acquisitions or hike dividends.Cisco stock rose 1% to 32.30 in the stock market today, touching a buy point of 32.04 out of a 16-week flat base. Shares are at their highest point since November 2007.RELATED:Cisco Systems Requires 'Needle-Moving' M&A, Says AnalystHow Cisco's AppDynamics Buy Could Impact New Relic, Splunk, IBM, HPECould Microsoft Join Cisco In Hunt For Security Firms?

532,TAP,"A Republican-led FCC may give AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA), Verizon Communications (VZ) and other pay TV providers more tools to counter the threat from Google TV, Hulu and other nascent internet video services, says a Cowen & Co. analyst.Ajit Pai, named chairman of the Federal Communications Commission by President Trump in January, has signaled that he'll scale back net neutrality rules that bar internet service providers from throttling, blocking or prioritizing web traffic. Under the Obama administration, the FCC sought more authority under utility-type regulations.Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen & Co., says ""MVPDs"" a regulatory term for pay TV incumbents, could seek interconnection fees from YouTube TV or Hulu. Gallant warned that MVPDs like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon might tap other tools to counter the threat from internet video services, also called over-the-top, or OTT, services. Broadband caps on data usage are another possibility, Gallant says.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) on Tuesday announced YouTube TV, a $35 monthly paid subscription service. YouTube TV will offer access to all four major broadcast networks (CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox), and the cable channel offerings owned by their parent companies, such as sports channel ESPN.IBD'S TAKE: Quanta Services, Primerica and Nucor are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.Google aims to set itself apart with unlimited cloud storage for users to record content. Google will seek advertising revenue from YouTube TV, say analysts, who contend that $35 monthly fees might not be enough to make the service profitable.Hulu — a joint venture of Walt Disney (DIS), Fox-parent 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) and Comcast's NBCUniversal — is set to launch yet another live TV streaming service in the spring.""With the rising OTT threat and a newly Republican Washington, MVPDs may now have greater incentive and ability to employ tactics to manage the threat from OTT,"" Gallant said in a research report. ""Whether they take these steps — and whether it draws influential companies like Google, Facebook (FB), Walt Disney, Fox and others into the net neutrality debate — could be important for the longer-term balance of power within the internet ecosystem.""""We suspect the new FCC will be much more open to ISPs charging interconnection fees to high bandwidth services, mainly video providers,"" Gallant added.He says Google could respond by imposing a ""Cable Company X Tax"" on its subscribers.YouTube TV will compete with other internet video services, such as AT&T's DirecTV Now and Dish Network's (DISH) Sling. YouTube TV does not provide channels from Viacom (VIA), Time Warner's (TWX) Turner Broadcasting, Discovery (DISCA) , AMC Networks (AMCX) and Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI).Alphabet stock slipped a small fraction in the stock market today to 849.08 and is about flat since the YouTube streaming announcement.RELATED:$35 DirecTV Now Live Streaming Deals Lives On After Promotion EndsAT&T Streaming Foray Hits Snag; Did Apple Avoid Black Eye?Google Advertising Plans Key In YouTube TV Launch Vs.

533,TAP,"BlackRock announced Thursday that it has become the first U.S.-based asset manager to score a prized quota to invest in mainland China capital markets.The Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota of $1.6 billion (11 billion renminbi, or yuan) allows BlackRock Fund Advisors, a unit of BlackRock Inc. (BLK), to invest in China's onshore equity and fixed-income markets.Specifically, it could pave the way for some popular iShares ETFs to invest in coveted A-shares, or shares of mainland China companies listed in Shanghai or Shenzhen — two of the 10 largest stock markets in the world.That is, and isn't, a big deal for investors in exchange traded funds, two industry experts told IBD.The bellwether Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), with $49.63 billion in assets, already owns A-shares, as do several China-focused ETFs from BlackRock and other smaller providers.Vanguard and other asset managers typically access the onshore China A-shares market through international subsidiaries who have RQFII status already.""Lack of U.S.-company RQFII hasn't slowed the market down much at all,"" Dave Nadig, CEO of ETF.com, wrote in an email.However, several heavyweight emerging-market exchange traded funds — including iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) and iShares China Large-Cap (FXI) — don't own any A-shares.For exposure to China, these funds tap Chinese stocks listed overseas in Hong Kong (""H-shares"") and New York (""N-shares"") — such as Alibaba (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU). Foreign investment in China remains tightly controlled, although the country continues to open up its markets.Many mutual fund and ETF investors may be unaware they invest in a fraction of the total China stock market. Funds that lack access to mainland China end up shutting out thousands of stocks from one of the world's largest economies, said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer of KraneShares.With many ETFs already owning A-shares, the real implication of BlackRock's quota approval could lie elsewhere, in the indexing world, he suggested.""Why everyone should take notice is, is this an indication that potentially MSCI is going to add Shanghai and Shenzhen names to their indexes for the first time?"" Ahern said.Every June, index provider MSCI (MSCI) reconsiders how its benchmark indexes are constituted. This year, investors like Ahern are hoping that the long-awaited inclusion of mainland China shares in key MSCI EM indexes sees the light of day. In 2016, MSCI failed to give China A-shares the nod, citing accessibility issues in that market.An inclusion for A-shares will be a multistep process that could eventually grow China's current 27% allocation to 40% or more in the MSCI emerging-market benchmark.It would also compel active and passive managers to rejigger their portfolios to align them with that benchmark, driving up demand for A-shares.One ETF that would pop as a result is Ahern's KraneShares Bosera MSCI China A Share (KBA), which invests in China stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Another beneficiary could be iShares MSCI China A (CNYA), which debuted in June 2016.Emerging-market ETFs were down more than 1% in afternoon trade on the stock market today.RELATED:Leading Global Stocks

But geopolitical concerns will remain high for investors going into the new week, following a failed North Korea missile test in defiance of President Trump and global powers. Trump has sent warships to the region and has left open the possibility of military action. Vice President Mike Pence is visiting a U.S. military base in South Korea near the DMZ.

"
539,TAP," For all the obsession in Washington and in college faculty lounges over income inequality, why isn't there more outrage over government policies that exacerbate the problem?   There are hundreds of programs that make the poor, poorer and increase poverty in America. Many of them were exposed last week by my colleagues at the Heritage Foundation forum on this very topic.Economist  ‎Don Boudreaux of George Mason University unmasked two such policies.  One is trade protectionism. Trade barriers raise prices and ""act as a regressive tax"" on Americans, Boudreaux explains.   They also stunt the very innovation process that makes goods and services widely available to people at affordable prices to begin with.  Think about who the consumers are that shop for those everyday low prices at Walmart. It's not Hillary Clinton.Minimum wage clearly fits into this category as well. In every other industry, Boudreaux notes, when something is more expensive we buy less of it. Why do some economists think that isn't so when it comes to buying labor.Especially for the young and the lowest skilled, minimum wage becomes a toll that prevents many from entering the work force and gaining the skills that can make a low income or  middle class worker a high income worker. This is so obvious that one wonders why liberals keep championing the minimum wage cause.Marlo Lewis of the Competitive Enterprise Institute points out that the fuel economy standards promoted by the leftist environmentalists add thousands of dollars to the cost of a new car. He estimates that these ""green"" policies could mean that 5 million fewer Americans each year can't afford a new car. And, again, those 5 million victims are surely not people like AL Gore or the board members of the Sierra Club.Another green policy that hurts the poor is the anti-fracking crusade of the environmentalists. In my book with Kathleen Hartnett White, ""Fueling Freedom,"" we point out that the lower cost of electricity due to cheap shale natural gas has benefited low income households to the tune of well over $4 billion a year.This is four times the benefit of the low income home energy assistance program. So if liberals really care about the poor, why not get rid of LIHEAP and promote fracking instead?Social Security is the greatest swindle of the poor ever. A new study by Peter Ferrara for the Committee to Unleash Prosperity shows that the average poor person who works 40 hours a week during his or her working life would retire with a larger monthly benefit and would have $1 million or more in an estate that could be left to a spouse or children at death if they could simply put their payroll tax dollars into a personal 401k retirement account and tap into the power of compound interest.Under Social Security poor (and middle class) households leave next to nothing for their kids at death.   So Social Security robs nearly every low and middle income family with a full time worker of at least $1 million over their lifetime.  What a deal!Occupational licensing laws — in trades like moving companies, realtors, hair dressers, limousine services, beauticians, physical therapy and on and on — ‎stunt small business start ups, destroy jobs, and raise prices for lower income consumers. What about the right to make a living?Big government advocates defend these statist occupational barriers to entry by arguing that they are needed to uphold progessional service quality. Professor Boudreaux shows evidence that to the contrary, licensing requirements reduce service quality by shrinking competition in the industry.Arguably the program that has set back upward income mobility ‎for the poor the most is the government school system in inner cities. Every study finds abysmal educational outcomes and even unsafe environments for school children despite cities spending upward of $20,000 per child. In Catholic inner-city schools, these same kids could and should be receiving a better education at half the cost.Yet liberals who champion the poor oppose school choice programs that would raise educational achievement and future earnings.   (Look at the disgraceful treatment of Trump's education chief Betsy Devos).These examples merely scratch the surface of scores of governmental polices that are regressive. Could it be that the gridlock and polarization in Washington could be ended by a bipartisan reform movement to scout out and remove laws and rules that hurt those at the bottom of the income scale the most?One universal goal that we should all agree on and aspire to is equality of opportunity — which these laws squelch.Where are Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and Nancy Pelosi and the class warfare warriors on reversing government policies that are stealing money and opportunities for low income and minority families?  Do they care more about protecting the poor or big government? It's time to really find out.

540,TAP,"Lufthansa's low-cost carrier Eurowings could soon step up its long-haul service, while Malaysian budget carrier AirAsia hopes to tap the growing air travel market in Vietnam, marking the latest escalation in cheap-fare competition as Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) set their sights on both regions.The moves reflect the industry's race to the bottom for no-frills longer flights, as well as an expected travel boom in Asia. In October, the International Air Transport Association said the Asia-Pacific region was set to become ""the source of more than half the new passengers over the next 20 years.""Delta on Wednesday announced an agreement to form a joint venture with Korean Air, while American Airlines a day earlier said it would invest in China Southern Airlines (ZNH). The three U.S. network carriers could step up ""basic economy"" service on flights to Europe as well, although they also face uncertainty in the region as the U.K. begins its separation from the European Union.Lufthansa indicated at an event that Eurowings needed more Airbus (EADSY) A330s, and the German carrier also floated the idea that Eurowings could begin offering flights to Berlin, Hamburg and Dusseldorf, Bloomberg reported.Eurowings currently serves such U.S. cities as Miami, Las Vegas and Seattle.

American fell 0.5%, while United slid 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: For a closer look at how Delta, American and United might be affected by low-cost European carriers, read this story.And as the Trump administration tries to curb travel from the Middle East and Africa, Middle Eastern carriers are trying to find ways to circumvent the restrictions.Following the administration's ban on electronic devices bigger than a cellphone aboard flights from the Mideast and North Africa heading into the U.S., Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways said this week they will loan out laptops on such flights. Emirates said it might do the same.The IATA this week condemned the device ban by the U.S. and the U.K.""The current measures are not an acceptable long-term solution to whatever threat they are trying to mitigate,"" IATA CEO Alexandre de Juniac said in a statement. ""Even in the short term it is difficult to understand their effectiveness.""He added: ""Why don't the US and the UK have a common list of airports?

545,TAP,"Following Trump's Tuesday State of the Union address, it is worth re-evaluating his upset victory.Rather than an independent long-shot victory, Trump's replicated an existing Republican roadmap. That map was drawn in state legislatures, and now, thanks to Trump's election, proves a way to the White House. Rather than a national wave, Trump's 2016 victory was more a state one.Donald Trump won exactly 100 more Electoral Votes in 2016 than Mitt Romney's 206 in 2012. This dramatic jump has been attributed to many things.The left said Russian hacking, FBI interference, and populist racism were the reasons. The right said Clinton's dishonesty, Obama's policies, and the economy's languor were the reasons. And many simply credit Trump's victory to first-timer's luck, akin to a novice gambler drawing to an inside straight.What all missed is that Trump's surge in Electoral Votes was neither as amazing, nor unexpected, as it first appeared. Instead, it came where Republicans were already strong in state governments — especially state legislatures.According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Republicans have total control of 25 state governments. In these, Republicans hold all the governorships and outnumber Democrats 667 to 252 in state Senates and 1901 to 922 state Houses. These states also account for 255 Electoral Votes. Trump won all but one of these states — losing only New Hampshire — and 251 of their combined Electoral Votes.Only 270 Electoral Votes are needed to win the presidency. Needing just 19 more meant Trump was almost in the White House before he left the half of America's states Republicans already overwhelmingly control. To find the remaining 19 Electoral Votes, Trump did not have to look far.While Republicans do not control their governorships, they do control both bodies of eight other states' legislatures. Those states comprise 77 Electoral Votes. Trump won six of these eight — losing only Virginia and Minnesota — and 54 more votes.Without having to leave a Republican ""home,"" Trump had already won.Just how big an advantage existed for Trump below the surface of the national presidential map is shown by Clinton and Democrats' corresponding disadvantage. Democrats hold the governorship and majorities in both bodies of state legislatures in just seven states (though because of legislative coalitions, they actually control only five), which comprise just 114 Electoral Votes.Democrats hold majorities in both houses of the state legislature, but not the governorship, in another seven states, comprising an additional 69 Electoral Votes.  Clinton won all these 14 states, but only 183 Electoral Votes.Several factors prove state government control's importance in 2016.Party dominance at the state level is the overwhelming norm. There are 32 states where one party totally controls the state government and another 15 states where one party has the majority in both legislative bodies. Only Colorado, Connecticut, and Maine fall outside these two groups.Republicans overwhelmingly dominate in this one-party tilt at the state level. Republicans hold 33 (with 332 Electoral Votes) of these 47 states; Democrats hold just 14 (with 183 Electoral Votes). Only 23 Electoral Votes remain outside this group.Finally, where one-party control of the state government or legislature existed in 2016, it almost perfectly predicted that state's presidential vote. Such states went 44-3 according to their respective party.Looking at 2016 from this perspective, Trump did not so much create, as tap into what existed beneath the presidential campaign's surface. Trump's triumph was in believing it could be done and in finding a way to do it. Again, Trump's way was state-based.States are the governments most directly affecting Americans' daily lives. They develop policies to a great extent, but even where the federal government does, states often implement it.Americans therefore make very basic demands on their state governments that can be basically described as competent conservatism. Infrastructure must be maintained, tax dollars wisely spent, budgets annually balanced, and security protected. State voters' demands are inherently conservative.Rarely do state elections revolve around promises of big social spending — as presidential elections frequently do — because few states can run deficits and few voters accept additional taxes.The state parameters of competent, conservative management of a limited government fit well Republicans' policy and political profile. Republicans dominate at the state level because voters feel they are better able to competently manage the governments most affecting them.Trump's insight was not so much to nationalize a movement, but to broadly localize an election. Essentially he echoed in his campaign the demands Americans put on their state governments. And this message appealed in state after state where it already had.Except for one in Maine, all Trump's Electoral Votes came from states with Republican-controlled state governments or legislatures, and he won almost all such states missing only three — MN, NH, and VA.The prevailing view that Trump blazed his own trail to the White House is not entirely accurate. Trump's message perfectly fit the political map drawn by Republican domination of America's state governments. And that route led Trump to America's center-right majority and the White House.RELATED:Trump News & Tweets

549,TAP,"Diamondback Energy (FANG), Concho Resources (CXO), Continental Resources (CLR) and other U.S. exploration and production companies will report earnings this week, likely providing more information on capital spending, production outlooks and oilfield service costs.Senior Robert W. Baird oil and gas analyst Daniel Katzenberg said he expects some increases in production outlooks for the year and said any increases in output without a corresponding bump in capital spending would be major a confidence boost for investors.Liquids production from U.S. shale plays is expected to expand by 2.3 million barrels per day by 2022 at current prices, and could grow more if prices rise further, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency.The number of oil rigs in operation has swelled for 15 straight weeks, according to Baker Hughes data, suggesting continued U.S. production gains in the near future.Even oil majors like Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (CVX) have turned their investment focus to expanding their holdings in the Permian Basin while curtailing spending in other areas.But the IEA worries that U.S. production won't be enough to offset the decline in investment in conventional drilling as demand for crude grows.But questions remain about service costs. Katzenberg doesn't think cost inflation will be an issue for E&Ps until WTI crude hits $60 per barrel.He said the average estimate is for a 20% increase this year, but he's only forecasting a 10% increase as improvements in drilling will offset some of the cost increases.IBD'S TAKE: Q1 reports from U.S. E&P companies will shed some light on how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts given by service providers during the crude price bust.""However, given investor trepidation, updated cost commentary, and its impact on 2017 plans, remains the biggest risk to the group over the earnings period, in our opinion,"" Katzenberg  wrote in note dated April 20.Diamondback Energy, Devon Energy (DVN) and ConocoPhillips (COP) are scheduled to release first-quarter results Tuesday. Continental, Laredo Petroleum (LPI), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), and Concho Resources (CXO) are on tap for Wednesday. Parsley Energy (PE) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) will announce results Thursday.Analysts expect Parsley and Occidental to report profits, with revenue up 191.2% and 27.3% respectively.International oil majors BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) will also report this week.RELATED: Exxon, Chevron Signal Stalling Investment As Oil Prices Lose Momentum

550,TAP,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 indicated modest gains at Monday's open following strong market gains last week. Investors will get a key reading on the U.S. economy Monday, with earnings from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) on tap following Friday's selloff in chip stocks.Last week the Nasdaq composite rose 2.3%, its best showing since January, with the tech-heavy index hitting record highs. The S&P 500 index climbed 1.5% and the Dow Jones industrial average 1.9%, both close to all-time levels.Futures for the Dow industrials rose near 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.2%. In overseas trading Monday, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.6% while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.55%. Many major Asian and European markets were closed for the international labor day holiday.Advanced Micro Devices is one of a handful of earnings reports on Monday, ahead of Tuesday, when Apple (AAPL), Mastercard (MA), Papa John's (PZZA), a pair of fiber-optic plays and dozens more release quarterly earnings.AMD is expected to report a 4-cent per-share loss after Monday's market close, narrowing vs. a 12-cent loss a year earlier. Revenue should climb 18% to $984.38 million. For the full year, AMD is expected to turn an 8-cent profit vs. a 14-cent loss a year ago.IBD'S TAKE: All-time winning stocks tend to have Composite Ratings of 95 or more near the start of big price moves. Here are the five ""top 5%"" stocks with earnings due this week.AMD shares have been trying to get above their 50-day moving average, moving above that key support intraday on Thursday and Friday but turning back, falling 2.3% to 13.30 in Friday stock market trading.AMD is working on a double-bottom base. A double-bottom pattern is a ""W""-shaped consolidation in which the second leg of the W undercuts that first. As a result, AMD has a potential buy point at 14.85, jut above the center of the ""W.""AMD's chips are used for PC gaming graphics as well as new AI uses. Its results and guidance may offer clues for rival Nvidia (NVDA), which reports on May 9.AMD and Nvidia have similar-looking chart patterns at first glance. But there is a key difference. In Nvidia's case, the second leg of the ""W"" did not quite undercut the intraday low of the first leg. That means it did not shake out as many weak holders as AMD's true double-bottom. Thus, Nvidia's potential buy point for now is 121.02, just above the old high. Nvidia's stock has moved just above its 50-day line.AMD's report also will key for the chip sector, which has been a leading group but faltered at the end of last week. Intel (INTC), which just missed on sales late Thursday, fell 3.4%. But Apple chip supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and chip-gear maker KLA-Tencor (KLAC) sank 4.3% and 5.2% despite better-than-expected profits and sales.Skyworks dragged down other Apple iPhone chipmakers, including Qorvo (QRVO), which fell 4.3%. Qorvo technically fell back into buy range but the heavy-volume decline to just below the 50-day line raises concerns. Qorvo reports earnings Wednesday.For iPhone chipmakers generally, Apple earnings late Tuesday may be the big mover. Expect another quarter of slim profit and sales growth. Investors are betting on strong demand for the upcoming iPhone 8, and perhaps new buybacks and higher dividends from Apple's huge cash pile.The Institute for Supply Management will release its April manufacturing survey at 10 a.m. ET. Economists expect a slight dip to 56.5 from March's 57.2. However, the ISM index has topped the Econoday forecast for seven straight months. Even an in-line reading would be well above the neutral 50 level.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will wrap up its two-day policy meeting. Economists don't expect any change in policy, but the central bank's statement could offer clues about future meetings. The odds of a Fed rate hike by the June meeting are now at 63%.On Friday, the Labor Department will release its April employment report.RELATED:The Big Picture: This Key Tech Sector FaltersThis Is Why You Should Consider Amazon, Netflix, Alibaba For Your PortfolioWhich Companies Are Now Outperforming 95% Of All Stocks?Apple, Tesla, Facebook, Fed To Grab Spotlight: Investing Action Plan

Intraday, Tesla rose as high as 260, crossing a 258.56 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. Aside from the brief handle, Tesla had run up strongly since early December, as investors see the made-in-America electric vehicle maker doing well under President Trump's America First policy.Tesla early move came despite a late Monday analyst note saying that Tesla faces increasing competition in electric vehicles.RELATED:Will Tesla Get Run Over By China, GM, Ford, BMW In Electric Vehicles?Nvidia rose 1.6% to close at 119.13.

It's also a late-stage base after a huge run-up, making this breakout more likely to fail than an early-stage move.Nvidia's fundamentals still look great. The company is at the forefront of several booming markets, expanding from PC graphics chips to the AI and autonomous driving fields. Tesla is among Nvidia's auto customers.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Nvidia on Thursday to report Q4 earnings of 83 cents a share minus items, up 137% year over year, on sales of $2.1 billion, up 50%.RELATED:Nvidia Shakes Off Recent Sell-Off, Climbs To Record HighThe Chinese short-message social network jumped 4.7% to close at 53.24 after climbing as high as 53.69.

Alibaba (BABA) and JD (JD) are consolidating near buy points.The operator of Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC rose 0.3% to 66.49, just above a 66.36 buy point.

553,TAP,"Lumentum Holdings (LITE) late Tuesday reported non-GAAP fiscal Q2 earnings that beat views but revenue that missed expectations, and also gave mixed guidance, sending the shares of the optical communications parts maker down in after-hours trading Tuesday and premarket trading Wednesday.Milpitas, Calif.-based Lumentum said it earned 57 cents per share minus items in the three months ended Dec. 31, up  from 31 cents in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 21% to $265 million, the company said. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had modeled non-GAAP EPS of 51 cents on revenue of $265.5 million.In the current quarter, Lumentum forecast non-GAAP profit of 50 cents per share at the midpoint of its guidance range, above views, and revenue of $257.5 million at the midpoint vs. analyst consensus of 47 cents EPS ex items and $264.5 million revenue.Lumentum stock was down more than 3.5% in after-hours trading Tuesday, after posting its results, and was down 3% in premarket in the stock market today. In Tuesday's regular session, shares climbed 3.6% to 40.20.IBD'S TAKE:  Netflix, Glaukos and Broadcom are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.Lumentum stock hit an all-time high of 44.50 on Oct. 10. Lumentum stock has moved lower along with other stocks in IBD's Telecom-Fiber Optics group. It  ranks No. 172 out of 197 industry groups.Demand from China has been driving growth for the fiber-optics sector, but some analysts have questioned whether orders have eased from network gear makers Huawei and ZTE, at least for some suppliers.Lumentum's customers include Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Ciena (CIEN), which build optical systems for phone companies.Upgrades to 100-gigabit-per-second technology by telecom firms such as Verizon Communications (VZ) and internet companies building data centers has also boosted fiber-optic parts makers.Lumentum is the former communications and commercial optical business of JDS Uniphase, which restructured in August 2015.

554,TAP,"Stocks opened lower Wednesday in a session that revolved around quarterly reports.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 fell 0.2% while the Nasdaq composite gave up 0.3%, with the latter feeling pull from Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Akamai Technologies (AKAM).Biotech giant Gilead dropped 9%. Gilead reported not-as-bad-as-expected fourth-quarter revenue and earnings, but management's full-year revenue guidance was far below the consensus expectation. Gilead shares have been in steady decline since June 2015, as profits for its controversial hepatitis C drugs started to taper off.Akamai stumbled 11% following strong fourth-quarter results and Q1 guidance that appeared to be in line with expectations. The stock fell nearly 8% from a buy point of 69.36, which triggers a sell rule.A host of other notable names were also in motion early Wednesday as Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) dropped 3%, Time Warner (TWX) added 0.5% and Cognizant Technology (CTSH) leapt 4%.Myriad Genetics (MYGN) rocketed 12% at the open. The beaten-down biotech reported late Tuesday its fiscal second-quarter earnings declined less and revenue rose more than anticipated by analysts. Myriad shares ended Tuesday 67% below a November 2015 high.Coherent (COHR), a maker of laser-based chip manufacturing gear, spiked 13% at the open. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company reported after Tuesday's close its fiscal first-quarter results swept past analyst targets: earnings up 160% and revenue up 82%. The thinly traded stock is extended, and has been pounding out new highs since November.Microchip Technology (MCHP) lobbed a 6% advance at the open after a 78% earnings gain and a 60% rise in revenue stomped analysts' fiscal third-quarter targets. The IBD 50 stock is extended from a 66.91 flat base buy point.Walt Disney (DIS) edged up less than 2%. The entertainment giant reported mixed fiscal first-quarter results during Tuesday's after hour session, and Chief Executive Bob Iger reported no plans to leave ahead of his contract expiration in 2018.  Disney shares are in buy range above a 106.36 cup-with-handle buy point.Chip developer Inphi (IPHI) rose 1% after reporting fourth-quarter earnings and revenue growth of better than 50%, and guiding first-quarter growth to more than 70% — all well above analyst projections.

Investors will be looking for guidance on future results, and how these retail giants plan to respond to Amazon's gains and brick-and-mortar pains.Wal-Mart EPS likely fell 13% to $1.29 with revenue up 1.2% to $131.27 billion. Wal-Mart recently dropped its Amazon Prime membership rival and began offering free two-day shipping with minimum online orders of $35.

558,TAP,"U.S. shale production has been surging as companies like EOG Resources (EOG) and Diamondback Energy (FANG) take advantage of the recovery in prices, but is it enough to make up for weakness in conventional plays?With break-even prices in shale plays like the prolific Permian Basin dropping to just $40-$45 from over $60, producers are pouring money into oilfields again. On Thursday, U.S. crude futures settled down 1.3% at a one-month low of $48.97 a barrel.Liquids production from U.S. shale plays is expected to expand by 2.3 million barrels per day by 2022 at current prices, and could grow more if prices rise further, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency.Meanwhile, conventional resources sanctioned for development last year fell 30% to 4.7 billion barrels in 2016, and overall exploration spending will down for a third straight year to less than half 2014 levels, with offshore projects especially hit.Conventional oil accounts for the largest share of global oil production, at 69 million barrels per day out of the total 85 million barrels, and just 6.5 million barrels come from U.S. shale.That's left the IEA and other energy watchdogs worrying that the U.S. won't be enough to fulfill the world's growing need for crude.""Every new piece of evidence points to a two-speed oil market, with new activity at a historic low on the conventional side contrasted by remarkable growth in US shale production,"" said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement.

566,TAP,"The office, in lower Manhattan, has all the markings of a tech startup. There are high ceilings and a cool warehouse vibe, craft beer is on tap in the kitchen, and the place is buzzing with twentysomethings.But they aren't trying to make the next hit mobile app. The big idea here is to disrupt another ubiquitous product.""There were so many evolutions in technology, but underwear was stuck in, like, the early 1900s,'' said Tom Patterson, founder of Tommy John, which makes premium skivvies for men. ""It was a very sleepy category.""Tommy John is part of a growing drive by fledgling brands to get men to rethink underwear and pay more for it.It isn't easy. The $8 billion category has long been an afterthought. Many guys restocked only after ridicule from a significant other, or when disintegration could no longer be denied. Thanks to fellow upstarts such as Mack Weldon, guys are giving this everyday item more consideration.Skivvies ranging from $25 to $70 a pair now come with a list of features as long as those that once came with lawnmowers and television sets. They are ""game-changing products,"" with moisture control, cool zones, and stealth waistbands. They can be Swiss-made, breathable, anti-microbial, and anti-odor. Tommy John even reconfigured the front flap and developed a ""Quick Draw"" fly for easier access.All this has boosted spending. In the past three years, the average price for a pair of underwear in the U.S. has risen by a third, while prices for men's apparel overall have declined by about the same amount, according to research by Fung Global & Retail Technology and First Insight. Global sales are expected to increase from $8.4 billion in 2015 to $11 billion by 2020, according to Persistence Market Research.The disruption is a testament to the power of ""premiumization,"" a strategy that over the past decade has swept through many once-mundane categories.While many take it for granted, there was a time when grocery stores didn't have a dozen kinds of coffee. When the only consideration for buying ground beef was price, not what the cows ate. When a workout shirt was a cheap basic, far from the innovation story shoppers pay more for today. People never used to talk about how much they loved such things as water bottles and blenders.Now men's underwear, of all things, is being transformed.Premiumization is all about resetting expectations with additional choices and benefits. Under Armour (UAA) revolutionized workout gear with polyester shirts that made sweat evaporate better than cotton did. Starbucks (SBUX) became a behemoth by introducing a slew of new tastes and styles to America's coffee drinkers, whose choices had stopped at sugar, milk or cream.""Because this happened, it doesn't mean everything will be disrupted,"" said Adam Burgoon, a partner at investment fund KarpReilly, which owns a stake in Mack Weldon. The size of the market for such refashioned underwear remains to be seen, Burgoon said, because many guys are likely to balk at the price. ""But it means probably everything can be disrupted,"" he said.Men's underwear was especially ready for a change. Not only was it largely devoid of innovation, such industry leaders as Calvin Klein were mostly focused on winning over women, because they bought most of the underwear.It was primarily a fashion business with a buffet of patterns and colors. The marketing featured images like Calvin Klein's buff young Mark Walhberg up on billboards, and packaging showing expressionless youngsters with six-pack abs.Yet men were settling down later in life, and so doing more shopping on their own in the interim. Being single longer made them care more about their appearance, which has disrupted other categories, such as skin care and jeans. The underwear startups' marketing is more approachable. Some of it uses middle-aged models and pushes fun and honesty over sexy slickness.""I never really related to traditional underwear advertising,'' said Patterson, the Tommy John founder. ""It was too serious. It was weird. We just say it like it is. We're the first brand to have a no-wedgie guarantee. You're not supposed to talk about wedgies with underwear. The fact of the matter is that 100% of men get a wedgie at some point in their lives.""Patterson got the idea for Tommy John last decade, from a much different place than sexy. While wearing a suit as a medical-device salesman, he found his underwear was even more uncomfortable than usual. He set about to solve a problem, not to go wild with beefcake and polka dots.The early years were difficult. Direct selling on the web wasn't as viable, so he had to pitch department-store buyers, who were mostly women. Patterson's break came in 2009, when he won over Neiman Marcus by getting the woman who ran the underwear department to let her husband and male colleagues test his product.From there, the idea of selling men's underwear to men gained steam and has exploded in recent years. There's been a rush of startups, helped by lower barriers to entry. Sourcing from Asia has never been easier, and the internet has slashed marketing costs. That has allowed brands like Mack Weldon to sell only directly, through its website.Today, a majority of men's underwear is purchased by men, a reversal from a decade ago. Amid a dizzying number of choices, men are indulging: Tommy John and Mack Weldon each more than doubled sales last year.Young brands are also going beyond products and revamping how items are purchased. New York-based Basic Outfitters offers a ''create-a-drawer'' option that makes things really easy for guys by offering underwear, socks, undershirts, and joggers in one package for $60.""Men really are rethinking what they want,'' said Matthew Congdon, Mack Weldon's creative director and former top underwear designer for Calvin Klein. It used to be about ""an oversize logo or a slicker pattern or print,"" he said. ""Now it's about innovation, the fit, the fabric, and the waistband. Something that is for him.""

568,TAP,"Deep into a product transition that has kept analysts on edge, Tesla (TSLA) stock was down Thursday following the company's mixed fourth-quarter earnings report late Wednesday and the resignation of its CFO.Analyst reviews of Tesla's results were also mixed. RBC Capital Markets hiked its price target on the stock, but UBS maintained a sell rating.Tesla stock fell 6.4% to 255.99 in the stock market today, falling below its 258.51 buy point. The stock has taken a roundtrip from its breakout after rising this month to 287.39, touching its highest price since September 2014.Tesla reported a wider-than-expected loss of 69 cents a share. Analysts had expected a 42-cent loss. Revenue rose 88% to $2.28 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $2.2 billion.IBD'S TAKE: The automakers rank 70 in six-month stock performance out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. Tesla holds an IBD Composite Rating of 77, indicating that it has outperformed 77% of stocks in the past year based on a variety of IBD metrics. Also arriving fast is the era of self-driving trucks.RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak raised his price target on Tesla to 314 from 245, maintaining a sector-perform rating. Spak, in a research note, said he was ""gaining more confidence"" in the production ramp and profitability of the Model 3, ""which is the key factor for the stock.""Tesla said plans for its Model 3 sedan are on track to start limited vehicle production in July, and to steadily ramp up production to exceed 5,000 vehicles per week in the fourth quarter and 10,000 per week in 2018. Tesla predicts that it will deliver 47,000 to 50,000 Model S and Model X cars in the first half of this year. That's growth of 61% to 71% compared with the year-earlier period.Spak now expects Tesla to deliver 8,000 Model 3s this year, way up from his prior estimate of 2,000, with a more pronounced rise into 2018 and at a rate far steeper than the company has yet achieved.

569,TAP,"Stock indexes had trouble finding traction Wednesday afternoon, and the day's leaders were from laggard groups.The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each eased 0.1%, while the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average inched up 0.1%. The small cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.5%. Volume in the stock market today was lower on both major exchanges compared with the same time yesterday.With the Nasdaq posting gains of 0.4% to 0.6% in five of the past eight sessions, a day of caution was to be expected.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, mail order and auto replacement parts scored the biggest gains. However, both groups are market laggards. The top-rated groups were mostly down modestly.Homebuilders initially looked like they might pose a bullish exception. The group thrust 1.2% higher and then reversed to nearly break-even for the day.High-end homebuilder Toll Brothers (TOL) surprised the Street with stronger than expected results. Revenue came in about 2% higher than analysts expected. Earnings were 42 cents a share, or about 6 cents above the consensus number.Toll leapt to a 6% gain in heavy volume, clearing a shallow pattern.Meanwhile, existing-home sales in January scored a 10-year high, topping the Street's consensus expectation.But Toll's good news ultimately had little effect on the homebuilders.With only an hour left in the session, individual investors should watch how the indexes close. A sell-off in accelerating volume would be a bad sign. Either rebounding in strong volume or keeping the losses small in lighter volume would  be bullish.RELATED:Facebook Explodes To Record HighToll Bros.

(TOL) reported an unexpected earnings gain for its fiscal first quarter early Wednesday, breaking out past a buy point, but not giving much help to several other homebuilders near proper entry areas. Meanwhile, January existing-home sales soared to a 10-year high in January despite tight supply and higher interest rates.The builder of homes worth up to $2 million earned 42 cents a share, up 5% vs. a year earlier. Analysts expected a 10% EPS drop to 36 cents. Sales dipped less than 1% to $920.73 million, better than views for $902.49 million.Toll shares soared 6.1% to 33.93 on the stock market today, gapping above a 33.58 buy point and hitting a 52-week high. On Tuesday, Toll initiated a quarterly dividend of 8 cents a share. The stock rose 1.6% to 31.99 on Tuesday, rising above its 50-day moving average.Pulte Group (PHM), KB Home (KBH) and Lennar (LEN) also are consolidating close to buy points. Pulte rose 0.5% and Lennar 0.6%, but KB Home reversed to close down about 1%.A tight supply of existing homes is helping to support demand and prices for new homes.Existing-home sales rose 3.3% to annual rate of 5.69 million last month, the Commerce Department said, above views for 5.58 million. The median existing-home price rose 7.1% vs. a year earlier to $228,900. The supply of existing homes for sale retreated 7.1%.Solid job growth is boosting demand even as interest rates have risen somewhat from record lows in anticipation that President Trump's policies will boost economic growth and inflation, also spurring Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.Toll delivered 1,190 homes in its Q1, up 12% vs. a year earlier. But overall revenue fell because the average price sank 11.5% to $773,500.Orders rose 22% to 1,522 homes. Toll expects to sell 6,700-7,500 homes in the current fiscal year, vs. the old target of 6,500-7,500.At 2 p.m. ET, the Federal Reserve will release minutes from its Jan. 31-Feb. 1 policy meeting.

"
576,TAP,"The skies above the Atlantic Ocean appear to be the next front in the insurgency against higher airfares.Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) for years lorded over much of the trans-Atlantic market and have signaled they will mount a fierce defense. But even before President Trump's immigration restrictions last month threatened to hurt demand, the big three U.S. network carriers were facing a challenge in international travel.New fuel-efficient, narrow-body jets from the likes of Airbus (EADSY) have made it more feasible for other carriers to offer low-cost, long-haul flights. And Boeing (BA), which is scrambling to regain market share lost to Airbus in recent years, is developing similar aircraft, providing more options for expansionary carriers.All of this means competition will rise on the Atlantic, fares will sink, and the number of available flights will remain high — just as the industry rehabilitates from a cutthroat, two-year grab for airspace in the U.S.""It's still a very profitable entity for U.S. airlines, and I think it'll continue to be,"" Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said of the trans-Atlantic market. ""It'll probably just become less profitable.""The big three control about a third of the flights in the lucrative market, and DeNardi estimates Delta, American and United generate 10%-15% of their revenue from trans-Atlantic flights. But other airlines, especially European ones, could turn more toward the Atlantic as competition on the Continent from discounters and Gulf carriers chews up profits.Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) has floated the possibility of eventually flying across the Atlantic. Air France-KLM last year said it planned to launch a discount airline that could fly to the U.S. The parent company of British Airways could soon also offer low-cost flights to the U.S. All these airlines would join Lufthansa, which already operates the low-cost carrier Eurowings.They must contend with challengers like Norwegian Air Shuttle, which boasts $69 one-way fares from New York to London, and can fly you from New York to Oslo and back for $350 this month. Iceland's WOW Air offers a round-trip flight from Boston to Berlin for less than $400.Now even a U.S. airline, JetBlue (JBLU), is considering flights to Europe. It should decide later this year as it starts to take delivery of Airbus A321s.While low-cost operations get more difficult the farther planes have to fly, jets like the A321 are more fuel-efficient and have fewer seats to fill, allowing for tighter operations overall and easier access to more parts of the world.""JetBlue ... doesn't have to become a widebody operator to serve Europe,"" said Seth Kaplan, managing partner at Airline Weekly.A long-range variant of the A321 will fly up to 4,000 nautical miles, which Airbus calls the longest range of any single-aisle jetliner. With that kind of reach, it could serve cities like Philadelphia and Milan, which require longer distances than the typical New York-to-London route that spans about 3,500 nautical miles.""It is ideally suited to trans-Atlantic routes and enables airlines to tap into new long-haul markets that were not previously accessible with current single-aisle aircraft,"" Airbus says on its website.Meanwhile, Boeing plans a new midsize plane that can travel up to 5,000 nautical miles, industry officials told CNN last month.U.S. airlines aren't completely at odds with European carriers. They get a share of revenue from European counterparts via alliances like SkyTeam, Oneworld and Star Alliance as well as joint venture agreements.But analysts say U.S. carriers prefer that the big European airlines do well in Europe so that their partnerships stay healthy — and so their European peers don't try their luck over the Atlantic.In the new Battle of the Atlantic, the big three are taking a hard line.""We are sensitive to anyone that's a competitive threat issue for us, and we will be aggressive about competing with all of them,"" said United President Scott Kirby last month, responding to an analyst's question about partner Air Canada's plans to add trans-Atlantic capacity. He declined to talk specifically about the Canadian carrier.During its call with analysts in January, American's management acknowledged pressure from low-cost carriers in the market. The airline is shrinking trans-Atlantic capacity during Q1 but plans to increase it again in Q3, when summer travel makes flights more lucrative.""We don't intend to cede our position across the Atlantic to anybody,"" said Chief Marketing Officer Andrew Nocella.To compete with low-cost rivals, the big three U.S. airlines are banking on more cabin ""segmentation"" — or dividing up a plane's seats into more classes of service, from no-frills ""basic economy"" to higher-end offerings.Delta offers a basic economy class and has said it wants to make it available across its network by 2018. United and American will offer basic economy in the U.S. this year. It's unclear whether they will offer the service on international flights, but the three tend to match one another's competitive moves.American's Nocella suggested the airline's segmentation would indeed go international as it strategizes with joint venture partners like British Airways. He called it American's plan to compete.""So we feel bullish about that. It's definitely going to be a really tough competitive environment, particularly I think over the next year, year and a half as we see these capacity inflows,"" Nocella said. ""But our position is good. London Heathrow is the best hub in Europe, and we feel good about it.""If nothing else, segmentation and the availability of basic economy help the network carriers better adapt to the changing tastes of passengers. At the same time, the strategy potentially robs discount carriers of the very thing that makes them unique and turns passengers on to fares that include more amenities, analysts say.""The one-size-fits-all product never made a lot of sense,"" Kaplan said. ""It was a legacy of pre-deregulation, of pre-1978, when airlines couldn't control their pricing and could only compete on service, and they had to compete for who had the least bad meal.""With basic economy's affordability — at least on U.S. flights — come some predictable annoyances. Although they sit in the main cabin, like other economy travelers, passengers can't pick their own seats. They face other restrictions on refunds, upgrades and what bags they can bring aboard, and they aren't guaranteed a seat next to the passengers they're traveling with.Once they're in the seat, though, the in-flight experience is similar to anything else in the main cabin. Snacks, drinks, Wi-Fi, entertainment: all largely still there.For the airlines, basic economy's advantage lies in its flexibility, analysts say. It's a type of fare, not a type of physical seat separate from others in the cabin. Thus, carriers can adjust more easily to demand and competition, as opposed to creating their own low-cost airline.Meanwhile, the airline-within-an-airline model that European carriers are employing runs the risk of cannibalizing the parent airline and making labor costs difficult to manage.Segmentation isn't just for cost-conscious travelers. It gives carriers more ways to attract passengers to pricier fares that offer better convenience and comfort, such as options like United's Polaris and Delta's Premium Select, which offer more room to recline or lie-flat seats. Even with standard economy fares, passengers can get a complimentary glass of wine on international flights.Last month, Delta President Glen Hauenstein said on a conference call that the airline might have trouble retaining market share over the Atlantic as low-cost carriers proliferate. But he said the company will try to ""preserve and accelerate"" margins and compete through higher-end cabin offerings like Premium Select.""If you think of retailing, you go to the car dealership because they had an ad that said you could get the Mustang you wanted,"" said Bob Mann, a former airline executive and current president of the R.W. Mann & Co. consultancy. ""You get there, you decide, well, you don't really want the V-6, because you're kind of a V-8 guy.""Low-cost carriers have taken note. Even Norwegian has a premium cabin, and WOW just announced a more upscale ""Big Seats"" product.But the bigger airlines offer more flights, which gives them room to accommodate passengers if a flight gets canceled or a passenger's schedule changes, Mann says. Low-cost rivals sometimes only offer one flight a day or less to a given destination.Delta, American and United are also more well-known than the smaller low-cost carriers, so brand recognition is another advantage. Plus, on a long-haul flight, little amenities and comforts tend to matter more.""The same thing that people will tolerate for two hours won't necessarily do it for eight,"" Kaplan said.

581,TAP,"Facebook (FB) reported fourth-quarter earnings after the market close Wednesday that surpassed Wall Street expectations, sending the stock up in after-hours trading.Facebook reported revenue of $8.8 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $8.5 billion and rising 51% year over year.Earnings per share minus items soared 78% to $1.41 a share, beating the consensus estimate of $1.31. That 78%, though, actually marks a cooling from huge gains of 91% in Q3 and 94% in Q2.Facebook stock was up more than 2% in after-hours trading Wednesday, after the company released Q4 earnings. Shares rose 2.2% to 133.23 in the regular session, still in a buy zone from a breakout at 129.37 first touched last week.In the past three months, analysts have fretted over whether Facebook can defend against a slowdown in ad placements with new and enhanced products. The consensus seems to be it will, since Facebook has multiple avenues of growth that it has yet to tap or fully exploit.Mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 84% of total ad revenue, up from 80% in Q4 2015, the company said.Facebook reported daily active users of 1.23 billion, up 18%, and mobile daily active users of 1.15 billion on average, up 23%. Facebook has continued to grow users at a reasonably robust pace off a very large base.Facebook said Q4 ad revenue rose 53% to $8.63 billion, beating consensus of $8.38 billion.Facebook reported monthly active users of 1.86 billion, up 17%. It said two-thirds of Facebook's monthly active users visit Facebook every day.""Our business did well in 2016, but we have a lot of work ahead to help bring people together,"" Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the earnings release.Facebook had capital expenditures of $4.49 billion in 2016 and ended the year with $29.45 billion in cash and equivalents.RELATED:Facebook Still In Early Stages Of Growth Despite Massive SizeFacebook Stock Buyback May Signal Slower Growth As Company Matures

582,TAP,"Apple stock rose to its highest level in 18 months on Wednesday after the iPhone maker posted better-than-expected December quarter sales and earnings. At least nine Wall Street firms raised their price targets on the stock after Apple's fiscal first-quarter report.Apple stock scored price-target hikes from BMO Capital Markets, Canaccord Genuity, FBN Securities, Mizuho, Morgan Stanley, Pacific Crest Securities, RBC Capital Markets, UBS and Wells Fargo Securities.Apple shares rose 6.1% to 128.79 on the stock market today, rising as high as 130.49 intraday. That's the highest level for the stock since July 2015. Apple hit an all-time high of 134.54 in May 2015. Apple stock is now extended from a 118.12 buy point from a cup-with-handle chart pattern cleared on Jan. 9.""Apple delivered a very strong holiday quarter despite difficult foreign-exchange headwinds,"" Macquarie Research analyst Ben Schachter said in his research report. ""With strength across virtually all products and geographies, bears will have a tough time finding much to highlight. Most importantly for the stock, iPhone units exceeded expectations even without being able to meet demand for the iPhone 7 Plus.""IBD'S TAKE: Facebook and a pair of Apple iPhone chipmakers are among the notable tech earnings on tap Wednesday evening. Schachter rates Apple stock as outperform with a price target of 156.Apple's fiscal 2017 has been ""largely de-risked"" now that the company has delivered better-than-expected Q1 results and better-than-feared Q2 guidance, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a report.Sacconaghi reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of 140.""We believe that Q2 guidance may be conservative, given that it implies iPhone unit declines of about 27% sequentially … notably below normal seasonality,"" he said.He sees Apple benefiting from a large upgrade cycle around the iPhone 8 this fall.Apple's new goal of doubling its services business over the next four years will require the company to introduce new service offerings, Sacconaghi said. One possibility is Apple's long-rumored streaming video service.Apple's better-than-predicted iPhone sales in the December quarter likely got a boost from rival Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 recall and the bad publicity surrounding it, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang said in a report. He rates Apple stock as neutral with a price target of 102.The large and growing installed base of iPhone users bodes well for the iPhone 8 upgrade cycle as well as the continued growth of Apple's services business, Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley said in his research report. Walkley maintained his buy rating on Apple stock and upped his price target to 142 from 140.He estimates that Apple ended the December quarter with more than 570 million iPhone users. Walkley predicts the installed base will reach 635 million by the end of calendar 2017.RELATED:5 Takeaways From Apple's 'Outstanding' Q1 ReportQualcomm Lawsuit Was 'Last Resort,' Apple CEO Says
"
583,TAP,"Consumer electronics maker Apple (AAPL) surprised Wall Street late Tuesday with better-than-expected sales and earnings in the December quarter, fueled by record iPhone sales, sending its shares to 18-month highs.Apple CEO Tim Cook called the company's fiscal first-quarter results ""outstanding"" on a conference call with analysts. He said they could have been even better if Apple had built more units of the iPhone 7 Plus, MacBook Pro, iPad and Apple Watch during the quarter. The company was production-constrained on the iPhone 7 Plus and MacBook Pro, but misjudged holiday season demand for the iPad and Apple Watch.Apple's Q1 marked a return to growth for the Cupertino, Calif.-based company, which had seen declining sales and EPS in the preceding three quarters.Apple earned $3.36 a share, up 2% year over year, on sales of $78.35 billion, up 3%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Analysts were expecting $3.21 and $77.25 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock broke out of a cup-with-handle chart pattern on Jan. 9, clearing a buy point of 118.12. For more information on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.For the current quarter, Apple expects sales of $52.5 billion, up 4%, based on the midpoint of its traditionally conservative guidance. It did not give an EPS target. Wall Street had been modeling Apple to earn $2.08 a share, up 10%, on sales of $53.79 billion, up 7%, in the March quarter, its fiscal Q2.Apple stock jumped 6.2% to 128.87 on the stock market today, still in a buy zone from breakout in early January at 118.12.What follows are several key takeaways from Apple's Q1 report:Apple sold 78.3 million iPhones during the December quarter, up 5% year over year. The increase follows three straight quarters of declining iPhone sales.The average selling price for iPhones rose to $695 in the December quarter from $619 in the September quarter thanks to the success of the iPhone 7 Plus. That top-of-the-line model was supply-constrained throughout the quarter and did not reach supply-demand balance until January, Cook said.The iPhone 7 Plus features a dual-camera system for taking high-quality photos, especially portraits. IPhone sales accounted for 69.4% of Apple's total revenue in the quarter. Apple generated $54.4 billion in iPhone sales in fiscal Q1, up 5%.Apple's second-largest business in Q1 was its Mac computer unit, which generated $7.24 billion in sales, or 9.2% of revenue. Services came in third with $7.17 billion, or just under 9.2% of revenue.Services were Apple's fastest-growing business in Q1, with revenue up 18% year over year. The company's App Store was the biggest driver of growth, executives said.""Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year,"" Cook told analysts. ""Our goal is to double the size of our services business in the next four years.""Apple's services portfolio includes the App Store, iTunes, iCloud, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, among others. Apple manages over 150 million paid customer subscriptions through its services unit, including its own services and third-party services offered on its App Store, Cook said.Apple's App Store revenue grew 43% in Q1 vs. the comparable period a year earlier, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said.Cook described the company's foray into original video programming for its Apple Music service as a ""toe in the water."" The company will be learning from its experience in original content and seeing where it can go from there.""With our toe in the water, we're learning a lot about the original content business and thinking about ways that we could play at that,"" Cook said.Apple has long been rumored to be interested in offering a streaming video service, as competition for either pay-TV services or on-demand services like Netflix (NFLX). Apple sees its Apple TV set-top box as a platform for internet video services. Cook believes the media industry is beginning to see the traditional cable TV programming bundle break down.Cook spent some time on the analyst call to tout Apple's efforts in home automation.""We are leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10,"" Cook said. ""With Siri and a new Home app in iOS 10, everywhere you go, you can easily and securely control all of your home accessories with your iPhone, iPad, or your Apple Watch.""Four weeks ago, Amazon's (AMZN) Alexa voice control system dominated the CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas. Scores of device vendors announced plans to integrate Alexa into their products, so users can control them using spoken commands. Apple was a no-show at CES 2017.Perhaps feeling left out of the conversation, Cook pitched Apple's play in home automation with its HomeKit.""The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly, with many exciting solutions announced just this month, including video cameras, motion detectors, and sensors for doors, windows, and even water leaks,"" Cook said. ""Perhaps even more importantly, we are unmatched when it comes to securing your home with HomeKit-enabled door locks, garage doors, and alarm systems.""Cook discussed his own use of Apple home automation services.""I'm personally using HomeKit accessories and the Home app to integrate iOS into my home routine,"" Cook said. ""Now when I say good morning to Siri, my house lights come on and my coffee starts brewing. When I go to the living room to relax in the evening, I use Siri to adjust the lighting and turn on the fireplace. And when I leave the house, a simple tap on my iPhone turns the lights off, adjusts the thermostat down, and locks the doors.""When I return to my house in the evening, as I near my home, the house prepares itself for my arrival automatically by using a simple geofence. This level of home automation was unimaginable just a few years ago, and it's here today with iOS and HomeKit.""With the Apple Watch, AirPods wireless ear buds and Beats headphones, Apple is now a major player in the wearable device market, Cook said.""With AirPods off to a fantastic start, a strong full first year for Apple Watch, and Beats headphones offering a great wireless experience using the Apple-designed W1 chip, we now have a rich lineup of wearable products,"" Cook said. ""Their design, elegance, and ease of use make us very excited about the huge growth potential for wearables going forward.""Apple did not give sales figures for the recently launched AirPods and second-generation Apple Watch.RELATED:Apple Crushes Fiscal Q1 Estimates, Stock Jumps LateApple iPhone 8 To Get 3D-Sensing Tech For Augmented-Reality Apps

But Oclaro stock ended trading down 2.8% in the stock market today, closing at 9.68.NeoPhotonics, which is in IBD's Electronic-Parts industry group, has been a laggard.

NeoPhotoics stock plunged Dec. 19 after it lowered Q4 forecasts due to production woes. Worries over demand from China have also been an overhang on NeoPhotonics stock.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix, Dave & Buster's and Zions Bancorp are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.""While investors understandably remain concerned regarding the risk posed by China to NPTN and to most other optical component suppliers, our checks together with public datapoints reinforce our view that China should continue to drive strong growth for NeoPhotonics over the next 2-3 years,"" Cowen analyst Paul Silverstein wrote in a research report.He initiated coverage with a price target of 16.""NeoPhotonics should benefit from an ongoing strong and long 100G-plus optical upgrade cycle,"" Silverstein wrote. ""NeoPhotonics and most other optical component and module suppliers remain supply constrained. … A number of optical component suppliers have encountered and eventually overcome similar production ramp issues over the past couple of years, including most recently Applied Optoelectronics.""IBD's Telecom-Fiber Optics group ranks No. 70 out of 197 industry groups. Aside from Oclaro, Lumentum Holdings (LITE) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) have the highest CRs.Fiber optic stocks were big winners last year and just 13 weeks ago ranked No. 1, with some analysts proclaiming an ""optical supercycle"" amid heavy demand from telecoms, internet giants and China for 100-gigabit speeds.

587,TAP,"Shortly after Donald Trump was elected, leaders from Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and many others met the president-elect for a cordial tech summit.But that honeymoon is over after President Trump's executive order to temporarily close off the U.S. to refugees and people from seven largely Muslim nations in the Middle East and Africa.Since the order was signed Friday, the tech sector has been particularly vocal in its opposition to the ban compared with other areas of the business world. Apple, Facebook (FB), Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft (MSFT) are among the chorus of firms denouncing the order or expressing concern and support for their employees.Software development company GitHub is reportedly organizing a meeting Tuesday in which tech leaders will discuss filing a friend-of-the-court brief to back a lawsuit against Trump's order.The meeting, reported by Reuters, marks the latest attempt by the tech industry, which has turned to workers outside the U.S. to fill highly skilled positions, to hit back at the ban. The White House says the order is intended to strengthen national security against terrorism, not to target Muslims.But tensions between the White House and Silicon Valley appear likely to become more charged. Bloomberg reported that a draft executive order from the White House would change work-visa programs in an attempt to steer businesses toward American workers when making hires.GitHub has invited Google (whose parent company is Alphabet), Netflix (NFLX), Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce.com (CRM), Box (BOX) and others to attend, according to Reuters. It's not clear which tech firms will send representatives.Amazon and Expedia (EXPE), both based in the Seattle area, have already sent in filings expressing their support for the Washington state attorney general's suit against the ban, and the Council on American-Islamic Relations has filed its own suit, Reuters noted. What lawsuit the companies might get behind is not clear, Reuters said.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's executive order also suspends the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which could slow the visa-renewal process for frequent international travelers, some analysts say, potentially leaving airlines exposed. Apple closed down 0.2% in the stock market today but rose late after reporting strong quarterly earnings and sales, while Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon lost 0.5%, 0.4% and 0.9%, respectively.  Alphabet shares have tumbled below a buy point this week following last week's earnings miss.

589,TAP,"U.S. Steel (X) reported mixed fourth-quarter earnings and sales late Tuesday but signaled better things to come in 2017. Earlier, rival Nucor (NUE) also topped profit estimates, while reporting its biggest revenue gain since Q3 2014, but that failed to impress investors.U.S. Steel lost 61 cents per share, but excluding unfavorable adjustments of 88 cents, the company earned 27 cents. Earnings estimates were for 1 cent per share, an improvement on its 23-cent loss a year ago. Revenue, expected to rise 3.1% to $2.651 billion, came in at $2.650 billion.Management forecast earnings of $3.08 per share in 2017, assuming market conditions remain as they are. But the company expects conditions to improve, suggesting there could be upside. It's not clear if U.S. Steel's 2017 EPS outlook is comparable to analyst estimates of $1.86.""While we will benefit from improved market conditions, they continue to be volatile and we must remain focused on improving the things that we can control.""U.S. Steel shares were volatile in after-hours trading, jumping 5% then settling back to down fractionally. Shares slipped 0.9% to 32.71 in regular trading on the stock market today, continuing a modest downtrend since spiking to a two-year high in early December.Most steel stocks were lower. Nucor closed down 3.3% to 58.09, falling intraday to levels not seen since the stock broke out on Nov. 9, the day after the election. AK Steel (AKS), which sold off last week after reporting results and guidance, slipped 0.1%, while Steel Dynamics (STLD) sank 3.8%. Specialty steel firm Allegheny Technologies (ATI), which surged 31% on Jan. 24 on its own results, bucked the trend, rising 1.2%.Nucor reported earnings of 50 cents — or 43 cents after accounting changes, by Thomson Reuters calculations. The Wall Street consensus estimate was for 34 cents. Revenue rose 14.5% to $3.96 billion.Nucor management offered vague guidance, saying that things are improving, though perhaps not as fast as investors were hoping. Wall Street expects Q1 earnings of 82 cents per share on revenue, nearly double Q4 profit.Here's what Nucor said: ""Earnings in the first quarter of 2017 are expected to increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe full year 2017 profitability could significantly exceed the level achieved for 2016. Prices began to increase during the fourth quarter for our steel mills segment and we expect that trend to continue into the first quarter of 2017.""IBD'S TAKE: Faltering steel stocks suggest the Trump rally may be taking a breather, but the president's much-anticipated policies could still fall into place. Stay ready by always reading IBD Leaderboard. That's where IBD's best market writers are tracking the leading stocks, including infrastructure plays like copper miner Freeport McMoRan and Martin Marietta Materials, to spot buying opportunities for readers and sell signals to take profits.Nucor and U.S. Steel have been two leaders of President Trump's postelection rally. Domestic steel producers stand to benefit from Trump's policies in three main ways: An infrastructure push could rev up demand; corporate tax cuts would deliver greater after-tax earnings; and punitive tariffs against Chinese steel imports could firm up pricing.After both stocks hit multiyear highs on Dec. 8, they pulled back and, at least until Nucor broke through support on Tuesday, have mostly moved sideways as investors await for clearer signs that Trump will be able to deliver tax cuts and a major infrastructure package. The stocks closed below their 30-day averages on Monday, a technical signal that upside momentum has waned.Until there's greater clarity and optimism that much-anticipated policies will come to fruition, incoming results may drive stock performance.RELATED:Trump Triple play Stocks Nucor, U.S. Steel Earnings On TapAK, Allegheny Earnings Top, Steel Dynamics Meets; Steel Stocks Bend Both WaysSteel Stocks Erase Wednesday's Trump Trade Gains; Citi Says Upside Priced InNucor's Q4 Warning Bends Steel Stocks, But They Don't Break

590,TAP,"Channel checks and a look at other data prodded RBC Capital Markets to reiterate an outperform rating on Facebook (FB) stock ahead of the social networking leader's Q4 earnings slated for release after the market close Wednesday.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney has a price target of 170 on Facebook stock, which ended trading Monday down nearly 1% to 130.98 on the stock market today. Shares remain in a buy zone from breakout last week at a 129.37 buy point.Wall Street expects Facebook to report revenue of $8.5 billion, up 46% year over year and the second quarter in a row of revenue deceleration. Revenue growth in Q3 was 56%. The revenue slowdown is attributable mostly to a deliberate move by Facebook to cool the growth in advertising to avoid saturation. Analysts expect EPS to rise 66% to $1.31, also marking further cooling after huge gains of 91% in Q3 and 94% in Q2.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook is one of the four closely watched FANG stocks, along with Amazon, Netflix and Google's parent company, Alphabet. Internet stocks are expected to outperform the broader market in 2017.Mahaney said key items to focus on include user growth and engagement.Facebook has continued to grow users at a reasonably robust pace off a very large base, with Q3 growth accelerating 16% year over year to 1.79 billion registered on Facebook. User engagement was also at record highs of 66% globally, as measured by the daily average users and monthly average users metrics.Mahaney expects user growth of 16% to 1.81 billion, with engagement staying level at 66%.Another focus will be on advertising revenue growth. During its Q3 conference call, Facebook warned that the growth pace of advertising dollars would slow, due to ad saturation. Facebook saw ad revenue growth of 59% in Q3, and it faces a tough comparison to Q4 a year ago. Mahaney expects Facebook ad growth of 48%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates.In the past three months, analysts have fretted over whether Facebook can defend against a slowdown in ad placements with new and enhanced products. The consensus seems to be it will, since Facebook has multiple avenues of growth it has yet to tap or fully exploit.RELATED:Facebook Still In Early Stages Of Growth Despite Massive SizeFacebook Stock Buyback May Signal Slower Growth As Company Matures

The one standout has been Allegheny Technologies (ATI), which vaulted out of a 10-month trading range on January 24 after beating views.IBD'S TAKE: Check out where Nucor and U.S. Steel rank against other steel makers based on earnings, relative stock price strength, and see which company leads the pack with IBD's highest composite rating.On Jan. 18, steel stocks rebounded from 50-day lines after Trump's Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross signaled he would support additional tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum. But those gains quickly reversed. Steel stocks have had several sharp moves above and below the 50-day line, but most are tracking below that key level.Nucor slipped 1.5% to close at 60.10 on the stock market today. U.S. Steel lost 2.3% to finish at 33.Arconic results, stripped of Alcoa operations, are expected to show a profit of 13 cents a share in Q4, up 8%, on revenue of $3 billion, down 43%. Arconic retains a 20% stake in Alcoa and has seen the value of that holding surge as shares of Alcoa have surged on hopes for Trump stimulus, tax cuts and protection from Chinese imports.Several major investors are pushing to oust Arconic CEO Klaus Kleinfield, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, less than three months after the Alcoa split.Arconic shares fell 0.4% to close at 22.50. Alcoa was off 0.3% to 36.55.RELATED:AK, Allegheny Earnings Top, Steel Dynamics Meets; Steel Stocks Bend Both Ways Steel Stocks Trigger Buy Points As Wilbur Ross Signals China Tariffs

596,TAP,"With their one child finished with college and hard at work on a job, Rich and Linda Wright of Kingsport, Tenn., are hurtling toward their next big goal, retirement. He's a market research analyst, trying to rebound from a layoff. Linda is a middle-school guidance counselor, whose school days are slated to end next June.Just shy of his 64th birthday, Rich increasingly wonders how they will squeeze income from their portfolios, without risking a lot of volatility, for decades to come. He's wary of bonds' likely price erosion amid rising interest rates. One thing he is bullish about is the prospect that his online brokerage, Charles Schwab (SCHW), will help him solve this puzzle. ""My parents lived into their nineties, so that's my general life expectancy,"" Wright said. ""I know Schwab has some tools I can use.""Whether it's for retirement — like the Wrights — or other goals, investment and retirement planning tools are increasingly on the minds of Americans. Those tools were rated by investors as one of the 13 most important traits that an online brokerage can have in the 2017 edition of IBD's annual ranking of the Best Online Brokers.And they were two of the most important traits for clients of Fidelity, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade — the three top-ranked brokerages in the category.Investor's Business Daily and its polling partner, TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, survey thousands of investors each year to find out which online broker characteristics are most important to them and how well their own broker performs in each important performance area. The investors' ratings determine the Best Online Brokers in Overall Customer Experience and in each performance category. (See the full broker survey details.)Investment and retirement planning tools qualified as a critical category for the first time this year.Fidelity, Schwab and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) were the top three brokers in the category. The tools include online interactive retirement calculators, which can tell you things like whether you're on track to save enough to generate the income you'll need. You can also find a wide variety of tools to help you make long-term strategic decisions — figuring out how to get your finances from where they are today to where you want them to be for retirement or other key goals. Those differ from tactical one-time-only decisions about, say, which securities to buy or sell today.Strategic decisions include figuring out whether to roll over your 401(k) account balance into an IRA. TD Ameritrade has an interactive tool for that.Other brokers offer tools that can knit together several related strategic decisions.Fidelity's Planning & Guidance Center (P&GC) combines several tools into one package. One, called Retirement Preparedness Measurement, gives you a score that indicates whether you are on track to save enough. If you are falling short, the tool package suggests ways to bridge the gap. For example, it will point out if you are not kicking in enough to your 401(k) account to get the maximum company match. Or it might suggest changing your asset mix to boost your weighting in growth-oriented stocks and stock funds.The package can even point out a timetable for maximizing your Social Security benefits, whether you are already receiving a check or have not filed a claim yet.Now offered to Fidelity customers, in the next few months the online brokerage plans to debut a version with fewer bells and whistles for non-customers.For Fidelity customers, the tool draws on data about assets in the Boston-based firm's care. You can enter information about assets that are in some other firm's custody, or you can give Fidelity permission to look inside those other accounts, without being able to touch the assets.Another Fidelity tool, Guided Portfolio Summary (GPS), analyzes your portfolio and tells you how you're allocated among sectors, geographies and asset types, and how your weightings compare to various benchmarks. And GPS and P&GC can ""talk"" with each other, sharing information. ""If a customer sets a retirement goal in Planning & Guidance Center, they can run a GPS analysis for that goal,"" said Jason Jagatic, vice president for product development, in the business group that oversees Fidelity's retail and defined contribution customers.Senior Vice President Matt Borden, to whom Jagatic reports, said, ""Our aim is to help people understand where they stand and then plan to look ahead, create an investment plan that works for their situation and implement it for their situation so they can achieve their goals and get a better outcome than they probably would without these tools.""Schwab offers a tool it calls Bubble Chart. It shows market performance of securities in your retirement or other account with images more than with words and numbers. The securities in your account are displayed on a grid. Each security is represented by a bubble.The size of each bubble signals its dollar value. The color of a bubble — green or red — tells you whether it has gained or lost value in the time period displayed. Each bubble's height shows its percentage change in value. The taller a bubble is, the more its value has changed.And each bubble's location on the grid signals its impact on your account. The further to the left it is, the less its impact is. The further to the right, the more its impact is. You can click or tap on each bubble to see additional data about the position.""We're in a visual world,"" said Eliel Johnson, Schwab vice president of user experience and design. ""It's a great way of conveying a lot of information in a small space. In other tools, it also helps you interact with the data — make changes to your account, change your contributions, and so on.""Said Fidelity's Borden, ""We want to think about tools that bring together your different financial planning tasks. We want to give you a holistic view of your situation and of ways of reaching your goals.""RELATED:Are You Saving Enough To Retire?

600,TAP,"Over the past three months or so analysts have fretted over whether Facebook (FB) can defend against a slowdown in ad placements with new and enhanced products.The consensus seems to be they will, since Facebook has multiple avenues of growth it has yet to tap or fully exploit. Those efforts will come into focus when Facebook reports fourth-quarter earnings after the market close Wednesday.Facebook first raised the issue of slower ad growth during its Q3 earnings conference call. Over the past few years Facebook has averaged about 50% growth in ad revenue, which accounts for about 97% of total company revenue. On the Q3 call in early November, CFO David Wehner said ad revenue growth rates will ""come down meaningfully,"" as would the revenue growth rate in Q4 and 2017.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook is one of the four closely watched FANG stocks, along with Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet. Internet stocks are expected to outperform the broader market in 2017.""As you get to mid-2017, we expect ad load will be a less significant contributing factor,"" Wehner said at the time. ""As we slow ad load growth, we're going to have a slowing in revenue as well. That's our expectation, but obviously we're going to continue to work hard to innovate in the ad product space.""Among those who say Facebook's growth outlook remains solid is Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves, who issued a research note late Wednesday that reiterated an overweight rating on the social networking giant and price target of 150.Facebook stock was up 1% to 132.78 in the stock market today, closing in on its all-time high of 133.50 touched Oct. 25. Shares remained in a buy zone from a Tuesday breakout at 129.37.While Hargreaves expects Facebook to once again highlight slowing ad growth and foreign currency exchange rates as headwinds to 2017 revenue growth, he says that can be offset by growth in users, ad pricing and video engagement. The slowing ad growth is intentional, in part to avoid saturation.""Due to Facebook's early strength in video, massive audience, Instagram and other ancillary opportunities yet to be monetized, we see the stock reaching our $150 price target and remain buyers,"" Hargreaves wrote. ""We expect solid Q4 results and believe the likelihood for cautious commentary on ad load and conservative expense guidance are captured in current expectations.""The consensus estimate is for Facebook to report revenue of $8.5 billion, up 46% year over year and the second quarter in a row of revenue deceleration. Revenue growth in Q3 was 56%.Among the FANG stocks, Hargreaves also issued a buy rating on Alphabet (GOOGL). Hargreaves in a research note that Alphabet's current valuation underestimates the sustainability of growth in internet search and opportunities to extend YouTube. Hargreaves gave Alphabet an overweight rating and price target of 1,030.Alphabet reports earnings after the market close Thursday.

603,TAP,"President Donald Trump plans to unveil actions on national security starting Wednesday that are expected to include steps toward building a wall on the Mexican border and limiting refugee inflows to the U.S., moving to fulfill key promises he made during his election campaign.""Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall!"" the president wrote Tuesday night in a message on his personal Twitter feed.The announcement on the border wall is expected during a Wednesday afternoon visit by the president to the Department of Homeland Security, the federal agency that has primary jurisdiction over securing the border and would carry out most of the other immigration-related steps that Trump talked about in his run for office.The Mexican peso reversed early gains to drop to a session low against the U.S. dollar after news of Trump's plan emerged.One of the hallmarks of Trump's presidential run was his pledge to build an impenetrable wall between the U.S. and Mexico to keep out the people ""taking our jobs"" and to immediately round up and deport ""criminal aliens.""He repeatedly said he will make the Mexican government pay for the wall, but may tap existing appropriations for border security at DHS to get construction started. Mexico's government has rejected the notion that they will ever pay for the wall.""I don't think Mexico is going to appropriate dollars from their Congress to pay for this,"" Representative Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, said at an event hosted by Bloomberg Government Wednesday morning.Higher visa fees for citizens of Mexico and Central American countries could help offset the cost, he said. He pegged the price of the wall at $10 billion to $20 billion and said his committee would have to authorize the project.The border wall — and who will pay for it — is already drawing the ire of Democrats.""The bottom line here is this is another divisive policy and it's another polarizing policy,"" Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said in an interview with CNN Wednesday. ""I think the American people are going to be able to see through this.""Trump's tweet presaged what's expected to be broader moves in the coming days to curb immigration that would include limits on government programs to settle refugees in the U.S. The Trump administration is considering a 120-day suspension on refugee admissions and a reduction in the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. this fiscal year to 50,000 from 110,000, according to a person familiar with the plan.During his campaign, Trump warned that the U.S. risked allowing extremists to slip into the country as part of the refugee program, pointing to terrorist attacks such as the killing of a French priest and a bombing at a German music festival, as evidence of the danger posed by refugees. He's said Germany's admission of hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing the Syrian conflict was a ""disaster.""Trump once proposed a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration to the U.S. After drawing bipartisan criticism, he subsequently proposed blocking immigration from countries with a ""proven history"" of terrorism. Other than Syria, he hadn't specified what countries would meet that definition during his campaign.""We're letting people come in from terrorist nations that shouldn't be allowed,"" Trump said at a campaign rally in September. ""This could be the great Trojan horse of all time.""Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. focused its refugee admissions on individuals with existing links to America, as well as women and children facing persecution or in desperate need of medical care. The screening process averages 12 to 18 months and includes biometric data and reviews by multiple law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

Look at yourself and be brutally honest about your weaknesses as well as strengths, says Laurie Sudbrink, owner of Unlimited Coaching Solutions, a leadership development firm based in Rochester, N.Y., and Sarasota, Fla.""If somebody knows themselves in that way, then they're living by integrity and doing what they say,"" she said.Open up. Be transparent, especially when you make mistakes. Sudbrink worked with one leader who struggled to get his team to have tough conversations with each other. He told them he had problems with that too. He overcame them by telling himself he was helping someone find a solution through those difficult conversations.""You show vulnerability, and that's when people respect us,"" said Sudbrink, who wrote ""Leading With GRIT.""Set the bar. Give others focus and clarity about what you're trying to accomplish. Show them what success looks like. Then they'll know what the goal is and trust you to help them reach it.""Be clear about expectations,"" Lynch said. ""If you assume, you're treading on dangerous territory.""Look inside. Instead of looking to blame others, consider what you could do differently to get better results. You could schedule a longer meeting time or set expectations more clearly.""There's so much you can't control, but what you can control is your own actions,"" Lynch said.Pay attention. Listen to what your people suggest, acknowledge you heard it and let them know if the suggestion will be implemented or not.""Listening is about being able to really be in the moment,"" Sudbrink said. ""But you lose credibility fast if there's no follow-up.""Get others involved. Urge employees to make sure they hold each other's feet to the fire. If Joe doesn't get his report in on time, it's powerful if Lisa, who needs that report to finish her project, goes straight to Joe rather than to the boss.""When everybody does that, that's how you can infiltrate that into the culture,"" Sudbrink said.Correct problems. Take action if standards aren't being met. You've been clear about expectations, so address it if your team falls short. That often simply means talking about the problems and what can be done so they don't happen again.""Build a culture where people can talk candidly,"" Lynch said. ""Hold people accountable. And accountability can be good, if the project is a success. What you do when your team doesn't meet expectations can go a long way toward getting people to achieve at the highest level.""MORE ABOUT LEADERSHIP:New Leadership Role?

606,TAP,"Clients have clear priorities when it comes to reasons why they use a financial advisor. Not surprisingly, making money and protecting principal top their wish lists.The No. 1 reason cited by clients is for help in improving investment performance. Clients know their own limits. They know that you know more about how to pick investments, how to decide when to sell a security, how to form a portfolio game plan and how to keep the portfolio in line with that plan.When surveyed by Finra's Investor Education Foundation, 81% of clients said the reason they use an advisor is to improve their portfolio's investment performance. That was the most commonly cited reason.The next most commonly cited reason was for help avoiding losses. That was named by 78% of clients.And 63% of clients said they use an advisor to learn about investment opportunities.Clients are hard-nosed and practical about the value you bring to them. Fifty-three percent said the reason they use an advisor is to gain access to investments they could not otherwise tap into. That can include opportunities like investing in private equity or alternative assets such as timberland and farms, which are not available on public exchanges.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for income-oriented investments that are less exotic than alts? To learn about a top income investor's insights into such sources of income as convertible bonds, preferred stock and high-yield stock — and mutual funds that invest in them — read this IBD question-and-answer interview with Fidelity Investments' Joanna Bewick.Your skills overseeing a portfolio are not the only things that lure clients. Your credentials do too.Fifty-eight percent of clients says that an advisor's professional designations and certificates are very important.But few clients feel compelled to act on that belief. Less than a quarter of all clients — 23% — have checked an advisor's background with a regulatory authority.Even among just those clients who say credentials are very important, only 28% have checked an advisor's background with a regulator.Among clients who says credentials are not very important, just 17% have looked into an advisor with a regulator.Those findings suggest that financial advisors do not face a lot of skepticism from clients, and that clients generally trust financial advisors.Another aspect of the survey also suggests that many clients are not worried about advisors' having conflicts of interest between how they are paid and investment products they sell. ""(Fewer) than half (of clients) are worried that various incentives and commission structures would present a conflict of interest,"" Finra's report says.The new Department of Labor (DOL) fiduciary rule was created to minimize conflicts of interest by brokers and financial advisors dealing with clients' retirement accounts.The portion of the Finra survey dealing with clients addressed people who have nonretirement accounts. They may also have retirement accounts.Finra is the largest self-regulatory organization in the securities industry in the United States. It makes and enforces rules for its members based on federal securities laws.

608,TAP,"Boeing (BA) emphasized the importance of trade with China for aerospace industry jobs in the U.S. as President Donald Trump pushes for more protectionist policies.CEO Dennis Muilenburg said on a conference call Wednesday that a ""healthy trade relationship between the U.S. and China is still important.""China is emerging as a key aerospace market as the country's rising middle class boosts demand for travel. In September, Boeing estimated China would need 6,810 airplanes, valued at $1 trillion, over the next 20 years.To stay competitive Muilenburg said the planned 737 completion plant in Zhoushan is ""an important part of the partnership equation.""""That finishing center is a location where we can add value in China, but every airplane that goes there is built in the U.S.,"" he said. ""It's a great example of how growth in China creates growth in U.S. manufacturing jobs.""Muilenburg was bullish on Trump's focus on the American workforce and tax reforms and regulations for the aerospace sector, but Citron Research warned earlier this month that Trump is a big threat to the industry as he looks to lower military aircraft costs.But strong Q4 results sent Boeing shares up 4.2% to 167.36, hitting record highs on the stock market today, continuing to break out after just clearing a 160.17 buy point on Monday. European rival Airbus (EADSY) fell 0.8%.Adjusted Q4 earnings jumped 54% to $2.47 a share, marking its fastest growth in more than three years, as revenue dipped 1% to $23.29 billion, better than forecasts for $23.19 billion.Commercial aircraft revenue rose 1% to $16.24 billion, as Q4 deliveries edged up 1.6% to 185. Defense, space and security revenue fell 12% to $6.86 billion. Total backlog was $473 billion at the end of Q4, up from $462 billion at the beginning of Q4.Full-year 2017 EPS of $9.10-$9.30, below Wall Street views for $9.31, on revenue of $90.5 billion-$92.5 billion, below consensus views for $93.09 billion. Operating cash flow is seen increasing to $10.75 billion next year from $10.5 billion in 2016, as the 787 program has finally turned cash-flow positive, boosting prospects for more stock buybacks and dividend hikes.Boeing's commercial division has been pressured by Airbus in recent years and its hot-selling A321neo. Boeing plans to roll out a stretched version of the latest 737 Max to hold on to market share before launching a new fell 0.6%.Boeing's 737 Max 10X plane will carry 190-230 people and could launch in 2020, according to reports earlier this month. Management said in October that the new midsize plane could be delivered by 2024-2025.On the defense side, Boeing had come under fire from Trump over the high costs of its Air Force One replacement program. But Muilenburg met with Trump and said the company could build a new Air Force One for under $4 billion.But Trump also tweeted last month that he asked Boeing to price out a F/A-18 Super Hornet ""comparable"" to the F-35. But Pentagon officials said they need the new Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 for stealth and other fifth-generation capabilities that the Super Hornet lacks.Shares of Lockheed, which reported Q4 results above analyst views on Tuesday but gave weak 2017 EPS guidance, dipped 1.1% Wednesday.Also Wednesday, Textron (TXT) said Q4 earnings fell 3.7% to 78 cents per share, falling short of views 87 cents. Revenue was down 2.5% to $3.83 billion, under views for $3.9 billion. Textron also said it agreed to buy Arctic Cat (ACAT) for $247 million, or $18.50 per Arctic Cat share, a 41% premium on Tuesday's closing price. The deal also includes an unspecified amount of debt.  Arctic Cat will keep its brand and become part of Textron's specialized vehicles business.

609,TAP,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) expects a surge in F-35 deliveries this year but gave weak earnings guidance as the defense giant comes under intense pressure from the White House to cut costs on the massive program.The Pentagon's top contractor expects to deliver 66 of the stealth jets in 2017, up 43% from the 46 delivered last year, though that fell short of its goal for 53.But Lockheed sees 2017 EPS of $12.25-$12.55, below consensus views for $12.87, on revenue of $49.4 billion-$50.6 billion, with the midpoint above the Wall Street estimate of $49.59 billion.The $400 billion F-35 program is becoming an increasing critical part of Lockheed's business as production, and deliveries, ramp up. In 2015, the company delivered 45, up from 36 in 2014.Lockheed shares closed down 1.8% at 252.91 on the stock market today, halving earlier losses. United Technologies (UTX), which makes the F-35's engines, rose 1.15%, and Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major F-35 subcontractor, added 0.4%.IBD'S TAKE: President Donald Trump is seen as risky for the aerospace industry as Hillary Clinton was to drug manufacturers, according to a report from Citron Research.In Q4, Lockheed's aeronautics revenue, which includes F-35 sales, jumped 23% to $5.41 billion. That helped lift total Q4 sales 19% to $13.75 billion, better than views for $13.03 billion.Missiles and fire control revenue fell 10.8% to $1.76 billion. Rotary and mission systems revenue jumped 36.8% to $3.81 billion, helped by the Sikorsky acquisition. Space systems revenue climbed 16.7% to $2.78 billion.Adjusted EPS climbed 24% to $3.25, easily topping forecasts for $3.05.President Donald Trump has complained about the $400 billion F-35 program's costs and suggested it could face competition from Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet.But earlier this month Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson assured Trump that an upcoming contract for the next batch of F-35 fighters will create 1,800 jobs in Texas and thousands more across U.S. suppliers.Lockheed said it was near a deal for 90 additional F-35s that will ""significantly"" reduce the cost of the fighter.Hewson, along with other manufacturing company executives, met Monday with Trump, who vowed to slash income taxes and regulations and said companies that send operations aboard will get slapped with a border tax on items coming back to the U.S.Boeing also has come under fire from Trump over the costs of its new Air Force One program.

612,TAP,"The market may hate uncertainty, but it has reacted with unmistakable enthusiasm to the prospect of a political leader who is an unknown quantity. So have investors in exchange traded funds.Since the Nov. 8 election, major indexes have shot to record highs and investors have poured billions into ETFs. The rally has been fueled by optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's proposals of more government spending, less regulation of certain industries, and tax cuts.In recent interviews with IBD, two money pros expressed hope for the stock market going into the new year.Tempering this sentiment is their circumspect view of the Trump agenda, the earnings picture and the economic outlook.Philip Blancato of Ladenburg Thalmann discussed where he is looking to tap growth and where he is hunting for income as both hopefulness and wariness color his views. One of his top ETF ideas, VanEck Vectors Fallen Angel High Yield Bond (ANGL), outperformed in the past month and is among the ETF winners of 2016.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2016Brian Sterz of Miracle Mile Advisors identified some ETFs that could benefit most from the ""Trump bump"" in the markets.Here are the ETF investing pros in their own words:Philip Blancato is CEO and president of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York City. The registered investment advisory firm has $2.2 billion in assets under management.We are fairly optimistic about U.S. equities going into 2017, but not without caution. There still remains uncertainty on what President-elect Donald Trump will do, but the broad direction is pointing to the positive side.We believe the S&P 500 will eke out returns between 5% to 7% as the U.S. economy continues to expand at a modest rate between 2% and 2.5% and profits expand modestly.Volatility will be heightened more than its current level as markets trade more actively on the president-elect's announcements and actions.We also believe the Fed will raise rates in a gradual manner with two hikes at most in 2017. Given the concern surrounding rising rates, I chose two fixed-income ETFs with compelling cases.Additionally, active-management and smart-beta ETF strategies can be used to take advantage of price dislocations in less price efficient asset classes.VanEck Vectors Fallen Angel High Yield Bond (ANGL) invests in below-investment-grade corporate bonds that were rated investment grade at the time of their issuance.Higher-yielding bonds should be less affected by rising rates than your standard corporate bonds, which have lower yields. When interest rates increase, bonds with lower yields are less attractive than bonds with higher yields and as a result they can experience a more significant sell-off. So, higher coupons actually help to cushion the impact of rising interest rates.Further, ANGL invests in ""fallen angels,"" which are higher-quality, high-yield bonds that are trading at a discounted value when purchased. So, the majority of the selling of these bonds is already done before they are purchased, which makes these bonds even less interest-rate sensitive.Between Nov. 8 and Dec. 12, when the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield increased from 1.88% to 2.49%, ANGL outperformed the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index by 3.96%. Also, high-yield bonds outperformed corporate bonds in 2013 during the ""Taper Tantrum"" period, when rates were increasing.ANGL invests in bonds that have had historically higher average credit quality than the broad high-yield bond universe. The yield is attractive in this low-interest-rate environment at 5.23%. And the ETF's current 27% allocation to the energy sector could be beneficial given OPEC's agreement to cut oil production.ANGL is up 23.66% this year through Nov. 30.Fidelity Total Bond (FBND), an actively managed ETF, is based off Fidelity's Total Bond Fund (FTBFX), which has a long-term track record of strong risk-adjusted returns. The strategy invests across various sectors, maturities and credit qualities to achieve a diversified core bond position.FBND has an attractive yield of 2.96% and a duration of 5.32 years. The ETF has navigated volatile fixed-income markets, and I believe its actively managed approach can adapt to future rate hikes. Year to date through Nov. 30, it returned 6.09%, outperforming the Barclay's Aggregate Bond Index.(Editor's note: FBND trades on average less than 50,000 shares a day. Ladenburg Thalmann says that, as long-term investors, they can be patient when trading in and out of an ETF to ensure they execute trades at reasonable prices.)JPMorgan Diversified Return International Equity (JPIN) is passively managed to an FTSE index developed by JP Morgan Asset Management to provide exposure to developed international equities.JPIN uses a top-down risk-allocation framework that equally distributes portfolio risk across 40 regional sectors. It ranks holdings with a focus on value, size, momentum and low-volatility factors. The construction methodology entails monthly rebalancing, liquidity screens and turnover constraints.Active management has a better chance of success in less price efficient asset classes like international equities. So we are willing to take some active bets through the use of smart-beta strategies like JPIN.Brian Sterz is an investment advisor at Miracle Mile Advisors, an RIA firm based in Los Angeles; AUM: $ 720 million.Despite the strong investment returns following the Brexit decline and, more recently, the U.S. election, we believe that domestic stock markets will be volatile next year but ultimately positive.Given that the Fed and most economists predict only modest GDP growth, and the Fed is set to again raise interest rates, stock market returns will be based on forecasts of what effect any tax and fiscal policy legislation will be able to achieve in 2018 and beyond.While the rhetoric is known, the substance is not yet, and the market will move based on perceptions of what will ultimately be passed. We see the S&P 500 ending next year at 2400, and small-cap stocks outperforming large peers, but with a high probability of a correction during the year.Dispersion is likely to increase, meaning that investors will have to pick their sectors and markets much more carefully than during these previous ""Fed driven"" years.The surprise of next year may be that Europe, trading at low valuations and even lower investor sentiment, may outperform U.S. stocks. Given the positive intermediate market responses to both England and Italy's populist referendums, there may be precedent for such follow-through across the region.SPDR Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) holds 58 stocks in the energy sector. Following OPEC production halts, and potentially firmer oil and gas prices, domestic exploration and production (E&P) companies are set to ramp up production.Given the turmoil in the industry over the past year, and subsequent cost and debt rationalization, these firms are set to generate dramatically increased profits given increased demand and decreased regulation.The sector performed well in 2016, though it has trailed the S&P 500 on a two- and five-year basis, and appears set to rebound sharply.SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) invests in homebuilders, home furnishers, home-improvement stores and the like. U.S. homebuilders are set to profit from an environment of encouraging housing data, limited supply of available housing stock, and increasing employment and wages.As the demand for new homes continues to outstrip supply, these firms are dramatically ramping up efforts to produce homes to sell. The sectors' revenues rose 20% in the first three quarters of 2016, and diversified builders are beginning to expand margins going into the new year.Despite this, stocks in the sector have not yet caught up to the fundamentals and may outperform going forward as they do.SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) invests in stocks that have borne the brunt of campaign rhetoric for more than a year and now trade at their lowest valuations in more than two years.Historically, these have made for strong entry points for long-term investors.We like the prospects for the industry as it is filled with innovators creating solutions to a constantly evolving collection of medical concerns.One could view the sector as a collection of venture investments, and owning a broad basket of these potential future market leaders is the best way to own them.ETFs such as iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) or SPDR Biotech are great ways to get this exposure. They include many of the smaller-market-cap, early-stage names that may be tremendously volatile before eventual large gains.For those who are looking for stable health care exposure, an ETF such as Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) holds a broader range of biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical-device stocks that, owned together, may offer a potentially smoother investor experience.RELATED:Which ETF Investment Strategies Are Right For You?

613,TAP,"A survey had good and bad news for Amazon's (AMZN) new Amazon Go convenience store format, which will have no cashiers and no checkout but instead will automatically deduct payment from shoppers' accounts.A poll this month by Morning Consult found that people love the convenience, but they love it less when they then take into account the loss of jobs the concept entails.The research and media firm's survey of 2,000 U.S. adults, taken Dec. 6-8, found that two-thirds were likely to shop at the Go stores because they would not have to wait in line, and 59% said they would likely shop their because they wouldn't have to pay with cash or credit/debit cards.But then, when asked how likely they were to use Amazon Go at the expense of cashier jobs, 52% said that would make them unlikely to shop at the store.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon and Wal-Mart are increasing big rivals, but they have plenty of other competitors. IBD takes a look at just which sellers will ""win"" Christmas 2016.No. 1 online seller Amazon this month took aim at some physical store rivals, introducing Amazon Go. These will be small — 1,800 square feet or so — convenience stores that won't have checkout stands. Instead, they will use computer vision and deep-learning algorithms to let shoppers just pick up what they want and exit the store without any checkout procedure. Amazon reportedly has more such store concepts in the works.Shoppers will just tap the Amazon Go app on their smartphones, and their virtual shopping carts will automatically tabulate what they owe, and deduct that amount from their Amazon accounts.Amazon is calling this ""just walk out technology,"" which it said is based on the same technology used in self-driving cars. It's certain to up the ante in the company's competition with Wal-Mart (WMT) and many others.Its first Go store, in its home base of Seattle, is open for testing by employees only, but is slated to open to the public early in 2017.While the loss of jobs resonated, the Morning Consult survey found that 62% of respondents were more worried about the loss of jobs due to outsourcing to lower-cost regions overseas, vs. 27% more worried about the loss of jobs due to technological advances (with the others not stating or saying they didn't know).President-elect Trump has made U.S. job growth a central component in his plans, and he has criticized Amazon for what he says are unfair tax advantages the online seller has received, and he has feuded with the Washington Post, which is owned individually by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos.Bezos was among 14 tech leaders who met with Trump to talk about various issues Wednesday, a much-publicized tech summit, and jobs was on the minds of both Trump and Bezos.The press was barred from the meat of the meeting and not much is yet known about what was discussed. Afterward, though, Bezos said in the statement to Yahoo Finance that ""I found today's meeting with the President-elect, his transition team, and tech leaders to be very productive.""I shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country.""Amazon stock fell 1% to 761 in the stock market today, continuing to trade below its 50-day moving average for going on seven weeks.RELATED:Amazon Introduces Amazon GoTrump Meets With Amazon, Apple, Other Tech Kingpins

614,TAP,"Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ) on Thursday reported better-than-expected earnings and raised full-year EPS guidance, but shares fell sharply.Constellation Brands reported third-quarter earnings per share of $1.96, a 38% increase, well above Street forecasts for $1.72. A favorable tax rate played a key role in the EPS beat.Revenue rose 10% to $1.811 billion, roughly in line with estimates.The company expects full fiscal 2017 EPS of $6.55-$6.65, up from its prior range of $6.30-$6.45, with Q3's 24-cent beat largely accounting for that. Analysts had expected $6.46.Still, shares tumbled 7.1% to 146.76 in the stock market today, falling back below their 50-day line a day after retaking that key level on Wednesday. The stock hit 144 intraday, matching its lowest level since last March.Constellation shares sold off following the presidential election, on fears that Donald Trump could set up protectionist barriers that raise the cost of its Mexican beer imports. But the stock had started to recover in recent weeks.IBD'S TAKE: As more states legalize marijuana in some form or another, Constellation could win in some ways and lose in others based on demographic trends, an analyst report said last year.The company has in recent quarters tried to buy its way into the craft beer, Mexican beer and higher-end wine markets. However, investors have been worried about what its reliance on Mexican-made beers might mean under a Trump administration that could put up higher trade barriers.Constellation, whose beer brands include Corona and Modelo, said it expected its beer business to grow sales by 16%-17% for the full fiscal year, helped by last year's acquisition of craft brewer Ballast Point.The company also said it expects full-year wine-and-spirits sales growth in the ""mid single-digit range,"" with the gains boosted by Constellation's acquisitions of the Prisoner, Meiomi and Charles Smith wines, as well as its purchase of High West Distillery, which makes craft whiskey.Brown Forman (BFB), which makes Jack Daniel's, fell 0.75%.

615,TAP,"President Trump took steps to advance construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, marking the start of an era with fewer constraints on the oil industry to the chagrin of environmentalists who have bitterly fought the projects.The moves, among Trump's first actions since taking office, are a major departure from the Obama administration, which rejected TransCanada's Keystone proposal in 2015 and has kept Dakota Access blocked since September. Environmentalists, concerned about climate change and damage to waters, land and Native-American cultural sites, now face an executive branch that's less sympathetic to their efforts. For the oil industry, it heralds more freedom to expand infrastructure and ease transportation bottlenecks.""We are going to renegotiate some of the terms,"" Trump told reporters today in the Oval Office as he signed the two measures. ""We will build our own pipelines we will build our own pipes.""Foreshadowing Trump's plans, the president told U.S. auto executives at a White House meeting Tuesday morning: ""We're going to make the process much more simple for the oil companies and everybody else that wants to do business in the United States.""TransCanada (TRP) climbed 3.7% to 48.92 in afternoon trade on the stock market today. Energy Transfer Equity (ETE) and Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the developers of the Dakota project, climbed 3% and 4%, respectively.TransCanada had no immediate comment on the president's actions before they were announced, and Energy Transfer didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the Standing Rock tribe that opposes the Dakota project says she would comment ""if it happens.""IBD'S TAKE: TransCanada is among five hot stocks soaring to new highs Tuesday.White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday said both Dakota Access and Keystone are examples of projects that would ""increase jobs, increase economic growth, and tap into America's energy supply more."" He said Trump wanted to balance environmental protection with activity that can grow jobs and the economy.It wasn't immediately clear what mechanism the documents Trump signed today would take. But his advisers have urged the new president to direct the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to grant an easement that would allow construction of the final portion of Dakota Access, reversing the Obama administration's conclusion that more environmental scrutiny was needed.The advisers had also urged the president to pave the way for Keystone XL by rescinding a 49-year-old directive from former President Lyndon B. Johnson that assigned the State Department responsibility for determining whether proposed cross-border energy projects serve the ""national interest.""TransCanada may need to submit another formal application to build the pipeline. The company's plans for Keystone XL already have been vetted, with years of environmental scrutiny culminating in Obama's 2015 decision that the pipeline was not in the U.S. interest.TransCanada has not said it would reapply for permission to build the pipeline, but the day after Trump's election, the Calgary-based company said it was looking for ways to convince the new administration of the project's benefits to the U.S. economy. The company has previously said it remains ""committed to Keystone XL.""Environmentalists fiercely battled the project, making it a flashpoint in broader debates about U.S. energy policy and climate change. Landowners in the pipeline's path warned that a spill of dense crude could contaminate the Ogallala aquifer, a source of drinking water that stretches from Texas to South Dakota. And activists said it would promote further development of oil sands in Alberta, Canada that generally require more energy to extract.Dakota Access opponents say the pipeline would damage sites culturally significant to Native Americans and pose an environmental hazard where it crosses the Missouri River. Earlier this month, the Department of the Army withheld the final easement necessary for construction beneath the lake.Energy Transfer has argued it went through the full permitting process and has the necessary approvals. The company has said the line will be in service in the first quarter of this year, a delay from its original expectations that Dakota Access would be operational by the end of 2016.Swift approval of Dakota Access could reinvigorate the sometimes violent protests at the site of the proposed construction. Environmental activists vowed to continue battling both projects.""A powerful alliance of indigenous communities, ranchers, farmers, and climate activists stopped the Keystone pipeline the first time, and the same alliance will come together to stop Keystone again if Trump tries to raise it from the dead,"" said Travis Nichols, a spokesman with Greenpeace.Josh Nelson, the deputy political director of the CREDO activist group said the action would show Trump is ""in the pocket of big corporations and foreign oil interests.""""Fierce grassroots activism has stopped these pipelines over and over again,"" he said. ""CREDO will do everything in its power to stop the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, and keep dirty fossil fuels in the ground where they belong.""Pipeline supporters said a final easement for the project would illustrate Trump's commitment to building out energy infrastructure needed to ferry oil and gas around the U.S. Although Keystone XL would transport oil sands crude from Canada, some space on the line is slated to be filled by supplies from North Dakota's Bakken shale play.Dakota Access, likewise, is aimed at giving Bakken producers a new route to energy markets, allowing them to forgo more costly rail shipments that have been a backstop when existing pipes fill up. With a capacity of about 470,000 barrels a day, Dakota Access would ship about half of current Bakken crude production and enable producers to access Midwest and Gulf Coast markets.Craig Stevens, spokesman for the Midwest Alliance for Infrastructure Now said moves to advance Keystone XL and Dakota Access would be a ""positive development"" for ""our nation's resource development energy infrastructure as a whole.Energy Transfer owns the Dakota Access project with Phillips 66 (PSX) and Sunoco Logistics Partners (SXL). Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Enbridge Energy Partners (ENB) announced a venture in August that would also take a minority stake in the pipeline.

617,TAP,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and other top banks picked up steam Wednesday immediately after Federal Reserve policymakers upped their forecast for interest-rate hikes that could take place next year, but then gave up some gains or reversed lower.The Fed on Wednesday said it expects three rate hikes next year, up from the two it forecast in September. The central bank also raised its target range for the federal funds rate to 0.5%-0.75%, from 0.25%-0.5%, as was expected.JPMorgan closed virtually flat, dropping 3 cents to 84.73 on the stock market today after rising as high as 86.12 soon after the fed announcement. Bank of America rose 0.3% while Citigroup (C) lost 0.6%. Wells Fargo (WFC) dropped 2%.Goldman Sachs (GS) edged up 0.6%, while Morgan Stanley (MS) added 0.7%.IBD'S TAKE: The prospect of fewer regulations under a Trump administration has sent bank stocks higher. Trump's announcement that he would focus on developing the nation's infrastructure has also lifted steel stocks. When the Fed increases its interest rates, banks can, in turn, raise their own rates and expand their net interest margins.Soon after the Fed announcement Wednesday afternoon, banks began saying their prime lending rates are going up. But not all banks will be affected by the Fed's move in the same ways.Investment bank Goldman Sachs is seen benefiting especially from higher rates and market volatility as it relies more on fixed-income, currency and commodity trading. Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods also said last month BofA's cost cuts position it better than its rivals to take advantage of higher rates.But Citigroup's exposure to overseas markets has been flagged as a concern as higher rates and the stronger dollar send investors' money to the U.S.The rate hike also boosted the 10-year Treasury yield, which also moves mortgage rates higher, and Wells Fargo is the largest U.S. mortgage lender by volume.RELATED:Federal Reserve Hikes Rates, Now Sees 3 Moves In 2017; Yellen On TapWhy BofA, Goldman Sachs Could Stand Out In Bank RallyBanking ETFs Emerge As Leaders After Postelection Rally

618,TAP,"The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate, as expected, by 25 basis points to 0.5% to 0.75%; its first increase in a year. In December 2015, the Fed said it would raise rates four times in 2016, but global economic troubles combined with Brexit kept the Fed's foot on the brake pedal. The Fed now expects a steeper 2017 trajectory for rates.Following the announcement, the market hit new lows on the day, but has since rebounded. All three indexes had been trading in a tight range today, in anticipation of the announcement.The Nasdaq fell 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials were each down 0.2%. Financials buoyed the blue-chip index with both Goldman Sachs (GS) and JP Morgan (JPM) shooting to new highs just after the announcement, but both stocks subsequently gave back some of their gains.Small-cap stocks lagged on Wednesday, sending the Russell 2000 down 0.8%.Nasdaq volume fell, NYSE rose compared with the same time Tuesday.Among leading growth stocks, Callon Petroleum (CPE) fell more than 5% on surging volume after the company priced an upside public offering of 40 million shares, worsened by a 3% fall off in oil prices. The stock again retested its 16.46 buy point in a cup base. Volatile trading is typical of a small-cap energy stock.Three technology companies received upgrades today: Akamai Technologies (AKAM), Nvidia (NVDA), and F5 Networks (FFIV).Akamai jumped 3.5% after earning an outperform rating from Oppenheimer. The stock has been building a flat base following its huge earnings gap-up back in October. Earnings grew 10% in the last quarter.Nvidia was the big leader in the IBD 50 in the stock market today, rising 6% to new highs. The chip company was upgraded to buy from hold by Evercore ISI Group.

620,TAP,"Few Americans would think of fixing a Toyota Prius or a Chevrolet Volt on their own. Yet many ETF investors are confident they have all the skills needed to generate income from their portfolios.One strategist who's a pro at investing in ETFs considers a DIY approach to income investing less than ideal now, for two main reasons.First, index-tracking mutual funds and exchange traded funds simply won't generate the necessary yield to pay bills in retirement, with the S&P 500 and Barclays Aggregate Bond benchmarks both yielding around 2%. Second, interest rates have nowhere to go but up, making broad-based exposure riskier than at any time since the early 1980s. When bond yields go up, prices come down.""Going forward, bond allocations need to be unconstrained and tactical in order to find opportunity and avoid this risk,"" said Mike Sorrentino, chief strategist at Global Financial Private Capital.Special Report: Dividend And Income InvestingHe added: ""The days of easy income generation are over and are not coming back in our lifetimes. You can't fix cars on your own now; the world has evolved. And it's so much more difficult to generate income safely.""To achieve the income they need, investors may be tempted to stretch for the highest yields and unwittingly take on higher default risk. Or they be lulled into complacency, believing they cannot lose money in bonds — yet many fixed income currently have high (and rising) inflation or interest-rate risk, or both.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. Treasury bonds have fallen and yields have risen as traders and economists widely expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at the Dec. 13-14 policy meeting. Optimism is running high over Donald Trump's agenda of lower taxes and more infrastructure spending.So Sorrentino advises income investors to seek professional help to find safe and adequate income, with either an actively managed mutual fund or a money management firm.That does not mean it is impossible for investors to achieve attractive income at an acceptable level of risk on their own. In fact, exchange traded funds offer low-cost and transparent exposure to a variety of fixed income and equity income assets, many of which merit more attention.Sorrentino and Steve Blumenthal, founder and CIO of CMG Capital Management Group, shared some tips in recent phone interviews with IBD.First and foremost, be nimble, these investing experts say.Bond yields are mired near record lows but have been rising of late. Bond ETFs sold off postelection as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped from 1.72% to above 2%. It crossed a multimonth high of 2.50%, set in June 2015, on Monday and was at 2.473% Tuesday.To reduce potential risk from rising rates, Sorrentino favors portions of this asset class with less rate sensitivity, such as iShares 0-5 Year High Yield Corporate Bond (SHYG).It marries the ""best of both worlds — high-yield bond exposure and short duration,"" he explained. So when rates start rising, this ETF will see less volatility, while the credit risk of its underlying assets should get better if the higher rates accompany an improving economy.SHYG is up 11.8% year to date through Dec. 12 and has a 12-month yield of 5.64%.Sorrentino also likes Virtus Newfleet Multi-Sector Unconstrained Bond (NFLT), an actively managed ETF with a ""go anywhere, invest in anything"" strategy.The fund managers have so far nicely managed the strategy for a relatively high, but not outrageous, 0.80% expense ratio, he said.In terms of both income and rate sensitivity, this $193.7 million ETF in his view compares favorably with a far larger actively managed peer, $5.42 billion Pimco Enhanced Short Maturity (MINT).NFLT has gained 7.5% so far in 2016 vs. 2.0% for MINT, while offering a heftier yield of 3.83%.Meanwhile, Blumenthal warns that many fixed-income investors will be shocked when they wake up to their November statements. With the 10-year yield's massive move from 1.4% in July to 2.473% today, the price is down roughly 9%.""Who in the world was interested in bonds yielding 1.40%, yet record flows were racing into bond ETFs,"" Blumenthal said. ""Now, just four months later, nearly five years of earning 1.4% per year is lost. The safe money is not safe.""He advises ETF investors to diversify with trend-following, trading-based strategies.For example, the Zweig Bond Model suggests shortening or lengthening bond exposure as interest rates go up or down. It provides a disciplined, rules-based way to profit from shifting rates and can be implemented with ETFs such as SPDR Bloomberg Barclays 1-3 Month T-Bill (BIL), Vanguard Total Bond Market (BND) and iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (TLT).Another alternative, his firm's CMG Tactical Fixed Income is available through managed accounts and ranks nine fixed income ETFs based on price performance. It then invests in the top two and is currently long SPDR Barclays Convertible Securities (CWB) and SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond (JNK).The CMG Tactical Fixed Income Index slipped roughly 0.81% in November while its benchmark, Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index, fell 3.97%. The strategy was up roughly 10% year to date as of Dec. 6 vs. a 2.56% stumble for the benchmark, according to Blumenthal.He advised investors to have a flexible approach to fixed income in the current environment.""It is not a time to buy-and-hold bond ETFs,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean you shouldn't have fixed income exposure, it means you should think about your fixed income exposure differently.""Outside bonds, Sorrentino likes the hybrid securities known as preferred stocks for their lower correlation to traditional stocks and bonds, as well as their high yields.Preferred stocks give owners a higher claim on a company's assets and earnings than common stock, but don't carry voting rights. They generally yield more than common stocks but have limited potential to appreciate in price, like bonds.At least nine ETFs tap this asset class, including $16.61 billion iShares U.S. Preferred Stock (PFF).The $223.9 million Global X SuperIncome Preferred (SPFF), which targets the 50 highest dividend-paying preferred securities, is focused entirely on financials.Sorrentino finds that attractive given his outlook for the sector.SPFF has advanced 3.4% since the start of 2016 and it yields 7.00%, outpacing PFF on both counts.Income investors also can diversify their portfolios with ETFs that invest in energy infrastructure companies and real estate.Known as MLPs (Master Limited Partnerships) and REITs (real estate investment trusts), these securities pay out most of their earnings as dividends to shareholders in exchange for favorable corporate tax treatment.They also make it easy and possible for individual investors to own a stake in large-scale, income-producing commercial properties.Dozens of ETFs and exchange traded notes offer exposure to domestic and global REITs, as well as MLPs. Some even offer potentially tasty yields — as high as 20% — without a strong correlation to interest rates.Sorrentino likes and uses Vanguard REIT (VNQ), but tends to avoid MLP ETFs. That is in part because his clients dread the cumbersome K-1 tax forms that MLPs generate.They can also be very volatile. Investors also should be aware that REITs are down double-digits from their July highs, at least in part due to concerns about the impact rising interest rates could have on their business.High-yielding utility and dividend ETFs also are popular choices for equity income. However, Sorrentino is wary of their stretched valuations and questions their future growth potential as they trade near historic highs.Instead, he finds ""very nice income"" in individual stocks such as BP PLC (BP), Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM).Companies in integrated oil services, such as BP, have yields as high as 7.0% and should be resilient in the unlikely event of an energy sector rout, Sorrentino explained.""If BP goes out of business, then we have a bigger problem,"" he quipped. Besides paying very strong dividends, many integrated oil stocks are cheap at current valuations, he added.Then Sorrentino added on a more serious note: ""Buying stocks for income requires a tremendous amount of skill, education and experience. Most individual investors should not be buying dividend-paying stocks on their own.""RELATED:Which Of The Best ETF Investment Strategies Is Right For Your Portfolio?Flexibility Is Needed For New Era Of Income InvestingProfits From Stock Gains And Augment A Low-Yielding PortfolioHow To Find Dividend Stocks With Staying Power

But the rebound in crude has boosted demand for services and materials, and rival Halliburton (HAL) has said it is ready to increase prices, even if it means losing some market share.Schlumberger said exploration and production investments in North America will increase by 30% this year with the biggest growth seen in the Permian basin, ""which should lead to both higher activity and a long overdue recovery in service industry pricing.""""On fracking, we need significantly higher pricing before we get into a sustainable operating environment,"" CEO Paal Kibsgaard said during a conference call with analysts.

624,TAP,"Never accuse the country's biggest retailer of resting on its laurels. After disrupting and transforming one retail segment after another, Amazon (AMZN) has the checkout line in its sights. And investors are returning to ETFs that have big stakes in the stock.Amazon Go, unveiled Monday, promises a new kind of brick-and-mortar store. Its marquee feature is checkout-free ""grab and go"" shopping. So no more dealing with long lines at cash registers or scrambling for a debit card, although details of Amazon's plans are scarce.Convenience is highly valued by consumers, and the Amazon Go news should help exchange traded funds tied to consumers' disposable income, said David Haviland, a managing partner at Beaumont Capital Management.""This appears like a positive announcement in a very exciting technology,"" he added. ""If it works as described, it seems like it could be applied to all retail.""A positive development tied to Amazon matters in the ETF investing world, where roughly 100 funds hold the stock. It matters especially to investors who make tactical and strategic bets on equity sectors to tap growth, diversify portfolios and manage risk.Amazon's stock was down 9.70, or 1.26%, at 758.95 Monday. Amazon accounts for 13% of the consumer discretionary sector of the S&P 500, more than any other company.That makes Amazon the top stock in the $11.11 billion Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY). Amazon also is the No. 1 holding with a 10% to 16% portfolio weighting in cap-weighted ETFs such as Vanguard Consumer Discretionary (VCR), iShares U.S. Consumer Services (IYC), Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary (FDIS) and VanEck Vectors Retail (RTH).Of them, the Fidelity ETF has the lowest expense ratio at 0.8%.IBD'S TAKE: New products or services represent the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system. Strong earnings growth (the C and A in CAN SLIM, for Current earnings and Annual earnings) is the No. 1 factor to look for in a stock, but new products or services often generate stellar profitability.Haviland, whose Massachusetts-based firm has $2.7 billion in assets under management, is cautiously optimistic about the consumer discretionary sector for two reasons.""We think the sector will do relatively well as the Trump administration is focusing on tax cuts and government spending, and this will put more money into the economy,"" he told IBD via email. ""Also, the proposed infrastructure spending may be inflationary, which may help Americans by reducing their debt burdens in real terms.""Consumer discretionary funds have had a hard slog of late, but are starting to perk up.Apart from the Trump factor, the seasonal factor is in play. Holiday shopping often delivers a boost to retailers in the run-up to the ""Santa Claus rally"" that stocks tend to see in the final week of the year.In the month ended Dec. 8, XLY leapt 6.7%, outpacing the S&P 500, and it pegged a 52-week high of 84.34 on Thursday.Year to date, XLY is up 8.9% vs. 12.2% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). Consumer discretionary has outperformed virtually all S&P 500 sectors over the past five years and longer periods of time.Investors have piled back in as the sector regains its footing. XLY saw $1.1 billion in net inflow in the month ended Dec. 7, according to FactSet data. That contrasts with a $1.1 billion in net outflow since the start of this year.XLY and most of its peers had bled money earlier in the year amid a multitude of woes: falling foot traffic in brick-and-mortar stores; disappointing reports across the retail landscape; and an uncertain economic outlook that made consumers reluctant to spend.Sheraz Mian, research director at Zacks Investment Research, finds it worrisome that all major industries in retail came out with weaker-than-expected results in the third quarter.""We saw that with the online vendors, the restaurants and even the big-box retailers,"" Mian said. One big exception was Best Buy (BBY).Department stores such as Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN) and Kohl's (KSS) did relatively better, ""but that was largely as a result of tight inventory controls,"" Mian added.Haviland of Beaumont Capital, despite his increased optimism about the sector, notes a big risk in rising interest rates.""If Americans have to spend incrementally more of their incomes servicing debt burdens, then they'll have less to spend on discretionary items,"" he said.Consumer discretionary ETFs that skew toward small caps and value stocks have beaten their cap-weighted peers on the stock market so far this year.PowerShares S&P SmallCap Consumer Discretionary (PSCD) is up 21.5% through Dec. 8, while Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Discretionary (RCD), SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) and First Trust Consumer Discretionary Alpha (FXD) are up between 11% and 13%.Small-cap and value stocks are also favored by some strategists in the changing landscape under President-elect Donald Trump.RELATED:Small-Cap Value ETFs Show Again Why They Are Darlings Of The MarketHow To Play Small-Cap ETFs In Strong Equity Markets With Rising Rates

625,TAP,"Generating income in the current market environment has been a bit like a carnival game. It can take a lot of effort and the prize may seem of little more value than a cheap stuffed pink elephant with uneven button eyes.Interest rates on Treasury bonds remained near historic lows this year, forcing many income investors to chase yield in junk bonds and dividend-paying stocks.At this point choices for dividend stocks range from those down a lot and offering juicy yields, like energy refiner and marketer CVR Energy (CVI), which is 51% off its 52-week high and has a dividend yield of 10.8%, and transportation services company Scorpio Tankers (STNG), 53% below its high, yielding 12%. At the other end of the spectrum are stocks that have been on the upswing but have less potent yields, such as food giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), which is up 22% this year but pays a dividend yield of just 2.7%.Still, dividends could get more appealing. What if tax cuts under President Trump coax corporations to repatriate overseas caches of cash back to the U.S.? Many companies might use the bounty to boost their dividends.Special Report: Dividend And Income InvestingMany companies have already used those overseas cash stashes. Tony Hallada, CliftonLarsonAllen Wealth Advisors (CLA) managing partner, said, ""Corporations issued a massive amount of corporate bonds at record low interest rates that was collateralized by the assets held overseas. Many used the bond-sales proceeds to increase their dividends. This way they could pay out some of this buildup of capital on the balance sheet, borrow at record low rates and avoid paying the taxes on the repatriated money.""The game is changing already. Bond yields are rising as the economy strengthens and the Federal Reserve on Wednesday nears what is expected to be its first rate hike in a year. The 10-year Treasury yield has pushed as high as 2.4% in recent days, a level not seen since July 2015. Boatloads of erstwhile bond investors parked in dividend-paying equities are waiting to jump back into their preferred ""safe"" investment class.But investing in bonds when interest rates are rising can cause principal to erode since bond prices fall when rates rise. And when money moves back into bonds to capture higher yields, it could rush out of dividend-paying stocks that have been bid up to high valuations by income seekers.What's the smart play for retirees and others searching for income?Given today's risks in any one type of bond or income-oriented stock, the secret to winning the income prize is to be flexible. You need a variety of income sources, tilting toward those whose valuations hold steady while they churn out income, and tilting away from those whose prices sag and undercut your total return.You can get higher yield than what's paid by safe blue chip stocks by taking on credit risk. Ditto for bonds; you can get higher yield if you accept higher risk. But odds are you're aiming for a relatively safe balance of yield and risk.Telecom's Verizon (VZ), for instance, is approaching the end of the choppy year with a 9% gain and yielding 4.6%. Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) is up 35% and yielding 3.1%.Don't expect the Federal Reserve to help your pursuit. Even with rate hikes, rates will remain near historic lows. And rate hikes can crush securities' prices.""The current environment is murky,"" said Radu Gabudean, a manager of several American Century funds, including $52.6 million Multi-Asset Income (AMJAX) and $16.4 million Global Allocation (AGAVX).Among stocks, sectors that tend to pay higher yield have grown pricey because investors have crowded into them. Among bonds, you have to give up more and more credit quality to find higher yield. Both of those facts threaten your ability to score price gains. You could even end up eating a loss.""Focusing your investments on those equity sectors and in lower-quality bonds is a dangerous investor behavior,"" said Justin Christofel, co-manager of $13.7 billion BlackRock Multi-Asset Income Fund (BAICX).Christofel exhibits flexibility by including covered call options among his fund's income sources. About 13% of its shareholders' money is invested in such options, which aim to minimize the high yield-high risk trap. But 20% to 30% of the fund's yield is from covered calls, he says.The fund's 12-month yield is 4.47% as of Nov. 30, according to Morningstar Inc. That's more than double the 2.08% yield from the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), a proxy for the popular big-cap stock benchmark.Covered call options are a way to wrest income from stocks that pay few if any dividends.  Individual investors can follow this strategy on their own if they invest the time to shop for worthwhile stocks, arrange an option trading agreement with a brokerage and sell calls on specific stocks.""But it's far easier to have a financial advisor do it for you, or to use a mutual fund that holds them,"" Christofel said.IBD'S TAKE: You can learn more about investing in covered call options in this IBD report.The strategy involves buying a stock and at the same time selling to another investor that stock's potential price gain above a certain specific price. You pocket any gain up to that agreed upon threshold, known as the strike price. The person who bought the option gets any gain beyond that.This strategy generates income through the price — called the premium — the second investor pays for the option. Mutual funds pass those premiums through to shareholders as income in the form of dividends.This income strategy relies on potential share-price appreciation, not dividends paid. That means covered call options help a fund diversify its risks and avoid stocks with cyclically inflated share prices.""We can generate income this way without relying on sectors and geographies that investors are most likely to turn to for dividend income, such as staples, REITs, utilities and telecom,"" Christofel said.In turn, that frees his fund to focus on stocks with better prospects for price gains, improving the fund's overall total return potential.How can you tell if any given mutual fund holds covered call options? It's easier with some funds than others. In its monthly commentary, Christofel's portfolio details the share of income from each of its strategies. As of Oct. 31, the largest slice of its income pie was from covered call options, whose 30% share topped the second-largest source, global high yield bonds at 18%.The covered call option portion of his portfolio customarily yields 10% to 15% annually, he adds. Compare that to the 2.08% average 12-month yield of dividend-oriented stock mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. as of Nov. 30.The strategy only works if the stock you use gains in price. Christofel sees the best opportunities for this tactic at the moment in financial stocks. Also promising are technology, consumer discretionary and industrials.Many additional strategies involve the familiar tit-for-tat, seeking some relatively safe balance of yield and credit risk or market risk. Among them:Linda Duessel, executive vice president and equity markets strategist for Federated Investors, likes stocks that raise their dividends. Payout is not their only benefit. The stocks tend to outperform other stock categories after Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes.""It's common with the first rate hike, and I call the hike that (may come out of) the Fed's next meeting (Dec. 13-14) a 'first hike' because the prior one was a year ago,"" Duessel said.Those stocks tend to climb because rate hikes occur amid economic strength, which helps companies lift their dividends.You can play this strategy through mutual funds or individual stocks. If you go with individual stocks, weigh how much a stock's price has risen in, say, the past year. The higher it has climbed, the harder it will be to score additional appreciation.""This is the category we're having the most discussions with clients about,"" said Terry Simpson, U.S. multiasset strategist for the BlackRock Investment Institute. ""This area offers higher yield with only a small increase in risk. A more stable U.S. dollar can create an opportunity for foreign-currency bonds.""But if the dollar rises in value, that could lure investors away from emerging markets debt, hurting their prices, Simpson cautions. ""An aggressive Fed tightening cycle or a global risk-off situation could threaten the asset class,"" he added.U.S. dollar-denominated emerging markets debt yielded 5.13% on average as of Nov. 30, according to the Bloomberg Barclays Emerging Markets USD Aggregate Bond Index. Its local currency counterpart yielded 5.18%.Attractive yields are this category's driver. But beware of volatility. ""High-yield bonds have been the best-performing category this year, along with emerging markets debt,"" said Adam Kramer, a manager of $42.7 million Fidelity Advisor Multi-Asset Income Fund (FWATX). ""But the year before, high yield was the worst performing.""The category's total return is vulnerable to cycles in sectors where it is highly exposed, such as financials and energy.High-yield bonds averaged a yield of 6.57% as of Nov. 30.Joanna Bewick, manager of two Fidelity Investments income-oriented mutual funds, describes convertible bonds as bonds on steroids. They generate income like bonds, and they offer the price appreciation potential of stocks. Convertible bonds averaged a yield of 3.31% as of Nov. 30.These loans are typically made to large corporations. The loans' interest rates are adjustable, usually every 90 days. That protects the lender in a rising rate environment.Borrowers generally have sound fundamentals. Still, these loans are typically below investment grade. The loans are senior secured debt, which give lenders first claim on the borrower's assets if it defaults. You can play these instruments through loan participation or bank loan mutual funds.Current 12-month yield is more than double the S&P 500's. But total return historically lags the broad stock market over multiyear periods.Elsewhere in our special report on dividend and income investing, you can read reports that offer tips about a wide variety of income strategies:RELATED:Want Income?

626,TAP,"Income from mutual funds? That's the holy grail of investors who yearn for a way to generate income that's as simple — and safe — as pocketing 5% interest from savings accounts in the good ol' days. But how can you do it? Many bond yields remain low. And rising rates have chipped away at bond prices. Investors fear similar damage in the REIT, telecom and utility spaces.What's an income investor to do? Mainly, don't rely on any one strategy. Use a variety of sources to cut your volatility, minimize price pullbacks and maximize your income.If instead you stick to a single, narrow strategy, expect volatility and uncertainty.Take a look at dividend funds that are not REIT, telecom or utility sector funds. Only two of the 11 that are in the top 10% in total returns over the three years ended Nov. 30 were also in the top 10% over the past 10 years. Another seven of those 11 funds don't even have a 10-year record.Special Report: Dividend And Income InvestingWhy diversify instead of relying on just one strategy? No one source of income looks sufficient, says Radu Gabudean, a manager of several American Century target date and target risk funds as well as $52.6 million Multi-Asset Income (AMJAX) and $16.4 million Global Allocation (AGAVX). Why not ""hire"" a professional fund manager, who can tap into a variety of sources for income for you, allocating from one to another as their fortunes rise and fall?""We have exposure to REITs, other dividend stocks in both the U.S. and internationally, high-yield bonds, convertibles, emerging markets debt,"" Gabudean said, referring to Multi-Asset Income.So, if you take that route, how do you decide which income-producing fund — or two or three — is right for you?An income-oriented stock fund will likely be more volatile than a bond fund over the long run. Yet many stock funds can generate better income in the foreseeable future. Those yields can be much higher, but only if you're willing to take a chance on a fund that tilts toward stocks that are troubled, at least in the near term.As for bonds, sure, yields are creeping up and the Federal Reserve is expected to resume its rate hikes. But rising rates translate into bond price declines.Look at four categories: dividend funds as well as utility, REIT and telecom sector funds. REITs, or real estate funds, offered the best 12-month yield, averaging 2.30% as of Nov. 30. That topped the other four groups' averages. But REIT funds' year-to-date total return of 1.10% was the worst of the four. Dividend funds' 11.69% total return was the best year-to-date average return. But its 1.64% yield was the worst.In contrast, qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at a maximum of 20%. Under a Trump administration, tax rates may decline. But there still may be a tax advantage to income in the form of dividends and capital gains. Still, this year and possibly in years to come, you may want to create income by selling stock fund shares that have risen in value rather than by relying on dividends or interest. And the best price gains may come from stock funds that don't make income-generation a priority at all.How do some mutual funds navigate around these choices? Look at holdings in $2.3 billion Invesco Dividend Income Fund (FSTUX). Over the past three years, the fund's 11.26% average annual return ranks tops among all dividend stock mutual funds.The fund's 1.75% 12-month yield is slightly better than average.The fund's top-performing stock this year through Dec. 7 was Kennemetal (KMT), which makes tooling, engineered components and advanced materials. Shares are up 77% for the year. And the stock's 2.3% dividend yield was slightly better than the broad market's 2.01%, measured by SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY).Not bad? Not so fast. Earnings per share growth has declined in six of the seven most recent quarters. The stock has a weak 54 Composite Rating from IBD. Still, this stock has mounted a powerful rally, even providing a nice gain after breaking out of a base last month.The portfolio holds sturdier looking names. A Composite Rating of 98 and an SMR Rating of A for Microchip Technology (MCHP) are signs of greater strength. Its stock is up 39% for this year. And EPS growth has accelerated, rising by 0% to 3%, 22% and 42% the past four quarters.IBD's TAKE: SMR is a proprietary rating pioneered by IBD to help investors identify companies with superior Sales Growth, Profit Margins, and Return on Equity ratios.

627,TAP,"As a caregiver for her ailing father, Quentara Costa spent six years immersed in eldercare issues. Today, she applies those lessons to build her financial advisory practice.Costa, a certified financial planner in North Andover, Mass., has carved out a niche working with seniors and their families. She's developed expertise in helping individuals tackle eldercare challenges, especially as they weigh a move into an assisted living facility.Costa, 31, focuses on an underserved market. She has not come across other advisors who specialize in helping seniors and their families evaluate various types of assisted living communities and analyzing the long-term affordability of making the move.To grow their business, advisors must think like entrepreneurs. They uncover niches that others overlook to differentiate themselves from the pack.The trick is to tap a previously ignored niche that's substantial enough to provide a significant number of clients. If you concentrate on a market that's too narrow, you can set yourself apart but have little to show for it.Pursuing the right niche comes naturally to some advisors. If they have connections to a certain market segment, they may find themselves attracting clients who refer others with similar characteristics or interests.In other cases, advisors' life experience shapes their outlook. Like Costa, they may realize that the wisdom they've gained through their personal travails can prove an asset in winning over clients with specific needs.Ideally, the most overlooked niches consist of a stable or growing cache of potential clients. If you are the first advisor to penetrate that group, you can gain a head start by establishing your credibility within that market.In the course of helping her father, Costa became well versed in assisting living options. She learned what constitutes skilled nursing care and what questions to ask when assessing a facility.""There are many seniors who are considering the move into some type of assisted living facility,"" Costa said. ""And such a move can involve lots of moving pieces such as getting all the family members on board.""Costa, who markets exclusively to seniors and their families, tours facilities in her area and builds relationships with administrators who run these operations. They in turn refer seniors to her who already reside in the facility and seek an advisor to help address their financial concerns.""I don't do investment management, so I have to show my value as a planner,"" she said. ""And this is a booming market. I can help seniors choose a facility — or figure out how long their money will last so they can stay there.""Some advisors don't have to search far to find a good niche. When Jennifer Kim started her financial planning career nearly 25 years ago, she noticed that no advisors were pursuing the bustling Korean-American community in Los Angeles.By advertising in a local magazine that targeted Korean readers, Kim built visibility. Her Korean heritage also helped her forge ties, and she's now a certified financial planner with deep roots serving her niche.Some advisors stumble upon an overlooked niche by accident. Fate can lead them to discover a cluster of professionals who welcome an advisor's specialized knowledge.In 2012, Tim Baker moved to Baltimore to begin his career in the financial advisory field. After his friend married a pharmacist, Baker won a key client.""My friend and his wife were champions of my business,"" Baker recalled. ""She's on the staff at a local pharmacy school, and she recommended me to other pharmacists.""Like other advisors who successfully uncover a hidden niche, Baker benefited by having what he calls ""early adopters to help spread the word."" He also took steps to educate himself about his target market.""I have no medical background, but I identified the challenges that pharmacists face, such as dealing with student loan debt,"" said Baker, a certified financial planner. ""And I've had thousands of cups of coffee with pharmacists to understand their financial needs better. A lot of my free time is spent listening to podcasts geared to pharmacists.""When he set up his own firm in May 2016, he called it Script Financial to further commit to his niche. He incorporates terms that are familiar to pharmacists — such as ""prescription"" and ""legend"" — in his marketing outreach.""I think financial planning is so broad that you cannot be a master of all,"" Baker said. ""That's why having a unique niche is so important. My goal is to build a national brand so that when a pharmacist graduates from college, within five years they're my client.""RELATED:Advisors Tread Lightly When Talking Politics With ClientsHow Much Is A Financial Advisor's Service Really Worth?

629,TAP,"With Inauguration Day just around the corner, it is important to remember that every new administration brings changes.The incoming U.S. president has expressed skepticism about several international trade deals, including NAFTA. That's worrying to many Canadians. A poll conducted last November found that 57% of Canadians think the pact has made their economy better off (vs. just 20% who say it is worse off).There is also the open question of how well this new Republican administration and the Republican-controlled Congress will get along with Canada's still-young Liberal government. At least on the surface, President-elect Donald Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau seem to be very different from one another.Yet there is cause to believe that the two countries on either side of the world's longest border will remain close in the coming years. Whatever difficulties threaten to strain relations — and there are always some — should be weathered reasonably well.Take the issue of NAFTA. While there are understandable fears regarding the prospect of reopening this trade deal, there is also the real possibility that doing so could lead to more free trade between our countries, not less. Contentious issues — like Canada's supply management for dairy and poultry, or U.S. tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber — might actually get resolved to the benefit of consumers on both sides of the border.Furthermore, Mr. Trump favors easier trade with Canada on at least one specific point: approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. Connecting Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Neb., the 1,179-mile pipeline could transport up to 830,000 barrels of Canadian oil daily to Gulf Coast refineries. Thus far, however, this important project has been blocked by President Obama.Though many Americans do not realize it, Canadian oil still matters quite a great deal to the United States. It is true that technological advancements like horizontal drilling and fracking have allowed U.S. oil and natural gas producers to tap previously unreachable domestic resources, leading to a substantial drop in total oil imports.Nevertheless, Canada remains the top foreign oil supplier to the U.S. In fact, imports from Canada are up, thanks to the displacement of imports from other countries, the addition of new pipeline capacity, and more U.S. refinery space for heavy oils from Western Canada. In 2015, 40% of all oil imported by the U.S. came from its peaceful northern neighbor.Although Mexico is set to overtake Canada this year as the No. 2 exporter of goods to the U.S. (behind China), Canada remains the top export destination for 35 American states. It is also the number one supplier to the U.S. not just of crude oil, but also of refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. And it's a leading supplier of uranium, too.The fact is that our two countries have a long history of cooperation, even when our leaders and governments have hailed from opposite sides of the political spectrum.Through decade after decade of peaceful coexistence, the United States and Canada have been reliable allies in an uncertain world. They have fought side by side, too, to defend freedom around the world. Our nations' closeness derives from proximity, to be sure, and from a shared history as well.But more profoundly, what binds the two allies are shared values. Whatever our differences in this regard, they have always been far outweighed by our commonalities.Our two countries have long been beacons of freedom and progress in a world that still cannot take these for granted. Our two organizations, the Heritage Foundation and the Montreal Economic Institute, have always championed these core values. And we are confident, given all of the above, that the new administration in D.C. will work to uphold them as well, and to maintain the close relationship that persists between the land of the free to the south and the true north, strong and free.

Some 500 other versions — by Frank Sinatra, Bob Marley, Shania Twain, Lady Gaga, among others — have added another 50 million.But its popularity started slow: It was first sung by Crosby on a Christmas Day broadcast 75 years ago, just weeks after the Pearl Harbor attack brought the U.S. into World War II. And after its inclusion in ""Holiday Inn"" the next year, Berlin had given up trying to promote the melancholy song that critics had disparaged.""In the closing weeks of the year, it quietly found its way to a special constituency: American soldiers abroad,"" wrote Laurence Bergreen, author of ""As Thousands Cheer: The Life of Irving Berlin."" ""It became the GIs' anthem of longing and homesickness. … Although it owed its initial success to the war, the appeal was essentially timeless … belonging to no particular era, place, or musical fashion.""It was just one of 25 of Berlin's songs that reached No. 1 on the charts, according to the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). Not bad for someone who never learned to read or write music, taught himself to play piano only in one key, and began his career by singing as he sold newspapers amid New York City's tenements.Berlin (1888-1989) was born Israel Beilin in or near the city of Mohilev, in what was then Russia and is now Belarus. His father, Moses, was the synagogue's cantor, which would inspire his son to sing. The family of nine fled anti-Semitic persecutions and entered the U.S. in 1893, with authorities changing their name to Baline.Settling in the Lower East Side, Moses found a job at a kosher meat market, mom Leah became a midwife, and the kids worked in sweatshops making shirts or cigars. At 8, Izzy became a newsboy, but at 13 when his father died the family couldn't afford to keep him in school. Embarrassed by his meager contribution, he decided to run away to the seedy Bowery district to pursue his dream of becoming a singing waiter.Homeless at first, he hawked papers and popped into saloons to sing for the coins tossed his way. A year later, he was hired by a cafe, showing a talent for witty parodies of popular songs. During slow times in his 12-hour shifts, he taught himself to play the piano, but only in the key of F-sharp major. At 19, he collaborated with the resident pianist to write ""Marie From Sunny Italy,"" selling his publishing rights for 37 cents. A printer's error credited him as ""I. Berlin"" and he embraced the mistake, choosing Irving for his first name.In 1909, Berlin had his first hit, ""Sadie Salome (Go Home)."" It sold 300,000 copies of the sheet music. He was hired by a publisher as a staff lyricist and churned out so many best-sellers that his one-cent royalties earned him $15,000 for the year (equivalent to $403,000 in today's money).He was soon composing tunes as well, but had to hire someone to write out the harmonies for the melodies that he tapped out or sang. He bought a transposing piano, which allowed him to pull a lever that would make his F-sharp major become any other key.Berlin's first international hit was ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" in 1911, which failed when he first wrote it as an instrumental. When he added lyrics, it stimulated a worldwide dance craze. George Gershwin called it ""the first real American musical work.""Berlin composed his first full score for a stage musical, the ragtime revue ""Watch Your Step,"" in 1914. This was followed by a series of patriotic songs during World War I, including one for an all-soldier musical that included the classic, ""Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning,"" which he often performed himself. After the war he had a series of hit singles, including ""Always"" in 1925. Al Jolson sang his ""Blue Skies"" in the first feature-length ""talkie"" movie, ""The Jazz Singer,"" in 1927.Berlin's first full film score was for ""The Cocoanuts"" starring the Marx Brothers in 1929, and he wrote 17 others, including ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" in 1930 and ""Top Hat"" in 1935.Part of Berlin's formula for success was his discipline in attending rehearsals all day, then composing from after dinner until four in the morning.""He was the embodiment of dedication to craft and hard work, focusing every night to become a one-man music factory,"" said guitarist and composer Justin Morell, who's also an assistant professor of music at Lebanon Valley College in Annville, Pa. ""He didn't believe in the romantic image of the inspired artist; he knew that chipping away at a task could produce something extraordinarily beautiful, which is a good model for anyone involved in a creative process. The result was a catalog of 1,500 songs, with an astonishing number that remain popular today because he knew how to connect with everyday people and communicate his message in simple terms to bring them happiness and make them feel something.""As the world rumbled toward war in 1938, Berlin decided to revive a song he had written 20 years earlier but never released. Kate Smith debuted ""God Bless America"" on Armistice Day, Nov. 11. The song is regarded as a second national anthem. He assigned the royalties to the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, earning them millions.Berlin also produced ""This Is the Army,"" a revue which he took to troops on the front lines for nearly four years. The stage and the film versions also raised $10 million for the Army Emergency Relief Fund.Berlin wrote about some unusual patriotic causes, like the Lend-Lease Act (which permitted military aid to the Allies in World War II)  and the importance of paying the IRS (Berlin refused to use tax shelters). But nothing came close to the success of ""White Christmas,"" which won the Academy Award for Best Song. ASCAP ranks it No. 3 in its list of most popular songs of all time. The 1942 master of Bing Crosby's original recording was so overused that it became damaged, and a 1947 rerecording by Crosby is the one now in circulation. Crosby also starred in the 1954 movie musical of the same name, which was that year's top earner.Although some of Berlin's postwar projects failed, he had success with the movie versions of such Broadway hits as ""Blue Skies"" (1946), ""Easter Parade"" (1948), ""Annie Get Your Gun"" (1950) and ""Call Me Madam"" (1953).""The score for 'Annie' is remarkable for its variety, one outstanding song after another keeping the silly plot in motion,"" wrote Edward Jablonski in ""Irving Berlin: American Troubadour."" "" 'They Say It's Wonderful' was broadcast on 'Your Hit Parade' only a week after the musical opened and stayed on the roster for no less than six months. 'I Got Lost in His Arms' is the show's loveliest ballad with a melodically hypnotic chorus. It also introduced 'There's No Business Like Show Business' and 'Anything You Can Do,' among others.""""It's beautifully ironic that a Russian-Jewish immigrant wrote our most beloved song for Christmas, our most popular song for Easter (""Easter Parade""), and another national anthem,"" said Harry Parker, chair of the department of theater at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, who wrote a musical revue featuring Berlin's music. ""Berlin had a way to tap into universal feelings in a way that was simple yet profound, in a quintessential American style that made them classics.""Berlin's last composition was ""An Old-Fashioned Wedding"" for the Broadway revival of ""Annie Get Your Gun"" in 1966. He died 23 years later at age 101.""Irving Berlin's innate musical ability cannot be mistaken for what propelled him to become one of America's greatest songwriters, which was his tenacity and lifetime of hard work,"" said Rebecca Dodson-Webster, associate professor of horn and music history at Mansfield University in Pennsylvania. ""He never let obstacles stop him from creating some of the best-known entries in the Great American Songbook.""Wrote lyrics and music for ""White Christmas"" and many other classic songs.Overcame: Lack of training to read, write or play music.Lesson: Don't wait for inspiration — make a ritual of working hard on a challenge until the solution emerges.""Life is 10% what you make it, and 90% how you take it.""MORE ABOUT LEGENDARY ENTERTAINERS:George M.

637,TAP,"Online retail king Amazon.com (AMZN) is taking dead aim at the physical-store world Monday, introducing Amazon Go, a retail convenience store format it is developing that will use computer vision and deep-learning algorithms to let shoppers just pick up what they want and exit the store without any checkout procedure. And Amazon reportedly has more such store concepts in the works.Shoppers will merely need to tap the Amazon Go app on their smartphones, and their virtual shopping carts will automatically tabulate what they owe, and deduct that amount from their Amazon accounts, sending you a receipt.

641,TAP,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has halted or partially halted several early stage clinical trials of a Seattle Genetics (SGEN) drug being developed to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the company said Tuesday.Premarket trading in Seattle Genetics was temporarily halted on the news. Seattle Genetics plunged 15% to 52.36 on the stock market today, touching a nearly two-month low. Seattle Genetics stock hit a record high of 75.36 on Nov. 10, and it had been up 38% for the year before Tuesday.The holds were on trials of SGN-CD33A, vadastuximab talirine, in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia.""The clinical holds were initiated to evaluate the potential risk of hepatotoxicity in patients who were treated with SGN-CD33A and received allogeneic stem cell transplant either before or after treatment,"" Seattle Genetics said in its press release Tuesday. ""Six patients have been identified with hepatotoxicity, including several cases of veno-occlusive disease, with four fatal events.IBD'S TAKE: It has not been the best of times for biotech and medtech stocks of late, but some tech groups are almost always doing well. Get a jump on hot tech areas by keeping track of IBD's Tech Leaders.""Overall, more than 300 patients have been treated with SGN-CD33A in clinical trials across multiple treatment settings. Seattle Genetics is working diligently with the FDA to determine whether there is any association between hepatotoxicity and treatment with SGN-CD33A, to promptly identify appropriate protocol amendments for patient safety and to enable continuation of these trials.""The company said other ongoing trials of SGN-CD33A are proceeding with enrollment.In a recent interview with IBD to look ahead at 2017, which will appear later this week, Seattle Genetics CEO Clay Siegall said of the firm's 33A AML drug: ""We'll be starting a randomized phase 2 (trial) in younger AML patients, younger being less than 60 years old. So that will be a big trial that starts this year (2017).""A ""pivotal"" study on elderly AML patients was not affected, nor were some other studies, Needham analyst Chad Messer pointed out in a research note Tuesday. He also pointed out that the company's treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma is far more important, with major data on tap for 2017. Messer maintained his buy rating and 72 price target on Seattle Genetics stock.Siegall, in the IBD interview, also was asked for his thoughts about the 21st Century Cares bill, which aims to speed up the FDA drug approval process. He said:""As far as the (21st Century) Cares bill goes, I'm very supportive of anything we can do to make developing therapies for patients in need more efficient or more robust. We work with people with cancer and people that are dying of cancer and have relapsed after multiple therapies, so we see it everyday. ... So I love the fact the country is making this a priority and making a good budget to do biomedical research and to improve how we make medicine for patients.""Having said that, I also think the FDA model is very good. And I applaud the FDA on the work they are doing, because what I have seen over 25 years is how hard the FDA works and how the intentions of the FDA are to provide approvals for the best medicines and to protect the country from medicines that should not be approved.""

648,TAP,"This is a football story with both political and legal implications.It was fourth down in a National Football League game, and the punting team came onto the field. The other team went into their formation to defend against the punt. Then somebody noticed that the man set to kick the punt was black.""Fake!"" one of the defenders cried out. That cry was immediately echoed by others, and the defending team changed their formation, to guard against the kicker either running with the ball or throwing it. But in fact he punted.Why did anyone think he was not going to punt the ball? Because chances are no one on that field had ever seen a black football player kick a punt. As someone who has watched NFL games for half a century, I have never seen a black player either punt the ball, or kick a field goal or a point after touchdown.I have seen hundreds of black players score touchdowns, but not one kick the point afterward. I have seen a black President of the United States before I have seen a black kicker in the NFL.Politicians, the intelligentsia and even the Supreme Court of the United States have been saying for decades that statistical disparities between racial groups indicate discrimination. If so, then the racial disparities among kickers in professional football exceed that in virtually any other job anywhere.But is it discrimination? The very same people who employ blacks at every other position on a football team are the people who hire kickers. Why would they be willing to hire black players in other positions that pay a lot more money than most kickers get, but draw the line at hiring black kickers?In this situation, discrimination is an explanation that doesn't even meet the test of plausibility.At the other end of the ideological spectrum, there are those who attribute differences in racial representation to genetics. Are blacks genetically incapable of kicking a football? Somehow black colleges have been playing football for generations, without having to recruit white players to do the kicking.But if neither race nor racism can explain why black kickers are so rare in professional football, what can possibly explain it? One of the most obvious possibilities is routinely ignored in many cases of group disparities: Different individuals and groups have different things they want to do.If black youngsters who are dreaming of an athletic career don't happen to be dreaming of becoming kickers, then it doesn't matter whether they have both the innate ability and the opportunity.It is very doubtful if any of the guys who grew up in my old neighborhood in Harlem ever became ballet dancers. Is that because black guys can't dance? Some of the best male tap dancers have been black. Is it because nobody would hire black male dancers? Some black male tap dancers have starred on the stage and danced in movies. Just not in ballets.Many of us have been so brainwashed over the years — by sheer repetition, rather than by either logic or empirical tests — that statistical disparities are automatically taken to mean discrimination, whether between races, sexes or whatever.The plain fact that different individuals and groups make different choices is resolutely ignored, because it does not fit the prevailing preconceptions, or the crusades based on those preconceptions.Women make different career choices than men, and wisely so, because men do not become mothers, and being a mother is not the same as being a father. And we can't make them the same by simply calling them both ""parents"" or saying that ""the couple"" is pregnant.Discrimination can certainly cause statistical disparities. But statistical disparities do not automatically mean discrimination.When some racial or ethnic groups have a median age that is 20 years older than the median age of some other racial or ethnic groups, how surprised should we be to find members of the younger groups far better represented in sports and members of the older groups far better represented in jobs that require long years of experience?Statistics are no substitute for thought — certainly not in government policies, and especially not in Supreme Court decisions.

654,TAP,"Your financial future is up to you. Savvy ETF investors don't allow the ebb and flow of the stock market to throw their plans and portfolios off track. They treat even a very good year for exchange traded funds with dispassion.As 2016 draws to a close, most major asset classes — not including foreign developed-market equities — are up on the year. SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) is up nearly 9%, ahead of its 10-year average annual gain of nearly 7%.Even a shock presidential election result, expected to create a flight to safety, saw the stock market climb to flirt with all-time highs.The annual portfolio tuneup at this time of year is not just a time to drill into the nitty-gritty of your individual ETF holdings — their performance and fees vs. the benchmarks and relative to rival funds, for example. It's also a moment to take a step back and look at the big picture.Your ETF winners in 2016 — small companies, high-yielders and emerging markets, for example — may mean a portfolio with far bigger stakes in those asset classes than you realize. In effect, investors are set up for increased volatility and potentially big losses if the markets reverse.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2016And indeed market trends change. Tony Davidow of Schwab tells IBD his research shows there's no pattern to how the different asset classes performed over the past decade. Emerging markets are at the top this year, as in 2005, 2007 and 2009. They were at or near the bottom in 2008, 2011 and 2015. Other asset classes were just as erratic.So, in his view, it's best to diversify your portfolio with the goal of seizing opportunities and reducing risk. Investing in ETFs — which tap virtually every known asset class and world region — makes that easy. Davidow discusses what to keep in mind as you fine-tune your asset allocation during the annual checkup.Another forward-thinking aspect of the portfolio tuneup at this time of year relates to taxes.Waiting until April to make potential tax-related changes is a missed opportunity, Alex Benke of Betterment points out. He offered three actionable ways investors can reduce the tax bite and improve the overall tax efficiency of their portfolios.Here is what the two investing experts said, in their own words.Tony Davidow is an asset allocation strategist at Schwab Center for Financial Research, a unit of the $2.71 trillion investment firm Charles Schwab (SCHW).During turbulent markets, you may notice your asset allocation veering off course. Year-end is often a good time to revisit your asset allocation. The temptation is often to rebalance into market volatility — rather than developing a disciplined plan to rebalance based on a predetermined time horizon or level of deviation from your allocation.For example, with the strong year-to-date performance of the emerging markets, investors may need to trim their exposure because they may be overweight. It's worth noting that emerging markets have given back some of their gains postelection.Conducting a thorough year-end portfolio checkup is a good practice. Have your goals and objectives changed over time? What's your market outlook? Are there tax considerations that should be dealt with?We believe that the current market environment presents a number of challenges — increased bouts of volatility, increased correlations, generational low yields for fixed income, and lower expected equity returns. You can respond to these new market realities in the following ways:With the growth of exchange traded funds, you can now access segments of the markets that were historically difficult to tap into. You now have many ways of gaining exposure to markets as well.Many clients were leery of allocating assets abroad due to concerns about Chinese economic growth, the Brexit vote and geopolitical risk. However, some of the best-performing asset classes in 2016 have been outside of our borders. Appropriate diversification can help mitigate risk and uncover opportunities.The chart below helps illustrate the value of diversification by showing the year-over-year performance of various asset classes. As you can see, there is no discernible pattern, or predictive capability in the data, but rather it shows the natural rotation of the best- and worst-performing asset classes over time.U.S. large-cap stocks were near the top of the pack in 2013-15, but have lagged in 2016. Several of the best-performing asset classes this year — emerging markets, high yield, international and emerging-market debt — were laggards in recent years. Asset allocation provides exposure to a broad group of asset classes — and attempts to do so in the optimal fashion — not too much or too little.The diversified portfolio owns a portion of all of the asset classes, and consequently takes out the peaks and the valleys associated with owning individual asset classes. The returns of the diversified portfolio are typically in the middle of the pack — with lower risk — thus smoothing the ride. The reality is no one has a crystal ball and can accurately predict the best-performing market on a year-over-year basis.With the innovation of indexing, you can now choose to own a segment of the market in a market-cap fashion, or choose among the different types of smart-beta strategies (i.e., momentum, low volatility, quality or fundamental). Smart-beta strategies ""break the link"" with price — the idea that the market capitalization of a company is the best barometer of a company's performance.Fundamental indexing screens and weights securities based on such factors as sales, cash flow, dividends and buybacks. The difference in weighting methodology can provide very different returns over time.At Schwab, we are advocates of allocating to both market-cap and fundamental index strategies. Each has a role within a portfolio. Market-cap strategies tend to be the lowest-cost solution. They provide little or no tracking error and provide market beta by definition.Fundamental index strategies have historically delivered excess returns relative to their market-cap equivalents. Over longer periods of time, our research has shown that these strategies deliver alpha. The combination provides diversification, cost-effective exposure and the potential for alpha, or excess returns.As you review your portfolio, you may want to evaluate your current allocation. You may want to examine the way you're accessing each asset class, and you may want to rebalance your portfolio to align with your long-term strategy. Market volatility presents both challenges and opportunities.(Editor's note: Morningstar's Instant X-ray is a free tool to better understand your portfolio's asset allocation. Schwab offers asset allocation models for free to the public.)Alex Benke is vice president of advice and investing at Betterment in New York City; assets under management: $6.1 billion.Investors typically think about taxes in April, but December is the time when planning is more important.As the 2016 tax year comes to a close this Dec. 31 (and not the April 15 tax filing deadline), it's time to take action so that you can complete any changes by mid-December, so you won't miss year-end tax deadlines.Everyone's circumstances will vary, but here are three actionable ways you may be able to improve your portfolio.First, gather your cost-basis statements, year-to-date realized capital gains for all taxable accounts you own and last year's tax return for the ""carry forward loss"" numbers (which can be found on Form 1040 Schedule D, and is the difference of line 21 and 16 for the 2015 tax year).Using the statements you gathered, look for ""quick wins,"" or opportunities to sell losses and reduce costs in what you already hold in your taxable accounts. These suggestions assume you are paying taxes on your investment gains, i.e., you are at least in the 25% marginal tax bracket.Second, resolve tax-inefficient and out-of-balance areas in your portfolio. As you undertake the review, you should look for areas where you can increase tax efficiency as well as control for risk.For example, while maintaining your overall asset allocation, you may want to implement an asset location strategy.This involves managing your multiple accounts as a single portfolio, placing assets that are taxed more into more favorably taxed accounts (such as Individual Retirement Accounts, or IRAs).So you'll want to buy tax-inefficient holdings — those with active management or dividend payouts that are taxed at higher rates, such as bond funds and international stock funds — in tax-deferred or tax-free accounts. Tax-efficient investments, such as U.S. stock funds, which pay dividends that qualify for a lower tax rate if held more than 60 days, can be held in taxable accounts.Third, create a to-do list for future years. Sometimes, you can't make all the changes you want to make in a single tax year due to tax implications. Earmark these opportunities for future years, including moving assets to a more ideal allocation, into more tax-efficient investments, and out of high-fee funds.RELATED:Which ETF Investment Strategies Are Right For You?

655,TAP,"If they were anywhere else in Beijing, the five young women in cowboy hats and matching red, white and blue costumes would look wildly out of place. But here at the city's biggest international property fair — a frenetic gathering of brokers, developers and other real estate professionals all jockeying for the attention of Chinese buyers — the quintet of wannabe Texans fits right in. As they promote Houston town houses (""Yours for as little as $350,000!""), a Portugal contingent touts its Golden Visa program and the Australian delegation lures passers-by with stuffed kangaroos.Welcome to ground zero for the world's largest cross-border residential property boom. Motivated by a weakening yuan, surging domestic housing costs and the desire to secure offshore footholds, Chinese citizens are snapping up overseas homes at an accelerating pace. They're also venturing further afield than ever before, spreading beyond the likes of Sydney and Vancouver to lower-priced markets including Houston, Thailand's Pattaya Beach and Malaysia's Johor Bahru.The buying spree has defied Chinese government efforts to restrict capital outflows and shows little sign of slowing after an estimated $15 billion of overseas real estate purchases in the first half. For cities in the cross hairs, the challenge is to balance the economic benefits of Chinese demand against the risk that rising home prices spur a public backlash.""The Chinese have managed to accumulate very large amounts of wealth, and the opportunities to deploy that capital in their own market are somewhat restricted,"" said Richard Barkham, the London-based chief global economist at CBRE Group (CBG), the world's largest commercial property brokerage. ""China has more than a billion people. Personally, I think we have just seen a trickle.""While a dearth of government statistics makes it difficult to gain a comprehensive view of cross-border real estate investments, most industry projections point to a surge in Chinese purchases. Ping An Haofang, an online real estate platform owned by China's second-largest insurer, says its $15 billion first-half estimate, derived from market data, nearly matches the figure for all of 2015.Fang Holdings, the country's most popular property website, predicts overseas buying on its system will increase 130% this year, while transactions through September at Shenzhen World Union Properties Consultancy, China's largest broker for new-home sales, were already 50% above last year's level. The country overtook Canada as the largest source of residential purchases in America last year after an estimated $93 billion of buying from 2010 to 2015, according to a May report by the Asia Society and Rosen Consulting Group.It adds up to the world's biggest-ever wave of overseas residential property investment, according to Susan Wachter, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School who specializes in real estate markets. While Japan had a similar boom in the 1980s, it was mainly focused on commercial buildings, Wachter said.Today's Chinese buyers have a long list of reasons to flock overseas. The yuan's slump is eroding their purchasing power, while returns on local financial assets — including stocks, bonds and wealth-management products — are shrinking as the $11 trillion economy slows.Chinese real estate, meanwhile, has grown increasingly out of reach after a speculative boom sent domestic home prices to all-time highs. Residential property values in Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai all jumped more than 30% in the year through September, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.""Properties in Shanghai are ridiculously expensive,"" Chen Feng, 38, said as he evaluated prospects at a property fair in Shanghai in September, lured by television commercials for the event the night before. ""With the amount of money it takes to buy a small apartment here, I can buy a building of apartments in many places in the world.""That line of reasoning is nothing new, of course. Sydney, Vancouver, Hong Kong, London and a handful of other cities have long been popular destinations for Chinese buyers.The difference now is that those traditional hot spots are starting to lose their appeal, due to soaring prices and new measures to deter an influx of overseas money. In Hong Kong, the government enacted a 30% tax on foreign property owners this month after Chinese demand pushed home values toward record highs.The risk of similar measures in other cities can't be ruled out as politicians including President-elect Donald Trump tap into local discontent over rising living costs, according to CBRE Group's Barkham.Chinese buyers have responded by branching out to cheaper cities. In the U.S., they're increasingly searching for properties in Houston, Orlando and Seattle, which displaced San Francisco in the first quarter as the third-most-viewed U.S. market on Juwai.com, a Chinese search engine for offshore real estate.At the national level, countries in Southeast Asia have grown more popular. Juwai.com's queries on Thailand are surging at a 72% annual rate, helping it surpass Britain as one of the top five most-targeted destinations worldwide earlier this year.In Pattaya Beach, Chinese investors have snapped up 20% of the luxury condos on offer from Kingdom Property over the past year. The properties offer Gulf of Thailand views for as little as $120,000, or less than a quarter of what buyers would pay for a typical apartment in central Shanghai, according to Han Bing, a 30-year-old anchor in Chinese television shows who doubles as a sales agent for the Bangkok-based developer.""It's a cool bargain for a retirement plan,"" Han said.In the Malaysian state of Johor, across the northern border of Singapore, major Chinese builders including Country Garden Holdings, Greenland Holdings and Guangzhou R&F Properties are developing new projects. Country Garden agents handed out fliers for the firm's $37 billion Forest City development at the Beijing property fair in September, advertising permanent property rights, zero inheritance taxes, long-term residence visas and high-quality hospitals.One challenge for Chinese investors is getting money out of a country that caps individuals' foreign-currency purchases at $50,000 a year. While that limit hasn't always been strictly enforced, the yuan's slump is prompting policymakers to clamp down. This year, they've banned the use of friends' currency quotas, curbed on the cross-border activities of underground banks and asked lenders to reduce foreign-exchange sales.Still, alternative routes abound. Many business owners finance their homes through offshore trading companies, while some Chinese developers allow clients to pay for overseas units in yuan. Foreign-currency mortgages also play a role, helping to fund more than 80% of China's international property purchases, according to an estimate by Fang Holdings based on user searches and surveys.""Where there's a will, there's a way,"" said David Ley, a professor at the University of British Columbia who wrote a book on the flood of wealthy migrants from East Asia in the 1980s and 1990s.This year's purchases could be just the tip of the iceberg. Chinese holdings of global real estate, including commercial properties, will probably swell to $220 billion by 2020 from $80 billion in 2015, according to Juwai.com.As the first generation born after China's opening in the late 1970s approaches middle age, many of them want an overseas base for family members to travel, study and work. Chinese parents with children at foreign schools have been a major source of demand, accounting for an estimated 45% of cross-border buying, according to Fang Holdings.Zha Liangliang, a 31-year-old owner of commercial wheat farms in China's eastern Jiangsu province, said he purchased a $587,000 apartment in Sydney in August and plans to add five more before sending his children to high school in Australia. He's flying to the country this month to view homes and farmland, hoping to buy before the yuan weakens any further.For some investors, it's never too early to pull the trigger. Richard Baumert, a partner at Millennium Partners Boston, tells the story of a 33-year-old Chinese man who purchased a luxury home for his future children in August, convinced they're destined to attend one of the city's prestigious universities.The buyer shelled out $2.4 million for the property, Baumert said, unfazed by the fact that he's single and it could be two decades before he has kids old enough for college.MORE ABOUT HOMEBUYING:Return Of The Single Female HomebuyerAmerica's Foreclosure Activity Flares UpBest Homebuying Markets For Millennials

661,TAP,"Shares of Lending Club (LC) spiked Monday after the online lending platform reported Q3 results that beat estimates, said it didn't need investor incentives in September, and landed an investment deal worth up to $1.3 billion.That investment, from Credigy, a U.S. subsidiary of the National Bank of Canada, comes as Lending Club tries to diversify its funding after a difficult year. The money will be invested over the next twelve months, Lending Club said.The stock soared 15.2% to close at 5.91 in the stock market today. It hit an intraday high of 6.18 that put shares above their 200-day average for the first time ever.Shares have crumbled for much of the past year after a review of the company found staff financial misconduct, resulting in the ouster of the company's CEO and other top officials.Over that time, the company, like financial tech peer On Deck Capital (ONDK), has also contended with concerns about weaker loan-volume growth. Lending Club and Prosper this year have both announced layoffs, and the fintech industry has also faced concerns about insufficient regulatory oversight.IBD'S TAKE: An array of fintech startups could make managing your finances as easy as tapping your smartphone screen, and the shared ledger technology known as Blockchain could overhaul the way banks' back offices work to clear transactions. Large financial institutions are trying to keep up.Lending Club reported a third-quarter loss of 4 cents per share, better than expectations for a 7-cent loss. Revenue slipped 1.5% to $114.56 million, better than forecasts for $103.65 million.The company said that it entered September without the need for investor incentives, after offering them earlier this year in an attempt to prevent financial firms that buy Lending Club's loans from fleeing. Lending Club had said earlier that it hoped to end the incentives by year-end.Third-quarter loan originations rose 1% from the second quarter, but were still down 12% year over year.The company said that ""there is still work to be done"" and that costs remain ""elevated."" But it said the results, along with banks rejoining its platform, made management optimistic for the coming year.In attempt to tap the massive auto loan market, the company last month announced an auto refinancing product, which was set to debut with California residents and expand elsewhere in the U.S. early next year.Shares of OnDeck edged up 0.25%, and mobile payment company Square (SQ), which also offers small-business loans, added 0.3%.RELATED:How Will Lending Club's Problems Affect 2016 Fintech Funding?

662,TAP,"The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey index out Tuesday showed a steady, slow pulse for the factory sector, ticking up to 51.9 in October from 51.5 the prior month, slightly ahead of expectations.Yet the U.S. factory sector remains stuck in first gear, and that's not likely to change as automakers tap the brakes and interest rates edge higher.Meanwhile, the construction sector has stalled outright, dragged down by weak public-sector outlays. Total construction spending in September fell 0.4% from August and 0.2% from a year ago. That's the first year-over-year decline since 2011.Private construction spending fell 0.2% from August as a 1.0% drop in nonresidential spending offset a 0.5% rise in residential spending. In the past year, nonresidential spending has led the way, rising 4.1% vs. 0.9% for residential. Still, growth in private spending has been swamped by a 7.8% drop in public construction spending from a year ago.The ISM survey showed a pickup in production to 54.6 from 52.8, but there was less visibility into future production as the new orders index slipped 3 points to 52.1 and the gauge of order backlogs fell to 45.5 from 49.5. Readings above 50 signal expansion, while those south of 50 suggest contraction.On a positive note, the employment index rose to 52.9 from 49.7.While the overall ISM was only modestly above the 50 neutral level, a sixth rise in seven months is somewhat encouraging after weak overseas growth and a retrenchment in the oil patch led to a manufacturing contraction in the second half of 2015 and early this year.Even as health care and housing costs push up services inflation, plodding growth in the industrial side of the economy gives the Federal Reserve more leeway to leave interest rates low for longer, because factory slack limits pricing power. The Federal Reserve began a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday.Ford Motor (F) said last week that it would idle some plants or run fewer shifts to avoid a backup in inventories if U.S. auto sales slow in 2017, as it expects. This week, it was cutting one of three shifts at its F-150 pickup truck plant in Kansas City, Mo.Ford said late Monday that it won't release October U.S. sales later this week due to a Monday fire, knocking out power for data systems at its Dearborn, Mich., plant. Ford is expected to report that its sales in October fell 10.9% from a year ago, according to Edmunds' auto-information service.Still, overall U.S. sales are expected to match the highest level of the year, coming in at a 17.8 million-unit annual rate, though that would be another year-over-year decline.General Motors (GM) reported sales slipped 1.7% from a year earlier, but that was much better than the 6.3% drop expected by Edmunds.IBD'S TAKE: While the Federal Reserve is virtually certain to hike interest rates in December, the strengthening dollar may lead policymakers to spring another kind of surprise to avoid a repeat of what happened after the hike in December 2015.Several industrial companies have lowered their earnings guidance in recent weeks. Steel maker Nucor (NUE) said on Oct. 20 that profitability will ""decrease notably"" in the fourth quarter, not entirely due to regular seasonality. Nucor said its end markets are a mixed bag, with automotive remaining strong, but energy, heavy equipment and agricultural markets are still weak.The ISM survey showed that 10 of 18 manufacturing industries reported growth. Among survey respondents, positive comments came from the chemical sector, computer and electronics, fabricated metals, plastics and rubber — along with food, beverage and tobacco. Negative comments came from primary metals, where it was noted that production was down 20%, and transportation equipment.General Electric (GE) said on Oct. 21 that its comparable industrial orders fell 6% during the third quarter, though its digital and software orders rose 11%.United Technologies (UTX), Caterpillar (CAT) and 3M (MMM) all offered earnings outlooks below analyst estimates when they reported last week.One positive in the third-quarter GDP report released on Friday was a 10% rise in exports, the biggest since the fourth quarter of 2013. But that trend is unlikely to continue after the surge in the dollar vs. other currencies in October.RELATED:GM, Fiat Chrysler U.S. Sales Fall Less Then Feared; Ford DelayedNucor, Steel Dynamics Profit From Fewer ImportsGM, Caterpillar Fall Below Buy Points As Industrial Giants Guide Low

665,TAP,"Analysts have lowered expectations for Verizon Communications (VZ) ahead of its Q3 earnings report early Thursday, with Apple's (AAPL) rollout of the iPhone 7 expected to pressure profit margins for all four national wireless firms as a result of their promotional offers.Verizon Q3 revenue is expected to fall 6% from Q3 2015, to $31.08 billion, with EPS dropping 5% to 99 cents. Apple iPhone 7 promotions also are expected to pressure Q4 results for the wireless services companies.T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S) especially ramped up iPhone 7 trade-in offers in late September and are expected to lead in phone subscriber additions. AT&T (T) reports Q3 earnings on Oct. 27.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of AT&T and Verizon have dropped since they reported Q2 earnings, amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates, a negative for dividend-paying stocks. IBD's Big Cap 20 includes some dividend-paying companies.Yahoo (YHOO) reports earnings after the close Tuesday, but the web portal canceled its earnings conference call in light of its pending acquisition by Verizon.

The Dogs theory recommends investing annually in the 10 highest-yielding companies of the blue-chip index. The thinking is that these ""dogs"" may be oversold and likely to rebound in price.Research shows this strategy outperforms the overall stock market in the long term. It has inspired several ETFs including ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs (SDOG).Small believes investors may be rewarded with a similar-but-different approach using ETFs. It takes advantage of the granular exposure to specific regions and industries that ETFs offer. The goal is to find the ""Dogs of ETFs"" that have sold off irrationally but offer value relative to the market. This is what the process involves, using iShares ETFs as an example:Screen the list of funds using price returns rather than dividend yield as the traditional Dogs strategy and Dogs-based funds do. The poorest performers will include funds that are cheap or oversold. Some of these may offer an attractive opportunity.Small suggests investors evaluate the performance of funds over both the shorter term (year-to-date, for example) and longer periods (one, three and five years).For example, here's what investors can learn looking at the current iShares ETF dogs. The 25 worst-performing iShares ETFs year to date show two broad areas that have been beaten down: foreign developed markets and health care.Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) crumbled 27% through Nov. 3. and iShares MSCI Europe Financials (EUFN) 11%. Over the same period, iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV), which tracks the broad U.S. stock market, advanced 4%.To Small, IBB seems oversold for a sector with favorable intellectual properties and strong sales. The fund's 181 stock holdings include Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Biogen (BIIB).Its negative trend coincided with scrutiny of drug pricing ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. That could mean a rally is in store for drugmakers after the political risks abate.In the case of EUFN, a turnaround is likely to depend on monetary policy having its desired effects. It has 30% of its assets in the U.K., where Brexit continues to cause uncertainty, and 5% in Italy, embroiled in bank loan troubles.It's important to look at how long the fund declined, as well as how fast and deep that decline was. ""Factors such as magnitude and speed (of decline) are additional pieces of information that can help you round out the story and decide if this is an opportunity you want to tap,"" Small said.The idea behind this type of analysis is to decide whether the ETF losers were unduly punished, as well as when they might revert to what is more attractive or normal.""Some of these incredibly sold off investments might return very quickly (to the mean) and others might take a very long period of time,"" Small said, adding value investing often requires patience.That's why he suggests value investors should not only ask ""How much is that dog?"" but also think about how long it might take to get the dog trained.Put your ETF dogs in the opportunistic sleeve of your portfolio. That's the one you carve apart from your core holdings for higher growth investments.""To the extent you need to take higher risk, it's best to do it with a strategy that does some type of value seeking,"" Small said. In other words, do what is hard for most fund investors. Buy low and sell high.It's the opposite of the buy-high-and-sell higher strategy that CAN-SLIM investors know and love.The value of the ""Dogs of ETFs"" approach is that it requires investors to understand the underlying drivers of the portfolio holdings, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of funds research at CFRA. Basically, it makes investors buy an ETF looking forward, not backward.He considers past performance to be of limited value in predicting future performance in ETF investing.""You should not chase winners and you should not discard losers without understanding why those ETFs have performed the way they have,"" he said. ""An ETF performing well is not relevant to whether it can continue to rise.""An index-based ETF merely reflects the performance of the market it targets. Unlike the case with active mutual funds, index fund managers have no control over the stocks in the portfolio.Related:'Dogs' ETF Hits Record High With Dividend Portfolio

668,TAP,"Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) is set to report third-quarter earnings after the close Monday, but investors are more interested in how many subscribers it added in Q3.Netflix stock has been in a tug of war between bulls and bears lately over whether the company can continue to add new subscribers at a brisk pace or has hit a wall.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix stock has a middle-of-the-road IBD Composite Rating of 48. It is ranked No. 13 out of 19 stocks in IBD's Leisure-Movies & Related industry group. To see which company leads the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.In July, Netflix predicted that it would add 2.3 million subscribers in the September quarter, including 300,000 in the U.S. and 2 million in international markets. In the second quarter, Netflix badly missed its own new subscriber forecast, attracting 1.68 million new customers worldwide vs. its target for 2.5 million.As for top and bottom lines in Q3, Wall Street is modeling for Netflix to earn 6 cents a share, down 14% year over year, on sales of $2.28 billion, up 31%.For the December quarter, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are looking for Netflix to earn 7 cents a share, down 30%, on sales of $2.39 billion, up 31%.Netflix shares fell 1.65% to 99.80 on the stock market today. The stock fell as low as 98.38 intraday, finding support at its 50-day line, which has acted as support for most of the past two months.""Subscriber net adds will be what moves the stock after Q3 earnings,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham said in a research report Thursday. ""Last quarter, the company missed on both domestic and international total subs. Many concerns remain among investors, including around competition and international adoption.""He rates Netflix stock as buy, with a price target of 115.Third-quarter subscriber growth is expected to be negatively impacted by competition from the Summer Olympics in August and by customer churn in the U.S. from a delayed price increase to longtime subscribers.While subscriber growth was hampered in Q3, it should reaccelerate in Q4, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves said in a note Wednesday. Netflix also will start seeing traction in more international markets from its growing local language support, he said.Hargreaves rates Netflix stock as overweight with a price target of 125.Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter believes Netflix is overvalued. He rates the stock as underperform with a 12-month price target of 50.RELATED:Netflix U.S. Subscriber Estimate Cut On Price-Hike ImpactDeutsche Bank Hits Sell Button On Netflix Stock; Expectations Too High

670,TAP,"Tech companies — at least of the few of the real biggies — continue to be cash-generating machines, with Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) having the most cash and equivalents of all U.S. nonfinancial companies, says a new report from Moody's Investor Service.Moody's predicts that cash holdings for all U.S. nonfinancial companies will reach $1.77 trillion by year-end, up 5% from last year, with the tech sector remaining dominant.The top five cash holders are all tech companies: Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL). Together, Moody's projects, they will hold $587 billion, or 33% of the total nonfinancial corporate cash balance by the end of 2016. Cash figures include cash, cash equivalents and liquid marketable securities.Apple's cash holdings are expected to exceed $250 billion by year-end, or 14% of total nonfinancial corporate cash holdings.Microsoft will have $115 billion, with Alphabet at $85 billion, Cisco at $67 billion and Oracle at $68 billion.The technology sector's share of total cash will rise to 49% in 2016, up 4%.Most of the cash that companies have is generated and being held overseas. Moody's estimates that the amount of overseas cash will reach about $1.3 trillion, or 74% of total cash, in 2016. That's up from an estimated $1.2 trillion, or 72% of total cash, a year earlier.""Without tax reform that reduces the negative financial consequences of repatriating money to the U.S., we expect offshore cash levels to continue increasing,"" said Richard Lane, a Moody's senior vice president.Overseas cash from the top five tech companies is projected to reach $505 billion, or 86% of their total cash.Moody's said corporate cash holdings have more than doubled in the last 10 years, driven by rising cash levels at companies in the technology sector. Technology corporates now hold almost half of all cash that is held by U.S. nonfinancial companies.RELATED:Apple iPhone Grabs 104% Of Smartphone Industry Profit In Q3Microsoft Stock Rises To Record High As Cloud Leads Earnings Beat4 Top Stocks With Highest Dividend Growth RatesQ3 Bottom Line: Google A Cash Machine, Amazon A Free SpenderApple Loses Buy Point, Microsoft, BofA On Edge, Jobs On Tap: Investing Action Plan

671,TAP,"Apple's (AAPL) smartphone market share by unit shipments is declining, but it continues to dominate where it counts: profits.BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long estimates that Apple accounted for 103.6% of smartphone industry operating profits in the third quarter. Its share is over 100% because other vendors lost money in the business, resulting in Apple having more smartphone profit than the industry netted overall. In the year-earlier period, Apple grabbed 90% of smartphone profits, Long said in a research report Thursday.Apple was No. 1 by a mile in smartphone operating profit in Q3. Among major vendors, Samsung was No. 2 in smartphone profits with a tiny 0.9% share, he said. Money-losers in the smartphone business last quarter included LG and HTC, Long said.,IBD'S TAKE: Outside of Apple, the only way for investors to play the smartphone market is to invest in component suppliers. One such company, chipmaker Broadcom, is on the IBD 50 list of top stocks.Samsung ceded market share in smartphone shipments to Apple and Chinese vendors in the third quarter because of its Galaxy Note 7 troubles, Long said. He expects further share loss by Samsung in the current quarter.Apple captured over 100% of smartphone industry profits for the first time, thanks in part to Samsung's weaker results, Long said.Samsung had 21.7% of the smartphone market based on units sold in Q3, followed by Apple (13.2%) and Huawei (9.7%), BMO said.Global smartphone shipments rose 2.1% year over year to 346 million units in Q3, BMO estimates.Long predicts that smartphone unit shipments will grow at a compound annual rate of 2.6% from 2015 to 2019.""Emerging markets will dominate smartphone growth, at 4%, while developed markets will decline less than 1%,"" Long said.On Wednesday, Strategy Analytics reported that Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Android operating system captured its highest smartphone market share ever in the third quarter. Android accounted for 87.5% of global smartphone shipments in Q3, compared with Apple's iOS, with 12.1% market share.RELATED:Apple's iPhone Appears To Be Going The Way Of The MacChinese Smartphone Makers Take Share From Apple, SamsungApple Loses Buy Point, Microsoft, BofA On Edge, Jobs On Tap: Investing Action Plan

672,TAP,"Shale bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) said OPEC is losing its relevance as the U.S.'s expanding shale exploration efforts is making .Meanwhile, Carrizo Oil and Gas (CRZO) reported a surprise rise in third-quarter profit Thursday, while Apache's (APA) loss wasn't as bad as analysts feared. Plus, EOG Resources (EOG) is on tap after the market closes.During Continental's third-quarter conference call, Chief Executive Harold Hamm said no matter what the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries does at its meeting later this month, ""markets are at a turning point"" and that U.S. shale has made the cartel ""less relevant."" But earlier this week Goldman Sachs (GS) warned that oil prices could hit the low $40s per barrel if an OPEC agreement fails.U.S. crude fell 1.5% to $44.66 a barrel on Wednesday, its lowest close since Sept. 23.Despite current volatility in oil prices, Continental said it expects a ""a very strong"" 2017 but won't give full-year guidance until January. The company said more than 50% of the cost savings it's seeing is from operational restructuring and will stay with the company as it looks to complete drilled but uncompleted wells in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota.IBD'S TAKE: Continental is talking a bullish game about 2017 but oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell are taking more cautious capital expenditure outlooks for 2017.The company also said it bundled services for greater efficiencies and plans to continue negotiating packages as service providers look at raising prices. Earlier Halliburton (HAL) said it is still in a ""brawl"" on pricing with competitors.Late Wednesday Continental reported third-quarter results that fell short of Wall Street views. Continental shares fell 1.8% to 46.17 in the stock market today.Among shale producers that issued quarterly results Thursday, Carrizo's earnings jumped 15% to 23 cents a share, beating analyst views by 6 cents. But revenue fell 29.8% to $111.8 million. The company's overall oil and gas production rose 13% on strong results from assets in the Eagle Ford formation and Delaware Basin while oil production rose 4%.Carrizo raised its full-year oil production outlook to 25,350-25,500 barrels per day up from an earlier outlook of 25,150-25,400 barrels per day, due to increased production from its acquisition in the Eagle Ford from an affiliate of Sanchez Energy (SN). The company said it would add a third full time rig in early 2017 for use in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin.Shares jumped 3.55% to 34.41.Apache's per-share loss was only 3 cents vs. the 16 cents analysts were expecting and revenue also topped views.During the quarter, the company announced the discovery of the Alpine High play in the Delaware Basin. The mountainous region had previously been dismissed by hydraulic fracturing experts but Apache plans to spend more than a quarter of its $2 billion 2016 capital spending budget on the play.Apache said it will add three rigs in the Midland Basin in Q4 and would end the year at the high end of its North American onshore production guidance of 268,000-278,000 barrels per day.But shares plunged 6.6% to 55.52.EOG Resources late Thursday announced that it lost 35 cents a share, or 40 cents excluding various items. Revenue fell to $2.12 billion. Analysts had expected EOG swinging to a loss of 31 cents a share, with revenue down 11.1% to $1.93 billion.EOG raised its 2016 capital spending guidance and upped its 2020 production growth targets.EOG rose 2.3% to 94.20 late after closing up 1.25% to 92.08.RELATED: Biggest-Ever U.S. Oil Stockpile Jump Sends Price Back To $45

673,TAP,"Stocks bled again on Thursday, and losses were weighted more heavily in technology and certain medical sectors.Meanwhile, long-term government bond prices rose on both sides of the pond, sending the yield on the U.S. 10-year bond to around 1.8%. The 10-year U.K. bond yield edged back below 1.20% to around 1.18%, according to Tradeweb, after British judges ruled that only the U.K. Parliament can formally begin the process of the country's exit from the EU.Commodities fell, led by a 1.2% slide in West Texas intermediate crude oil futures to $44.78 a barrel. Gold edged 0.4% lower on the Comex, while silver slid 1.9%.The Nasdaq 100 fell 1%, a touch worse than the 0.9% drop by the Nasdaq composite.Apple (AAPL) fell slightly more than 1% to 109.83, dipping back below its 110.33 cup-with-handle breakout point for the first time since its Sept. 14 breakout in towering volume. That's a sell signal. Watch to see if the stock can hold close to that proper entry and begin a fresh rebound.With the market still in a pressured uptrend and distribution still heavy recently on both key indexes, it's not a surprise that other growth stocks have joined Apple in stumbling back near or below their prime entry points, especially in the field of medical devices.Abiomed (ABMD), down 1.6% to 102.51, has fallen nearly 30% in just four weeks. The heart pump innovator is back below a 105.05 cup-with-handle entry.Also in the medical sector, artificial joint replacement maker Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) edged 0.5% higher to 102.54, but only after having fallen more than 20% below its 52-week high; it's now hovering near 102, roughly 3% below a 105.58 entry in a long bottoming base. Zimmer earlier this week plummeted 14% after reporting a 9% rise in Q3 earnings to $1.79 a share. That marked the second quarter in a row of decelerating profit growth.Sales rose just 4% after the Warsaw, Ind., firm notched gains of 59%, 58%, 68% and 66% in the prior four quarters, thanks to a merger with Biomet that completed in June 2015.The S&P 500 dropped 0.4% as generic drug, medical services, drug wholesale, biotech and gaming stocks paced the decline. The Dow Jones industrials lost 0.2%. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is another market leader that has recently drifted back to prior buy point. In the regular session, the stock gained 1.8% to 43.37, returning back above a recent flat-base buy point at 43.25. The stock is also trying to reclaim its 50-day moving average.Wall Street saw the video game creator's quarterly profit doubling to 42 cents a share on a 51% pickup in revenue to $1.57 billion. After the close, Activision met that consensus estimate and exceeded its prior outlook of $1.49 billion, while non-GAAP earnings vaulted to 49 cents, crushing Wall Street's view by nearly 17%.The company reported 482 million monthly active users who logged more than 10 billion hours of play during the three-month period. CEO Bobby Kotick noted in a news release that its newest futuristic battle game franchise, ""Overwatch,"" has ""incredible player engagement"" and has topped 20 million players in four months.Activision also forecast Q4 net revenue at $1.86 billion, up 38% vs.  year ago. The stock initially fell nearly 3% in extended-hours trading but later rebounded to nearly break-even.Elsewhere in the stock market today, solar firms got trampled after former huge market winner First Solar (FSLR) reported a 46% plunge in third-quarter sales to $688 million, its worst year-over-year decline in more than three years.Earnings beat Wall Street views, yet still dropped 64% to $1.22 a share. The stock tanked 15% to 34.51, notching the lowest level since April 2013.Starbucks (SBUX), down 2% to 51.77, gained more than 1% after hours following news that the coffeehouse chain posted a 16% rise in non-GAAP earnings to 56 cents a share, including 6 cents stemming from an extra week of operation in the September-ended fourth quarter. Revenue grew 16% to $5.7 billion, and the company opened 690 net new stores, raising the total to 25,085 in 75 countries.The stock has been struggling since gapping lower on April 22 and losing support at both its 50- and 200-day moving averages. Starbucks holds a barely lukewarm Composite Rating of 66 on a scale of 1 to 99 in IBD Stock Checkup.RELATED:Apple Retreated Back To Its Breakout Price; Is It Time To Buy?Apple Loses Buy Point, Microsoft, BofA On Edge, Jobs On Tap: Investing Action PlanWhy The Bottoming Base Helps Growth And Value Investors Make MoneyGeneric-Drug Makers Crash On Report DOJ Plans Collusion ChargesHow To Handle Activision Blizzard Shares: Buy?

It had no debt and said it expected to have $900 million in cash at the separation, Yum China said in a statement last month, adding that it serves more than 2 billion customers annually.The separation makes Yum China a licensee of Yum Brands in China. Each Yum Brands shareholder has received one common share of Yum China for each common share of Yum Brands held as of Oct. 19.Yum China shares climbed 8% to 26.19 on the stock market today.

While Yum Brands and Yum China have separated, Domino's CEO predicts more consolidation among the crowded fast-casual pizza business. The separation, announced last October, came after Yum Brands, which operates Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell, contended with the fallout from a food-safety scandal and competition.New headwinds have come up.

682,TAP,"Tyler Technologies (TYL), New Oriental Education and Technology Group (EDU), Glaukos (GKOS) and TAL Education Group (XRS) were among the stocks breaking out on Thursday, while Apple (AAPL) supplier Broadcom (AVGO) continued to rally.Some of those made 52-week highs.TAL Education, a China-based educational services provider, broke out of a late-stage flat base in below-average volume. Shares leapt 10.3% to 70.36 on the stock market today, already extended from a 66.48 buy point. A stock is within buy range if it is 5% or less above a buy point.New buys are risky in the current market environment in any case.New Oriental, also a Chinese education company, jumped 6.8% to 48.35 Thursday. It is breaking out of a cup base with a 45.47 buy point, but shares were already extended from that pivot by the afternoon.Glaukos, a company that makes a tiny eye implant used for eye surgery, cleared a 36.60 buy point of a cup base on Thursday. Shares have jumped over the past week with little resistance so far, potentially meaning that the run-up isn't on solid footing.

683,TAP,"Boeing (BA) could cut 777 production even further if sales continue to slow, a move that would ""add pressure"" to its profit-margin target.But CEO Dennis Muilenburg said at an investor conference hosted by Morgan Stanley on Wednesday that the company's profit-margin target still wouldn't change, according to Reuters.Boeing shares fell 0.85% to 127.67 on the stock market today, a two-month closing low.The aerospace giant had already announced that it was cutting production of the widebody jet to seven per month in 2017, down from 8.3 per month currently. But that production pace is threatened by slumping sales. Boeing has only sold eight 777 jets year to date, well under its 40-50 annual sales target.""We need to be successful on some of those campaigns over the next two to three months to hold that seven-a-month rate structure,"" Muilenburg said at the conference. ""If we don't, we'll have to adjust.""IBD'S TAKE: Declining commercial sales have weighed on Boeing's stock. But the defense market is booming as Boeing, Lockheed Martin and other defense firms are battling for lucrative Pentagon aerospace contracts.Boeing hopes to maintain a certain level of output of its current-generation 777s to engineer a seamless transition on its production lines as workers shift to the next-generation 777X in the coming years. But customers have been reluctant to buy the older design, preferring to wait for the newer one.As Boeing makes the switch from the 777 to the newer 777X it will intentionally leave some production slots open so workers have time to transition into learning the mechanics of building the new model. But slowing down too much, and leaving large gaps in production, would cut into Boeing's profit.But European rival Airbus (EADSY) has struggled to deliver 50 A350s this year due to supply issues, potentially benefiting Boeing 777 and 787 sales.Airbus shares fell 1.5% to 14.84 Wednesday.RELATED: Boeing May Stretch 777 To Get Airbus A380 CustomersBoeing Plans More Midrange Planes To Tap Trans-Atlantic, China MarketsBoeing: China Will Be First $1 Trillion Aviation MarketBoeing Eyes Options For Larger 737 Max 9 To Challenge A321neo

684,TAP,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) on Monday urged the Federal Reserve to ""just raise rates"" and touted its popularity with mobile-oriented millennials.JPMorgan argued in a presentation that it is outperforming rivals in attracting millennials, with more from that generation gravitating toward its Chase checking, savings or credit-card accounts than toward Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC).The bank's attempt to position itself as the top choice for millennials, who now outnumber baby boomers, comes as big financial institutions try to offer more mobile services to tap the spending of an increasingly smartphone-oriented portion of the population that manages more of its money online.""Millennials make up the majority of our new deposit customers, and we lead competitors in primary relationships with millennials,"" according to slides accompanying a presentation given at the Barclays Global Financial Services conference.Fifty-seven percent of Chase's recent checking-account acquisitions have come from the millennial population, Gordon Smith, CEO of Consumer & Community Banking, said in the presentation.Twenty-two percent of millennials preferred Chase as their primary financial institution for checking and savings accounts, compared to 19% with Bank of America and 14% with Wells Fargo, the presentation said, citing research that TNS Retail Banking Monitor conducted from Q2 2015 to Q1 2016. The figures and rankings were similar for credit-card accounts. Active mobile users had risen 18% during the first half of the year.Smith's presentation materials also said mobile payment services like Apple (AAPL) Pay had yet to fully take off but added that Chase wanted to be ""wherever our consumers want to spend.""He also remained upbeat on the economy, adding he was ""not seeing customers taking on excessive levels of debt"" and that he was not concerned about a slight rise in credit-card 30-day delinquencies and net charge-offs. Mortgage delinquencies and net charge-offs had continued to trend downward, company data showed.Smith's remarks about the economy echoed comments made earlier in the day by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who urged the Fed to move ahead with raising rates during an event at the Economic Club of Washington.After contending that that the U.S. economy was ""actually doing OK,"" Dimon said that ""twenty-five basis points is a drop in the bucket."" He added: ""Let's just raise rates.""JPMorgan shares finished 0.6% higher in the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks have rallied on more bullish remarks from Fed officials. While few are buys right now, read this story to find out which bank stocks are buys. Bank of America shares rose 1%, while Wells Fargo fell 0.4%, finding support at its 50-day average.Last week, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $190 million to settle fraud charges that included thousands of bank employees opening fake accounts with customers' money.

Shares dropped again Tuesday by 1.2% to 171.10. Even with the decline, the stock is still holding well above its 50-day line.The losses come after Broadcom issued a beat-and-raise quarter late Thursday. But at least eight analysts hiked their price targets on Broadcom stock in the wake of the report.Another top-rated chipmaker, Silicon Motion Tech, is approaching a consolidation base buy point of 56.31.

691,TAP,"After mobile messaging-app and gaming company Line Corp. (LN) -- which some have called Japan's Facebook (FB) -- went public in July, its plans to become a better social media outlet have drawn equal amounts of praise and concern as bigger rivals consolidate their power elsewhere. As Facebook has extended its reach over the Western world, Tokyo-based Line has become an immensely popular way to communicate in Japan and elsewhere in Asia. The end result of at least 15 years of tech mergers of Eastern Asian firms, Line was able to stake its claim largely because it showed up early to tap an increasingly smartphone-oriented population. Now, Line hopes the 200 million-plus users it has amassed -- along with advertisers -- will stick around as the company bulks up its online game offerings and focuses on targeted advertising that tries to engage the individual needs of its users.""It's done well to add features and functionality, including the (emojilike) stickers, games, and so on to make it more unique and distinct in the market too,"" Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, said in an email.In doing so, Line hopes to become not just a destination for gaming and sharing experiences with others, but a place to go to read news, hail rides, and make electronic payments and restaurant reservations.""All you need are a few hit games, like 'Pokemon Go' or something like that,"" Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, told Investor's Business Daily. ""If you can hit one of those things, I think that will get a lot of people into your ecosystem and keep them there."" As of March, Line had made its way into the lives of around 82% of Japan's smartphone users, Nomura estimates. The company's monthly active users in its other core markets -- Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia -- have grown for three consecutive years as of the first quarter. Total average monthly active users could reach 263.5 million by 2020, Nomura also forecasts.More recently, Line's shares have gotten a lift after the company's second-quarter results, which showed increased profits, solid revenue growth and lower marketing costs, Dawson said. Nomura forecasts ""major margin improvement owing to advertising sales growth and lower costs"" next year. The stock has seesawed since coming public this summer but maintains an IBD Composite Rating of 67 out of a best-possible 99. As messaging's popularity grows, the stock could benefit from being a purer play in that business than others.After going public in July, Line's stock price has been choppy as investors have tried to sort out where the company is headed. Shares have swung wildly between 36 and 48 in the six weeks since the company's IPO. Shares gapped up roughly 4.4% to 44.06 on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Line Corp. broke out of a short IPO base last month, but has since pulled back and on Thursday erased much of the gains made in August before surging again Friday and Tuesday. Other recent IPOs, like Amplify Snack Brands, have fared better. You can also learn more about investing in IPOs here. ""Part of what's driven the stock is that Line is about the only major public company where you can invest directly in the growth of messaging,"" Dawson said. ""At Facebook and Tencent (TCEHY), it's part of much bigger companies, and several other messaging apps are also either part of bigger companies or privately held.""Line generates revenue from advertising materials that companies can send directly to the messaging app's users. The company also makes money when users pay to download its emoji-like ""stickers,"" which users on Line's messaging app send one another as a shorthand form of expression. Stickers depict scores of characters in a variety of forms, from ""Star Wars"" to ""South Park"" to Line's own creations -- Brown and Cony, a cartoon bear and rabbit, respectively. Users can pay for different sets of stickers that they can then message to others, and advertisers can pay the company to create and promote sponsored stickers.The company also brings in a huge amount of revenue from game sales. Since last year, ""a steady 7-8 of the games released by Line in Japan, including both in-house and third-party games, have been among the 100 best-selling games for the (Apple) iOS platform,"" Nomura analyst Yoshitaka Nagao wrote in a research note in August.Overall, Line's communication and content offerings, which include chat, nonsponsored stickers and games, accounted for 69.8% of revenue last year, with ad-related services making up the rest, according to Nomura. Rao said Line hopes to even out that ratio by strengthening its advertising efforts, and that its recently introduced targeted ads will be an important metric to watch next year. The smartphone market in Line's four core countries isn't fully saturated, and developments in broadband connectivity in emerging markets where Facebook hasn't taken hold give the company a chance to claim new territory, analysts say.While Line's shares jumped after the company debuted, worries have grown over whether tighter media control in some areas and rivals' strongholds in others could shut the company out of expanding in certain regions. Management from Line did not respond to a request for an interview for this story. ""Everyone is always afraid of missing out on the next Facebook,"" Rao said of Line's IPO. He added: ""But I think when you really pull the covers off this, you see that there are challenges ahead.""Analysts say that Line doesn't do anything that's dramatically different from other social-media companies. And while it's strong in Japan, Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia, its overall user base is dwarfed by Facebook's WhatsApp messaging service. Further, Line is blocked in China, cutting it out of one of the world's largest economies currently undertaking a massive upgrade to its fiber-optic infrastructure to boost internet speeds.A closer look at the numbers by Jackdaw Research published in June also uncovers potentially deeper flaws. After peaking at nearly 40 million users in 2014's fourth quarter, monthly active users for Line's games had slid for more than a year, Dawson wrote in commentary dated in June. Game and messaging-app downloads had also begun to slip, he wrote then, and messaging volumes showed signs of topping out. Monthly active user growth has decelerated in Japan and fallen outside of Line's core countries, Dawson also noted. Some of that decline is due to Line's decision to focus on its core markets, given Facebook's reign elsewhere. ""But it also highlights a big challenge: Unlike Facebook and WhatsApp, which have global audiences, and WeChat, which has a massive domestic audience, Line's dominance is spread across four markets, none of which is large enough to compete with the global leaders,"" Dawson wrote in a research note in June.Nomura contends that the company's decision to build up its core areas is a smart one.""In these areas -- especially in English- and Spanish-speaking countries -- Facebook's WhatsApp already is benefiting from the network effect (where one added user makes the product valuable to other users), making it increasingly difficult for other players to make inroads in these areas,"" Nagao wrote.Still, Nagao, despite short-term optimism, said that after two years of solid sales growth, ""a clear profit growth driver is then lacking"" from 2018 on.""We think that sustained profit growth over the medium term would require: (1) progress with monetization in Indonesia and Thailand; (2) business development in new markets such as Saudi Arabia and Iran; and (3) the construction of a new business models beyond the realm of games, stickers, and advertising,"" Nagao said.Dawson said that some of the novelty for stickers could be wearing off, as users in some markets simply gravitate elsewhere.""You go and spend time where your friends are,"" Dawson said, ""and if your friends are all on Facebook, WhatsApp, WeChat, or elsewhere, you're going to spend time there rather than on Line.""

701,TAP,"Do you find yourself doing more and more of the mundane tasks of life online -- buying groceries, filing a tax return, depositing a check, refilling a prescription? Here's something you need to know as ETF investors: So are businesses.That could mean exciting opportunities for those looking for successful investing ideas.Technology ETFs come in all stripes. The biggest and most popular tech exchange traded funds offer broad exposure to a sector that's been a winner for portfolios over the long term. A crop of smaller ETFs is worthy of attention too. They target specific tech industry niches that are gaining momentum after a sluggish year.As American companies make the great migration to the cloud, the computer software group is sizzling. Paycom Software (PAYC), which provides human-resources services via the cloud, has grown earnings an average 117% over the last three quarters. Veeva Systems (VEEV), which helps pharma and biotech companies sell and market their products over the cloud, has done a stellar job keeping down debt as it grew sales and profits over the last three years.Other highly rated IBD stocks in this group include Atlassian (TEAM), Ellie Mae (ELLI), CyberArk Software (CYBR), Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and NetEase (NTES).IShares North American Tech-Software (IGV) is the largest of at least three ETFs that are thematic plays on the computer software industry. It hit an all-time closing high of 112.12 on the stock market Monday.This cap-weighted ETF has $775 million in assets and a 0.48% expense ratio. It holds 59 stocks, with the biggest stakes in tech giants Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE). It also has smaller positions in the likes of gaming company Activision and e-mortgager Ellie Mae.IGV has gained 6.1% in the third quarter through Aug. 12. Year to date, it is up 8.4%.Peers include PowerShares Dynamic Software Portfolio (PSJ), which skews toward smaller growth companies. This ETF aims to outperform by screening stocks based on risk factors, style classification and stock valuation, according to ETF.com.Paycom, Veeva and RealPage (RP), which caters to the rental housing market, are to be found in this portfolio. PSJ is outperforming its larger software-focused rival with a 7.8% gain this quarter and 12.6% gain so far in 2016. But it's thinly traded.The enterprise-computer software group ranks No. 6 among 197 industry groups tracked by IBD; it was No. 13 four weeks ago. The specialty enterprise computer software group has climbed from No. 120 to No. 13 over the same period.Shifting tech trends are also benefiting companies directly involved in the flow of electronic information. At least three stocks from the internet networking group make the elite IBD 50 list for their top-notch technical and fundamental metrics -- Gigamon (GIMO), LogMeIn (LOGM) and Rackspace Holdings (RAX).PowerShares Dynamic Networking Portfolio (PXQ) invests in 30 U.S. networking companies. These are typically internet-focused companies that support the ever-expanding flow of electronic communications, including voice, data, images and commerce.PXQ hit a 52-week high Monday. Its holdings include Gigamon, whose products help to optimize the reliability, performance and security of network infrastructure. With 72% average EPS growth over the last three quarters, Gigamon is top ranked in IBD's network-solutions group.The ETF also holds LogMeIn, which gives users remote access to their computers and mobile devices.PXQ  invests in companies that hold the potential to outperform based on their perceived quality and price and earnings momentum, but its trading volume and bid-ask spreads beg closer attention. It has $20.54 million in assets and a 0.63% expense ratio.A nearly 14% jump this quarter puts it ahead of most of its tech ETF peers and marks a sharp rebound after two down quarters. Year to date, the fund is up 8.1%.The internet/network-solutions group ranks No. 39 among the IBD industry groups vs. No. 69 four weeks ago.

702,TAP,"Gilead Sciences' (GILD) nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) drug is ""clearly active and promising,"" but Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) remains one to two years ahead, RBC analyst Michael Yee said after Gilead, the No. 2 biotech by market cap, unveiled promising efficacy data.Gilead's Selonsertib aims to inhibit apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, a protein tied to NASH, diabetic kidney disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Of 72 patients enrolled in Gilead's 24-week phase-two study, 43% showed at least some improvement in fibrosis, the company said.That jibes with the results of Intercept's earlier NASH study, in which 35% to 40% of patients had a positive response vs. 20% on the placebo track, Yee wrote.Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA), which is being acquired by Allergan (AGN), also is active in the NASH market. In a recent study, 20% saw improvement in fibrosis using Tobira's drug.But Intercept has a healthy lead over Gilead and Tobira/Allergan, Yee says. All three are vying for a NASH market worth a potential $2 billion to $5 billion. Intercept should see key data in 2018-2019, but its rivals will likely have to wait until 2019-20, he says.""From a competitive landscape this is not shocking that there are NASH drugs that are starting to show promise and move into late stage,"" Yee wrote. ""Intercept is still one to two years ahead and will have data (in) 2018-2019.""Thursday's news did little for Gilead stock on Friday. On the stock market today, Gilead fell 3 cents to 74.28. Shares are down 26% for the year, as IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group has fallen 22%.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead is on tap to report its Q3 earnings on Nov. 1. Some biotechs are on deck next week, including Biogen, Celgene and Amgen.

703,TAP,"In a darkened master bedroom, David Kaiserman stood in shirtsleeves next to a turned-down king bed. ""Good morning, Siri,"" he said to the iPad in his hand, and the lights went on while the blackout shades retracted.""Your home is ready to rise and shine,"" the virtual assistant replied.Inside this four-bedroom stucco house in Alameda, Calif., Kaiserman, president of the technology division at construction company Lennar (LEN), was pitching a vision of a home controlled via iPhone or iPad.Tap your phone, and AC/DC's ""Back in Black"" blasts. Tap again, and the bath runs at a blissful 101 degrees. Sweet, right? Of course, your dad might view it as a bit over the top. All told, $30,000 worth of gadgets and gizmos were on display here, many run with Apple's free HomeKit app.As iPhone sales growth  slows, Apple (AAPL) is teaming up with a handful of builders and using these kinds of test beds to inch its way into the market for Internet-connected home furnishings, a nascent field that has attracted rivals like Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Amazon.com (AMZN).The gamble is that pricey wireless home devices will be an easier sell when bundled into the home itself. Builders market granite countertops and brushed-nickel fixtures at thousands of model homes across the U.S. Why not video doorbells?Unlike Google and Amazon, however, Apple isn't hawking hardware meant to connect the home. Instead, the HomeKit app could increase the value of its iOS ecosystem — and make it tougher for users to switch to Android phones and tablets.""We want to bring home automation to the mainstream,"" said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of product marketing. ""The best place to start is at the beginning, when a house is just being created.""The convenience on display in the Alameda stucco doesn't come cheap. A single motorized, battery-operated Lutron shade starts at $349. Or consider the Schlage ""touch-screen deadbolt,"" which can be controlled remotely, so you can text an unexpected visitor a code. It can retail for $200. A regular deadbolt fetches $32 at Home Depot (HD) -- and there's always hiding a key under the flower pot.In Fremont, Calif., about 15 minutes from Facebook's (FB) headquarters, Los Angeles-based KB Home (KBH) is also getting its own Apple house ready. Along with the automated thermostat, lights, security system, locks, fans and shades, it lets you, on voice command, change the color of the light underneath a vanity.With the words ""good night,"" the light turns purple. With a ""good morning,"" it switches to white.KB offers wireless devices as upgrades. A basic package runs about $2,000, ""which once rolled into a mortgage is pennies a month,"" according to spokesman Craig LeMessurier. Lennar builds the cost into the price of homes. The Alameda house sells for $1.2 million, though it was a beta model and an actual dwelling wouldn't include $30,000 worth of gadgets.Apple is also working with Brookfield Residential Properties (BRP) and other builders. The companies declined to say when the homes would go on sale.Consumers will buy about $24 billion worth of connected home devices in 2016, according to Strategy Analytics. Though that's a drop in the bucket compared with smartphones, the research and consulting firm expects those sales to nearly double by 2020.For most people, connected homes remain a ways off, said Jonathan Gaw, an analyst with research firm IDC. The proliferating devices remain difficult to install in older homes and, in some cases, seem useless. Gaw cites the wireless candle he saw the other day.""Give me a break,"" he said. ""That only hurts the message. It tells people that we have gone too far. There's too much crap out there, it's only diluting stuff that's really cool.""Even some who sell such gadgets say the hype may be getting ahead of the reality. The discount retailer Target (TGT) opened its own Target Open House showroom a year ago in San Francisco. Shoppers walk through a futuristic home, watching prerecorded displays projected onto its transparent acrylic walls and furniture.In the nursery, a baby wears a Wi-Fi onesie — made by a company called Mimo, founded by whizzes from MIT. It tracks the infant's breathing, skin temperature, sleep and body position. When she stirs, it triggers the home's lights, turns on soothing music on the Sonos wireless speakers and even tells the coffee maker downstairs to start brewing java for red-eyed parents.You can pick one up for $199. Many parents brew the coffee themselves and let their babies wail — or buy a traditional baby monitor for as little as $19.99. Connected home devices can cost five times the price of the old-fashioned version, according to Target spokeswoman Jenna Reck.""The smart home will get there but it's not there yet,"" Reck said. ""Adoption is happening even slower than people predicted.""As with all things tech, there is the matter of glitches, frustration and complexity. Markus Giesler, 40, equipped his 1924 house with an Apple home system so he could be a subject for his own academic research at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Canada.When the associate professor of marketing pulls up to the house in his BMW, the GPS on his phone alerts the garage door to open and turns on lights in various colors and brightness throughout his home, depending on his preferences and the time of day. At least, in theory, they do.""Certain devices obey, and some do not,"" Giesler said.Homebuilders started offering smart devices such as automatic locks and thermostats more than five years ago. In its current model homes, Miami-based Lennar works with a company called Nexia, a unit of Ingersoll-Rand (IR).Lennar's Kaiserman hopes working with Apple will have a ""halo effect,"" helping convince customers that a new home in a subdivision can be a ""cool"" alternative to an existing one.No doubt, Apple would be heartened by the experience of Ken Bieber. Last year, Bieber, a 39-year-old executive at a consulting firm, bought a $357,000 Lennar smart home after visiting a model north of Tampa, Fla.With his Nexia system, his lights automatically start dimming in the evening, signaling that it's time to get ready for bed. When his wife, April, went into labor two months ago, he stayed with her in the hospital and texted a temporary entry code to a friend who walked the dog.Since buying his house, Bieber has spent another $1,000 for wireless motion detectors, a video camera and controls for his light dimmers, ceiling fans and irrigation system.Neighbors ask him for advice on their own smart-home device purchases, and he plans to add motorized blinds.""I'll be watching a movie and suddenly I have to get up and pull blinds — apparently it's just too much for me at that point,"" Bieber said. ""I'm so used to saying things and they just happen.""Related:No Need To Ask Jeeves When You Can Ask Apple, Amazon, Facebook, GoogleHomebuilder Confidence Cools As Housing Market Takes A BreakApple iPhone 7 Makes Big Q3 Impact In Just 2 Weeks Of Sales

704,TAP,"Proofpoint (PFPT) isn't your daddy's spam protector.The highly-rated cybersecurity firm jumped to the cloud in 2008. And within three years of its April 2012 initial public offering, Proofpoint launched social and mobile products that, today, are swiping share from rivals Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Symantec (SYMC).CEO Gary Steele credits Proofpoint's nimble nature, which he says hasn't changed since it was a venture capital-backed Silicon Valley newbie in 2002 with 10 employees. Now, Proofpoint boasts more than 1,300 staffers.""In a world where you're in an ongoing war against bad actors, we have to be nimble and responsive to the changes we see in the marketplace,"" he told IBD. ""And I think that's one of the things that has truly distinguished the company.""Proofpoint on Friday cleared a 76.93 buy point from a short consolidation, climbing 0.9% to 77.20 on the stock market Friday, but in light volume. Proofpoint rose 0.4% to 77.50 in Monday trade in above-average volume.Proofpoint stock has surged 19% year to date, outplaying IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group, down nearly 8%. But the group, too, is seeing a resurgence and ranks No. 30 out of 197 industries tracked, up from No. 191 over 13 weeks.IBD'S TAKE: Proofpoint is ranked No. 4 in IBD's security software group. Go to IBD Stock Checkup to find the top three cybersecurity stocks -- and how they stack up vs. Proofpoint.That's because cybersecurity spending is taking a larger-than-expected chunk of total IT spending, Dougherty analyst Catharine Trebnick says. Panic spending forced valuations to rocket in 2015 and the first half of 2016 couldn't keep up.But the second half is turning out to be a different story, Trebnick told IBD.""You're seeing in IT spending, security is still a No. 1 priority,"" she said. ""And in this whole security area, email is the No. 1 threat vector. It's also the place where people feel they have control over their network.""And that's where Proofpoint is winning, she says.Proofpoint got its start as a spam-blocker. But today's hackers are less interested in selling a ""Rolex"" and more interested in credential theft. Thus, social engineering is at the heart of most attacks.Such was the case in February and March when Seagate Technology (STX) and Snapchat were duped into dispensing thousands of W-2 forms. Seagate's breach came down to a phishing attack whereas Snapchat was duped by a spoofed email.Both are nascent email cons. Phishing emails contain legitimate-sounding requests for information. Spoofing changes a key figure in an email address. So in Snapchat's case, CEO Evan Spiegel's last name could have been spelled with the number 1.""The email threat vector is really vulnerable,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski told IBD. ""It's easier to trick a human into clicking a link than it is to write sophisticated malware.""Since January 2015, businesses lost a collective $3.1 billion in email compromise schemes across the globe, the FBI found. Last year, 30% of targeted people opened a malicious email, according to a recent Verizon study.Proofpoint's targeted attack protection (TAP) aims to solve that equation by filtering out malware-ridden emails before they arrive in the inbox. And for spear-phishing and spoofing, last Wednesday Proofpoint announced the $18 million acquisition of Return Path's email fraud protection business.Last year, industry tracker Gartner predicted TAP, data loss prevention and encryption would continue driving secure email gateway (SEG) growth. Overall, the SEG segment is expected to sustain 2%-4% growth annually over the next several years.""The SEG market is mature. The penetration rate of commercial SEG solutions is close to 100% of enterprises,"" Gartner wrote. ""Despite the market maturity, companies can't do without SEG solutions. ... Despite the low overall growth, we do see individual vendors that are taking market share.""A Piper Jaffray survey of resellers found Proofpoint is most often beating out Cisco and Symantec, with FireEye's (FEYE) on-premises solution trailing, Nowinski told IBD. Mimecast (MIME), which filed its IPO last year, targets small and midsize businesses (SMBs), while Proofpoint's focus is larger companies and enterprises.Proofpoint is outgrowing Cisco and Symantec. In 2015, Proofpoint grew its sales 31%, leading 16% growth in Cisco's security segment. Symantec shrank 10%, though its Blue Coat Systems acquisition will likely help it grow this year.""Cisco is really pushing their security angle,"" Dougherty's Trebnick said. ""They're trying to establish a bundle, but I wouldn't say they have any new function or features. Only Proofpoint and Mimecast have whaling (spoofing) detection. ... Cisco is late to the game.""The proof is in the pudding for Proofpoint, Rosenblatt analyst Marshall Senk said in an Aug. 1 research report. During Q2, Proofpoint hit ""an inflection point,"" crushing Wall Street's sales, earnings, billings and free cash flow projections, and hitting profitability two quarters ahead of time.Revenue growth accelerated for a second straight quarter, to 41%, its best gain in seven quarters.Beyond that, Proofpoint expects to hit $1 billion in annual sales by 2020. To do that, the company would have to maintain a 20%-32% compound annual growth rate. Since 2013, Proofpoint has grown an average 37% annually. Sales have grown by more than a third for the past 11 quarters.It's also beaten sales expectations by an average of 4.3% for the past eight quarters. It has met or topped EPS minus items views for the last seven of eight quarters. Nowinski credits Proofpoint's keen forecasting skill to the fact 97% of its sales stem from subscriptions.""The average contract length is between 15 and 22 months,"" he said. ""They have two years of visibility already from all the contracts they've been signing.""Perhaps the biggest tailwinds for Proofpoint stem from cooperation. Earlier this summer, Proofpoint announced partnerships with Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Splunk (SPLK), CyberArk Software (CYBR) and Imperva (IMPV) for technical integration.The partnerships open Proofpoint up to nonoverlapping customer bases like Palo Alto Networks' 26,000 customers, Wells Fargo analyst Gary Powell wrote in a July 25 research report. Meanwhile, Intel (INTC) McAfee is obsoleting its services and recommending customers to Proofpoint.Nowinski models an $80 million to $100 million McAfee opportunity for Proofpoint. Steele wouldn't put a dollar-figure on the potential windfall. Dougherty's Trebnick expects it to be a five-year push.On top of that, the transition to Microsoft (MSFT) Office 365 adds another three- to four-year charge. Microsoft launched its cloud-based Office 365 in 2011. But only about 13% of all publicly listed firms have made the switch to cloud-based office systems, Trebnick says. It has online threat protection built in, and offers sandboxing on its enterprise model, but doesn't include spoofing protection.""CIOs (chief information officers) say that there's too much latency with (Microsoft's) new products, so they'd rather choose the (enterprise) version with either the Mimecast piece of it or install the Proofpoint piece,"" she said. ""They work in conjunction.""RELATED:Palo Alto Seen Tightening 2017 Guidance On Cisco RivalryProofpoint Battens Against Spoofers, Phishers With $18 Million BuyProofpoint Hits Stratosphere On EPS Beat, First-Ever ProfitCisco Tests Palo Alto, Check Point; CyberArk, Proofpoint Niches Safe

706,TAP,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) tellers, Starbucks (SBUX) baristas and Wal-Mart (WMT) cashiers have all received a significant bump up in pay in recent months, and the latest round of earnings calls from Corporate America shows that they have plenty of company.In recent weeks, Wendy's (WEN), Ross Stores (ROST), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and others have said they're paying more as they compete for top talent, incentivize performance and keep up with minimum wage laws.The broad upward pressure on wages is still fairly modest, but it appears to be picking up, based on the latest Treasury data on federal income and employment taxes withheld from paychecks. In the past four weeks through Aug. 19, withheld taxes rose 4.7% from a year earlier, the fastest pace since the start of November.The data, which are roughly consistent with 2% growth in aggregate hours worked and 2.7% higher wages, still don't qualify as robust. By comparison, withheld taxes rose about 5.5% from a year earlier during the first half of 2015, and growth exceeded 7% for most of 2006.Yet the upward trend is worth watching, both because it could signal stronger consumer activity and because it could shift the Federal Reserve's view of the economy and the interest-rate outlook.IBD'S TAKE: With wage growth picking up, investors may want to focus on companies with a strong enough position in their markets to withstand labor inflation without suffering a hit to profit margins. Read this Investor's Corner on profit margins.Still, a continued acceleration in income growth isn't a sure thing. After weak productivity gains in recent years, companies are doing their best to do more with less by driving efficiencies, from managing inventory better at Wal-Mart to adopting self-pay kiosks at some Wendy's franchises.Here's what companies have been saying about labor costs:RELATED:Wal-Mart CEO: Sam's Club Shoppers Can Skip CashierFast Food Prices Have Never Risen So Fast Vs.

707,TAP,"Verizon Communications (VZ) may think twice about scuttling its planned acquisition of Yahoo over a massive email breach because of Yahoo's improved free cash flow in Q3 financial results, says one analyst.Yahoo (YHOO) late Tuesday reported Q3 profit that topped expectations and in-line revenue. Verizon in July agreed to purchase Yahoo for nearly $6 billion, including employee stock costs. But, Verizon is reportedly seeking to renegotiate the deal because of an email breach involving over 500 million accounts.Dan Salmon, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, doesn't think Verizon will walk away.Yahoo churned out $167 million in free cash flow in Q3, up from $18 million in the year earlier period. Verizon's purchase of Yahoo excludes the now-$7.7 billion in cash on the web portal's balance sheet as well as its 15% stake in Alibaba Group (BABA).But, Verizon should be able to create operating synergies by combining Yahoo with its AOL business, says Salmon. He expects Yahoo's improved FCF generation to keep Verizon from scuttling the deal.""We think this trend will be important to getting Verizon to the finish line as it has a unique opportunity to optimize cash flow even further by combining with AOL,"" Salmon said in a report.IBD'S TAKE: Yahoo stock traded at a 15-month high in September owing to its stake in China's Alibaba Group. Alibaba on Tuesday was added to IBD's Leaderboard of fast growing stocks. The Chinese online retailer is approaching its 2014 record high, following its IPO.Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer has been cutting costs.According to Yahoo, its stake in Alibaba Group was valued at $40.6 billion as of Sept. 30, up from $22.6 billion a year earlier. Yahoo also owns a 35% stake in Yahoo Japan, with SoftBank the biggest shareholder.In Q3, Yahoo said non-GAAP earnings rose 33% to 20 cents per share, with revenue climbing 7% to $1.305 billion. Analysts had projected EPS minus items of 14 cents and revenue of $1.306 billion.The web portal canceled its conference call to discuss earnings in the wake of its pending acquisition by Verizon.Yahoo shares rose 2.5% to 42.73 on the stock market today. Verizon, which reports Q3 earnings Thursday before the open, rose a fraction, as did Alibaba.RELATED:Yahoo Earnings Top Estimates, Revenue In Line; Stock RisesVerizon Q3 Earnings Drop Expected: Apple, Yahoo Updates On TapAlibaba Price Target Raised As Product Delivery Network GrowsYahoo Stock Rises On Alibaba Stake; Is Tax-Efficient Deal Doable?

714,TAP,"Square (SQ) reports earnings after the close Wednesday, with analysts looking for an update on its newest offering -- loans to small business that use its payments processing system -- and an update on its food delivery business.San Francisco-based Square makes credit card readers that plug into mobile phones and tablets. Adjusted revenue growth appears to be slowing, though Square could be a takeover candidate, analysts say.Analysts estimate Square will report a wider non-GAAP loss of 11 cents per share vs. a 9 cent loss in the year-earlier period. Adjusted revenue -- sales minus transactions with Starbucks (SBUX) and other partners -- is expected to rise 43% to $157.8 million, with net revenue growing 31% to $406 million.""We are expecting Q2 adjusted revenue of $158 million, slightly above guidance, reflecting our bullish payment-processing outlook,"" said Josh Beck, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, in a research report.""The bigger question in our mind is 'What could the business look like next year?',"" he added, referring to new lending initiatives and the food delivery business.In Q1, Square's adjusted revenue jumped 64% to $146 million.In the September quarter, analysts estimate adjusted revenue growth of 39% to $164 million, with a narrower 10 cent per-share loss vs. a 16 cent loss in Q3 2015.IBD'S TAKE: Jack Dorsey has been serving as CEO of both Square and Twitter, which last week reported disappointing Q2 results. Some analysts question whether Dorsey can lead both companies effectively. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Square Capital, which has provided short-term financing to small businesses, began offering small loans in March through a partner bank.Square acquired food delivery startup Caviar for $90 million in 2014 and has been expanding that business.

716,TAP,"Oilfield service providers Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB) likely didn't see any pricing improvements in the third quarter, but if U.S. oil stays around $50 per barrel, activity in North America will increase in the fourth quarter.Analysts see Halliburton reporting a 7-cent-per-share loss, swinging from a 31-cent-per-share gain in the year-ago quarter when it announces results Wednesday. Revenue is seen falling 30.3% to $3.89 billion.Schlumberger's earnings are expected to plunge 71.8% to 22 cents a share and revenue is seen tumbling 16.2% to $7.1 billion when it announces results Thursday.Halliburton is expected to benefit from U.S. crude prices hovering around the key $50 price point, more so than internationally focused Schlumberger, but neither company will see any service-pricing improvement in the third quarter, a major issue both mentioned on their second-quarter calls.""I don't think they made any more progress on price recovery in (the third quarter),"" said Robin Shoemaker, a KeyBanc director. ""They will be emphasizing in the results that their goal is to push pricing higher.""Shoemaker is more bullish on North America than the international market.""The $50 threshold is important for the North America market,"" he said. ""We will see higher activity if oil holds, but it won't immediately have an impact internationally where the market is quite weak and even declining in some areas.""U.S. oil prices fell 0.8% to $49.94 a barrel, the first close under $50 since Oct. 7.IBD's TAKE: Oilfield service providers are expected to be the first in the oil patch to see stock gains as oil prices increase. Halliburton and Baker Hughes are consolidating near buy range as oil bounces around $50. More rigs are being put to work in the U.S. as the oil rig count rose by four to 432 in the latest week, according to Baker Hughes data out Friday, marking a seventh straight week of increases.On the international side, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reached an agreement last month to cut production to 32.5 million-33 million barrels per day. But who will cut and how much will be decided at OPEC's official meeting in November.Goldman Sachs analysts warned that oil prices could come crashing back to $43 a barrel if OPEC fails to follow through with the agreement. The International Energy Agency said last week that the oil market could rebalance in the first half of 2017 if OPEC sticks to its production cap.Baker Hughes' (BHI) third-quarter results are on tap for Oct. 25.

718,TAP,"TV broadcasters reduced their asking price for prime wireless airwaves by about 36% to $54.6 billion in the second-stage of bidding in a government auction of radio spectrum, raising expectations that AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) could bite.In the first stage of the auction, TV broadcasters had sought $86 billion for 100 megahertz of usable radio spectrum, an asking price viewed as much too high by telecom industry observers. The Federal Communications Commission lowered the spectrum to be auctioned off to 90 MHz from 100 in the second stage.IBD'S TAKE: A successful auction is important to T-Mobile, which most needs more airwaves and could engage in merger talks after the auction is over, analysts say. T-Mobile stock is up 18% in 2016 but has been in a trading range since early August. Learn more about T-Mobile and Comcast, another possible auction bidder, at IBD Stock Checkup.The bigger-than-expected reduction makes it more likely that AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and other bidders will buy the spectrum, though perhaps at a still lower price, analysts say. The next phase of bidding starts on Oct. 19.""The reduction is larger than we expected, and suggests the auction could end more quickly,"" said UBS analyst John Hodulik in a research report. ""Were the broadcasters to lower their ask in Stage 3 by a similar amount, 80 MHz of spectrum would be priced at around $35 billion, within our expectations for industry demand.""TV broadcasters can walk away at any point if they determine that bids are too low.""To us, the ($54.6 billion) target is still likely to be far off from what carriers might be willing to pay, given our projected spend for top industry players,"" Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack wrote in a research note.The auction's outcome is important to Dish Network (DISH), which has amassed nearly 80 MHz of spectrum but is still looking for a wireless partner. Cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA) has registered as a bidder and could buy airwaves as it readies a push into wireless services.UBS' Hodulik estimates that AT&T could spend $10 billion in the auction, followed by T-Mobile at $8 billion, Verizon at $6 billion and Comcast at $5 billion to $6 billion.If the auction drags on until the spring of 2017, it'll put a chill on telecom industry mergers and acquisitions. The FCC has imposed a quiet period on bidders, banning strategic talks among them until the auction is over.RELATED:Yahoo Stock Falls On Verizon Counsel Comments On Acquisition PriceAT&T Still Pays Big Dividends; Earnings On TapVerizon, T-Mobile, Dish Strategic Talks On Hold As Auction Drags On

720,TAP,"Spotting emerging business opportunities requires an eyes-wide-open approach. How to pick up on promising outliers:Take leaps. “The pace of innovation is accelerating. You have a massive trend of disruption happening in every industry we care about.” So says Hilton Romanski, chief strategy officer of tech giant Cisco Systems (CSCO).Firms large and small need to be agile in how they pursue fresh opportunities. “The reality is the market is waiting for no one,” Romanski told IBD.Join forces. Corporations lumbering under the philosophy that work should stay within its walls will ultimately stumble. “It actually slows you down,” Romanski said. “No single company can take on the challenges.”Partnering and codeveloping are two ways to speed ahead. Last September, Cisco announced it was allying with Apple (AAPL) to make Cisco networks and iOS devices work together more efficiently and reliably.Look around. In another outside-the-walls approach, Cisco has dedicated $2 billion to a venture capital portfolio. Investing in pioneering firms helps the conglomerate see “over the horizon and around corners,” Romanski said. “It allows you to have access to disruptions early, so you can forecast what the world will look like.”Start small. To get a read on the Internet of Things trend, Cisco allocated $150 million of venture capital to emerging IoT tech firms. “That allowed us to realize where the most value would be brought to bear for our customers,” Romanski said.Dabbling in the startups led to last February’s acquisition of Jasper Technologies, a firm that helps clients launch, manage and monetize IoT services.Tap insiders. Last year, Cisco issued an Innovate Everywhere challenge. “It was a call to action to our 70,000 employees to come up with their best ideas,” Romanski said.The contest resulted in 1,100 ideas from 2,000 employees last summer, three of whom won cash prizes plus mentoring from Cisco and partners, as well as time off to develop those brainstorms.“It says to our employees: If you have an idea you can bring it to the table,” he said. “It also ensures we’re taking full advantage of our amazing assets.”Reward effort. “Leaders need to know the importance of creating a culture where risk-taking is acceptable. Indeed, it is one of the strongest drivers of producing a culture where innovation thrives.”So says Amantha Imber, author of “The Innovation Formula: The 14 Science-Based Keys for Creating a Culture Where Innovation Thrives.”Chiefs at multinational conglomerate Tata Group hand out Dare to Try awards at an annual innovation-recognition event. They are awarded for interesting, but botched initiatives.“By doing this, leaders at the Tata Group demonstrate they are comfortable with failure, just so long as there were some great learnings that came from it,” Imber said.Create distance. Workers who realize what went wrong come back stronger with realistically inspired ideas.“One of the great things Etsy has been doing for several years is running 'blameless postmortems,’ ” Imber said. When something flops at the peer-to-peer e-commerce site, staffers get together a day later -- after emotions have settled -- to dissect the incident.“A list of ‘remediation items’ are then created, which are things the team agrees they need to do better next time,” she said.“By focusing on issues rather than people, a culture of blame -- which is a big innovation killer -- is avoided.”Related:Customer Loyalty Requires Careful Attention To Finer Sales PointsCreative Company Cultures Embrace Baby StepsBuild Business On A Foundation Of Efficiency And Engagement

721,TAP,"Three exchange traded funds that specialize in dividend stocks are tracing bullish patterns on their charts. Moreover, they seldom drop more than 15%.Slow and tight price activity characterizes this trio of ETFs, reflecting the quieter nature of stocks that tend to belong to mature companies whose dividends appeal more to investors than share appreciation.For investors content with dividends and moderate price appreciation rather than the immediate satisfaction of a price rally, the three funds -- all part of IBD's ETF Leaders screen -- are sound choices. But there's a trade-off with the low volatility of dividend ETFs because price performance is dull.PowerShares High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers Portfolio's (PEY) worst drop since the 2009 market bottom was a 19% correction in May 2010. (That excludes the Aug. 24 market mini-crash.)The fund's dividends produce an annualized yield of about 3%. In the latest monthly payout, investors got about 3.5 cents a share. The ETF is up about 13% this year, but it declined 12% in a November-January correction.The Dividend Achievers fund tracks a portfolio of stocks with solid dividends and dividend growth rates. The ETF is close to new highs after finding support at the 10-week moving average, despite the fact that some of its top holdings are oil companies that have been battered lately. Murphy Oil (MUR), the largest component, is about 30% below a 52-week high.As its name implies, the mission of PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio (SPHD) is not just to tap dividend companies, but also stocks with historically subdued price performance. Its steepest decline since the fund launched in 2012 was 10% in 2014. Shares are finding support at their 50-day moving average.The ETF's annualized yield is about 3%. Shareholders were paid about 11.5 cents a share at the end of April. The bulk of the portfolio is in financial, utility and industrial companies.IShares Select Dividend (DVY), which is also rising slowly from its 50-day average, had a couple of 18% declines in 2010 and 2011, but the worst drop since then was a 9% correction in 2014. Shares are near highs as they test the 50-day line. Shareholders are paid dividends on a quarterly basis. In March, they got a little over 63 cents a share.IShares Select Dividend tracks a Dow Jones index of 100 of the highest-dividend-yielding securities, excluding real estate investment trusts. Top holdings include Lockheed Martin (LMT), CME Group (CME), Chevron (CVX) and Philip Morris (PM).The comfort of steady performance, however, was nowhere to be found on Aug. 24, when machinations in electronic trading resulted in a mini crash for most stocks. PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend collapsed as much as 38% before paring most of the loss. IShares Select Dividend crashed 35.5%, and PowerShares High Yield plummeted 29% before both erased most of those huge losses.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

That's in addition to the $99 fee paid for annual Amazon Prime membership.The deal gets better for owners of the Amazon Echo line of smart speakers that responds to voice command, which includes the lower-end Echo Dot and Tap. They'll pay $3.99 a month for the new music service. The Echo devices also provide access to other streaming services, including Spotify, Pandora and iHeartRadio.The standard price for Amazon Music Unlimited is $10 a month, the same as Spotify, Apple Music and most others.About 78% of Amazon Prime members already listen to Amazon Music, Cowen analyst John Blackledge said in a research note Wednesday. He estimates there are 49 million Amazon Prime members.""While Amazon Music Unlimited's impact on the current music landscape is unknown, given Amazon Prime's massive scale, it's reasonable to assume it could take share,"" Blackledge wrote.Last week, Amazon received a big-price target boost by Morgan Stanley, with the investment bank citing strong growth for the Amazon Prime loyalty service. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on Amazon stock to 950 from 800. The report estimates there are 60 million subscribers of Prime, with about 19 million members outside the U.S. Amazon does not disclose its number of Prime subscribersAmazon stock rose a fraction, to 834.09, in the stock market today. Amazon is near its all-time high of 847.21, touched on Thursday, and remains quite extended after finding support at its 50-day moving average near 758.Amazon's move to connect its streaming music to its Echo smart speaker comes as Alphabet (GOOGL) last week unveiled a comparable version of a personal digital assistant, called Google Home. Along with Alexa and Apple's Siri, tech companies are strengthening their connection to customers with in-home devices infused with advanced speech recognition and artificial intelligence.RELATED: Pandora, Spotify Said To Be 'Too Big To Fail' In Discordant Music IndustryAmazon Pushing Deeper Into Grocery Business With New Store Plans

724,TAP,"Under Armour (UA) is getting a little sunshine on this autumn Monday. Wells Fargo upgraded the Nike (NKE) rival to outperform, and even typically bearish Morgan Stanley had some nice things to say about the Baltimore-based athletic apparel brand.A ""top-line reacceleration"" could be in Under Armour's future over the next year to year and a half, thanks to distribution expansion, wrote Wells Fargo analysts Tom Nikic and Ike Boruchow, as the ""noise"" settles from Sports Authority's bankruptcy proceedings.The brand's growth story is still in early days, and it has ""noteworthy"" opportunities to close in on its rivals abroad. Star endorser Steph Curry recently went on an Under Armour-branded tour of China, and the company flexed its marketing muscle at the recent Rio Olympics.Plus, there's Kohl's (KSS) introduction of Under Armour products, which should help offset the loss of Sports Authority, they said. Wells Fargo upped its price target range to 44-46 from 38-42.Under Armour shares rose 1.3% to 38.27 in the stock market today. The stock remains below its 50-day and 200-day moving average. So does Nike's stock, which closed unchanged at 51.79 Monday.IBD's TAKE: Not sure what to do when it comes to moving averages? Here's one guideline: ""Law Of Averages: Sell When Stocks Breach 200-Day Line.""Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole, in a note on Finish Line (FINL), remarked that Under Armour has a ""big opportunity"" after being a ""major share gainer"" at the sports apparel retailer over the past year. Like Adidas, the brand's share of Finish Line sales has doubled.Under Armour sales now represent 6% of the store's sales, he said; Adidas has expanded its Finish Line share to 10% as its resurgence powers higher.Under Armour's ""Curry franchise has the opportunity to become even bigger than it already is if (Under Armour) can tap into Curry's status as not just a great basketball player, but also

725,TAP,"a style icon,"" wrote Sole on Monday.But he added that the brand needs to adapt to the shift in fashion from performance to lifestyle.And while Nike accounts for 70% of Finish Line's sales, ""Under Armour, a brand with exceptional growth prospects, could become a much bigger vendor over time,"" he said.Finish Line rose 0.8% to 22.59. Larger rival Foot Locker (FL) dipped 0.3%.

726,TAP,"Happy Columbus Day, dear ETF investors. In honor of that illustrious forebear and intrepid voyager, let us discover potential movers and shakers within the world of exchange traded funds this week.Third-quarter earnings get underway in earnest Tuesday with Alcoa's (AA) report. It's an especially big week for the big banks.We can hope Wells Fargo (WFC) fares better on its earnings call Friday than Wells Chief Executive John Stump recently did before lawmakers.Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) also report Friday.Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) last week closed above the 50-day moving average — a marker of short-term health — for the first time in four weeks.The big banks' earnings will play a role in whether XLF holds above that level or caves under, and whether or not it finally shakes off its year-to-date sloth.Some big chip earnings are in the works too: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) on Thursday and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) on Oct. 20.U.K. chipmaker Dialog Semiconductor gave Apple (AAPL) shares a boost last week after reporting solid sales.And tech ETFs with big stakes in Apple and its iPhone suppliers are showing bullish momentum. Among them: iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX).How could you not be dazzled by the chart?Last week, two flagship commodity ETFs made headlines for very different reasons.United States Oil (USO), which invests in near-month West Texas intermediate futures, made a three-month high. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which tracks the price of spot gold, fell to a four-month low.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is making the right noises about a production freeze. That's helping to boost ""black gold,"" but any concrete action will be formalized only in November.In the meantime, train your eyes on the USO chart. It may offer a buying opportunity at 12.55 if it successfully breaks out of a first-stage base.Keep in mind this would be a turnaround story, rather than your typical growth story. USO is trading near its lowest level in a decade at 11.34, and there's no clear signal yet that crude oil is out of the hole.Gold's hefty loss last week came amid a September jobs report that is likely to keep the Fed on course for a rate hike by year's end. That doesn't bode well in the near term for gold, which bears no yield.This week, will GLD ETF reclaim the 200-day moving average or fall further under it? The former would be a bullish sign, the latter bearish.However, Goldman Sachs sees a buying opportunity in the yellow metal if it gets even more tarnished.You'll find room in your portfolio for gold if you think for a moment about the uncertainties in the stock and commodity markets.Gold's a safe haven and a portfolio diversifier. Not to mention, shares of GLD are at $120 vs. $186 at the peak in 2011.The minutes from the September meeting of the Federal Reserve are on tap for Wednesday and Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks Friday at a Boston conference, ponderously themed ""The Elusive 'Great' Recovery: Causes and Implications for Future Business Cycle Dynamics.""IBD'S TAKE: How can you tell if a jobs report is too hot, too cold or just right? Markets may react negatively or positively on the day of the report, but the key for investors is to stay abreast of the market's prevailing trend. Visit IBD University for a primer on how to time the stock market and read The Big Picture column every day.Cue moves for rate-sensitive equity sectors, some of which have fallen off the proverbial cliff as expectations for a December rate hike grow.Among the worst-performing S&P sectors last week were utilities, real estate and consumer staples. Will the minutes restore a spark to Utility Select Sector SPDR (XLU)?How the times have changed for this once hard-charging, $7 billion sector equity ETF. Just look at the chart.RELATED:Oil ETF Hits 3-Month High; Gold ETF At 4-Month Low

727,TAP,"Zendesk (ZEN) Q2 revenue is expected to grow 50%, with analysts looking for an update on Zopim chat, a customer support tool integrated with Facebook's (FB) messaging app.San Francisco-based Zendesk reports after the market close Tuesday.Zendesk is expected to report a loss of 9 cents per share, a penny wider than its 8 cent loss in the year-earlier period. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast revenue of $72 million.Zendesk's products help provide customer support via email, live chat and phone, and the company is expanding into social media. It announced a messaging platform at Facebook's F8 developers conference in April. Salesforce.com (CRM) also plans a similar product using Facebook Messenger.""Adoption of Zopim continues to increase, which should benefit average revenue per user,"" Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, said in a research report. ""Facebook Messenger, which integrates with Zopim, remains one of several new products that should help drive ZEN growth in 2016.""IBD'S TAKE: Zendesk belongs to IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise group, ranked No. 6 out of 197 industry groups. An acquisition wave has lifted some stocks in the group, with Verizon Communications on Monday announcing its would buy Fleetmatics. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup. The maker of customer-support software recently set a goal of reaching $1 billion in annual sales by 2020, nearly five times its 2015 sales of $209 million.For the September, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Zendesk to post a 40% rise in revenue, to $78 million, and a loss of 7 cents per share.Zendesk shares closed down 3.5% to 28.98 on the stock market today.

728,TAP,"Software-as-a-service (SaaS) leader Salesforce.com's (CRM) acquisition spree is drawing scrutiny ahead of its fiscal Q2 earnings scheduled for Aug. 31.The enterprise software company's sales-channel outlook also is drawing commentary from analysts.Salesforce.com on Monday said it would purchase business analytics platform BeyondCore. In July, Salesforce.com acquired startup Quip for about $582 million in stock, stepping up competition with Microsoft (MSFT). And in June, Salesforce announced it was buying e-commerce platform Demandware for $3 billion.""The most common question we are fielding from investors is whether what looks like a newfound affinity for acquisitions is a sign of slowing core growth,"" said Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard in a research report. ""Our key question is whether CEO Marc Benioff is now on a quest to build the foundation for $20 billion in revenue, which would involve further acquisitions and potentially a departure from disciplined, largely organic growth that included margin expansion.""Salesforce posted revenue of $6.67 billion for its fiscal year ended Jan. 31.Keith Bachmann, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, says expectations are low heading into the fiscal Q2 earnings report, which will include 19 days of Demandware's financials.""We think investors are expecting a weaker reported quarter compared to Salesforce.com typical upside,"" he said.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project revenue growth of 24% for the quarter ended on or near July 31 vs. the year-earlier quarter, to $2.02 billion. That's down from 27% year-over-year growth in the preceding quarter. Analysts see EPS growth of 16%, to 22 cents, which would be its smallest growth since the April 2014 quarter.Billings, a sales growth metric, also might weaken in fiscal Q2, says Bachmann.""Revenue and billings upside this quarter could be less than in recent quarters, which includes the impact of (currency exchange rates),"" he said in a report.IBD'S TAKE: Salesforce.com stock this week slipped below its 50-day moving average. That's usually not good. As more revenue comes from large companies rather than midsize businesses, Salesforce's reported revenue is becoming more ""lumpy"" as big contracts are awarded. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.""Unlike prior quarters, we see lowered investor expectations on Salesforce.com's fundamentals heading into Q2 results,"" Keith Weiss, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a report.But he was generally upbeat.""Despite the increased pace of acquisitions year to date (nine companies acquired in 2016), we see organic growth trends remaining healthy, with billings growing more than 20% at least through fiscal 2018, based on our estimates,"" he wrote.Jefferies analyst John DiFucci rates Salesforce stock a hold.""While fiscal Q2 headline numbers are likely to be fine, our field checks and partner survey indicate that new subscription ACV (annual contract value) growth likely slowed. It appears that the vertically focused enterprise business continued to do well, though overall enterprise momentum moderated from stellar performance in the last two quarters,"" he said in a report.Salesforce.com shares rose a fraction on the stock market Friday to 77.48. The stock carries a poor IBD Relative Strength Rating of 41, but shares touched a record high of 84.48 on May 26, about a week after the company reported a fiscal Q1 beat that sent the stock rising more than 4%.RELATED:

730,TAP,"Walt Disney (DIS), Macy's (M), Gap (GPS), Kohl's (KSS), Fossil (FOSL) and others reported weak earnings or guidance, triggering a broad sell-off in retail and other consumer stocks -- but not for shares of Amazon (AMZN). Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) tumbled to a two-year low amid fresh evidence that iPhone demand remains weak. The major indexes ultimately closed modestly lower, with the S&P 500 and Dow industrials falling below key support.The major averages fell for a third straight week, with most or all of the losses coming Friday. The Dow fell 1.2% and the S&P 500 0.5%, both closing below their 50-day moving averages for the first time since Feb. 29. The Nasdaq, already below that key line, retreated 0.4%. The market uptrend remains under pressure. Retail and consumer groups were big losers after a raft of weak earnings reports and guidance from the likes of Walt Disney and Macy's. Oil prices rose to six-month highs during the week.Retail sales rose 1.3% in April, their best gain in more than a year. But that couldn't shake the gloom surrounding retail and consumer stocks.Macy's, Kohl's, Nordstrom (JWN), JCPenney (JCP) and Dillard's (DDS) tumbled on dismal first-quarter reports and/or guidance. Macy's and upscale Nordstrom slashed outlooks after sharp EPS declines. Kohl's posted a same-store sales drop that was the worst ""since the height of the Great Recession,"" according to Retail Metrics.Macy's stock fell 17% to a four-year low, and Kohl's fell nearly 14%, setting to its seven-year worst. Nordstrom, JCPenney and Dillard's lost 18.5%, 8% and 11%, respectively.Meanwhile, watchmaker and seller Fossil collapsed 31% after missing Q1 views and slashing guidance. Fossil hinted at competition from the Apple Watch and other wearables. Gap said Q1 same-store sales sank 5%, with April comps down 7% ahead of its full Q1 results on May 19. Its shares plunged nearly 19% to the worst since late 2011.Wal-Mart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), Ross Stores (ROST) also continue the flood of retail earnings next week.The media conglomerate delivered its first earnings miss in five years as per-share profit grew 11% to $1.36 and revenue grew 4% to $12.97 billion, short of consensus. ESPN lost subscribers once again, but the media networks segment didn't appear to disappoint Wall Street too badly. Studio revenue shot up 22% on ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and ""Zootopia"" fanfare. ""Captain America: Civil War"" should keep movie box office receipts high in Q2.Disney shares tumbled 4.8% to 100.52, falling out of a cup-with-handle base and well out of buy range. Disney closed just above its 50-day line.Apple stock fell last week amid new evidence that Apple suppliers are seeing weak orders for the upcoming iPhone 7. That suggests Apple's sales woes may continue for quite some time. Separately, Apple will invest $1 billion in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service and app. Apple stock fell 2.4% to its lowest level since June 2014 and lost its market cap crown, barely, to Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).Amazon intensified its rivalry with Alphabet’s Google by launching a new video streaming service comparable to YouTube. Sanford Bernstein analyst Carlos Kirjner on Tuesday raised his price target on Amazon to a whopping 1,000.Wal-Mart (WMT) announced its subscription service would offer two-day free delivery vs. three days before. But, as brick-and-mortar retailers struggle, Amazon rose 5.3% to 709.92, with investors betting its share of consumer spending will keep expanding.Facebook released guidelines revealing that the social media giant relies far more on people for its ""trending"" news topics, contradicting earlier company claims that they were largely driven by computer algorithms. Earlier, Gizmodo suggested that Facebook was suppressing news stories from conservative media outlets. Facebook strongly denied the allegation, saying it has “rigorous guidelines in place” for its review team, seeking to ensure consistency and neutrality.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he would meet with conservatives to discuss Facebook's policies.Facebook stock rose 0.3% to 119.81 for the week, extending a recent breakout but still in buy range.Staples (SPLS) and Office Depot (ODP) called off their proposed merger late Tuesday after a federal judge agreed with the Federal Trade Commission that the deal would have limited office supply competition with big corporate customers. Staples crashed 19%, and Office Depot dropped 40%. The Obama administration has blocked several megamergers recently, including that of Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI). Analysts say health insurance consolidation could get a hard look, with Aetna (AET) seeking to buy Humana (HUM), and Anthem (ANTM) set to acquire Cigna (CI).The Treasury Department on Tuesday called for greater oversight of the nascent industry, whose quick, easy online payment and lending solutions threaten to upend traditional banking but have raised questions about safeguards and potential for abuse.That came a day after Lending Club (LC) said CEO Renaud Laplanche was stepping down after the company found misconduct within the online lending platform relating to loan sales and lack of financial oversight. Several large and small banks halted work with Lending Club. Shares shed 51%, hitting a record low.Peer-to-peer lending firm Prosper recently announced a large round of layoffs, and disappointing quarterly results from OnDeck (ONDK) have prompted worries over insufficient loan-volume growth.Online gaming platform NetEase (NTES) more than doubled revenue in Q1, beating estimates, boosted by mobile games such as “Fantasy Westward Journey” and newer releases such as “Kung Fu Panda 3.” EPS also topped. Shares rose 9.3% for the week, moving above the 200-day line.Weibo (WB), a Twitter (TWTR)-like social-media platform majority owned by Sina (SINA), fared well, helped by mobile-user growth, strong ad revenue and expansion beyond major cities. Shares rose 2.1% for the week.Online media company Sina itself also topped Q1 views, with better sales and a narrower net loss than expected. The strong Weibo performance was a key help. But ad revenue from its Web portal segment lagged. Shares lost 11.2%, plunging through the 50-day line but closing just above the 200-day.Online retailer JD.com (JD) reported a Q1 loss in line with expectations. Sales surged but were just below expectations, and Q2 revenue guidance was just shy of analysts’ consensus. Shares tumbled 10.2%.LGI Homes (LGIH) on Tuesday reported a surprisingly strong 73% surge in first-quarter adjusted earnings per share. But the entry-level homebuilder's revenue fell short, and gross profit margins declined. LGI Homes, which briefly flirted with a 29.87 buy point, fell 8.9% to 25.69.Trex (TREX), the world’s largest maker of wood-alternative decking and railing products, topped Q1 views. But Trex guided Q2 revenue below consensus. Shares reversed hard, down 9.6% this week.Gypsum wallboard and related products maker Continental Building Products (CBPX) Q1 profit climbed 173%. Shares rose 7.5%, breaking out of a base to a seven-month high. TopBuild (BLD), which installs building insulation, also bested Wall Street Q1 earnings and revenue estimates. Shares of the July 2015 IPO rose 2.8% after the prior week's breakout.Several housing reports, including housing starts and existing-home sales for April, are on tap for next week.SolarCity (SCTY) torched Wall Street’s Q1 sales views late Monday, but losses swelled, and the No. 1 residential installer cut 2016 installation guidance as bookings fell short after Nevada cut net-metering payments to solar customers.Also Monday, rival Vivint Solar (VSLR) reported a 93% revenue rise that still missed views as losses widened.But No. 2 installer Sunrun (RUN) late Thursday reported a surprise Q1 profit ex items, while revenue nearly doubled.SolarCity fell 10.3% for the week, while Vivint was off nearly 8.9%, hitting record lows. Sunrun was down nearly 12%, even with Friday's 7.5% pop.Israeli giant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) beat Q1 earnings and sales estimates, but it guided Q2 slightly below consensus. Teva said its $40 billion buyout of the Allergan (AGN) generics business is on track to close in June, despite some earlier delays. Teva stock rose 3 cents to 50.30 for the week.Allergan reported mixed Q1 results -- earnings beat and sales missed -- but the drugmaker said it'll buy $10 billion in stock. Allergan, fresh off a failed takeover by Pfizer (PFE), signaled it'll focus more on improving operations than on making big buyouts in the near future. Shares rose 10.8%.A third generics giant, Perrigo (PRGO), hit a four-year low after its Q1 report on Thursday, though since it issued guidance last month there were few surprises. Perrigo fell 4.4% for the week, working on its fifth straight weekly loss.Smaller player Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) missed estimates, but its stock rose on news of a deal with two generic drugmakers not to sell knock-offs of its lead drug Xyrem until the end of 2025. Jazz shares closing up 0.9%. Meanwhile, Akorn (AKRX) finally reported its 2015 numbers after a long accounting overhaul, lifting shares more than 20%.

731,TAP,"Amazon.com (AMZN) tapped Texas Instruments (TXN) to lead its ""hockey-puck-sized"" Echo Dot Alexa-infused speaker, and incorporated Apple (AAPL) suppliers Broadcom (AVGO) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) in its portable Tap stereo, iFixit teardowns show.But the teardowns did little to help chipmakers Thursday on Wall Street. Chip stocks were broadly down in afternoon trading on the stock market today, in conjunction with fractional dips for the major indexes.Texas Instruments won five chips -- including a digital media processor -- inside the Echo Dot, but that total was skimmed down from eight chips inside the larger Echo. Also, Samsung succeeded SanDisk (SNDK) as the flash memory supplier.Echo Dot also features a DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) chip from Micron Technology (MU), apparently replacing a Samsung RAM chip in the Echo. Qualcomm (QCOM) re-won the Bluetooth function from the Echo.The smaller Echo Dot earned a six out of a best-possible 10 in its repairability rating, dropping from seven in the earlier Echo iteration.Amazon's Tap won a seven out of 10. It's Amazon's first Alexa-equipped portable speaker vs. the Echo Dot and Echo, according to iFixit.Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) topped the Tap with two chips -- an audio codec and a power management chip. Texas Instruments supplied an amplifier. Apple suppliers Broadcom and NXP won a chip apiece -- WiFi/Bluetooth and an applications processor, respectively.The device is powered by a lithium-ion cell, such as those used in Tesla Motors (TSLA) vehicles, iFixit notes. It provides for nine hours of music playback, according to Amazon, vs. the iPhone 6S Plus, which has ""a battery with a similar output for a radically different job.""

732,TAP,"Top shale oil producers like Continental Resources (CLR) and EOG Resources (EOG) are on tap to report quarterly results this week and could give an update on when drilling might start again after crude prices jumped 20% last month.U.S. oil prices are nearing the break-even level of $45 to $55 per barrel, when some producers could start bringing wells online.Some producers may have even started pumping when oil hit $40 per barrel. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Sanchez Energy (SN), which are active in Texas, already reported results in April. Pioneer boosted its 2016 production growth outlook to 12% from an earlier outlook of 10%, helped in part by increased output from the Spraberry/Wolfcamp zones.Sanchez reported a 25% rise in first-quarter production to 56,500 barrels of oil per day, above its 48,000-52,000 guidance, on better-than-expected results in the Eagle Ford’s western Catarina region. The producer brought 11 new wells online in the area.Late Monday, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) reported that its adjusted Q1 loss deepened to $1.12 a share, beating views for a loss of $1.16, while revenue sank 28% to $1.67 billion, below views of $1.81 billion. But in the Delaware Basin of west Texas, Anadarko grew sales volumes by 47%. In the DJ Basin of northeast Colorado, sales rose 11%.Despite the recent sharp rally in oil prices, some shale companies may wait and see how sustainable the upswing really is. EOG Resources  Chairman Bill Thomas said at an industry conference in March that his company won’t rush to boost output right after oil hits $60 a barrel.Producers also have to wait for capital markets to reopen and for workers and rigs to come back. Jason Bordoff, founding director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, has said it could take nine months to a year before production ramps up again.Market headwinds also remain. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped out 32.64 million barrels per day in April, near a new high, according to a Reuters survey. Oilfield service provider Baker Hughes (BHI) has said it doesn’t expect activity “to meaningfully increase in 2016,” but U.S. rig counts may stabilize in the second half of  the year.Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO)  and Noble Energy (NBL) will announce quarterly results before the market opens Wednesday.Analysts see Carrizo's earnings staying flat at 14 cents a share but revenue is expected to fall 17.2% to $123.44 million.  Noble is seen posting a 57-cent per-share loss vs. a 3-cent per-share profit a year ago. Revenue is expected to rise 3.4% to $784.5 million.Continental Resources reports late Wednesday, and analysts expect its Q1 per-share loss to widen to 37 cents from a 9 cents a year ago. Revenue is seen falling 24.6% to $439.52 million, marking a fifth straight decline. After its Q4 report, Continental said it had suspended fracking in the Bakken Shale formation.Concho Resources (CXO) and Marathon  will announce results after the market closes on Wednesday.Analysts see Concho breaking even vs. an EPS of 36 cents a year ago. They see revenue rising 9.9% to $454.2 million. Marathon's loss is expected to widen to 46 cents a share from a 37 cent a share loss a year ago. Revenue is seen plunging 41% to $903.3 million.EOG Resources will report results late Thursday, with analysts expecting a loss of 84 cents a share vs. EPS of 3 cents a year ago. Revenue is seen falling 28.1% to $1.67 billion.Meanwhile, Apache (APA)  and Occidental Petroleum (OXY)  will issue results early Thursday. Apache is expected to report a 90-cent per-share loss, down from a 37-cent per-share loss a year ago. Revenue is seen falling 39.3% to $1.1 billion.

733,TAP,"New FBI data show a deceleration in firearm background checks, but gun makers Smith & Wesson (SWHC) and Sturm Ruger (RGR) rose fractionally Thursday morning.Smith & Wesson closed up 0.9% in the stock market today, while Sturm Ruger rose 1.4%.The FBI on Wednesday reported 2,145,865 NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) firearm background checks for the month of April, up 25% from a year earlier and the most for any April on record. However, April's showing was down 15% from March and the lowest of any month so far this year.What's more, the background check figures -- often used as a way to gauge gun sales -- came after Sturm Ruger on Monday reported first-quarter results that soundly beat analyst forecasts, lifted by strong demand. The company also hiked its dividend. Ruger and Smith & Wesson jumped that day, and Wall Street likely sees little reason to move the stocks any higher.Background checks from month to month have hovered at record highs this year, partly amid anxieties over tighter firearms regulations and safety concerns following a wave of high-profile shootings over the past several years.And the pastime of shooting has become more popular over the years. An increasingly diverse selection of firearms has drawn increasingly diverse, discerning consumers who, while still concerned about regulation, are less likely to horde whatever guns they can get.Still, worries persist about how long the gun sale surge can last, and that regulatory risk might be simply pulling forward gun demand. Smith & Wesson and Ruger both sold off heavily in March after firearms retailer Sportsman's Warehouse (SPWH) warned of potentially weaker sales, and New York Public Advocate Letitia James said Sturm Ruger had inadequately informed investors about the potential financial impact of gun violence.Smith & Wesson has said it would make a bolder push into the ""rugged outdoors"" market, a move that could help it tap into a higher-margin business.Sportsman's Warehouse fell 1.5%, while outdoor sports retailer Cabela's (CAB) lost 1.2%.

Revenue was $46.44 billion, under views for $50.22 billion.""Compared with a year earlier, the underlying second-quarter result was impacted by lower oil and gas prices and significantly lower refining margins,"" Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in the earnings release.BP shares closed down 0.9% in the stock market today. Brent crude oil futures edged up 0.3% to $44.87 per barrel.

735,TAP,"Will Verizon Communications' $4.83 billion acquisition of Yahoo boost its Go90 mobile video service, which so far has focused on millennials aged 18 to 34 and Gen-Zers that are even younger?A Jefferies analyst says Yahoo's users may over-index in non-millennial generations, raising questions over Verizon's strategy.Verizon (VZ) made its acquisition of Yahoo official on Monday, ending months of speculation. Verizon will discuss its digital media strategy when it reports Q2 earnings before the open Tuesday, a spokesperson said.Verizon bought AOL for $4.4 billion in 2015 and has been investing heavily in its Go90 mobile video service. Verizon has not broken out AOL's financials since the June 2015 purchase, nor has Verizon disclosed Go90's subscriber base or revenue since its launch in September. Verizon has said it's going after ""viewership,"" which drives ad revenue.""Yahoo will clearly bring more eyeballs to Verizon's digital media offering, an important draw for advertisers,"" said Mike McCormack, a Jefferies analyst, in a research report. ""However, we believe Yahoo over-indexes in the non-millennial generations, which seems counter to Verizon's stated intent, and we wonder whether big bets on technology acquisitions is the appropriate direction for Verizon.""McCormack has a hold rating on Verizon stock. Verizon stock edged down 0.4% to 55.87 by the closing bell on the stock market today. Yahoo stock was down 2.7% to 38.32, after climbing 1.4% to a one-year high on Friday amid reports that a Verizon deal was near.""We continue to believe that the appropriate video strategy is one that marries traditional content with short form in an over-the-top fashion,"" McCormack said. ""Yahoo could enhance the content side, while contributing meaningfully from advertising, though its scale in video could pose a challenge.""Said Nomura Securities analyst Jeffrey Kvaal in a research report, ""We expect Verizon to cross market Yahoo's content and 1 billion active monthly users on the mobile side. Yahoo's brand and Go90's target demographics, particularly millennials, don't seem a perfect fit on first glance.""The Yahoo acquisition is expected to close in Q1 2017, Verizon said. The sale does not include Yahoo's cash, its shares in Alibaba Group (BABA) or Yahoo Japan, Yahoo's convertible notes, certain minority investments and Yahoo's non-core patents.Yahoo says it has more than 1 billion monthly active users globally and 600 million mobile users.Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer says she has no plans to leave.""For me personally, I'm planning to stay. I love Yahoo, and I believe in all of you. It's important to me to see Yahoo into its next chapter,"" Mayer said in a blog post to employees.While Yahoo's content and AOL's ad platform may be a good match, not all of Yahoo's internet assets may be the right fit for the phone company, analysts say.Verizon aims to create a mobile advertising platform to challenge Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google. Part of Verizon's grand plan, analysts say,  involves using wireless customer location data to support its ad business, analysts say.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook and Alphabet report earnings this week on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. Both are at or just below buy points. Should you buy them before earnings? Check out this chart analysis video of big tech stock with earnings on tap.Yahoo's search advertising business has been declining.Yahoo's auction has dragged on since March. Yahoo has a market cap near $37 billion, but the vast bulk of its value stems from its 15% stake in Alibaba Group and its more than 30% stake in Yahoo Japan. Those assets will be monetized separately.AT&T (T), Quicken Loans Inc. founder Dan Gilbert, as well as firms Vector Capital Management and TPG, were also active in bidding for Yahoo.While Verizon has expanded into internet content, AT&T last year bought satellite broadcaster DirecTV, another piece to the telecom conglomerate's strategy.

736,TAP,"Verizon Communications (VZ) could announce a deal to buy Yahoo (YHOO) within a few days, after beating out other suitors, according to multiple reports.Verizon and Yahoo are in one-on-one talks discussing a price tag of about $5 billion, Bloomberg reported, citing sources. Verizon's bid includes Yahoo's real estate assets, but not intellectual property, CNBC reported. Several other outlets reported a Verizon-Yahoo deal was close.Yahoo shares closed up 1.4% at 39.38 on the stock market today, hitting its highest level since July 24, 2015.Verizon stock rose 1.3% to 56.10. Verizon, which has been consolidating near highs in recent weeks, is still in range from a 54.59 buy point. Verizon will report Q2 earnings on Tuesday.Yahoo is putting up its core U.S. assets for sale. What would be left is a company with stakes in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) and Yahoo Japan. Alibaba shares edged up 0.4%.IBD'S TAKE: While Yahoo shares have been rising on buyout talk, its stock and financial performance have been weak for years. Investors should focus on top-rated companies. Facebook is near all-time highs, though it's pulled back from Wednesday's breakout with earnings on tap next week.

737,TAP,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. -- Autonomy and artificial intelligence, driven by advances in the commercial sector, will be key to ensuring the U.S. military maintains its advantage, a top defense official said Wednesday.AI is becoming ubiquitous in the form of Apple's (AAPL) Siri, Facebook's (FB) Messenger bots, Amazon's (AMZN) Alexa voice assistant and IBM's (IBM) Watson computer. Meanwhile, companies like Tesla Motors (TSLA) and MobileEye (MBLY) are also making leaps in autonomous driving technology.""Because they are commercially available, all competitors will have it,"" Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work said of autonomy and AI. ""This is going to be a competition of fast followers.""The true advantage will go to the nation that can integrate the technology better on the battlefield, he added, noting that Germany spent the interwar period exploiting radio technology and advances in aviation to devise ""blitzkrieg"" tactics.Speaking at the Air Force Association's Annual Air, Space and Cyber conference, Work said he's confident the U.S. can be a leader in putting all the pieces together, but also warned the military needs to be more agile.Apple shares finished flat in the stock market today, Facebook climbed 1%, Amazon rose 1.2%, Tesla added 0.3% and Mobileye gained 2.55%.IBD'S TAKE:  On the civilian side, the Transportation Department finally unveiled long-awaited guidelines that establishes a national framework for the operation and deployment of self-driving vehicles earlier this week. The Pentagon is looking to a ""third offset strategy"" that will help U.S. forces keep their edge over adversaries. But unlike prior ""offsets"" like nuclear weaponry and GPS satellites, the next one will be derived from the commercial sector and not the military.The Defense Department realizes it's a slow-moving, government agency vs. rapidly developing, informal, creative tech firms. So Defense Secretary Ash Carter is trying to mend a strained relationship between the DOD and Silicon Valley.He opened a Defense Innovation Unit- Experimental outreach office in Mountain View, Calif., last summer and one in Boston earlier this year, with another one planned for Austin, Texas.

738,TAP,"As more people get high, they might not need to get so drunk, and that's bad news for the beverage industry.Far fewer people today admit to smoking pot than admit to drinking. But as others have noted recently, Jack Daniel's maker Brown-Forman (BFB) and Samuel Adams brewer Boston Beer Co. (SAM) have warned about the dangers that marijuana legalization poses to their businesses.Brown-Forman, in its past four annual reports, has cited ""the potential legalization of marijuana use on a more widespread basis within the United States"" as a business risk. Boston Beer, in its past two annual reports, has said that states that have relaxed or are considering relaxing laws around pot usage ""could adversely impact the demand for the company's products.""Now, a new report from Cowen & Co. says those two stocks, along with Constellation Brands (STZ) and Molson Coors (TAP), could be among the most vulnerable if more states — or the nation as a whole — legalize the drug.The research comes as traditional beer giants already struggle to retain market share against an array of craft brewers that have broadened drinkers' palates and made things like tulip glasses and beer with hints of coriander more prevalent in places like, say, sports bars.Beer, in general, has also been losing out to the popularity of spirits, Cowen noted. Millennials have been drinking more flavored liquors like cinnamon whiskey.And in this year's election alone, Massachusetts, Nevada, Maine, Arizona and California will vote on whether to legalize recreational use of marijuana in some form.""Broadening cannabis use seems to be having an impact on alcoholic beverage incidence,"" according to the Cowen report, released last week.The shift to pot and away from alcohol appeared to be more common among men. The report said that ""male alcohol incidence shifted from modest growth to decline"" over the past five years, while cannabis incidence crept up, posing ""negative implications for beer and spirits, in particular whiskey.""Legalization could also mean less wine consumption, which is more common among wealthier households and could pose a threat to Constellation, Cowen said. Constellation's wines include Kim Crawford, Robert Mondavi, Mark West and Toasted Head.""On a total social-lubricant basis (cannabis and alcohol), lower-income consumers are lower-incidence consumers. Interestingly, it would seem that cannabis is in fact having the greatest impact on higher-income alcohol consumption. ... This could have a negative impact on wine consumption, which over-indexes to higher-income consumers,"" the report said.IBD'S TAKE: Anheuser Busch InBev's stock jumped on Thursday, making it one of the few beverage stocks poised for a breakout. Breakouts elsewhere have been fragile. Read this story to see why Apple's breakout is holding up.But Constellation -- which makes Mexican beers Corona, Modelo and Pacifico for the U.S. market -- stands to gain from other demographic trends, Cowen said.""While cannabis use has risen with every major ethnic cohort in the U.S. over both the last 5 and 10 years, Hispanics have been the slowest to adopt cannabis, while their incidence also remains the lowest,"" Cowen's report said.""In contrast, over the last 10 years, Hispanic alcohol incidence has climbed markedly faster than we have seen for other multicultural groups (with the exception of blacks). Notably, despite these strong alcohol gains, there is room to grow, as alcohol incidence remains relatively low.""Shares of Brown-Forman closed up 1.5% in the stock market today but have been below the 50- and 200-day lines since late last month. Boston Beer rose 0.2%, Constellation Brands added 0.1%, Molson Coors gained 1.55%, and Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD) climbed 2.2%.The beneficiaries of pot legalization also include tobacco stocks like Reynolds American (RAI), which could draw pot smokers with its vaping devices, Cowen says.Fast-food chain Jack In The Box (JACK), whose past advertising efforts may or may not have appealed to those in the right state of mind, also has a bunch of its restaurants in pot-friendly states, the investment firm notes.RELATED:The Brews At Constellation Brands Offer Frothy Growth ProspectsInsys Stock Jumps As FDA Approves Appetite-Boosting Cannabis DrugGW Pharma Jumps As Cannabis Drug Treats Severe Epilepsy

741,TAP,"Mortgage insurance, an industry that drove several companies to collapse or the brink of failure in the housing crisis, is again considered a safe bet as Arch Capital Group (ACGL) CEO Dinos Iordanou reshapes his company by purchasing a loan guarantor from American International Group (AIG).""Hopefully the last war was fought and lost, and the new war is going to be fought and won,"" Iordanou said Aug. 16 on a conference call, a day after agreeing to pay $3.4 billion to buy AIG's United Guaranty. ""People are going to pay attention to properly price their business.""Mortgage guarantors cover losses for lenders when homeowners default and foreclosure fails to recoup costs. When housing prices are climbing, it can be one of the highest-margin businesses in all of insurance. The thirst for quick profits, however, drove companies to compete too aggressively for business in years such as 2006 and 2007, taking on risks they couldn't handle.""Too many people put their hands on the stove, and they got burned,"" Iordanou said, acknowledging that the past was not always ""stellar"" for the industry. ""I will assure you we're not going to make those tragic mistakes of the past.""Iordanou, along with hedge-fund billionaires and Wall Street giants, were among the first to bet on mortgage-insurance recovery after the credit crisis. The newcomers determined that profits would be sustainable if companies charged more for coverage.Essent Group (ESST), which was built with backing by Goldman Sachs Group (GS) and George Soros' Valorina, acquired assets from money-losing mortgage guarantor Triad Guaranty as markets recovered and had an initial public offering in 2013. That same year, Arch pushed into mortgage insurance with a deal to add assets from PMI Group, which was also hobbled by higher-than-expected claims costs.John Paulson has gained from the recovery of Radian Group (RDN), which is still trading for a fraction of its 2006 closing price. And, more recently, reinsurers tied to hedge fund managers Daniel Loeb and David Einhorn have taken on mortgage-related risks after being stung by losses on property-and-casualty coverage, including policies tied to Florida homes or commercial vehicles.""At this time in the cycle, we like the mortgage sector because we believe that the mortgage insurance earnings are more stable and predictable than P&C earnings,"" said Iordanou, whose Bermuda-based company will become the industry leader with the AIG deal. He expects mortgage insurance to contribute half the company's profits, while consuming only a third of its capital.Even as he sold United Guaranty, AIG CEO Peter Hancock stressed in a memo that his company ""will continue to be a participant in the residential real estate market"" through direct ownership of mortgage loans, a portfolio of structured securities, the holding of Arch stock and continued ties to United Guaranty. In his note to employees he also called the deal a ""milestone.""""This transaction maximizes UGC's value while further streamlining our organization,"" Hancock said in the statement. ""The deal also maintains our affiliation with the mortgage-insurance market and its leading company.""And New York-based AIG, which is divesting assets to free up cash for share buybacks, will also retain a portion of the profits from some United Guaranty policies sold in prior years. Plus, Arch is paying for the deal partly in stock.Holding Arch Capital shares has been a winning bet for two decades. This past week, the stock advanced its gain since Dec. 31 to 15%. The company has climbed in nine of the past 11 years, and never posted an annual decline of worse than 1% in that span.United Guaranty was founded in 1963 and sold to AIG in 1981. The unit has rebounded from the housing crash, when AIG was required to tap a Treasury Department line within its rescue package to help restructure the operation.Related:States Where Making The Mortgage Takes The Least And The Most Work2 Mortgage REITs With Double-Digit Dividend YieldsFor Mortgage Loans, Only Those With The Best Credit Need Apply

742,TAP,"Stocks ended slightly higher Wednesday after Federal Reserve policymakers were split on the need for an interest-rate hike. Cisco Systems (CSCO) dipped 1% after the close, while NetApp (TAP) jumped 5% after reporting earnings.The S&P 500 edged up 0.2%, the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1% and the Nasdaq ended up a fraction. Volume in the stock market today was higher across the board, according to preliminary data.Stocks erased mild gains in the afternoon, after minutes from the Fed's July 27 meeting showed policymakers had greater confidence in the economic outlook, but remained reluctant to raise interest rates.Computer networking giant Cisco Systems was down about 1% after the close despite reporting higher-than-expected profit and sales for the fiscal fourth quarter that ended in July. The stock dipped 1% during the regular session, ending just below a 52-week high. It was reported that Cisco plans to lay off 14,000 workers or about 20% of its global workforce.Agilent Technologies (A), a maker of scientific measuring instruments, fell 5% after the close following its quarterly results.NetApp (NTAP) jumped more than 5% in post-session trading after the maker of network storage and data management hardware posted better-than-expected fiscal Q1 profit and sales.The stock is working on a long and deep cup-type base.Chinese social networking stock YY (YY) was up 3% after the close after its Q2 results. The stock has retaken its 10-week moving average but is hitting resistance at its 40-week line as it tries to recover from a long slide.Retail stocks were hardest hit during the regular session, following disappointing earnings reports.Lowe's (LOW) dropped more than 5% after the home improvement retailer reported that profit for the fiscal second quarter that ended in July rose 9% to $1.31 a share, below Wall Street expectations.Sales edged up 5% to $18.3 billion, also below views.But L Brands (LB) popped 3% in post-session trading after the parent of Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret posted better-than-expected Q2 profit and sales.

743,TAP,"Alibaba Group's fourth-quarter revenue rose a better-than-expected 39 percent after China’s biggest e-commerce company drew in more users and boosted services to merchants on its platforms.Sales jumped to 24.2 billion yuan ($3.7 billion) in the three months ended March, Alibaba (BABA) said. That compares with the 23.2 billion-yuan average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Adjusted earnings-per-share were 3.02 yuan compared with analyst projections for 3.52 yuan.Alibaba’s platforms, which link buyers and sellers, hit a 3 trillion yuan milestone of goods sold as the company continues to expand even as the Chinese economy grows at the slowest pace in 25 years. The online emporium is making more from mobile advertisements, deepening its push into rural domestic regions and branching out overseas to boost transactions.“Alibaba is still growing very nicely and sustaining very high margins in the face of the concerns about Chinese consumers and the face of competition,” said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities Inc. “It’s good results for Alibaba and it seems like their business is holding up.”Net income rose 85 percent to 5.3 billion yuan, just shy of the 5.4 billion-yuan average of estimates. Affiliate Zhejiang Ant Small & Micro Financial Services Group, which owns Alipay, incurred a net loss after spending to drive user growth, the company said Thursday.Shares of Alibaba rose more than 4 percent in pre-market trading. The stock has dropped 6.7 percent this year compared with a 1.4 percent advance in the NYSE Composite Index.Revenue on Alibaba’s Chinese retail e-commerce platforms jumped 41 percent, driving growth in spending by merchants on the company’s marketing services. Commissions accounted for about a third of that.Alibaba has pulled out the stops to get its e-commerce platforms in front of villagers, setting up free Internet-equipped computers and working with local officials to train potential buyers and sellers. It had a presence in 12,000 villages across the country by the end of January, out of about 600,000. That effort to diversify the business comes as Alibaba is simultaneously trying to tap more of the 620 million Chinese who access the Internet from their smartphones and tablets.“The company was able to better monetize on selling advertisements to merchants,” Marie Sun, an analyst at Morningstar Investment Service, said before the earnings. “As the economy growth slows, it seems that merchants are more willing to place ads with bigger platforms like Alibaba that have a wider reach of customers.”The cloud computing business almost tripled revenue to more than 1 billion yuan and the business now has more than half a million paying customers.

745,TAP,"More earnings reports from big-name companies are due out this week, and positive results could fuel their shares higher.A lot of attention will be on Apple’s (AAPL) earnings late Tuesday, but its stock is in a downtrend. Let’s take a look at four tech stocks with earnings on tap that are trading in or near buy range: Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), PayPal (PYPL) and Baidu (BIDU).Facebook reports after the close on Wednesday. Both earnings and revenue are projected to jump 48%.The social media leader is trading 6% below a cup-with-handle buy point at 117.09. The stock fell 0.4% to 110.10 but for second straight session found support at the 50-day moving average on the stock market today.PayPal also reports late Wednesday, with analysts expecting earnings growth of 20% on a revenue rise of 19%.PayPal is trading just below buy range from an alternate entry at 40.03, and the stock was off 1.2% Monday.

746,TAP,"Scandal has always been the middle name of Donald Trump, but his current soap opera as a presidential candidate is the most shocking one yet. A year ago his campaign was nothing more than a joke, a mere anecdote at the edge of one of the pages of Jeb Bush’s triumph.Now, good old Jeb! is out, along with 14 other Republican hopefuls, and “The Donald” has almost secured the candidacy of the GOP. Trump has turned himself, somehow, into a conservative icon despite cries of anger and tears of desperation from both the Republican establishment and the real right-wingers.He’s winning thanks to his charisma, his TV experience and his outspoken persona, but the real key to Trump’s success is that he understands which fears and worries of the conservative audiences he should tap into.The first of them? Immigration. Let’s say it clear: Republicans are afraid of illegal aliens. It’s not out of racism; it's because they see those immigrants as safe votes for the Democratic Party. Let the aliens in, they contend, and all of America will follow the footsteps of liberal California. If the illegals stay, 20 years from now it’ll be impossible to elect Republicans. If there’s no deportation, America will go to the dogs (or worse, to the Clintons).So, when Trump began his sales pitch saying that “When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. ... They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with them. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists,” he is merely articulating a fear that lays deep within the minds of millions of Americans.And when Trump claims that he’ll make Mexico pay for the wall (spoiler alert: he can't), he completes a dangerous recipe of raising fear and inciting retribution. Once he’s done that, the debate has gone from the brain to the emotions and, there, no argument in contrary can be accepted. That’s the only way Trump can win.And he knows it. According to media estimates, Trump's stance against illegal immigrants cost him around $78 million, as several companies cut their commercial ties with his corporation, but for Mr. Trump that was actually part of the plan. So he has not buckled and turned every attack against him into further ""proof"" of his strong character. He's used the attacks to connect with those millions of voters who feel pushed outside of the mainstream by growing liberal influence.The problem? He counted on the outrage as a key part of his communication strategy. It’s good business for him, but really bad news for the conservatives.Donald won while doing a huge disservice to conservatives by deepening the paradigm of migration as a partisan issue and driving Hispanics further away into the welcoming arms of the Democratic Party. How? He’s playing straight into the immigration debate lines of the “Republican bigots” cliché, tirelessly promoted by liberals. They’re partying at the DNC, because they know that immigrants are not going away.There are more than 15 million illegal aliens in the U.S. That’s around 5% of the total population, all of them with family and friends. To remove them would be seen as an act of tyranny and political suicide. But it's also a logistical impossibility. Every single politician knows this, but both major parties manipulate the issue to galvanize their voters.By sticking to a morally questionable and politically lost battle on immigration, and now crowning Trump as their leader, Republicans have left a wide-open space for the left to convince immigrants to become cannon fodder in their social engineering.Liberals are playing with the home-field advantage, because most of the millions of people who emigrated from Mexico and Latin America have never heard about the values of the Founding Fathers and the principles of limited government. All they've heard is the old leftist tale of ""American imperialism,"" a recurring villain in the history courses in their native countries (that’s why Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s cries about the dangers of imperialism are echoed not only within the intellectual wasteland of the far left, but even in some of the Latin American ""conservative"" circles).When those immigrants get to the U.S., all they hear is that same leftist tale -- only now presented in the form of ""white guilt"" by liberals, therein consolidating their previous prejudices. So it should come as no surprise that, every now and then, thousands of them take to the streets waving Mexican flags and screaming softhearted imitations of ""death to America"" and “death to capitalism,"" ignoring that American capitalism allows them to reach a standard of living that would be a mere fantasy back home.The saddest part of the story is that the conservatives and libertarians who could have showed immigrants the nation’s real spirit and identity were too busy either fighting another battle or calling them names and trying to kick them out (which, again, is not only wrong and counterproductive, but impossible).What to do? The conservatives and libertarians within the GOP need much more than ads in Spanish or Taco Tuesdays. They need to understand their new neighbors, to learn their history and to learn first, and explain later, how the socialist policies of Latin American governments were actually the reasons that forced them to literally escape to the U.S. Socialized medicine, centralized government, class warfare, price controls, mandated wage increases, all those shiny ideas in the DNC’s toolbox are not new: They’ve all been tried before, from Mexico to Argentina, and proved disastrous.If conservatives want their Hispanic neighbors to understand the dangers of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, they only have to make those immigrants look back home and help them realize that the freedoms and values that make America a land of opportunity are not printed on a food stamp, but in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the ideals of honest, hopeful hard work that made those documents possible.If they are to save 15 million immigrants from the clutches of the DNC, they need to inspire, to lead the way in the rejuvenation of the American dream, and share it with the newcomers.Otherwise, if the GOP stays stuck on the same sterile talking points, the immigration tunes will sound forevermore to the rhythm of the liberals. And that’s a hideous song.

747,TAP,"The marketing heft of Amazon (AMZN) just scored a nice win for its customers and some gravy for shareholders.The online shopping giant announced an agreement Thursday with Wells Fargo (WFC) to provide discounted student loans to Amazon Prime Student customers.Wells Fargo said it will give an interest-rate discount of 0.5 percentage point to Amazon customers, noting that students could reduce their rate by another quarter-point by enrolling in an automatic payment plan.Announcement of the partnership didn't mention whether it was exclusive, but it looks like Wells Fargo is paying Amazon in a bid to increase market share. The deal is an example of Amazon leveraging its membership, much in the same way that AARP has served as a path for companies to tap into senior-citizen consumers via discounts.""We are focused on innovation and meeting our customers where they are -- and increasingly that is in the digital space,"" said John Rasmussen, Wells Fargo's head of its Personal Lending Group, in a statement.The deal could book Amazon Prime Student memberships. They cost $49 a year vs. $99 for the regular Amazon Prime.Amazon shares fell fractionally to 744.43 at the close on the stock market today, tracking modestly below all-time highs and above the 50-day moving average. Wells Fargo dipped 0.6% to 48.30.

748,TAP,"Innovation seems fun and easy when you bat around ideas with friends. But consider the advantages of innovating with diverse teams who don't know each other well:Creative sparks fly. A diverse mix of people might engage in a livelier debate. That can promote breakthrough thinking.A former executive at VeriSign (VRSN), Mack McKelvey led rapid response teams to decide whether to pounce on business opportunities. Each group varied in age, gender and race.""I learned the less homogeneous your team is, the better it is,"" said McKelvey, now a partner at the Chameleon Collective, a marketing firm. ""With diverse teams, you don't have a lot of agreement out of the gate. That's good. Disagreement fuels better discussions that lead to more innovation.""Assumptions carry less weight. When you gather a well-worn team of like-minded people, they might finish each other's sentences. If they're used to working together, they may assume they know what their colleagues are trying to say.But with diverse groups, all bets are off. Their lack of a common history can spur fresher, bolder insights.""On a homogeneous team, you can say, 'Yeah, we've tried that before and it doesn't work,'"" McKelvey said. ""Diverse teams are not OK with quick, easy, yes-or-no answers. They don't have shared assumptions, so there's more thought and discipline involved.""People communicate more freely. Brainstorming with people from wide-ranging backgrounds leads to more open communication. Participants tend to listen attentively and learn new ways of seeing the world.When McKelvey set up her marketing firm last year, she chose an advisory board with an emphasis on diversity. She recruited five women and four men, and they came from different countries and industries.""I wanted to find different styles,"" she said. ""That enables everyone to improve communication rather than just protect their own turf. With diversity, you don't have just one approach. Because everyone is processing things differently, you get an interesting blend of ideas that leads to innovation.""Everyone gets heard. In a room that lacks diversity, participants tend to fall into predictable patterns. The most opinionated individuals can dominate the proceedings.In diverse groups, it's less likely that one or two vocal personalities will drown out everyone else. That's because people might present their best selves to make a better impression with a wider cross-section of colleagues.When Angie McArthur leads training sessions for innovators, she emphasizes the importance of creating a vibrant environment where everyone contributes. In one of her exercises, participants jot their ideas on sticky notes and post them on a central bulletin board for everyone to see.""It shakes things up and prevents habitual thinking,"" said McArthur, acting chief executive of Professional Thinking Partners in Park City, Utah. ""It gets people moving around, and everyone has a voice.""Fresh perspectives emerge. When you convene a group of people with divergent backgrounds and outlooks, you tap a broader range of experience and expertise. Just make sure everyone feels comfortable chiming in.""You want them to show up with wild and crazy ideas with no editing of their thoughts,"" said McArthur, co-author of ""Collaborative Intelligence."" ""Give them permission to be raw.""Newbies thrive. Ideally, your team should be both diverse and fairly new to the topic at hand. That maximizes the odds that the group will gel and make breakthroughs.""It's good if the diverse group has little or no experience with the topic,"" said Braden Kelley, author of ""Stoking Your Innovation Bonfire."" He suggests assembling a mix of participants from outside your industry who can bring openness and free-flowing creativity.Related:Inspired Solutions Require Mental Sweat; Try Creative CogitationLeap Creativity Hurdles And Brainstorm Creative Ideas

There, Proofpoint competes with the likes of Symantec, FireEye (FEYE) and Mimecast (MIME).IBD'S TAKE: Resellers in a Piper Jaffray survey say Proofpoint is displacing Cisco Systems, Intel, Symantec, FireEye and Mimecast in the email segment.A ""constant barrage"" of high-profile breaches has helped Proofpoint top sales views by an average 5% for the past 18 quarters, Nandury wrote in a research report. Its email and social media security, privacy and archiving products rank high in the industry.""Not surprisingly, the company has been taking share from incumbents,"" he wrote. Among those, he identified Symantec and Intel. Intel's security arm is phasing out its email service and recommending customers to Proofpoint.Industry tracker IDC pegs the Intel opportunity at $92 million, but Nandury sees $200 million to $300 million given the cross-selling opportunity for Proofpoint's targeted attack protection (TAP), archiving, privacy, governance and emerging products.Only 46% of Proofpoint customers use multiple products, meaning the company has a massive runway for growth, Nandury wrote.

Amid rocky markets and an iffy growth outlook, haven assets like VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) remain ensconced as the best-performing ETFs of 2016 so far.Stocks dived late in June after Britons defied expectations and thumbed their noses at European Union bureaucrats and voted to leave the regional bloc. Then stocks snapped right back, following a bullish report on jobs growth and hopes for more global stimulus after the Brexit debacle. By June 30, the stock market was back in a confirmed uptrend.The benchmark S&P 500, blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average and small-cap S&P 600 index are now at or near all-time highs. Beloved names like Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) have more than clawed back heavy Brexit losses.

Two ETF investing experts tell IBD how they intend to play their favored Pokestops in the months ahead: emerging markets, value stocks and high yield.Duncan Rolph is managing partner at Miracle Mile Advisors in Los Angeles, an independent advisory firm and fiduciary with approximately $570 million in assets under management.We expect positive equity growth over the next six months due to low interest rates and improving earnings growth, which should benefit from a weaker dollar and higher energy prices.IShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility Emerging Markets (EEMV): After struggling in 2015, emerging markets are coming back to life on the back of recovering commodity prices and a softening dollar. Emerging markets have attractive valuations compared to U.S. equities, and they should reap the benefits of the Fed holding off on raising interest rates. Low-volatility emerging market ETFs provide exposure to less volatile emerging market stocks relative to a market-cap-weighted index. EEMV is also underweight China relative to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which is a benefit given the questions surrounding the Chinese economy. It has a relatively low expense ratio of 0.25% and a yield of 2.71%.IShares S&P 500 Value (IVE): Value stocks are in favor in 2016 after underperforming growth stocks in each of the last three years. Large-cap value ETFs should continue to perform well in the second half of 2016 as investors favor high-quality, low-volatility companies. IVE is outperforming its growth ETF counterpart, iShares S&P 500 Growth (IVW) by 3.7% this year through July 11. IVE has a yield of 2.5% and an expense ratio of only 0.18%.First Trust Preferred Securities & Income (FPE): With the global markets still dealing with the consequences of a British exit from the European Union, we don't expect the Fed to raise interest rates until at least December. Therefore, we expect high-yield fixed income to continue to outperform corporate and government fixed income. One area of high yield that we like is preferreds, hybrid securities with characteristics of both stocks and bonds. FPE has a solid yield of 6.0% and is up 4.5% through July 11. Even if interest rates rise faster than expected, 60% of FPE's holdings are fixed to floating-rate securities, which mutes its interest-rate sensitivity.Michael Krause is chief analyst at AltaVista Research, a Florida-based firm that offers fundamentally driven, forward-looking ETF analysis to financial advisors and sophisticated individual investors.Brexit, wobbly European banks, and lackluster corporate profits give the Fed all the excuses it needs to stay lower for longer. We think that leads to reflation in commodity prices and money flows back to beaten-up emerging markets in search of higher returns.ALPS Emerging Sector Dividend Dogs (EDOG): After a dismal few years, emerging markets rallied in the first six months of 2016, with certain commodity-driven markets roaring much higher. EDOG is based on the ""Dogs of the Dow"" theory -- a classic investment strategy where one invests in the 10 Dow stocks with the highest dividend yield at the end of each year and holds those stocks for exactly one year. However, EDOG selects the five companies with the highest dividend yield in each of 10 equity sectors from emerging markets, and weights each sector equally. This avoids the outsized exposure to financials (and Chinese banks!) that come with more popular funds like iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM). It also provides a tilt toward commodity-driven markets over the likes of China, South Korea and Taiwan, which dominate EEM.EDOG offers a yield of 4.1% based on consensus dividend-per-share estimates for fund constituents in 2016, vs. 2.8% for EEM.IShares MSCI USA Value Factor (VLUE): Growth stocks have far outpaced value for the last decade, but mean reversion may finally be taking hold. That makes sense given our anemic economic growth, and value may benefit more from any multiple expansion induced by lower interest rates. We like VLUE because its sector allocation mirrors that of the S&P 500, rather than tilting heavily to financials and utilities like many value funds. Ultra-low interest rates and a flat yield curve are no help to financials, while utilities' valuations are stretched after roaring 23% higher in the first half of this year.SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond (JNK): Though not as high as seen during this winter's correction, credit spreads remain elevated vs. the last few years, suggesting there is still value among lower quality bonds. We calculate a yield to maturity of 6.7% for JNK that, even if we assume losses based on historical defaults for bonds of similar quality and maturity, would result in realized yields of 3.1%, which compares favorably to most investment-grade corporates. Lastly, credit quality may also improve with oil prices back around $46 from roughly $30 at the February lows.

761,TAP,"Late Wednesday, No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) reported a 6-cent earnings beat and Q2 sales that were slightly shy of Wall Street expectations, as PC and Internet of Things sales slipped from Q1, slightly offset by double-digit growth in its Altera unit.Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said the chipmaker is on track as it shifts its focus toward data center, IoT and programmable chips. Intel is the longtime leader in microprocessors that power PCs, but that sector is in a downshift and more people move to smartphones. Intel plans to cut $750 million in costs this year, and three months ago it announced it would cut its workforce by 12,000.""We're gaining momentum heading into the second half,"" Krzanich said in the company's earnings release. ""While we remain cautious on the PC market, we're forecasting growth in 2016 built on strength in data center, the Internet of Things and programmable solutions.""Some of that played out in Q2. For the quarter, Intel reported $13.5 billion in sales, up 2.6%, and 59 cents earnings per share ex items, down 5%. The consensus of 41 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters called for $13.54 billion in revenue and EPS of 53 cents.Its PC unit's sales fell 3% both sequentially and vs. Q2 2015, which is largely in line with broad PC industry trends. Industry tracker IDC this month said PC shipments fell 4.5% year over year in Q2, but that beat its projection for a 7.4% plunge.But Intel's key IoT unit saw sales fall 12% sequentially, though they rose 2% from the year-earlier quarter. Nonvolatile memory sales fell 1% quarter over quarter and 20% vs. last year.Programmable solutions, on the other hand, flew 30% sequentially. Intel acquired field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-maker Altera this year, a combination that some analysts say could rival Xilinx (XLNX) in FPGAs.Intel's data center sales lifted 5% year over year but fell 1% from Q1.Current-quarter guidance for $14.9 billion in sales ex items, plus or minus $500 million, beat analyst views for $14.6 billion. Intel didn't provide an EPS guide. Analysts model 64 cents, which would be flat.In after-hours trading, after releasing earnings, Intel stock was down 1%. Shares closed Wednesday's regular session up 1.5%, at 35.69. Shares are up 4% for the year on speculation that Apple (AAPL) might tap Intel to source some of its iPhone 7 modems, partially replacing incumbent Qualcomm (QCOM).

767,TAP,"Following the hot path marked by Acacia Communications (ACIA), Twilio (TWLO), Line (LN) and others, initial public offerings are forecast to shift into high gear the rest of this year.Among tech companies expected to take the IPO plunge are Nutanix, Apptio, Everbridge and Trade Desk. The biggest names — Uber, Snapchat, Airbnb and Spotify among them — seem to be waiting until at least 2017.""While overall flows in the IPO market are nowhere near the pace we saw in 2014 and 2015, one sector, technology, is far outperforming the rest of the IPO market,"" said Scott Sweet, senior managing partner at research firm IPOboutique.com.In a survey released Thursday, 76% of North American executives polled expect IPOs to return to the high levels of 2013 and 2014 within a year, while worldwide the percentage is 58%. Law firm Reed Smith and M&A research firm Mergermarket polled 125 CEOs, CFOs and heads of strategic development for privately held companies, 100 of which expect their companies to make IPOs within three years, to get the findings.Just nine tech companies went public in the first eight months of 2016, the lowest number since 2008. But IPO returns spark the market for new issues, and on that score the recent trend is good. Acacia, Twilio and Line, as well as Impinj (PI) and Talend (TLND), have helped drive tech-IPO enthusiasm.Acacia, a provider of high-speed fiber-optic communications gear, got the wheels rolling with a May 13 IPO that jumped a strong 35% on its first trading day. The stock has soared 413% from its IPO price of 23.Acacia was followed by cloud software provider Twilio, up 283% from its IPO price of 15. Mobile messaging company Line is up 38%. Impinj, a provider of radio-frequency identification tags and reader chips, has jumped 152%. Talend, a Big Data and cloud integration software maker, is up more than 45%.""We feel it is a strong likelihood that technology deals will file and come to market in greater quantity,"" Sweet said. ""The past performance of the sector will certainly be a factor in the future demand of deals, as investors may seek to chase technology IPOs in hopes of finding the next Acacia or Twilio.""Burlington, Mass.-based Everbridge might be next. On Tuesday, it set terms for its IPO, saying it expects to sell 7.5 million shares (1.25 million by shareholders) at 11 to 13 per share. The company makes cloud software designed to keep businesses running during critical events, such as a terrorist attack or severe weather.Q1 marked the slowest quarter for IPOs in seven years. A mere eight, all in the health care field, raised just $700,000 combined. Q2 brought 33 IPOs, raising $5.5 billion. That's still far below average, but it sparked hopes for an IPO rebound.""IPO returns have been good and a completely different story than (early in the year),"" said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, which manages two IPO-focused exchange traded funds. ""We're still below last year, but activity is picking up.""IBD'S TAKE: It's important to focus on younger companies that are doing something new and on the rise. This is why IBD writes about fast-growing companies that went public within the past three years in the IPO Leaders column. IBD can also help you understand strong IPO bases.Renaissance counted 59 IPOs on U.S. stock exchanges this year through Thursday, 55% fewer than in the year-earlier period, and the $9.8 billion raised is down 56%. Yet the IPO market appears ripe to pick up the pace, says Renaissance, which expects 35 to 45 IPOs for the rest of 2016.IPOs often provide the funding fuel that young companies use to grow into multibillion-dollar businesses that innovate and create jobs. Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) were once tiny outfits that ballooned after their successful IPOs.Here's a brief rundown on likely tech IPOs coming this year that are receiving buzz:San Jose., Calif.-based Nutanix provides an enterprise cloud platform that converges traditional silos of servers, virtualization and storage into one integrated platform.For the nine months ended April 30, Nutanix reported revenue of $305.1 million, up 82% from the year-earlier period. Its net loss rose to $118.6 million from $88.9 million, as the company continues to spend heavily on expansion. Nutanix, in its IPO prospectus, said it expects to continue to incur losses ""for the foreseeable future.""Nutanix initially filed to make its IPO early this year, but it held back when stock markets plummeted in January and February on fears of China's slowdown and slower spending in the U.S., among other factors. Now the company is ready to take the plunge. It plans to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker NTNX. The lead underwriters are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan.Bellevue, Wash.-based Apptio makes software to help CIOs better manage their IT departments, through a platform called Technology Business Management. Its cloud-based software-as-a-service platform enables IT leaders to analyze, optimize and plan technology investments, and to benchmark their financial and operational performance against peers.For the six months ended June 30, Apptio reported revenue of $75.6 million, up 22% from the year-earlier period, and a net loss of $14.9 million, vs. a net loss of $18.4 million. The company is spending heavily on sales and marketing and research and development.It will list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol APTI. The lead underwriters are Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and BofA Merrill Lynch.For the six months ended June 30, according to the company's prospectus, Everbridge reported revenue of $24.5 million, up 34%, and a net loss of $6 million, compared with a net loss of $3.2 million, as it spends heavily on sales and marketing.Everbridge plans to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker EVBG. The lead underwriters are Credit Suisse and BofA Merrill Lynch.Ventura, Calif.-based Trade Desk provides a digital advertising technology platform for ad buyers, with a unique messaging platform.For the six months ended June 30, Trade Desk reported revenue of $77.56 million, up 83%, and net income of $6.5 million, vs. $5.67 million.It plans to trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker TTD. The lead underwriters are Citigroup, Jefferies and RBC Capital Markets.Other IPOs on watch lists are Yeti Holdings, a provider of premium outdoor and recreation products; low-cost cosmetics provider e.l.f. Beauty; Camping World, which operates a national network of RV-centric retail locations; motor oil provider Valvoline; and CBS Radio.RELATED:The 'Amazing' IPO Change That May Restart The Flow Of New StocksJapan's Facebook' Stays Local To Insure It Keeps GrowingAcacia, Twilio IPOs Set Stage For Closely Watched NutanixMedpace IPO Jumps 20%, Adding More Fuel For Growth In New IssuesIPI

769,TAP,"Apple (AAPL) is expected to introduce three new iPads in 2017, followed by significant changes to the portable device in 2018.Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo at KGI Securities, in a research note, said he expects Apple to introduce three new iPads: a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, 10.5-inch iPad Pro and a low-cost 9.7-inch iPad. KGI Securities is a wholly owned subsidiary of China Development Financial.Kuo predicts ""revolutionary"" and ""radical"" changes for the iPad in 2018 that will include a shift to active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) flexible displays, as reported by MacRumors and others. He also expects changes in form factor design.""We believe iPad will follow in the footsteps of the iPhone by adopting AMOLED panels in 2018 at the earliest,"" Kuo wrote. ""If Apple can truly tap the potential of a flexible AMOLED panel, we believe the new iPad model will offer new selling points through radical form factor design and user behavior changes, which could benefit shipments.""Kuo remains cautious in his predictions of iPad shipments due to a current lack of new models. He lowered his 2016 shipment forecast for iPads to a range of 35 million to 45 million units this year, down from 45 million to 50 million. But even with newly updated models in 2017, however, Kuo predicts tablet shipments will continue to decline as part of ongoing trends in the market.Apple stock finished the trading day up 1.2% to 109.48 on the stock market today. Apple stock is up 4% this year.IBD'S Take: With company sales declining in the past two quarters year over year, Apple needs new products to drive growth. The N in IBD's CAN SLIM Investing System stands for ""new,"" such as new products, services or management that can help drive profits and share prices higher.Apple is also planning a long-overdue upgrade to its MacBook Pro line of notebook computers. According to a Bloomberg report, the new laptops will be thinner, have an OLED touch-screen strip for function keys and offer more powerful graphics processors, the article said.The new MacBooks will be unveiled this fall, when the company also is expected to update its iPhone and Apple Watch.

770,TAP,"Yesterday, brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) raised its bid for SABMiller. But SABMiller management Wednesday told employees to stop working on integrating with AB InBev, widespread reports said.Investors including Aberdeen Asset Management have said AB InBev's revised offer to reflect the weaker pound following the Brexit still undervalues SABMiller. A week ago, AB InBev and SABMiller received U.S. regulatory approval for their $107 billion merger, which moved what would be the biggest-ever consumer products deal, creating a brewer with nearly 30% of the global market, closer to concluding.IBD'S TAKE: Belgian-based brewing giant AB InBev's stock hasn't formed a strong base in the last year as it tries to conclude its $107 billion SABMiller buyout. For a list of the leaders in the group go to the IBD Stock Checkup.AB InBev and SABMiller initially declined to comment, the reports said.Shares of AB InBev fell 3.7% to 121.94 in the stock market today.

771,TAP,"Apple (AAPL) will tap No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) to source 30-40 million iPhone 7 modems, but rival Qualcomm (QCOM) will remain top dog, Canaccord analyst T. Michael Walkley predicts.Meanwhile, Qualcomm's Chinese-licensing recovery is under way despite a $100 million quarterly dispute with South Korean LG, he wrote in a research report. Walkley reiterated his buy rating and 65 price target on Qualcomm stock.Qualcomm rose 0.6% and Intel 1% on the stock market today.  Apple fell 2.2%, extending losses after dropping below its 200-day moving average on Friday.IBD's Take: How healthy is Apple's stock? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupFor fiscal Q2 ended March 27, the consensus of 35 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Qualcomm to report 96 cents EPS minus items on $5.34 billion in sales, down 33% and 23%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.Three months ago, Qualcomm guided to $4.9 billion to $5.7 billion in sales and 90 cents to $1 EPS ex items. Then, Qualcomm outlined its improving Chinese negotiations which included four re-signed government-approved contracts.""With the recently signed Lenovo deal, we believe Qualcomm now has the top four Chinese (smartphone makers) licensed for 3-mode and all 3G/4G devices,"" Walkley wrote in a research report. He expects licensing sales to buoy in the latter half of 2016.Licensing sales toppled 20% sequentially back in fiscal Q3, ended last June 28, to just short of $2 billion amid the negotiations. Since then, the unit has seen 7%-8% sequential declines. No more, Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha says.For Q2, Garcha expects $2.2 billion in licensing sales, up 36% sequentially and down 10% vs. the year-earlier quarter. He expects $7.5 billion in total 2016 licensing revenue growing to $7.6 billion in 2017.But Qualcomm's chip sales could get snagged in headwinds, Garcha says. Qualcomm quintupled its content in the Samsung Galaxy S7, teardowns show, but it will likely lose some iPhone 7 share to Intel even as Apple shipments lag.Garcha retained his outperform rating and 67 price target on Qualcomm stock, which closed Monday at 51.55, up about 3% in 2016. Qualcomm has been in a downtrend for nearly two years.

772,TAP,"Lockheed Martin’s (LMT) first-quarter revenue is seen rising, but international sales could take a hit on lower oil prices, and its new Sikorsky helicopter division may underperform.On Tuesday, the maker of the F-35 and F-16 fighter jets kicks off a busy week for defense contractors, with Northrop Grumman (NOC), General Dynamics (GD) and Raytheon (RTN) also on tap. Boeing (BA), which has substantial defense operations, reports Wednesday.Analysts see Lockheed reporting a 5.5% drop in EPS to $2.59, following a 5% drop in Q4. Revenue is seen rising 12.4% to $11.36 billion, helped by recent acquisitions.All eyes will be on the Sikorsky unit that Lockheed bought from United Technologies (UTX) last year. In a February SEC filing, Lockheed said that the business ""may underperform relative to our expectations” and that demand for helicopters and other products from the unit could be “adversely affected by global economic conditions, including oil and gas trends that are outside of its control.”At Lockheed's annual media day in March, CEO Marillyn Hewson said that the company is taking a more cautious tone on international sales to the Middle East and others dependent on oil prices. In the Q4 earnings conference call, Hewson said that plunging oil prices haven’t affected weapon sales to the Middle East and that countries heavily dependent on oil exports are cutting back in other areas.Lockheed may also give an update on the progress of getting a deal with the Pentagon on lots nine and ten for the F-35.On Friday, a Lockheed spokesperson told the Washington Post that the company would lay off ""less than 200"" workers in its IT division. The cuts come after the company said in November that it would lay off 500 employees as it divests the unit as part of its deal with Leidos (LDOS) to focus on its aircraft and weapons units.Lockheed shares rose fractionally on the stock market Friday, up 0.3% to 226.81. The stock has been moving sideways for the past two weeks, less than 1% below a 228.01 buy point in a consolidation going back to late November.Northrop Grumman results are on tap for Wednesday. The Global Hawk maker’s EPS is seen climbing 3.3% to $2.49, but revenue is expected to dip 0.5% to $5.93 billion. Congress is pushing the Pentagon to buy even more of Northrop’s B-21 bombers. Northrop Grumman shares broke to a new high in weak volume late last month but remain in buy range.General Dynamics will also announce results Wednesday. Analysts see EPS edged up 0.9% to $1.26 and revenue down 1.2% to $7.69 billion. General Dynamics stock rose fractionally Friday but has been trading below its 200-day line since early December.Raytheon rounds out the week on Thursday.  Analysts expect the maker of the Tomahawk cruise missile to report a 23% drop in EPS to $1.38 but revenue is seen climbing 3.2% to $5.46 billion.

774,TAP,"Proofpoint (PFPT) smashed Wall Street's first-quarter expectations late Thursday, thanks in part to a $5 million billings pull-through, and boosted 2016 guidance by $5 million at the midpoint, prompting shares to rocket Friday.In early trading on the stock market today, Proofpoint stock jumped as much as 8% before paring the advance to a 2.5% gain in mid-morning trade, near 55. Shares are down more than 15% this year, but they have recovered 50% from a Feb. 8 bottom at 36.60 on concerns of a slowdown in IT spending.For Q1, Proofpoint reported $79 million in sales, up 37% year over year, and a 9-cent loss per share ex items vs. a 14-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter. Billings came in at $98.3 million, up 48%.All three metrics topped the high end of Proofpoint's guidance. The analyst consensus, meanwhile, had modeled $76.3 million in sales and a 14-cent loss per share.During Q1, Proofpoint's protection and advanced threat segment -- which represents 71% of sales -- grew 47% year over year, CFO Paul Auvil said on the late Thursday conference call. TAP (targeted attack protection) nearly doubled and accounted for half of all new add-on business, he said.Pacific Crest analyst Rob Owens called it a ""sign o' the times (as) momentum continues,"" and maintained his overweight rating and 66 price target on Proofpoint stock.""Proofpoint remains in the winners' camp relative to our bifurcation thesis, as results meaningfully outpaced expectations for the quarter,"" he wrote in a research report. ""Q1 was demonstrative of the multiple layers of potential upside for Proofpoint.""Current-quarter guidance for $83.5 million to $84.5 million in sales and $94 million to $96 million in billings would be up a respective 32% and 26% year over year. Proofpoint sees a per-share loss of 7-8 cents vs. a 9-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter.Billings guidance was slightly short of analyst views for $100 million, but Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski credited that to $5 million in early renewals that typically would have been factored into Q2.Nowinski retained his overweight rating and 76 price target on Proofpoint stock.Proofpoint also bumped up its full-year guidance.Partnerships with Intel (INTC) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) haven't yet been factored into guidance but are contributing to the pipeline, Nowinski wrote.""They did say revenue from a number of customers is double what they spent with Intel since they bought additional products like TAP or privacy,"" he wrote in a report. ""This suggests the overall opportunity could be larger than initially estimated.""

776,TAP,"Boeing (BA) is making moves to develop a new mid-range passenger jet, according to a report Friday from the Wall Street Journal, but the idea still needs board approval.""It's coming faster than you think,"" Mike Delaney, Boeing's vice president of airplane development, said in a presentation to reporters in June, according to the Journal. ""We have all the things we sort of need to put the airplane together.""Boeing had said in February that it was surveying customers about the need for a midsize plane to replace the 757, which was last produced in 2004. United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) are still flying 757s, and FedEx (FDX) uses a cargo version of the plane.But before Boeing gets approval for the new jet, it would need to prove it could build the aircraft at whatever price carriers and leasing companies require. If the board green lights the program, the new Boeing jet could enter service in 2024 or 2025.United Airlines shares rose 0.8% in the stock market today, while those of Boeing inched lower. American shares climbed 3.6%, Delta Air 0.9% and FedEx 1.3%.The new jet would need to fly trans-Atlantic routes and Asian market routes, between 2,900 and 5,000 nautical miles. It would be a rival to Airbus' (EADSY) A321s.Airbus' U.S.-listed shares fell 1.6%.Boeing has more concepts on the drawing board as well and is looking at a new version of the single-aisle 737 Max with new engines that could seat 250. Both new planes could be put into production.For the larger market, Boeing is looking at stretching  its 777 wide-body jet to carry 450 passengers, with an extra four rows of seats vs. the 777-9. The redesign would move Boeing's plane closer to the low end of the Airbus' A380's capacity.
"
777,TAP,"Tesla Motors (TSLA) cast a cloud over self-driving cars on June 30 when it revealed the first known fatal crash of a vehicle using its Model S Autopilot system.The next day, BMW (BMWYY) teamed up with Intel (INTC) and Mobileye (MBLY) to develop a fully automated driving system, a partnership one analyst called a ""turning point"" for autonomous vehicles.Safety questions or not, the self-driving car era is arriving fast, perhaps even this decade. Automakers and tech companies are plowing billions of dollars into research and forging alliances in a rush for the inside lane on the automobile's most revolutionary track since the Model T.""Everyone is doing something in this space or they'll get left behind,"" said Jeremy Carlson, an automotive technology analyst at research firm IHS. ""This is about the future of the automobile.""BMW said its alliance with Intel and Mobileye aims to ""enable the drivers to not only take their hands off the steering wheel, but reach the so-called 'eyes off' level and ultimately the 'mind off' level, transforming the driver's in-car time into leisure or work time"" -- as soon as 2021.The self-driving vehicle is gaining speed for many reasons. At stake is the future success not just of automakers, but also the suppliers of chips, software, sensors and other technology products that control the new cars.IBD'S TAKE: The auto industry currently ranks 189th in six-month stock performance out of 197 industry groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily.  Even Tesla holds a Relative Strength rating of just 20, indicating it has underperformed 80% of stocks in the past year. But innovation can be the key to future big winning stocks. To learn which stocks are leading the market now, check out IBD's Stock Lists.For automakers, it represents a huge opportunity to sell vehicles that come with driver assistance or self-driving technology. In the ride-sharing industry, Uber, Lyft and their global peers could deploy a fleet of self-driving cars and avoid having to pay drivers. And less human error could mean fewer accidents and less traffic and pollution. At the same time, insurance practices, driving laws and regulations will need rethinking.As is the case with all new technologies, there will be winners and losers. But it will be years before the dust settles to see who's still standing.Tesla's Autopilot has received much of the spotlight lately. The technology, which is installed on new Teslas in a disabled state but can be activated by drivers, is not fully self-driving. It keeps the car within a lane and lets users change lanes with the simple tap of a turn signal. It can manage speed and automatically brake and is designed to help avoid collisions. Drivers are supposed to stay focused on the road and be ready to take over at any time, says Tesla.In the fatal accident, a brightly lit Florida sky prevented the Autopilot system and the driver from detecting the tractor trailer that the car hit, Tesla says. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating.At BMW's July 1 announcement, the carmaker's CEO Harald Krueger expressed sorrow about the incident -- and the obvious: ""Today, the (self-driving) technologies are not ready for serious production.""On Thursday, Consumer Reports magazine urged Tesla to turn off Autopilot and stop referring to it as ""Autopilot,"" and to advise drivers to keep their hands on the wheel while the vehicle is in auto steering mode.Also Thursday, Sen. John Thune, R.-S.D., who heads the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, asked Tesla to brief the committee about the fatal Florida Autopilot crash by July 29. In a letter to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Thune said he was interested in company efforts to ensure the Autopilot technology was deployed safely, details of the incident and Tesla's cooperation with the NHTSA.Tesla stock declined 0.5% to $220.40 on Friday.But pretty much everyone in the auto industry is in the chase to be first with ""serious production"" technology.General Motors (GM), Ford (F) , Daimler (DDAIF) and others are fueling up their driverless car programs. GM, Volkswagen (VLKAY)  and Nissan (NSANY) all have cars on the road with Mobileye chips and software that use data from onboard cameras to keep cars within lanes, assist with braking and more.Toyota Motor (TM) plans to spend $1 billion through 2020 to develop self-driving cars.In the technology industry, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google is known for its pioneering moves in self-driving cars over the past six years. Its test cars, equipped with roof-mounted lasers, radars, cameras and (for now) test drivers, are regularly seen on the roads of Silicon Valley.Alphabet's efforts sped up with its May partnership announcement with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), its first with any car company. The pair agreed to jointly develop a fleet of 100 self-driving minivans.""The deal with Fiat Chrysler is the clearest signal yet that partnerships are where they want to take this,"" as opposed to Google becoming an automaker itself, said IHS analyst Carlson.Apple (AAPL) has not revealed its own plans, but it recently plowed $1 billion into Didi Chuxing, a ride-hailing service competing with Uber in China.Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Navigant Research, doubts either Apple or Google would build cars itself. ""They would likely partner with an existing manufacturer,"" he said.Both Apple and Google have lagged the Standard & Poor's 500 index this year. While the S&P is up 6%, Google stock has fallen 5% and Apple shares have dropped 6%.The latest forecast from IHS Automotive calls for sales of nearly 21 million autonomous vehicles in 2035. By then, IHS estimates that nearly 76 million vehicles with some level of autonomy will be sold globally.The consensus estimate seems to be that fully self-driving passenger cars will start motoring down the road in about four years. At first, the cars will likely be restricted to certain areas, and drivers probably will have to remain literally in the driver's seat, expected to take over when hazards arise.As autonomous driving nears, Uber and other ride-hailing services are attracting billions of dollars in investments.Those investments are a bet that ride-hailing services will lead the way in deploying self-driving vehicles. Their business is built on on-demand mobility. Uber last year confirmed it was developing driverless technology.Apple's investment in Didi was part of a $7.3 billion round of funding raised by the Chinese company. Apple so far has only vaguely hinted at its efforts in the automobile field, though its job listings indicate rapid hiring in the field.Volkswagen recently paid $300 million for a stake in Israeli startup Gett, raising its total funding to $520 million. Gett, an Uber rival, currently operates in New York, London, Moscow and Tel Aviv.San Francisco-based Uber, meanwhile, has collected a staggering $12 billion from investors since its 2009 start. It's Silicon Valley's most valuable private company, worth an estimated $62 billion.Its top U.S. rival, Lyft, has attracted more than $5 billion in funding from the likes of GM and Didi.Auto companies are investing in Uber and others partly with hopes to provide them fleets of cars. They also might gain access to reams of driver data that could be used for highly specific mapping information.GM invested $500 million in Lyft with a plan to develop a nationwide on-demand network of self-driving cars. GM also paid $1 billion to acquire Cruise Automation, a San Francisco startup developing software for hands-free driving.Not all automakers will succeed, says Kevin See, an analyst at Lux Research.And technology will not be the decider, according to See, who expects all companies to more or less employ the same technologies.""Few companies will have a significant technology advantage,"" he said. ""So winners will need to capitalize on novel business models, from car sharing and ride sharing to monetizing their own data.""To succeed, automakers most likely will aspire to become ""mobility providers,"" See says, earning money from services like ride sharing rather than solely from selling cars.Toyota recently announced a collaboration with Uber to create mobility services such as ride sharing and car sharing. ""Ride sharing has huge potential in terms of shaping the future of mobility,"" Shigeki Tomoyama, a Toyota senior managing officer, said in the announcement. ""Through this collaboration with Uber, we would like to explore new ways of delivering secure, convenient and attractive mobility services to customers.""Navigant has handicapped the race, saying Germany's Daimler is the No. 1 carmaker in self-driving strategy and execution. The Mercedes-Benz parent company says it's been working on the concept for decades. Its Mercedes F 015 drove itself onto the showroom floor at the January 2015 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, an early headline play in this field.Following Daimler, Navigant ranks in order the other leaders as Volkswagen's Audi, BMW, GM, Volvo, Ford and Toyota. Navigant ranked each company by a list of 12 criteria, such as partnerships and technology, sales and marketing, pricing and company commitment.Tesla, for all the recent attention, came in No. 11.""Tesla's financial stability is not that great, and they do not have a lot of strength in China, where we believe there is a lot of potential for deployment of autonomous vehicles,"" said Abuelsamid. (The company ranked only carmakers, so Google wasn't on the list.)As technology hits high gear, the big roadblocks in the drive toward self-driving cars is the need to develop regulations and insurance policies to cover this new era. NHTSA's investigation of the Tesla fatality could be crucial.Also this month, NHTSA is expected to release documents that will serve as the foundation for national regulations of autonomous vehicles.A handful of states, including California, already have some rules. No state has yet allowed cars without a human operator on the road except to conduct research.""Liability is the biggest problem that faces autonomous driving, as sending an algorithm to prison is not a practical option,"" Richard Windsor, an analyst at Edison Investment Research, told IBD via email. ""When autonomous vehicles crash, and they will, the question arises as to who is responsible for the crash.""Answering that question, says Windsor, is going to take many years.""We are sticking to our 2030 target for self-driving cars becoming a real commercial reality,"" he said.

780,TAP,"From the U.S. to Europe and Asia, markets are sending a clear signal -- the era of cheap money is far from over.Traders piled into equities, bonds and commodities as the Federal Reserve lowered its outlook for future rate hikes, soothing worries that global central banks would taper stimulus efforts. American stocks approached record highs, euro-region notes had their best day since Brexit, and the dollar fell against most major currencies. The decision also gave fresh impetus to emerging markets, with Russia and Argentina announcing debt sales. Commodities jumped for a sixth straight day as oil topped $46 a barrel.Stocks have surged, while bond yields fell to record lows as major central banks sought to boost growth with easy policies. Hours before the Fed scaled back tightening plans Wednesday, Japan tweaked its stimulus program, bolstering bets Europe will keep its accommodative stance. Thomas Lee, the biggest equity bull on Wall Street, said the U.S. monetary restraint is one more reason to bet shares will climb. Meanwhile, former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan called the rally in Treasuries unsustainable, and Janus Capital Group's Bill Gross said a bear market has been delayed.""It's a bit of a relief rally,"" said Chris Gaffney, the president of EverBank World Markets in St. Louis. ""Now we are onto the next piece of uncertainty, which is third quarter earnings and, of course, the election.""With central banks moving off center stage, investors will turn their attention to the first of three U.S. presidential debates on Monday ahead of the Nov. 8 election and another earnings season that gets underway in about three weeks. Data today showed the mixed picture in the world's largest economy -- sales of  previously owned homes declined in August, while filings for unemployment benefits dropped last week to match the lowest level since April.The U.S. 10-year note  yield dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.62%, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data.""Yields will remain at historically low levels for some time,"" Bill Irving, co-manager of Fidelity Government Income Fund said, according to the transcript of an interview on his firm's website. ""In that environment, I'd be cautious about reaching for yield.""Treasuries have rallied this year as economic circumstances in the U.S. and abroad caused the Fed to delay tightening policy multiple times after a liftoff from near zero in December. While signs of labor-market strength have led bond traders to price in a growing likelihood of a rate increase by year-end, other data such as August retail sales and industrial production have shown declines.The probability of a Fed move this year is about 57%, according to futures data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, the tightening cycle is poised to be the slowest and shallowest in recent history, based on the market for overnight index swaps, which reflect expectations for the fed funds effective rate.Benchmark German 10-year bund yields dropped the most since June 24, while those on Spanish five- and 10-year securities slid to all-time lows. The biggest gains were in longer-dated securities, which are more sensitive to the outlook for inflation and had underperformed last week in the run up to the Bank of Japan and Fed meetings.Russia offered investors $1.25 billion of 4.75% bonds in a tap of the 2026 notes it sold in May, according to the Finance Ministry. The Eurobonds were priced at 106.75% of face value, the ministry said.

784,TAP,"Beleaguered solar developer SunEdison (SUNE) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization early Thursday after securing $300 million in debtor-in-possession financing, the company said in a press release. The move had been expected.SunEdison stock -- which is 99% off its eight-year high of 31.66, hit on July 20 -- crashed spectacularly after it announced its now-failed plan to acquire residential developer Vivint Solar (VSLR). Shares were up a fraction midday Thursday, at 34 cents.Yieldcos TerraForm Power (TERP) and TerraForm Global (GLBL) stocks were up a respective 5.7% and 15.4% on news that the two wouldn't be included in the bankruptcy. Yieldcos are created to hold assets, generate dividends and provide on-tap cash flow.Neither TerraForm plans to file bankruptcy, the duo said in a joint release intraday Thursday. Both had earlier blamed SunEd's financial troubles and accounting system for their late 10-K filings and face potential delisting from the Nasdaq.SunEd Chief Executive Ahmad Chatila described the Chapter 11 filing as a reorganization that will let SunEd ""right-size"" its balance sheet and reduce debt. In a statement, Chatila called the filing ""a difficult but important step to address our immediate liquidity needs.""Restructuring will allow SunEdison to become more efficient as it sheds non-core assets and take advantage of its technological and intellectual assets, he said. Meanwhile, SunEd will continue ongoing projects and pay for products procured after the Chapter 11 filing. Employees still will receive wages and benefits.As of Sept. 30 -- SunEdison's last financial filing -- the company had racked up $11.7 billion in debt following what Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst Jenny Chase described as an ""acquisition binge.""""It borrowed a lot of money and lost it -- or at least tied it up in projects at various degrees of completion which it needs to sell to realize the gains and pay back creditors,"" Chase wrote in a research report. ""On the eve of the bankruptcy filing, these projects were for sale.""Rivals First Solar (FSLR), SunPower (SPWR) and Canadian Solar (CSIQ) could pilfer SunEd employees and acquire early-stage pipeline or projects, JPMorgan analyst Paul Coster wrote in a report. But there's risk SunEdison could flood the market in the near term, pressuring prices.SunEdison representatives directed media inquiries to the company's new restructuring website.

785,TAP,"Stocks finished lower Thursday as earnings reports continued to pour in, with some big names falling after hours on quarterly misses.The Dow Jones industrial average led the downside with a 0.6% loss, the S&P 500 gave up 0.5%, and the Nasdaq edged nearly 0.05% lower. Volume was mixed in the stock market today, slightly higher on the NYSE but lower on the Nasdaq, according to preliminary figures. Losers topped winners by a 5-3 margin on the NYSE; decliners barely outpaced advancers on the Nasdaq.The biggest losers included transportation, retail and homebuilder stocks.

That includes Corona Extra, Corona Light and Modelo Especial, all of which were gained after Anheuser-Busch InBev's (BUD) bought Grupo Modelo in 2013. With those brands, Constellation controls three of the four top spots in imported beer sales, with Corona and Modelo delivering 25% growth last year.But Constellation isn't stopping there. It entered the growing craft beer market with December's $1 billion acquisition of Ballast Point Brewing & Spirits of San Diego. Ballast is one of the fastest-growing craft beer companies in the U.S.In 2015, U.S. sales volume for craft beer grew 12.8% from a year earlier, while the overall beer market was nearly flat with 0.2% growth, according to the Brewers Association. As a result, the company is targeting both net sales growth and operating income growth in the 14% to 17% range for the beer business in fiscal 2017, including benefits from the Ballast Point buy.""The most important and biggest driver of growth -- and the most important variable for the stock -- is to what extent they can drive momentum in the beer business,” said Powers. ""Corona and Modelo Especial are the two brands that have been the drivers of growth and are the two big drivers for future growth.""S&P Global Market Intelligence equity analyst Joseph Agnese agrees.""I expect strong consumer demand for Constellation's beer products, driven by millennials and Hispanic Americans,"" Agnese told IBD. ""It (the growth) is supported by increased marketing spending and the launch of Corona Extra cans.""Agnese says craft beer is the fastest-growing segment of the domestic beer category. The Ballast Point purchase, he adds, goes along with the company's M&A strategy to acquire fast-growing, premium alcoholic beverages in wine, spirits and beer.Constellation also is benefiting from a trade-up to high-end beers and wines.""Constellation has carved out a more attractive niche within (the wine and spirits and beer) industry overall,"" said Powers. ""The U.S. beer market is not growing particularly well. But the Mexican import segment is growing quite well domestically. It's on trend, and there's lots of room for additional distribution.""It's not all just beer, though. Constellation is also the world’s leading premium wine company, with brands such as Robert Mondavi and Clos du Bois. In premium spirits, its brands include Svedka Vodka and Black Velvet Canadian Whisky.And all cylinders seem to be firing. Constellation's shares popped 5.9% to a record high on April 6 following its financial report for the fourth quarter ended Feb. 29, its 11th straight quarter of double-digit growth. The stock is up more than 37% from a year earlier. Its shares soared 52% through 2015, during which the company was one of the top-performing stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index.""It's about the strength of the quarter and, more importantly, the strength of the company's guidance looking into fiscal 2017,"" Powers said. ""The actual guidance was significantly better than investors expected coming into the quarter. Investors had expectations for the company to guide more conservatively. The guidance was an additional vote of confidence that, not only was the quarter good, but the momentum should carry over into fiscal 2017.""Constellation is targeting fiscal 2017 earnings per share of $6.05-$6.35 on a comparable basis and $6-$6.30 on a reported basis. The midpoints topped estimates at the time for $6.11.One of the company's strategic efforts to create shareholder value and strengthen the ""financial profile"" of its wine and spirits business is the possibility of doing an IPO for a portion of its Canadian wine and spirits business, CEO Sands said in a statement.""In fiscal 2016, our business in Canada delivered excellent overall financial results, outperformed the industry and gained market share, and we believe its full value is not being recognized,"" he said. ""An IPO will create better visibility to this dynamic part of the business.""Constellation will decide on whether it will pursue the IPO later in 2016.Agnese says he views the idea of an IPO for that business as a ""positive.""""It would make the company into a smaller, faster-growing company,"" he said. ""The Canadian wine and spirits business is a slower-growing part of the company vs. the beer business. The IPO would earn Constellation a bigger multiple on the ongoing beer business, and it would help investors isolate and value the Canadian business as a stand-alone company as well.""Constellation's financial picture looks bright. In the fourth quarter, earnings rose 15% to $1.19 a share. Sales jumped 14% to $1.54 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect fiscal 2017 earnings to rise 16% to $6.28 a share. They see a 13% gain in 2018 and in 2019.""I forecast Constellation will continue to grow quite well over the next several years and expand margins and profits along the way,"" said Powers. ""The challenge for the stock is that the price of the stock reflects that optimism, and there's a risk if they fall short.""

787,TAP,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) lagged Wall Street's Q1 revenue expectations late Tuesday on PC sales that grew minimally vs. the year-earlier quarter, and announced that up to 12,000 positions would be cut by mid-2017.The 12,000-cut represents 11% of Intel's global workforce and will require ""a combination of voluntary and involuntary departures and a re-evaluation of programs,"" according to the press release. Most affected employees will be notified within 60 days.And CFO Stacy Smith will move to a ""broader, new role within Intel"" leading sales, manufacturing and operations, and reporting directly to CEO Brian Krzanich. Smith will remain in his role pending a formal CFO search, Krzanich said on Intel's conference call with analysts, after it released results.Intel stock was down more than 2% after hours, having closed down 0.2% during the regular session. Shares are weaker by 8% for the year, having rebounded from a slide in January and mid-February amid reports of weak Taiwanese ODM sales.Krzanich detailed the restructuring in an email to employees, highlighting Intel's stepping away from PCs to focus on high-growth segments like the data center, Internet of Things and memory which, together, brought in $2.2 billion in revenue growth in 2015.""We are evolving from a PC company to a company that powers billions of smart, connected devices,"" Krzanich said on the call. ""We do not take these changes lightly. We will be saying goodbye to employees who have played a great role in Intel's success.""By restructuring, Intel plans to save $750 million in the first year, with an annual run rate savings of $1.4 billion by mid-2017, allowing Intel to ""intensify"" its investments in its key growth areas.Ultimately, ""we expect an even more profitable client computing group (PC),"" Krzanich added. PC sales comprised 55% of Intel's Q1 sales, but have struggled in recent quarters amid stiff tablet and two-in-one competition.For Q1 ended April 2, Intel reported $13.7 billion in sales and 54 cents earnings per share, up 7% and 20%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. EPS topped analyst expectations by more than a nickel, but sales missed.The consensus of 45 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters modeled $13.83 billion in sales (against Intel's non-GAAP revenue of $13.8 billion) and 48 cents EPS, in line with Intel's earlier view for $14 billion in sales, plus or minus $500 million.Nonvolatile memory sales declined 6% vs. the year-earlier quarter, underperforming the struggling PC unit, which managed to climb 2% year over year.Intel's high-growth units -- data center and Internet of Things -- grew a respective 9% and 22% year over year. Security sales popped 12% vs. the year-earlier quarter.Krzanich didn't address recent rumors that Apple (AAPL) might tap Intel to supply 30 million-40 million iPhone 7 modems -- a development that had sent Intel's stock jumping. Qualcomm (QCOM) typically sources the iPhone modem and would retain the lion's share of the iPhone 7, analysts say.Analysts largely doubt Intel's mobile strategy, which hasn't yet played out. But Krzanich, on the call, defended the mobile unit, which he said ""is absolutely continuing to grow for us as a segment, and we're increasing our profitability.""For the current quarter, Intel guided to $13 billion to $14 billion in sales, which would be up 2% at the midpoint vs. the year-earlier quarter. The company reduced its full-year guidance to mid-single-digit growth. Earlier, Intel saw mid- to high-single-digit growth.Pacific Crest and S&P Global Market Intelligence analysts had expected Intel to cut its full-year guidance on the ebbing PC market, which industry trackers IDC and Gartner recently saw dipping 11.5% and 9.6%, respectively, in Q1 shipments.Days after the forecasts emerged, rumors cropped up that Intel might be prepping to cut thousands of jobs. Image provided by Shutterstock.

788,TAP,"These are exhilarating times and trying times to be an ETF investor. It's easy to get carried away by the headlines that the major averages are making all-time highs. Until the fine print reminds you they're basically back to where they were a year ago.""It's been an unprecedented equity market roller coaster,"" Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer of equities at Charles Schwab Investment Management, said on a July 12 media call. While Aguilar was speaking after the stock boomerang following Britons' vote to leave the European Union, he was referring more generally to the sharp bouts of volatility that have accompanied U.S. stocks' slow and relentless grind sideways over the past year.Exchange traded funds allow Americans to invest in far-flung international markets with one tap on a touch screen. Even better, they allow investors to make opportunistic trades depending on their outlook for the asset class and the global macroeconomy.But this investment vehicle's flexibility can seem double-edged when the stock market outlook changes as often it has lately. For Aguilar, Brexit reinforces the uncertainties that ETF investors are already grappling with. Will a potential loss of confidence spill over to our shores? Which emerging markets are likely to face collateral damage? What could further weakening of the British pound mean for the dollar and U.S. portfolios?These are important issues to investors. More than ever before, they understand the importance of allocating to international as well as domestic markets to diversify portfolios and reduce risk. However, they're feeling stuck between a rock and a hard place. Earnings are on a downswing in corporate America. The profit outlook is equally or more bleak in Europe, Japan and many emerging markets.The performance of two ETFs tells this painful story clearly: iShares MSCI ACWI (ACWI), which provides access to the global stock market in a single fund, has given up 2% in the past year through July 13.If that sounds depressing, consider this: iShares MSCI ACWI ex US (ACWX), which also invests in the global stock market but shuts out the United States, has slumped more than 8% over the same period.Not all international markets are hurting though. As oil rallied, iShares MSCI Brazil Capped (EWZ) jumped 53% to become one of the best-performing ETFs of 2016 so far.Click Here For A Table Of The Best Performing ETFs Of 2016 All told, investing experts largely agree upon these grim facts: Global volatility is here to stay in the near term, and portfolio returns are unlikely to creep above the single digits. That has some investing experts asking: Does it still make sense to invest internationally in the current market scenario? At BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager and the firm behind iShares ETFs, strategists are optimistic that U.S. earnings will improve in the second half. However, they caution investors and financial advisors that the rebound may not be as big as many expect.""U.S. equities are the least dirty shirt of global equity markets, although high valuations keep our return expectations in check,"" Richard Turnill, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, wrote in a July 11 research note. In this decidedly mixed climate, he favors quality stocks and dividend growers.That preference for domestic stocks is, by and large, shared by the ETF investing pros who spoke to IBD about how they're constructing portfolios for the months ahead. In a recent interview, they offered unique perspectives on rate hikes, currency volatility, Brexit contagion and more.Susanne Alexandor is vice president and client portfolio manager at Cougar Global Investments, a Toronto-based tactical ETF strategist that seeks to achieve high portfolio returns primarily by managing downside risk; assets under advisement: $1.23 billion.Our message and positioning for our global unconstrained portfolios remain ""stay close to home"" in the United States. Cougar Global's strictly macro-focused approach continues to view the U.S. economy as in relatively better shape than its global peers. The flexible U.S. labor market has played a role. Proactive policymaking by the Federal Reserve under Ben Bernanke and now Janet Yellen has also helped. While it is difficult to isolate the effects of quantitative easing on the economy, we now know the economy eventually recovered from the Great Recession and remains on track to grow modestly. Confidence is up. The American consumer accounts for over 70% of gross domestic product, and has been spending, comforted by the continuing creation of jobs that has seen the unemployment rate drop back under 5%. The most recent employment report confirmed yet again that the labor market is healthy.The outlook for the path of rate hikes is very cautious, so as to not derail the expansion and exert further upward pressure on the U.S. dollar. We therefore hold our exposure almost evenly split between the cap-weighted S&P 500 and S&P Midcap 400 ETFs. We remain mindful of the effects of currency volatility, and midcaps tend to have less earnings exposure outside the United States than large caps.We have avoided the United Kingdom, Europe and Japan. All three have unique challenges. Japan's inability to escape 20 years of stagnation and deflation is concerning. We foresee little change within our 12-month horizon.In Europe, Brexit contagion has us concerned. The economic impact for the U.K. and Europe is sure to be negative in the short term, and its magnitude will depend on what the U.K. eventually negotiates. More important, the stability of the European Union and the euro are at risk. Euro-skeptical populist parties are gaining in polls across the continent. With several elections over the next year, the political landscape in Europe could change dramatically. Austria will be rerunning its election on Oct. 2. The anti-immigration, anti-EU candidate Norbert Hofer has another chance to become the first far-right leader of an EU country.Combined with the weak banking sector, high unemployment, tight fiscal policy and lack of structural reforms, the European macro outlook is not promising -- as evidenced by the negative yields offered across a large segment of the bond universe.Emerging markets have recovered this year as the U.S. dollar rally faded. However, we remain unconvinced that the fundamentals in many of these markets will result in a sustained growth trend. China's continuing moderation will also present challenges.With geopolitical and macro concerns escalating, we have become more defensively positioned by allocating more to gold and bonds at the expense of equities.Loose central bank policies continue to underpin market sentiment, collectively doing ""whatever it takes"" as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi famously said. For the time being, that may be enough to support markets. Despite our caution, we are still allocating a healthy portion of our mandates to the most promising opportunity: staying close to home in U.S. equities.(Editor's note: Cougar Global strategies include SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), SPDR S&P Midcap 400 (MDY), iShares Core S&P Small-Cap (IJR), iShares Core US Aggregate Bond (AGG) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU).)Jeff Raupp is senior vice president at Brinker Capital, an investment management firm in Berwyn, Pa., that emphasizes a multiasset approach to portfolio construction while actively managing market opportunities and downside risks; assets under management: $18 billion.We've had a strong bias within our equity portfolio toward the United States, and continue to maintain that bias going forward. Within the U.S., our focus has been on large-cap stocks, believing those have more attractive valuations than smaller-cap stocks. We also have had a bias toward higher dividend stocks, although we have been reducing that bias as those stocks have rallied sharply. While developed international markets are priced cheaper than the U.S., we think slower growth and political uncertainty warrants their lower valuations.Europe and Japan have fully engaged central banks, which will utilize any tools at their disposal to stimulate their economies. However, both have to contend with already low interest rates and large balance sheets, which will likely limit their effectiveness.The outcome of the Brexit referendum creates an added level of uncertainty for Europe and the United Kingdom that will likely dampen future business investment to some extent. In spite of central bank stimulus, I wouldn't expect demand to pick up substantially until we get some clarity on the future U.K.-eurozone relationship. It appears that could play out over the next several years.Longer term, Europe continues to work through structural issues created by a common currency without integrating more fully. And Europe as well as Japan will suffer from poor demographics in the coming decades. This creates a longer-term headwind for investment in both of those regions.While we are underweight developed markets, we think the benefits of a multiasset class approach are too powerful to abandon investing overseas altogether. While the U.S. appears to be the strongest economy, that could quickly change with a Fed policy mistake or headwinds from a political standpoint.Emerging markets are more attractive to us than developed markets. Generally, the long-term fundamentals are good -- much better demographics and higher GDP growth -- although that can vary greatly country to country. Emerging markets have been unloved over the last four to five years because of their association with commodities and, with commodity prices appearing more stable, we think emerging markets present some attractive valuations. Our focus within emerging markets has been on consumer-based economies as they've tended to provide more diversification from the developed markets and were less affected by the downdraft in commodity prices. Now that commodity prices have stabilized, we've been increasing our exposure to the broader emerging market universe. After multiple years of underperformance, emerging markets are an area where I think many investors are underinvested, and we should start seeing a shift in that direction.Frontier markets are also an area we like. These markets, such as Kuwait, Argentina and Pakistan, tend to be less global in nature, and driven more by their own fundamentals. Similar to emerging markets, you have a demographic tailwind, and investors are really just starting to discover the space.Benjamin Lavine is chief investment officer at 3D Asset Management, an independent Connecticut firm that has $750 million in AUM and works with fee-based financial advisors to bring low-cost, ETF-based solutions to individual clients.We would be more inclined to invest internationally despite the risks surrounding Brexit and China slowdown. The United States remains the top choice among global investors, but the S&P 500 trades at 17.9 times earnings based on next-12-month consensus estimates. A lot of things need to go right for the U.S. markets to maintain or expand these valuation levels. We believe valuations are more attractive internationally, although our preference is for emerging markets over foreign developed markets given the growth challenges in major blocs such as Japan and Europe. We think that Europe, including the United Kingdom, will continue to face further fallout from the vote to leave the European Union (""Brexit""), but much of the near-term demand will be driven by liquidity-driven repositioning.  The long-term arrangement between the U.K. and Europe has yet to be determined.We believe that investors cannot divorce the currency view from the market view when deciding whether to invest in foreign markets vs. the home market. In other words, investors should generally not allocate capital to foreign assets if they are uncomfortable with the underlying currency used to value those assets. Currencies are very difficult to time. In general, we view currency hedging more as an insurance policy against the underlying market exposures rather than as a tactical, alpha-seeking trade.If we are concerned about short-term volatility in the foreign currencies, we seek an insurance policy (hedging) for our longer-term allocation. We may hedge our asset class views through the adoption of a currency hedged ETF. The embedded costs include the trading expenses to implement the hedge as well as the cost-of-carry or the interest-rate differential between the home currency vs. foreign currency. Additional costs include trading expertise embedded in some of the more actively managed ETFs such as dynamic currency-hedged ETFs.Currently, we are invested in FlexShares Currency Hedged Morningstar EM Factor Tilt (TLEH) as a way to hedge some of our emerging market exposure. In the past, we used WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity (HEDJ) as a way to hedge our European equity exposure from a falling euro. We estimate the cost-of-carry for emerging-market hedging at around 2.5%, which may seem high (due to interest-rate differentials), but we harbor ongoing concerns about China's currency policies and the spillover of further devaluations on the broader markets.With respect to the Brexit vote, we did not position our ETF portfolios in anticipation of a specific outcome. Polls had the vote neck-and-neck, and markets, in hindsight, had aggressively priced in a ""remain"" outcome more than what was warranted based on the polling. Although the British pound continues to weaken vs. the other major developed currencies, both the euro and the yen continue to hold their value vs. the U.S. dollar. Given that the bond market does not expect any Fed tightening for the remainder of the year, we do not anticipate further strengthening of the dollar vs. the yen and the euro.Investors interested in currency hedged ETFs should first determine the desired level of hedging. The large ETF providers such as iShares, WisdomTree, and Deutsche X-trackers offer dollar-hedged versions of mainstream equity indices. IndexIQ offers 50% hedged ETFs as well. Finally, iShares offers dynamic-hedged ETFs based on MSCI's Adaptive Hedge Indices, and WisdomTree also offers their own line of dynamically hedged indices. Dynamic hedging incorporates valuation and technical signals to determine the appropriate hedge ratio.(Editor's note: 3D Asset's views should not be relied upon as investment advice or a forecast of the future.

789,TAP,"Stocks finished narrowly mixed Wednesday as the market paused from its recent rally. But the Dow Jones industrial average eked out another new high, thanks to gains from UnitedHealth Group and Microsoft.The Dow closed up 0.1%, while the S&P 500 was fractionally higher. The Nasdaq composite eased 0.3%, though it held above the 5000 level. Volume was lighter across the board vs. Tuesday, according to preliminary data.Oil stocks led the downside in the stock market today, as West Texas Intermediate crude slid nearly 4% to about $45 a barrel. The Energy Information Administration's weekly industry report showed a surprise rise in U.S. oil stockpiles. Biotechs and retailers also lagged.Gold miners were the biggest gainers, with gold futures climbing nearly 1% to $1,344 an ounce. Managed care providers and media stocks advanced too. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) led the Dow with a 1.2% gain. Shares are nearly extended from a 135.21 flat-base buy point cleared June 2.Microsoft (MSFT), up nearly 1% to stretch its winning streak to a seventh straight session, also boosted the blue chip index. Shares are working on the right side of a shallow consolidation. RBC Capital Markets reiterated an outperform rating and 61 price target on the Surface and Xbox maker, citing confidence in Microsoft's ability to maintain EPS growth.CSX (CSX) surged 4% in heavy volume to a seven-month high after the railroad operator reported Q2 earnings and revenue that topped views.On the IBD 50, Masco (MAS) followed through on a Tuesday breakout past a 33.02 flat-base buy point, adding 1% in heavy volume to a new high.

790,TAP,"Media leaks over who could buy Yahoo (YHOO) -- Verizon Communications (VZ), AT&T (T) or somebody else -- have died down ahead of the web portal's annual meeting on Thursday, where shareholders will likely ask for an update on the sales process.Besides Verizon and AT&T, private equity firms are believed to be among the bidders. The sales process has dragged on since early May. Most reports have cited bids in a range of $4 billion to $6 billion for Yahoo's core internet assets, real estate and patents.Shareholders are expect to approve Yahoo's new board of directors, which in April was expanded to 11 from nine members. Six have been added since March, posing a challenge for Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer.Yahoo shook up its board in April, agreeing to add four new members at the behest of activist investor Starboard Value. With two current board members leaving, Yahoo in April also changed the make-up of some committees.Yahoo's three-member Strategic Review Committee, which has been exploring Yahoo's sale, is chaired by Thomas McInerney, former CFO of Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC). It also includes Eric Brandt, a former Broadcom (AVGO) executive. Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith was added to the strategic review committee in April.Brandt had joined Yahoo's board in March, along with Catherine Friedman, a former managing director at Morgan Stanley (MS).Yahoo shareholders are expected to approve the three other Starboard nominees: Tor Braham, a former Deutsche Bank (DB) managing director; Eddy Hartenstein, former CEO of satellite broadcaster DirecTV; and Richard Hill, former CEO of semiconductor gear maker Novellus Systems.Yahoo has a market cap near $35 billion, but the vast bulk of its value stems from its big stakes in Alibaba Group (BABA) and Yahoo Japan.Two private equity firms and a group led by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert -- and said to include Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKA) Warren Buffett -- were recently reported to be still in the hunt for Yahoo.New internet privacy rules could hinder AT&T and Verizon if they buy Yahoo, some analysts say.Yahoo stock, which touched a three-month low of 35.05 on Monday amid the Brexit fallout, closed up 2.3% at 36.86 in the stock market today.

791,TAP,"Health Reform: For decades, lawmakers have tried to fix glaring faults at the Veterans Health Administration, only to find the government-run health program get worse. What's clearly needed is a wholesale overhaul of the system, one that exposes the VA to the bracing winds of competition. Donald Trump's plan, released this week, comes closest to getting there.Trump is absolutely right in his diagnosis of what ails the program: ""Politicians in Washington have tried to fix the VA by holding hearings and blindly throwing money at the problem. None of it has worked.""It is a classic example of a single-payer health care system -- wasteful, inefficient and impervious to change.A case in point is the $10 billion ""reform"" passed two years ago that was supposed to relieve chronic, and at times deadly, delays that veterans had to endure to get treatment. An Associated Press investigation found that wait times had not improved at all last year. An NPR analysis found that wait times had gotten worse this year, and that the ""Veterans Choice Program"" had failed.Meanwhile, a recent Government Accountability Office report found that two-thirds of the veterans it tracked had to wait from 22 to 71 days to see a primary care doctor.The 2014 reform bill was also supposed to improve accountability after it was revealed that the VA was involved in widespread efforts to purposely mask actual wait times.But no one involved in that scandal was fired, no charges were brought against any officials, even two who allegedly defrauded the program of $400,000.And an inspector general report found that at least one clinic -- located in Houston -- had continued to falsify its wait times to make them look much shorter than they were.Trump, like everyone else, calls for rooting out corruption and incompetence, waste and fraud. But the core of Trump's reform plan promises to directly address these failings by injecting real competition into the program.Unlike the fatally flawed Veterans Choice Program -- which the VA quickly smothered under red tap -- Trump would let veterans take their ID cards to any doctor who accepts Medicare, no questions asked.That will let veterans vote with their feet and, as Trump says, ""force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veterans' healthcare dollars.""This isn't the full-fledged privatization that we have supported, and Trump also wants to needlessly throw still more money at various VA health services. But his core reform would move the veterans health program decidedly in the right direction.At the very least, his plan is far superior to Hillary Clinton's. She claims to want to ""fundamentally reform"" the VA, but aside from standard-issue calls for more accountability, the only thing new in her plan is a new level of bureaucracy -- called the President's Council on Veterans. And she vows to block any efforts to privatize the VA.Decades of real-world experience show that Clinton's approach won't work. Common sense says that, done right, Trump's would.

796,TAP,"Time Warner (TWX) and 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) chief executives tried to shrug off the summer superhero doldrums at Goldman Sachs' annual Communacopia conference Wednesday, a stark contrast to Walt Disney's (DIS) Hollywood bullishness.The critics were unkind to this summer's DC Comics-based movies, but Time Warner chief Jeff Bewkes said that the studio's DC superhero movies -- i.e. ""Suicide Squad"" and ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" -- were ""very successful"" in their strategic and financial aims.""Every panel ... requires talking out of both sides of their mouths,"" he said. ""This is the part where we say, 'Pay no attention to the critics.'

800,TAP,"When I worked my way through college in the 1940s, tuition was $200 to $250 a year. My children's tuition was $2,000 to $2,500 a year, and my grandchildren's college education each cost $20,000 to $40,000 a year for tuition alone.College is so expensive that only about half of today's college graduates think their degree was worth the cost, according to a survey by Gallup-Purdue. The more debt the student incurs, the more likely he is to doubt that he received his money's worth.The total amount of student debt in the United States is a staggering $1.2 trillion, which exceeds even the annual discretionary spending of the entire United States government, including military spending. College debt burdens more than 40 million Americans, of whom more than 4 million are in default on their student loans.Student loan debt is now more than 50% higher than total credit card debt held by American consumers. Many students are saddled with more than $50,000 in obligations upon graduation, without any good job prospects that would enable them to pay down that debt.While college costs have skyrocketed, the value of the experience has declined. For example, free speech has become an endangered species at most colleges, and conservative commencement speakers are almost unheard of at public universities.Liberal Hollywood actors and Democratic politicians are perennial picks as speakers on Commencement Day, and this spring's ceremonies are no exception. A study last year found that liberal speakers outnumbered conservatives by a six-to-one margin for commencement addresses at the top 100 universities, and if the study had compared liberal to social conservative speakers, the imbalance would have been even greater.New terminology is needed to justify the rampant censorship that is imposed by liberals on college campuses today. A ""safe space"" is an area on campus where conservatives are not allowed to speak freely, and a ""trigger warning"" is an alert that something politically incorrect is about to follow.The Obama administration, through the federal Department of Education, is partly responsible for the vanishing amount of free speech on campus. Under the George W. Bush administration, a federal standard had protected free speech by proclaiming that ""the mere expression of views, words, symbols or thoughts that some person finds offensive"" could not alone constitute harassment.But in 2013 Obama changed that standard to expand the concept of sexual harassment to include words that are merely ""unwelcome."" Liberal colleges then widened this further to include as prohibited ""unwelcome"" speech anything that might offend with respect to any of these vast categories: gender, race, veteran status, and religion.The test of what constitutes harassment is no longer objective, but is subjective based on how the listener views the words spoken. If a professor or even another student says something that is unwelcome, then it could constitute harassment under the Obama rule.The result has been a paralysis in discussion and debate at many colleges. Far from being a dynamic environment encouraging independent thinking, colleges have become mental straight-jackets that suffocate the minds of the students.Choice of a major can make a big difference as to whether the college experience is a waste of time, or something that might lead to a good job. Anthropology, film, and fine arts are rated by Forbes magazine as three of the worst college majors, and to those I would add women's and gender studies, which not only fail to teach an employable skill but also mislead students into disastrous ideologies.Good majors can be pursued in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), but even there the future is not as rosy as it should be. Employers tap into foreign labor in those fields, exploiting the H-1B visa and other programs to hire workers who are bound to employers like indentured servants, and more profitable than American college graduates.In medicine, large health systems such as the Mayo Clinic are bringing in foreigners to practice medicine in the United States. Minnesota reportedly has more than 400 immigrant physicians who are not licensed to practice medicine yet, but plan to be.There's a shortage of good residency programs for Americans who graduate from medical school, who are then unable to obtain the training necessary to start their careers. Yet employers are bringing in foreigners to fill some of those residency positions, which is bad policy for American physicians and patients alike.The big majority of students in college today are women rather than men, in contrast with a generation ago. But many of those women will want to choose careers of homemaking rather than 9-to-5 jobs in the workforce, raising the question of whether it was worth it for them to incur debt of $50,000 or more in going to college, debt that they cannot get rid of even by declaring bankruptcy.

801,TAP,"The dollar has been the not-so-jolly green giant for corporate America since mid-2014, cutting top- and bottom-line growth. But with the buck retreating, the negative impact for IBM (IBM) and other U.S. multinationals faded in Q1 results, with even more improvement expected going forward.The U.S. dollar index fell Tuesday to its lowest levels since last August's flash market crash. That continued a downtrend this year after a huge run from mid-2014 to late last year. S&P 500 companies with heavy overseas exposure already are seeing smaller FX losses and raising full-year guidance on currency trends.""About 50% of (Johnson & Johnson's) sales come from overseas,"" said Lindsey Bell, senior analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""That’s an encouraging sign.""The dollar index shot up 25% from June 2014 to November 2015. That made U.S. exports less competitive, while reducing the dollar value of overseas income and revenue.The strong buck also contributed to the huge sell-off in dollar-priced commodities, with crude oil falling as much as 75%, hurting energy companies and emerging markets, both of which hurt the industrial sector.The dollar rose in large part because the Federal Reserve was moving toward raising rates, which it finally did last December, while other central banks eased policy. But the Fed has turned more dovish this year amid sluggish economic growth and financial turmoil earlier this year. The Fed now indicates just two rate hikes this year, down from four previously, with markets seeing just one tightening step, perhaps not until September.Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank pushed ahead with negative rate policies, but their currencies unexpectedly rallied on those moves.  Also, China's yuan recovered its early 2016 losses vs. the dollar.""The dollar index was up 14% (year over year) as of August 2015,"" said Robert Keiser, vice president at S&P Global Market Intelligence.The dollar is now down about 4% vs. a year earlier, suggesting that the FX impact will continue to fade or even start to turn positive. The weaker dollar also has helped U.S. crude prices rise back above $40 a barrel from the mid-$20s in January.A slew of corporate giants with huge international exposure likely will report less of a dollar impact in the next week or so.

803,TAP,"Wall Street split Friday on Intel's (INTC) shrouded PC future. At least one analyst hedged on Intel getting an Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7 chip win, as the No. 1 chipmaker prepares to unveil Q1 earnings after the close Tuesday.Intel stock was down a fraction in afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 32. Shares tanked 18% in January and early February on reports of more PC weakness, hitting a year-low 28.22 on Feb. 11. Since then, Intel stock has recovered 13%.For Q1, Intel is expected to report $13.86 billion in sales and 48 cents earnings per share, up a respective 8.5% and 17% from Q1 2015, per the consensus of 45 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Three months ago, Intel guided to $14 billion in sales, plus or minus $500 million.Pacific Crest analyst Michael McConnell and S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Angelo Zino expect Intel to miss the midpoint of its guidance. And McConnell sees Intel cutting its full-year guidance. In January, Intel guided to mid- to high-single-digit sales growth over its $55.36 billion in 2015 sales.Zino notes, ""The PC landscape appears to be softer than originally anticipated.""MKM analyst Ian Ing acknowledged Intel's strong data center sales (about 30% of revenue) but expects Intel's PC weakness ""(to) more than offset strength in cloud computing.""He expects a flat Q2 for PC sales following a subseasonal Q1.But Zino sees Intel's year-over-year PC losses becoming less pronounced exiting 2016, despite a likely challenging first half. Industry trackers IDC and Gartner predicted 11.5% and 9.6% PC shipment declines in Q1.""We see an aging PC landscape (over 600 million devices more than five years old), market share gains and new innovative devices supporting CCG (client computing group) revenue as the year progress,"" Zino wrote in a research report.He reiterated his 39 price target on Intel stock. McConnell has a 35 price target and overweight rating on Intel stock. Ing maintained his buy rating but cut his price target to 38 from 40 on Intel stock.Intel has striven to get its chips inside the iPhone, and rumors recently circulated that Apple might tap the No. 1 chipmaker to source some of its iPhone 7 modems. Qualcomm (QCOM) has supplied the iPhone modem in the past four flagship smartphones.But Ing doubts that Apple would risk implementing an Intel chip. Teardowns show that Intel last supplied an iPhone chip in the 2008 iPhone 3G.""We retain some skepticism that Apple would add risk to their global launches,"" he wrote in a report.

804,TAP,"When a small-cap semiconductor company starts getting mentioned alongside the likes of Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Amazon.com (AMZN), Wall Street tends to take notice.That’s what happened recently when Inphi (IPHI), a maker of high-speed semiconductors, said it will team with Microsoft on a new product designed to make it easier for companies to connect data centers.The news prompted several analysts to upgrade shares of Inphi, which has a market cap of about $1.3 billion. Deutsche Bank's Ross Seymore upgraded Inphi to buy from hold and hiked his price target on the stock to 40 from 30. Analysts with Northland and Stifel Nicolaus also raised their price targets on Inphi.""We have long acknowledged Inphi’s solid execution and technology position but have maintained a hold rating awaiting an opportunistic entry point,"" Seymore wrote in a research report. ""The size and diversity of the growth drivers the company is addressing are too compelling to ignore.""Inphi's new product -- known in industry parlance as a 100-gigabit, 4-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4) platform -- has been dubbed ""ColorZ."" It's capable of connecting multiple data centers within 50 miles.Introduced on March 22 at the annual Optical Fiber Communications conference in Anaheim, Calif., ColorZ helped Inphi shares to a 5% gain that day and almost 8% the next. The stock kept moving higher in subsequent sessions -- setting a new high of 34.87 on April 1 -- and it currently trades near 34.Inphi is due to report first-quarter results after the close on April 28. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings of 26 cents a share, up 13% from a year earlier. Revenue is seen rising 12% to $66.3 million. Full-year earnings are expected to climb 24% in 2016 and another 30% in 2017.The current industry standard is for a much slower 10-gigabit platform. ColorZ also is less expensive than other 100-gigabit options, such as long-haul products that cover much wider distances. The product will be able to deliver more than four terabits of bandwidth over a single fiber when it becomes available later this year, likely during the third quarter.ColorZ represents another stage in a relationship that began in 2013, when Microsoft enlisted Inphi to help resolve some of its data center issues.""The ability to provide high bandwidth connectivity in a form factor that is smaller, uses less power and is less expensive than today’s solutions is a benefit to Microsoft and the cloud market in general,"" Jeff Cox, Microsoft’s senior director of network architecture, said in a statement.Some analysts expect ColorZ to rival infrastructures by such tech heavyweights as Apple, Facebook and Amazon.com -- all of which have been expanding their cloud operations to meet growing demand for online content. In addition to speeding the process of building out data centers at Microsoft, the ColorZ also is expected to expand the entire cloud computing industry.The data center interconnect market is estimated at just above $1 billion, according to industry tracker ACG Research. It is expected to reach $4.7 billion by 2019.Inphi has a number of products designed to tap into that and other markets. The company’s lineup includes analog multiplexers, encoders, amplifiers and memory buffers for servers, routers and storage equipment.These products let central processing units use available memory resources more efficiently. It also provides high-speed analog semiconductor solutions for the communications market and high-speed memory interface solutions for the computing market.Much of Inphi’s growth is expected to come from rising demand for 100-gigabit optical networks amid what some industry experts call a ""data explosion."" This explosion has been driven by the growth of social networking, cloud computing, e-commerce and ""Big Data"" -- the term used to describe large, complex data that cannot be handled by traditional data processing applications.""Our consistent view has been, and continues to be, that the explosion of Big Data and the need for its rapid transmission is an ongoing trend and an enormous opportunity for Inphi,"" Chief Executive Ford Tamer said on a fourth-quarter conference call with analysts. ""We firmly believe the transition to higher-speed data movement enabled by Inphi is ongoing and inevitable.""Last month’s Inphi-Microsoft product announcement fortifies Inphi’s leadership in the transition, analysts say. In a recent note, Sterne Agee CRT analyst Douglas Freedman said the announcement demonstrates Inphi's ability to build optical solutions that are ""market disruptive"" and can expand the total available market.Inphi uses the occasional acquisition to bolster its technology and market share, though the company also invests a lot of money in research and development. Last year its R&D expense was $106.4 million, up 50% from the prior year.Financially, Inphi has delivered nine straight quarters of double-digit revenue growth. As for the bottom line, it had posted eight straight quarters of double- or triple-digit earnings growth before the streak ended during the 2015 fourth quarter.Earnings for that quarter came in at 32 cents a share, up 7% from the prior year and 6 cents above consensus analyst views. Revenue gained 18% to $64.4 million, in line with estimates.""With optical demand recovering in all three major geographies, (Inphi) has good visibility into its core infrastructure business through (the first half of 2016),"" Needham analyst Quinn Bolton said in a research note. ""We remain confident in (Inphi’s) growth prospects.""One potential headwind is Inphi’s exposure to China, where the company received just more than one-third of its revenue last year. China’s slowing economic growth is seen as a risk for companies with large stakes in the country, though CEO Tamer downplayed that risk during the fourth-quarter conference call.""While there are some warnings of impending market weakness, particularly from China,"" Tamer said, ""we at Inphi have seen a resumption of growth based on the renewed build-out of telecom and cloud infrastructure.""

806,TAP,"In the oil business, not all shale plays are created equal.The Permian Basin has seen production rates fall less than in other basins in the U.S. during the current downturn thanks to its exceptional geology. Diamondback Energy (FANG), an exploration and production company, is dominating prime acreage in the lucrative basin.""I would say their balance sheet is one of the strongest in the E&P sector after several major acquisitions in recent years,"" Dave Meats, a senior analyst at Morningstar, said of Midland, Texas-based Diamondback.Diamondback's most recent acquisition was in July for $560 million worth of assets in the southern portion of the Permian. It also announced an offering of 5.5 million shares to help finance the deal.""(Management) was very conservative and carried out acquisitions with equity offerings,"" Meats said. ""They will have no trouble when they want to tap into equity markets again. But the downside is that serially issuing equity can potentially lead to dilution.""Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, said he liked Diamondback's chart and that the company will more than make up in revenue gains from the play to compensate for the large investment in the coming years.""What sets them from their peers is that they have a good balance sheet and good cash flow,"" Flynn said. ""Unlike some of the smaller players in the basin that took a big hit (when oil prices fell), Diamondback weathered the storm and is in a better position to take advantage of prices coming back.""The Permian in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico is the epicenter of low-cost production of U.S. shale oil. Shale exploration and production companies like Diamondback, Concho Resources (CXO) and Parsley Energy (PE) have focused their spending on resources in the play.Multiple horizontal layers of deposits make the Permian more geologically desirable than other U.S. plays like the Bakken Basin in North Dakota. At Permian, producers can use a single production pad to drill down to different deposits in each layer.Diamondback has large holdings in several of the basin's formations for a total of 84,683 acres. Diamondback's total estimated proven reserves were 156.9 million barrels of crude oil equivalent as of the end of last year.In July, Diamondback raised its full-year production guidance to 38,000 to 40,000 barrels a day from an earlier outlook of 34,000 to 38,000 barrels on increased activity in the second quarter in the Permian region. Earlier the company raised its 2016 capital spending guidance to $350 million to $425 million on increased activity.""They decided to locate themselves smartly in the sweet spot of the basin,"" Meats said of Diamondback's acreage.In its September update Monday, the Energy Information Agency said production from the Permian will rise by 22,000 barrels a day this month to reach 1.999 million barrels a day in October. Production is seen falling in all other regions, including the Bakken and Eagle Ford basins.IBD'S TAKE: Diamondback shares broke out in mid-August and pumped up to a new high of 98.94 earlier this month before retreating amid concerns on oil prices. It is just one of many players in the Permian. Find other winners in the formation with this recent IBD Industry Snapshot. Diamondback Chief Executive Travis Stice said in the company's second-quarter conference call that the company expects to complete its backlog of 20 drilled but uncompleted wells by the end of the year.Drilling accounts for 40% of a new well's cost, while completion accounts for 60%, so exploration and production companies have drilled wells but waited to complete them as oil prices stayed below $45 per barrel. But oil prices have rebounded near $50 and companies are ready to start completing wells.After retreating for several days over oil-price concerns, Diamondback shares on Thursday rose 1.5%, then dipped 0.2% on Friday and ended Monday trades down 0.5%.But the market has already priced in Diamondback's prime Permian assets, and Meats warns that investors shouldn't expect to see a big upside if oil prices rise.""The only thing I would say is the market is pretty much aware of that, so the company is trading at very lofty multiples,"" he said. ""It's not a cheap stock, but a quality one.""Like other energy companies, Diamondback's major downside is its exposure to oil prices.In its July report, the International Energy Agency said that lower-than-expected demand growth out of China and concerns about the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union could put the oil market balance expected next year in jeopardy.But if oil prices fall, ""the strength of its balance sheet is a boon, and creates a cushioning layer,"" Meats said of Diamondback.Many analysts, including Flynn, are still upbeat that oil markets will balance in the coming year.""If you're doom and gloom on oil prices, you don't want to be long on this company because it's already had a good run,"" Flynn said. ""But if you're optimistic, this stock is something to keep in your back pocket.""RELATED: Who Will Win The Permian's Latest Bidding War?Apache To Spend Over A Fourth Of Budget On 'Immense' Permian PlayPermian-Focused Parsely, Laredo Benefit From Low-Cost Shale Center

809,TAP,"Investing can be a tricky dance between sometimes dueling aims. An ETF investor may look for ways to earn stock-like returns with less risk or to balance growth and income needs.Those conflicting goals have come more sharply into focus in today's challenging markets. And that's helping some exchange traded funds to make nimble-footed moves on the floor of the stock market.The $17.24 billion iShares U.S. Preferred Stock (PFF) is trading a hair under its Aug. 1 high of 40.33.Peers such as PowerShares Preferred (PGX), SPDR Barclays Convertible Securities (CWB) and PowerShares Financial Preferred (PGF) are also riding above their uptrending 10-week lines and trading at or near 52-week highs. Each yields north of 5%, when the 10-year Treasury rate is just 1.6%.Investors with a real need for income should look outside fixed income to preferred shares, convertible securities and high-quality dividend stocks in a tough market, according to State Street, the firm behind SPDR ETFs. These strategies offer a way to generate some yield in a low-yield or no-yield environment, but they do more.""These exposures may provide stability and diversification, helping to mitigate volatility across the equity and fixed-income sides of a portfolio,"" the firm said in its 2016 Mid-Year ETF & Investment Outlook report.Convertible bonds and preferred stocks fly under the radar of many investors in exchange traded funds. Companies generally issue convertible securities to raise money when they are unable to tap conventional sources of funding, such as public offerings and bank financings, or when they have special business reasons to do so. Investors get periodic interest payments and the right to exchange these securities down the line for the common stock of the issuing company.While convertibles offer high yields, they're no slouches in terms of capital growth. These shape shifters combine aspects of equity and debt, after all.CWB, the oldest and largest convertible bond ETF, yields 5.12% and has produced a 10.8% average annual gain over the past five years. It holds convertibles issued by chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), among others.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad stock market, has averaged a 16.6% gain over the same period and offers less than half the yield.However, convertibles tend to be much less risky than stocks (and more volatile than conventional bonds). The SPDR convertible ETF's holdings have bond-like qualities that generally mean their monthly returns jump around much less than stocks' do.""The fund may be appropriate as part of an equity allocation for investors looking to increase yield while reducing equity portfolio volatility,"" Morningstar analyst Brian Moriarty wrote in July.Investors in today's herky-jerky markets are looking for ideas on how to invest in stocks with less downside risk. Convertible bonds may be one potential avenue for successful investing. They have historically performed better than equities during periods of market turbulence, according to Morningstar.Investment firm Fidelity advises investors that convertible bonds typically offer lower yields than conventional bonds of similar duration from the same issuer, but may offer higher return potential over time due to their swap-for-stock features. Preferreds are much like convertible bonds, but are lower on the credit scale should the issuing company go belly-up. And convertible bonds are generally junior to traditional corporate bonds in a default.Year to date, CWB has outpaced most preferred stock-ETF peers with a 7.8% stock market gain.That performance hasn't translated into flow of investor money. Investors yanked $289.9 million from CWB over the first seven months of 2016, while pouring $2.23 billion into iShares' preferred fund PFF and $1.12 billion into PowerShares' preferred peer PGX over the same period.IBD'S TAKE: Preferred funds play a valuable portfolio role but may not be the best bet for investors looking for rapid stock market gains. To find highly rated ETFs from the best industry groups with market-leading performance, check out ETF Center.The SPDR convertible securities ETF tracks a Barclays index offering market-cap-weighted exposure to investment- and non-investment-grade convertible-bond securities with more than $500 million outstanding. The inclusion of lower-rated, junk and unrated securities can put investors at increased default risk.Defaults in the convertible-security space have ticked up modestly throughout 2016. However, the overall default level for convertible securities remains low, both in absolute terms and relative to the high-yield market, according to Calamos Investments. According to the firm, there are important differences between the two markets.""The convertible-security market includes a smaller proportion of energy issuers and more growth-oriented health care and technology issues,"" Eli Pars, co-CIO of Calamos, wrote on Aug. 2. ""This is because the high-yield market tends to be less open to companies in growth sectors that don't have long histories of generating cash, but relatively more open to companies with longer track records -- even if balance sheets are weaker.""Pars added: ""Even with default rates trending higher off their recent lows, the case for the asset class remains intact."" That's especially so, he said, with experienced managers who can sift the grain from the chaff when ""aggregate defaults of investment grade, noninvestment grade and nonrated convertible security issues are not as dispersed as might be expected.""The firm offers several mutual funds, including Calamos Convertible Fund (CCVIX).This convertible fund is up 3.2% year-to-date and has produced a 6.5% average gain over the past five years -- trailing the SPDR convertible security ETF over both periods. It has a trailing 12-month yield of 3.56%.According to Morningstar, a third of this mutual fund's bonds were rated junk as of June's end. More than 90% of its ETF peer's assets were concentrated in junk and unrated convertible bonds.

810,TAP,"Another charge on its military refueling tanker will weigh on Boeing (BA) earnings Wednesday and could be a troubling sign of things to come, as the aerospace giant plans to focus on more commercial derivatives.Last week, Boeing said it would take $2.1 billion in charges in the second quarter, with a $393 million after-tax charge on its KC-46 tanker program for the Air Force. Boeing cited higher costs to work on technical issues that put the plane behind schedule.Boeing also reported a charge on the tanker in the first quarter and has racked up $1.5 billion in cost overruns on additional engineering and development work. But the plane could get even costlier.The Air Force is in negotiations with the aerospace giant for penalties related to missing key milestones. Boeing will not be able to deliver the first batch of aerial refueling tankers in August 2017 as promised. The tanker was originally supposed to hit military runways in early 2015.Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein said at the Farnborough Airshow earlier this month that Boeing's tanker successfully completed flight tests with a C-17 transport plane and an F-16 fighter jet, ahead of a key production decision in August.IBD'S TAKE: Boeing's tanker struggles and weak commercial showing at the Farnborough Airshow have weighed on shares. It now is lagging behind stronger defense players Raytheon and Northrop Grumman, both currently in buy range. Despite major delays with the tanker, a derivative of a Boeing 767 commercial plane, the president of Boeing's Defense, Space & Security division, told the Wall Street Journal in June that the company was focusing on maintenance and upgrades for current jets and selling more military versions of its passenger jets instead of on fighter jets.While the show was underwhelming for commercial orders, Boeing had more success on the defense side. The U.K. finalized a $3.88 billion contract for nine new Boeing P-8A Poseidon anti-submarine aircraft. British officials also announced a deal for 50 Boeing Apache helicopters.On the commercial side, Boeing is taking an after-tax charge of $847 million on the 787 Dreamliner and an $814 million after-tax charge on its 747 program.Analysts see Boeing's second-quarter earnings jumping 37% to $2.22 per share, but revenue is seen falling 2% to $24.04 billion when it announces results Wednesday.European rival Airbus (EADSY) also will report half-year results on Wednesday.An order from Malaysia Airlines could be a positive note for Boeing's earnings. A report from Business Times said that Malaysia's national carrier could announce an order on Wednesday for up to 50 Boeing 737 Max jets.Boeing needs a boost to its commercial orders as the aerospace giant lost out to Airbus in orders and commitments at the U.K. air show. Boeing announced orders and commitments for 182 aircraft, valued at $26.8 billion at list prices, but only 20 come from firm orders, worth $3.3 billion.Airbus had 279 orders and commitments, worth $35 billion at list prices, including firm orders for 197 aircraft valued at $26.3 billion.Boeing shares fell 0.4% on the stock market today to 132.94, closing just above its recently retaken 200-day moving average. Airbus lost 1.3%.

Apple retook its 50-day moving average last week.IBD'S TAKE: S&P 500 technology earnings likely fell 6% in the second quarter, which would be their worst decline since 2009, according to analysts. But nearly all of that decline is due to Apple.The 140-character social network received not one, but two, downgrades -- one from Monness Crespi Hardt and the other from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey to neutral from buy -- on questions surrounding Twitter's user growth and reach.Twitter has been working on developing its services and technology, most recently upping its video play time to 140 seconds from half a minute and acquiring visual processing startup Magic Pony Technology.Shares fell 2% to 17.71.SunTrust Robinson Humphrey also handed out a downgrade to Yahoo on Monday, with analysts doubting that a sale would do much to help its stock price, according to a note acquired by MarketWatch.Shares climbed 0.6% to 37.96.The oil field services provider, which recently nixed its merger with Halliburton (HAL), received an upgrade to hold from underperform from Jefferies and a price target bump to 41 from 38. Analysts reportedly cited a ""decision to give more credit for capital efficiency than previously, which we think is likely more consistent with its emerging strategy,"" according to Street Insider.Baker Hughes shares fell 0.2% to 43.60 after hitting 44.74 intraday.RELATED:Rotten Apple: Get Ready For The Worst Tech Earnings Decline Since 2009Yahoo Annual Meeting On Tap; Media Leaks On Company Sale Die Down

817,TAP,"Aglow with prospects for ongoing profit gains, surging volume and talk of opportunities in emerging growth areas, Acuity Brands lit up Wall Street last week after the smart-lighting specialist reported a blowout quarter that kept up a long-running hot streak.Shares of Acuity (AYI) soared more than 13% to a new high on April 6 following its fiscal-second-quarter results. The designer and maker of innovative and energy-saving lighting products turned out its seventh straight quarter of double-digit profit growth and its biggest sales gain in years.Acuity shares moved sideways after that, then advanced Wednesday to a new closing high. The stock and is up more than 50% year-over-year.""Acuity is one of the industrial stocks that offers the best growth and visibility on that growth,"" CLSA Americas analyst Jeremie Capron told IBD. ""We think Acuity is on top of the ongoing technological shift we're seeing in the lighting industry.""Capron points out that Acuity's move into LED (light-emitting-diode) illumination systems provided organic growth in excess of 40% for the company's second quarter, which ended Feb. 29. The LED business now accounts for over 50% of Acuity's total revenue, he adds, and it's the fastest growing piece of the business.Not only does Acuity benefit from a surge in demand for its LED products, it's also seeing an uptick in both nonresidential and residential construction activity and ongoing remodeling and retrofitting work. Further, the company isn't afraid to make acquisitions.Acuity's growth trajectory is expected to remain strong, based on macro and internal trends.""We remain bullish about our prospects for continued future profitable growth,"" Chief Executive Vernon Nagel said recently in a prepared statement. ""Third-party forecasts as well as key leading indicators suggest that the growth rate for the North American lighting market, which includes renovation and retrofit activity, will be in the mid- to upper-single-digit range for fiscal 2016 with expectations that overall demand in our end markets will continue to experience solid growth over the next several years.""Acuity’s revenue is split 50-50 between new construction and retrofitting and replacing existing fixtures, Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne told IBD. The rest of the industry generates about 30% of its revenue from new construction, with the remainder coming from retrofitting and replacing existing fixtures, he says.""That’s very important as it relates to profitability,"" said Osborne.New buildings, he adds, usually require multiple lighting installations, which result in higher profits compared to just replacing existing fixtures. The latter, Osborne says, is ""not very profitable and more competitive.""As a result, Acuity’s gross margin exceeds 40%, while most of its peers are in the 20%-30% range, said Osborne.""The nonresidential (new) construction cycle is very strong now,"" he added. ""Investors were fearful Acuity’s business would start to decline because of their concern over the economy and concerns that new construction would start slowing down. Management went to great lengths on the second-quarter conference call to say the pipeline of activity is very strong and not slowing down.""Acuity continues to take share in the North American lighting market, he says, with revenue growing more than 20%, while the industry is growing at the mid to high single digits.The company’s products include lighting systems known as luminaires, lighting and building controls, lighting components, power supplies and prismatic skylights. They also do integrated lighting systems for indoors and outdoors using a combination of light sources -- as well as software -- to manage light levels and optimize energy.Acuity sells under several brands, such as Lithonia Lighting, Holophane and Gotham. Rivals include LED light-bulb maker Cree (CREE), Eaton (ETN) and Philips (PHG).Acuity's financial picture appears luminous. The company's adjusted second-quarter earnings soared 53% to $1.80 a share, smashing views. Sales climbed 26% to $777.8 million, 17% of which came from an increase in volume, with the remaining 11% stemming from acquisitions.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year fiscal 2016 earnings to rise 46% to $7.87 a share. They project a 20% gain in 2017 and a 24% increase in 2018.One key growth driver has been acquisitions. Capron says Acuity's merger strategy has become ""more aggressive"" the past couple of years.Capron says the most interesting move on that front was Acuity's acquisition of Distech Controls in September. Distech provides building automation and energy management solutions. It also integrates lights, HVAC, closed-circuit television and other energy-efficiency systems.Capron says the acquisition marked the first time Acuity entered a segment outside its core lighting business. Owning a company in the building automation space should boost Acuity's lighting sales, he says. He sees more buys on tap for Acuity.Ask management, though, and an area where they see potential is in the so-called ""Internet of Things.""""The transition to solid-state lighting provides the opportunity for lighting to be integrated with other building automation systems to create an optimal platform for enabling the 'Internet of Things,' which will support the advancement of smart buildings, smart cities and the smart grid,"" the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Acuity already has applications tied to the Internet of Things. The company has converted more than 12 million square feet of space for customers utilizing about 200,000 beacon-enabled lighting fixtures that can collect data and enable applications to provide users with usable information, CEO Nagel said on the second-quarter conference call.He explained the potential further when announcing second-quarter results.""We believe the lighting and lighting-related industry as well as building automation systems will experience solid growth over the next decade,"" he said, ""particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront, along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet of Things.""

819,TAP,"Dividend equities exert a magnetic attraction when the stock markets are rough, and they have grabbed ETF investors' hearts and wallets this year.In the world of exchange traded funds, two popular indexing subsets are dividend achievers and dividend aristocrats. Both invest in stock royalty -- household names like AT&T (T) and Procter & Gamble (PG) that have strong and consistent track records of dividend growth. So what's the difference between the indexes?Achievers have not missed a dividend increase in 10 years or more.Aristocrats have not skipped a dividend increase in 25 years or more.Click Here To See A List Of Top Performing ETFs In 2016In either case, it's no mean feat. Few companies on the stock market today can boast the same. Such a dividend history is often the mark of a quality company, with revenue, profits and cash flow to match.But whether an index holds dividend achievers or dividend aristocrats can have a big effect on a fund's profile.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers Select Index. It holds 185 stocks, each of which has grown dividends annually for 10 years or more.ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) holds 50 stocks, a smaller list that reflects a higher barrier to entry -- each holding has raised dividends every year for 25 years or more.They're both top-notch funds in their category, but VIG offers greater diversification, while NOBL may offer a shot at owning companies more likely to continue increasing dividends in the future.SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), which invests in dividend aristocrats from the S&P Composite 1500, has jumped 13.9% year to date through Sept. 14.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad U.S. market, is up 5.6% in the same period.The former has also produced better annual average gains over the past three-, five- and 10-year periods.IBD'S TAKE: Income investors would do well to understand the nuances of dividend yield, dividend growth and dividend stability, as explored in this story about steady AT&T.This year's best-performing dividend ETF is ProShares S&P MidCap 400 Dividend Aristocrats (REGL).REGL has gained 19.9% through Sept. 14. The fund launched in February 2015 and has grown to $169.5 million in assets. It's the first ETF to tap the dividend-growing companies in its parent midcap index.The underlying S&P MidCap 400 Dividend Aristocrats Index holds a minimum of 40 equal-weighted stocks and rebalances quarterly. Each holding must have increased dividends each year for at least 15 straight years.Dividend growers have been able to withstand repeated market turmoil and still deliver strong returns with lower volatility, according to ProShares.REGL yields a mere 1.35% -- less than SPY's 12-month yield of 2.01%. Like many dividend growth funds, it's less of a play for dividend income and more of a play for quality companies whose stock prices are likely to appreciate over time, while giving investors a smoother ride than the broad market.VIG yields 2.08%, SDY 2.29% and NOBL 1.79%.6 Best ETF Picks for Q4: Seizing Global GrowthChoosing An ETF For Your Portfolio Made Easy

They threaded through slalom posts and shipping containers, punctuated by saw-toothed bursts from their rotors, and sailed to the finish line past a handful of quiet spectators and a few white tents containing tables scattered with toolboxes, extra drones and extra parts.The drones themselves can hit speeds of 80 miles per hour. And they crash a lot -- propellers snap off, frames get bent, the GoPro (GPRO) cameras often mounted to drones to capture video get smashed. That also means the pilots can gauge more quickly what propellers, batteries, frames and controllers work and which don't.""You'll find the technology in the drones that we're racing is newer than most of what is used in commercial applications, or in even military applications, because our development time is so rapid,"" said Chris Thomas, founder of the racing league MultiGP, which helped organize the race.

Meanwhile, Amazon's (AMZN) drone delivery plans and Facebook's (FB) intentions to use drones to strengthen internet access are helping to push the aircraft into the mainstream. But flying under the radar is a loosely-knit community of tinkerers creating a groundswell of activity that some have compared with the early years of the PC revolution embodied by Apple (AAPL) a generation ago.And as these drone wildcatters stumble upon ways to improve the aerial devices -- and forge a regulatory framework -- an array of companies is also circling to tap into the entrepreneurial energy.""The drone industry is probably one of the first open-source hardware industries,"" said James Peverill, CEO of GreenSight Agronomics, a Boston-based startup that uses drones for agricultural imaging and analytics and which has done work with golf courses and agrochemical giant Syngenta (SYT).""It almost harkens back to the beginnings of the personal computer industry,"" he added. ""In the late 70s, people were experimenting with computers in the basement, and when Apple Computer was founded, they basically used a lot of the ideas and technology from that DIY community that had hatched.""While few public companies are pure-play drone stocks, the financial industry has been offering broader exposure to the market. PureFunds describes its Drone Economy Strategy ETF (IFLY), which debuted in March, as the first exchange traded fund devoted to tracking the commercial drone market.The fund's holdings include Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other defense contractors, drone-maker AeroVironment (AVAV), GoPro and its chipmaker Ambarella (AMBA).""We've seen drones start to transcend the initial aerospace and defense uses into many different industries and sectors around the world,"" PureFunds CEO Andrew Chanin told IBD. ""Trying to play the drone industry -- or any early-stage industry -- by picking one or two companies can be a pretty difficult and volatile proposition.""Amazon has been approved to test delivery drones in the U.K, and Alphabet (GOOGL) this summer got the OK for limited delivery-drone testing in the U.S. But despite the entrance of several tech Goliaths, the drone space is still so wide open that upstarts can aim high.Back when Amazon's drone plans were in a younger stage, Skycart, a drone delivery startup in San Jose, Calif., that started roughly four years ago, was trying to sell companies on the idea of using drones to send things.""Those companies thought we were joking,"" said Lukas Wrede, the company's CEO.Then, Amazon published a video demonstrating Prime Air, its future drone delivery service, and Wrede initially thought Skycart was done for. But he rethought.""If such a big company gets a lot of attention and they also have a powerful lobby, then they could probably influence the market in our interest,"" he said. ""And that's what they did.""Skycart also continued to improve its drone technology, enhancing its autonomous-flight and drop-off capabilities and its abilities to carry packages weighing 10 pounds, up from an earlier target of 5. Today, Skycart has started several delivery projects with their customers, which Wrede characterized as Amazon rivals who have become more aware of the possibilities of drone delivery. Among them is one of the biggest shipping express companies in the U.S., but he declined to identify it.Meanwhile, at the University of Southern California, assistant professor John Carlsson has been developing a delivery model in which drones carrying packages bounce between a moving delivery truck and their destination -- potentially cutting time, traffic and fuel costs.His means of testing this particular model? A drone and a skateboard. Still, he said, he has been approached by a handful of companies, including a multibillion-dollar retailer that sells a variety of products, but which he said is ""not Amazon.""He said he will be ""working on a project with them that will involve drones"" in the next several months that will either incorporate the delivery model or his other drone-related research, which has been backed by U.S. defense funding.""The kind of thing that we work on specifically is really applicable to any situation where you have one large vehicle, and a collection of smaller vehicles that are somehow tied to that,"" he said.As more drones swarm the skies and raise the risk of midair collisions, regulations have struggled to catch up, forcing the community of drone racers and other enthusiasts to cobble together solutions -- similar to the way they improvise technologies for their drones.The Sepulveda Dam race was two years in the making, said Brad Foxhoven, CEO Blockade Entertainment, one of the DR1 race's organizers. Thomas, of MultiGP, said that conversations had to happen between the site's owner and with the FAA, and a film permit had to be obtained.""Nothing like that has ever been permitted before,"" he said. ""We essentially had to look toward the jungle, take out our machetes and cut a path. We're building a sport from scratch.""Permitting, in general, though, is ""like they're trying to put a round peg into a square hole,"" Thomas said.The FAA and Transportation Department in June finalized regulations for small drone use, and the rules took hold last month. Still, some state and local officials are seeing a drone up close for the first time and regulators face information gaps. For example, the 2012 FAA Modernization and Reform Act requires drone operators within five miles of an airport to notify that airport of their presence, but the lines of communication weren't always clear. So companies saw an opening.""People were knocking on the door of the airport manager or calling on the phone and saying 'Hey I'm going to fly my drone at the 7-Eleven,' "" said Ben Marcus, CEO and co-founder of Santa-Monica-based tech company AirMap. ""Airport managers were like: 'What am I supposed to do with that?' ""AirMap's technology offers up a smartphone-accessible map of what's happening in the low-altitude airspace. Their technology lets airports know what drones are in the skies nearby, and provides a communications platform between pilots, airports and others. If you're flying a drone and, say, a jet approaches, AirMap will send an alert. The technology can also provide information on temporary flight restrictions -- wildfires, a sporting event, presidential visits, Marcus said.More than 100 airports use AirMap's technology, including Los Angeles International Airport, Houston's George Bush Intercontinental and other U.S. hubs, said co-founder Gregory McNeal.""Ultimately, when Amazon and Google and other companies are looking to make deliveries, they're going to need to know about all of these types of pieces of low-altitude airspace information, some of which is dynamic,"" McNeal said. ""So the county fair comes to town, and the Ferris wheel goes up. The Amazon drone should know about that before it ever gets to the county fair.""Back at the DR1 race, the Sepulveda Dam was decorated with logos for Pepsico's (PEP) Mountain Dew and Doritos as well as Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD). The event was broadcast on Twitch, the gaming-centric streaming service Amazon bought in 2014. And in August, the 2016 National Drone Racing Championships took place in New York, an event broadcast via ESPN.And in separate announcements Wednesday, ESPN and U.K. media giant Sky struck deals with the Drone Racing League, another racing group, to broadcast five races over 10 episodes. An introductory broadcast is set to air Thursday on ESPN2, with the others to be broadcast there, ESPN and Sky Sports Mix in October. Sky, which is 39% owned by 21st Century Fox (FOXA), also invested $1 million in the league.Blockade Entertainment's Foxhoven, meanwhile, said his company has had ""multiple conversations"" with people in the e-sports industry, some of whom attended the DR1 Invitational.As the racing community gains more mass appeal, the innovations it has made are starting to trickle out. The Drone Racing League has had ""quite a few outside parties"" approach them about potentially licensing its radio-system technology for non-drone-racing uses, founder and CEO Nicholas Horbaczewski said.""It's been fun to discover that in the process of developing this for a particular purpose, in this case sports, we've developed technology that has a broader application that can be used in other capacities in a positive and productive way,"" he said in an interview.Peverill, of GreenSight Agronomics, said his company uses a flight controller sometimes used in racing. And some companies are also scoping out racing events to see how drones can help their own products.Staff from GoPro, the event's title sponsor, attended the National Drone Racing Championships partly to get more of a sense of how drones could be used to provide more immersive, closer-to-actually-being-there camera work, said Scot Refsland, chairman of the Drone Sports Association, which organized the event.Enterprise data-storage giant EMC (EMC), which also backed the event, ran live demos of virtual reality technology there. AIG (AIG), a partner in the event and an issuer of drone insurance, has been working with the DSA to generate ideas on how to improve insurance for aerial devices as low-altitude airspace grows more crowded and complicated, Refsland said.Elsewhere, Justin Haggerty, founder of the competing International Drone Racing Association, said his organization has attracted interest from telecommunications companies looking to learn more about their technology. Among them was Korean telecom giant KT Corp. (KT), which Haggerty said is looking at ways to use drones for broadcasting.Meanwhile, the educational nonprofit Drones Pilot Federation sees drone racing as a crossover into education. Henry Minden, a vice president in the group, said the aerial devices have the potential to teach younger people, ages 12 to 30, about computer programming, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and assembly, and create new jobs in those areas.""You want to know how to go faster than the rest,"" he said. ""So you find yourself immersed in this world of physics, aerodynamics, electrical engineering and computer science.""In the process, many people involved in the informal community of drone enthusiasts have become advocates for wider application of the devices, which are still best known for their years of use in the military.""If I could just share this with more people, and especially take away the negative connotations,"" said Tommy Tibajia, one of the pilots at the DR1 race. ""Because, whenever I'm flying, (people) are like, 'Stop spying on me!' I'm like, 'Lady, trust me. I'm not spying on you.'

823,TAP,"Amazon.com (AMZN) seems to have a hit product on its hands with the Amazon Echo smart speaker. The e-commerce giant is estimated to have sold 3 million units of the device in the U.S. since it went on sale in late 2014, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners reported Wednesday.Amazon likely sold 1 million Echo devices during just the holiday shopping season in late 2015, CIRP said.Echo is a voice-responsive Internet query device and household controller, as well as a high-end streaming music speaker.Awareness of Amazon Echo among U.S. Amazon customers more than doubled during the year, CIRP said. By the end of 2015, 47% of Amazon’s U.S. customers were aware of Echo, up from 20% in March 2015, the Chicago-based research firm said.“Amazon very carefully but aggressively promoted Amazon Echo during the year,” Josh Lowitz, partner and co-founder of CIRP, said in a statement. “It dedicated Amazon.com homepage real estate to Echo, promoted it on Amazon Prime Day in July, and also advertised it heavily during the holiday shopping season. This effort paid off, as it stood out among Amazon customers.”Amazon also promoted Echo with a Super Bowl commercial this year starring Alec Baldwin.CIRP bases its findings on regular surveys of Amazon customers.In March, Amazon added two more devices that use its Alexa voice-control personal assistance, in addition to Echo. They were the Echo Dot, a smaller hands-free voice-controlled device, and the Amazon Tap, a smart portable Bluetooth and Wi-Fi speaker.Echo costs $179.99, while Echo Dot costs $89.99, and Amazon Tap costs $129.99.Amazon's Alexa technology competes with other voice-response digital assistants, like Apple's (AAPL) Siri and Microsoft's (MSFT) Cortana.Amazon stock was up 2% in midafternoon trading in the stock market today, near 598. The company gets a 77 Composite Rating out of a possible 99 from IBD.

824,TAP,"Sector equity ETFs exemplify the value of the middle path.These vehicles allow you to actively tilt your portfolio toward this broad sector or that industry niche for successful investing. At the same time, the exchange traded fund wrapper prevents you from loading up on single-stock risk.Technology ETFs are revving up as electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA) totes up 325,000 Model 3 reservations in the first week of preorders.In fact, the three largest diversified tech ETFs are nearing buy points. The tech sector's momentum comes in large part from the chipmakers who supply parts to companies such as Tesla and Apple (AAPL).They certainly stand to benefit from the Model 3 prebookings, which reflect $14 billion of potential sales.So do the tech hardware and software companies, and communication and electronic equipment suppliers, that make everything from Tesla cars' breakthrough electric motors to the processors that power their in-dash touchscreens.A Tesla is a computer on wheels, after all.You could, of course, invest in Tesla stock, which soared to a seven-month high after the Model 3 unveiling. But perhaps you're wary after its two failed breakouts within the past year.With these three broad-based ETFs, you can tap into the technology investment theme as well as the love that consumers are lavishing on Tesla:Nvidia is a highly rated IBD 50 stock. Many of the largest stock holdings in XLK have strong balance sheets and a durable competitive edge. It holds 73 stocks in total.XLK is trading 2% below a buy point of 44.74 from a 16-week cup base.When XLK broke out of a flat base in January 2012, it ran up 46% by July 2015.The ETF holds $13.97 billion in assets and has a 0.14% expense ratio.It's up 4.5% year to date through April 6.VGT holds 383 stocks. It has $8.58 billion in assets and a 0.10% expense ratio -- the lowest expense ratio of any large and liquid technology sector ETF, according to Morningstar.It's also a more pure-play broad tech ETF. This fund does not hold telecom services companies such as AT&T (T). AT&T and Verizon (VZ) are among XLK's top 10 holdings.VGT has gained 1.8% year to date.It holds 141 stocks, including Nvidia and other chipmakers in the connected-car space such as Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).IYW is the purest-play broad technology ETF.

825,TAP,"Technology giants in the S&P 500 are expected to turn in their worst earnings drop since the recession, dragged down by falling sales of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone.Overall, S&P 500 earnings in the second quarter will fall 4.7% vs. a year earlier, the fourth straight quarterly decline, according to analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. Revenues are expected to dip 0.9%, the sixth straight quarterly slide.Technology earnings are expected to decline 6% from a year earlier, worse than the 4% fall in Q1, according to Thomson Reuters. Tech revenue should slide 4.8%. But excluding Apple, tech profits should dip just 1%, with revenue off 2.5%.Apple's earnings per share are seen falling 24.9%, as revenue tumbles $7.6 billion from a year earlier to $42 billion. Apple revenue fell 13% in the prior quarter, the first drop in more than decade.Apple's revenue drop will more than offset a combined $5 billion pop from Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB). Google parent Alphabet is expected to report a 15.2% rise in earnings as revenue grows by $3 billion, or 17.0%, to $20.7 billion. Facebook's earnings are forecast to expand 62%, as revenue surges by just under $2 billion, or 48.5%.Despite Apple's ongoing slump, the stock has recently shown flickers of life, moving back above its 50-day moving average. But it's still in a yearlong downtrend.Facebook rose 1.2% on Friday, retaking a 117.09 entry point, but in below-average trade. Alphabet is close to retaking its 50-day but is much nearer its highs than Apple is.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook was just one of many notable breakouts Friday, with General Electric and Lowe's among those clearing entry points. Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC) are expected to see earnings declines of 3.3% and 3.6%, respectively. Weaker iPhone sales won't just hit Apple, but its suppliers too: Skyworks (SWKS) is seen reporting a 9.7% drop in earnings, as revenue falls 7.4% to $750 million.S&P 500 energy earnings are expected to tumble 78.5%, though that's better than Q1's outright loss.The energy sector is ""the main drag,"" but not the only one, Thomson Reuters analyst Greg Harrison told IBD. Six of 10 S&P 500 sectors tracked by the data provider are expected to show negative earnings growth.S&P 500 earnings excluding energy are on tap to fall 0.8%, the first drop in several years, after a scant 0.4% Q1 rise. Revenue should climb 2.1%.Companies tend to beat profit views by a few percentage points overall, so non-energy earnings likely will show a gain.Overall earnings and revenue are expected to return to growth in the current third quarter, as energy companies face easier comparisons.Stock markets typically rally ahead of a profit recovery, as investors anticipate stronger results. The current bull market began in March 2009, months before corporate results bounced back. But sustained profit declines usually occur during a recession -- such as the 2007-2009 slump. Not this time. And while stocks have been choppy for months, they've generally moved sideways to slightly higher.Also, the earnings upturn for the S&P 500, packed with corporate titans with heavy overseas exposure, is looking somewhat less certain after the U.K.'s Brexit vote sent interest rates sliding and boosted the value of the dollar.S&P consumer staples earnings rose 1.5% in the first quarter, but they are expected to slip 1.7% in the second quarter. Wal-Mart (WMT) earnings will likely show a 5.6% earnings decline amid flat revenue. Wal-Mart is continuing to face margin pressures after boosting its base wage to $10 an hour in February.After falling for nearly all of 2015, Wal-Mart shares have gradually recovered, rising last week to their best levels since July 2015.Financials have been another laggard, with sector earnings expected to fall 5.4% after a 10.4% tumble in the first quarter. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is expected to see a 6.5% earnings drop as revenues dip 1.7%. Earnings for Wells Fargo (WFC) are seen off a more modest 3.3%. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup (C) are due to report Q2 results in the coming week.Low interest rates have eroded the spread between the interest they can charge borrowers and what they have to pay depositors, and the further drop in borrowing costs since Brexit could mean more of the same in the current quarter.Shares of JPMorgan and other major banks remain far off their highs.Earnings in the consumer discretionary sector are expected to lead the way, rising 8.8% in the quarter. The sector includes Amazon (AMZN), which is projected to have another knockout quarter. The online retail giant and web-services provider is seen posting a 27.4% revenue boost. Amazon earnings should soar to $1.10 a share from 19 cents a year earlier.Amazon shares are at all-time highs after finding support at the 50-day line amid the post-Brexit vote sell-off.The other sectors expected to see positive earnings are health care (up 4.5%); industrials (3.1%) and utilities (1.6%). Health care demand tends to rise steadily, while domestic-focused utilities are shielded from overseas turmoil.Industrials like General Electric (GE) received something of a reprieve from the strong dollar in the second quarter, but that appears at risk of reversing in the third quarter after the U.K. vote to leave the European Union sent the dollar higher.Still, General Electric shares hit an eight-year high on Friday, closing at 32.20, just over a 32.15 buy point.Brexit isn't expected to have much of a direct impact on earnings in the near term, with the U.K. and Europe accounting for about 1% and 7% of S&P 500 revenue, respectively, Thomson Reuters' Harrison said.Yet, indirect effects from the stronger dollar and lower interest rates will be a factor. Earnings estimates for the third quarter have come down just ""a tad bit"" since Brexit, Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks Investment Research, told IBD.""We'll begin to learn the full extent (of the impact) in coming days and weeks as companies share their outlook on earnings calls,"" he added.

The aftermath of the shooting was livestreamed in a widely shared Facebook video.A day earlier, Alton Sterling was shot in Louisiana after being pinned to the pavement by two white officers. That, too, was captured on a cellphone video.Video footage from the scene showed that protesters were marching along a street in downtown, about half a mile from City Hall, when the shots erupted and the crowd scattered, seeking cover.Texas Gov.

831,TAP,"Baby boomers and older generations already are well acquainted with recreational vehicles, but being nimble enough to capture the interests of Gen Xers and millennials as well takes a bit of doing for those who sell RVs.Still, Thor Industries (THO) has tried to be at the forefront of innovation in that space. The Elkhart, Ind.-based maker of motor homes, travel trailers and fifth wheels has been able to tap into a younger consumer who wants access to the outdoor lifestyle while meeting the needs of the more-seasoned campers.The key is to combine lower-priced products with technological innovations.""They’ve been able to take off the unnecessary content to be able to produce travel trailers that are meeting the price point, in order to have younger consumers to be able to afford them. And that’s been driving a lot of growth for Thor in recent quarters,"" Seth Woolf, research analyst at Northcoast Research, told Investor's Business Daily.""They bought some smaller players and became one of the biggest RV manufacturers in the industry,"" Woolf went on to say. ""But, they’ve done a lot to really attract the millennials and Gen Xers, who have been coming into the channel. And this is a relatively new phenomenon.""Some of Thor's better known brands include Airstream, Dutchmen, Laredo, Durango, Bighorn, Landmark, Montana, Coleman and Mobile Suites. Prices can range from $10,000 for a small trailer to as much as $400,000 for the more expensive motor homes. But the latest trend has been toward the lower-priced units.To address that demand, Thor introduced four new motor homes last fall. Three are smaller Class C’s -- Class A's are the largest motor homes -- designed to fit a younger demographic.""They’ve performed unbelievably well in the marketplace this year,"" Bob Martin, Thor’s chief executive told IBD.But pricing isn’t the only ace among Thor’s cards. It came up with ""hitch vision,"" a system that gets installed on a fifth wheel to help customers look around without having to turn their head.  And this fall it is launching a system called ""in command"" which allows operators to control certain RV features from a phone app, such as air conditioners, lights, jacks and generators.""It’s something that no one else has,” said Martin. “It’s things like that that we really feel differentiate us from other manufacturers.”Founded in 1980, Thor has grown organically as well as through a series of acquisitions, the most recent one being Postle Aluminum, an aluminum supplier for RVs, last year. Thor plans to continue its growth trajectory.""We definitely look at opportunistic M&A strategies. We look at companies that are a good fit for our overall corporation,"" Martin said. ""We also grow organically. With our motor home brands, we introduced several more last fall; we just bought a new factory for motor home production for a new Class C; and we’ve added on to several of our facilities over the last year and a half, two years.""Thor has operations in 148 facilities in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Oregon. It employs more than 10,000 people and sells its products via independent retail distributors primarily in the U.S. and Canada.Thor is the only RV company that has been profitable every year since its inception. In recent quarters, earnings per share growth has accelerated from 5% to 33% to 70%. Sales increases also sped up from 19.7% to 20.3% to 21.8%. It has no debt and cash flow generation is strong.Last quarter, 72% of Thor’s RV sales came from the lower-cost towables, while motorized units accounted for 24%. Thor holds the No. 1 spot in the motorized market and is No. 2 in the towables market.Its overall market share in the RV industry is 35%. The other two main players are Forest River, which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), and privately held Jayco. Together, those three names account for 87% of industry units.The RV industry is highly dependent on the U.S. economy, and especially consumer confidence.“Confident consumers are willing to make a large, luxury purchase such as an RV,” Gabelli & Co. analyst Matthew Paige wrote in a recent note to clients.While consumer confidence has softened a tad from last-year levels, it is still strong. The Recreation Vehicle Industry Association forecast in March that 2016 wholesale RV shipments for all categories are expected to rise 2% to 381,800 units vs. 2015.""People in the U.S. still feel much more confident than the macro international community. Right now it’s more difficult to fly; for many, the big trip to Europe may not be in the plans,"" said Martin.In addition, out of the 46 million North American households that are active campers, only 9.7 million, or 21%, are RV campers. The others use tents or cabins and are a good target market for Thor to pursue. RVs are also increasingly used for a variety of nontraditional events, such as tailgating, craft shows, sports tournaments or even just going to the beach.""Thor is continuing to keep pace with an expanding industry,"" said BMO Capital Markets analyst Gerrick Johnson. ""The industry’s been doing really well. The travel trailer market is at peaks prior to the downturn; the motor home market is still at about two-thirds of the level of the prior peak, so we still have some room to go.""Another strong point for Thor is its decentralized structure, noted analyst Woolf.“One of the things that’s unique is instead of centralizing anything, they allow some of their subsidiaries to continue on with a level of autonomy and they have really strong middle management,"" he said. ""And there’s more diversity within the different product lines as opposed to just buying something and applying a cookie-cutter mold to the product.”This fits right in with the way Thor’s cost structure is set up, says Jeff Tryka, director of corporate development and investor relations at Thor.""We pride ourselves in having a variable cost structure,"" Tryka said. ""If the economy slows, we’re able to cut back production relatively quickly. But as the economy recovers, as it has been over the last few years, we’re able to ramp up production relatively quickly as well.""

832,TAP,"Three highly rated stocks -- Constellation Brands (STZ), Acuity Brands (AYI) and Ollie's Bargain Outlets (OLLI) -- are all on tap to report this week. Here's what to expect:The distributor of Corona beer in the U.S. has a Q4 earnings call scheduled for Wednesday morning. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are expecting 11% earnings growth to $1.14 a share on a 12% revenue rise to $1.52 billion.While the anticipated profit results would mark a slowdown for Constellation, which also sells Svedka vodka, Robert Mondavi wine and Arbor Mist, revenue forecasts signal an expected return to double-digit sales growth after five straight quarters of mid- to high-single-digit gains.Shares, which changed little Tuesday, have been forming a cup base with a 155.78 entry point for the last two months, with the stock edging closer to that buy point since retaking support at its 50-day line in mid-March.Constellation stock has a 91 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it has outperformed 91% of all other publicly traded stocks on a mix of technical and fundamental factors.Constellation Brands stock fell just 1 cent to 151.45 on the stock market today.The lighting company, which also reports early Wednesday, is expected to grow its Q2 earnings by 40% to $1.51 a share. Revenue is seen climbing 22% to $752.3 million.Acuity's stock rose 2.2% to 225.05 in strong volume breaking out of a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 222.95.Its brands include Lithonia Lighting, Holophane, Winona and others. The stock has earned a 96 IBD Composite Rating.Recent new issue Ollie's undercut the bottom of end of its buy range after forming a wide cup-with-handle base with 22.63 entry point.Shares fell 3.6% to 22.49.The value retailer, which has 204 stores across 17 states in the Eastern part of the U.S., reports Q4 and full-year results after the close on Wednesday. Wall Street expects 28 cents a share on $239.1 million in revenue from the company, which went public last July.Ollie's holds a 99 IBD Composite Rating.

834,TAP,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD), which are working toward becoming one, are both on tap to report earnings in the upcoming week.Walgreens has logged a string of double-digit earnings and revenue gains for the last four quarters, following the late-2014 completion of the merger of Walgreens and Alliance Boots. The drugstore giant then announced in October that it would acquire smaller rival Rite Aid at $9 per share in cash for a total valuation of $17.2 billion, including acquired net debt.The Walgreens-Rite Aid deal, which is still expected to close in the latter half of calendar 2016, was ""progressing as planned"" as of Walgreens' last quarterly report in January. Wolfe Research analyst Scott Mushkin, however, recently expressed doubt that the merger would get the regulatory OK.When Walgreens reports on Tuesday morning, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters anticipate an 8.5% profit rise to $1.28 per share. Revenue is seen growing over 15% to $30.66 billion.In mid-March, Walgreens and OptumRx, a unit of insurance giant UnitedHealth (UNH), announced a pharmacy benefit partnership, allowing the drugstore's pharmacies to better compete with CVS Health (CVS) on services and cost savings. CVS is a drugstore-pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) hybrid.Walgreens shares fell 0.45% in the stock market today. Shares have been in a broad period of consolidation, trading below their 200-day line since early November and finding support at their 50-day moving average in early March.Rite Aid, which has around 4,600 locations, reports early Thursday but will not be holding a conference call, due to the pending merger. Earnings are expected to tumble 50% to 6 cents a share on a nearly 23% sales climb to $8.4 billion.Shares dipped 0.1% on Monday.CVS shares retreated 0.3%. The stock recently found support at the key 200-day level in mid-March and set a 5-month high on Friday.RELATED:Walgreens-OptumRx Alliance Hits Express Scripts StockWalgreens-Rite Aid Deal: ‘Even More Doubt’ That Regulators Will OK.

835,TAP,"With no shortage of uncertainty surrounding the world economy, acceleration in a company's earnings-per-share growth can be a reassuring sign while deceleration may point to a plateau.Now that the first quarter has ended, here's a look at some of the IBD 50's bigger potential accelerators, which include Facebook (FB) and some of the companies whose earnings are seen as slowing, such as Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Broadcom (AVGO) and beverage maker Constellation Brands (STZ).Even as Twitter (TWTR) struggles to draw in enough users to satisfy investors, Facebook has benefited from improvements to mobile ads and videos.The company's news-centric, Twitter-esque modifications to its user feeds haven't hurt, either. Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus Rift could also help lead future sales growth and keep the company at the forefront of developments in media-sharing and virtual reality, analysts say.Analysts expect Facebook's Q1 EPS to rise 48%. That's up from 46% in Q4 and 33% in Q3, and marking the fourth consecutive quarter of EPS growth.Facebook shares appeared to be on the verge of breaking out or forming the handle of a cup base with a 117.69 buy point. The base began its formation early last month. The company's three-year EPS growth rate has outpaced both Apple and Alphabet.Meanwhile, Google parent Alphabet's Q1 EPS growth is seen slowing to 23% from 28% in the prior quarter.The tech giant has grown on the strength of mobile ads, but Facebook has beaten the company in app downloads, and it faces continued scrutiny in the European Union and struggles in some of its non-search offshoots.Alphabet holds its Q1 conference call on April 21. The stock is currently making its way through a cup base begun in February with an 810.45 buy point.Broadcom's fiscal Q2 EPS growth is expected to grow 12%, but that's down from 15% growth in the prior quarter and 26% in the quarter before that.The Q2 estimates, if they hold up, would mark the fifth straight quarter of slowing EPS growth for the chipmaker. The Apple supplier, like other chipmakers, has faced concerns over weaker iPhone demand.Among other top tech names, Chinese web portal NetEase (NTES) will see EPS growth slow to 30% from 60%, and graphics chip company Nvidia (NVDA) is expected to report a 3% EPS decline, down from a 21% gain.Beer-and-wine company Constellation Brands faces its third straight quarter of EPS growth deceleration when it reports Q4 results on Wednesday. The stock is close to breaking out of a cup base with a 155.78 buy point.Analysts see EPS gaining 11%, but that's down from 15% in the prior quarter and would be the fifth straight quarter of deceleration.The company last year bought craft brewer Ballast Point, following years in which smaller breweries have broadened customers' options and taken business away from larger mass producers. That acquisition, along with Constellation's Mexican beer offerings, should also help drive sales, Reuters noted.Some of the biggest EPS growth acceleration, however, could come from the REIT sector.CoreSite Realty’s (COR) Q1 EPS is seen surging 295%, building up from 52% growth in the quarter before. The company reports Q1 results April 28. Equity LifeStyle Properties (ELS), whose Q1 earnings conference call is set for April 19, is seen boosting its EPS for the quarter by 181%, in contrast to 17% in the prior quarter. Store Capital’s (STOR) Q1 EPS is set to climb 147%, up from 38%.

836,TAP,"AVG Technologies (AVG) stock rocketed to a 10-month-high early Thursday on news that privately held antivirus-maker Avast Software plans to acquire it in a $1.28 billion, all-cash bid to tap the global cybersecurity market.AVG also announced preliminary Q2 results. It sees June-quarter sales coming in at $104 million to $106 million vs. the consensus of six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $108.9 million. At the midpoint, revenue would be down 3% vs. the year-earlier quarter.Avast's offer comes to $25 per share, a 33% premium to AVG's Wednesday closing price of 18.79. AVG shot up 30.8% to 24.58 on the stock market today, touching an 11-month high after spending the last eight months below 22. AVG has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 46, meaning it underperforms more than half of its rivals in terms of earnings and growth.Czech Republic-based Avast aims to add AVG's mobile and PC security products to its portfolio of antivirus products.""Avast is pursing this acquisition to gain scale, technological depth and geographical breadth so the new organization can be in a position to take advantage of emerging growth opportunities in internet security, as well as organizational efficiencies,"" the company said in a statement.Together, Avast and AVG will have a network of more than 400 million endpoints, of which 160 million are mobile, ""that act as de facto sensors"" to provide information about malware threats. Avast says the deal will help it take advantage of nascent Internet of Things opportunities.Cybersecurity companies have keyed in on the IoT opportunity and the idea that billions of devices could be connected to the internet -- and are therefore at risk of compromise -- within the next decade.Both boards have approved the offer, Avast said. The transaction is expected to close between Sept. 15 and Oct. 15, depending on regulatory review.M&A within the cybersecurity sector has been relatively quiet in the first half of 2016. Symantec (SYMC) plans to spend $4.65 billion to acquire Blue Coat Systems, though was earlier said to be eyeing FireEye (FEYE). Palo Alto Networks (PANW) was reportedly considering a bid on Proofpoint (PFPT) earlier this year, an analyst told IBD.

837,TAP,"Every president since Richard Nixon has promised to make America energy independent, but  we still import nine million barrels of oil a day, with much of it coming from the Middle East and OPEC.  Now for the first time in a half century -- thanks to the shale oil and gas revolution -- the dream of American energy independence is not just a pipedream but easily achievable if the next president takes the right steps to make it happen.This Made in America energy strategy means we could stop draining our economy of about $200 billion a year that could be used to rebuild our own country.  This isn't just about the economy.  We know from intelligence reports that as much as $500 million a year of petro-dollars find their way into the coffers of terrorist networks like ISIS.To achieve American energy self-sufficiency I'm not talking about the left's strange infatuation with building more windmills (sorry Hillary). We only get about 5% of our energy from windmills and solar panels.What I am talking about is about taking the strategic steps necessary to making the United States the energy dominant force on the planet within five to 10 years by using our super-abundance of fossil fuel resources.  Thanks to the amazing made-in-America technological breakthroughs of the last decade -- including horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to get at shale oil and gas reserves -- the U.S. now has at least 150 years of oil and natural gas resources on top of 500 years of coal.Consider what has happened in less than a decade with oil production.  ‎In 2008 the U.S. produced about 5 million barrels a day. We hit 8.7 million ‎in 2014 and could double that by 2025.As we tap into the full potential of our tens of billions of shale oil and gas we can become the number one export nation on the planet. This could easily mean more than $1 trillion a year in oil, gas and also coal exports each year -- perhaps exceeding 5% of GDP.Let's not forget about coal.  America was built on coal, and our nation has far more of it than any other nation. And we burn it cleanly and efficiently, unlike the Chinese and India who build hundreds of coal plants every year, but spew out dirty emissions.I estimate that with five simple steps taken by the next president, America will gain its energy independence:1. Allow drilling and mining permits on federal lands.  So far at least 90% of the shale gas and shale oil revolution has happened on private land.  But around half of all the land west of the Mississippi is government owned.  We estimate there are $50 trillion of energy resources stored underneath non-environmentally sensitive federal lands.  This is the biggest treasure chest in the world.2. Build a national network of pipelines across the country by allowing the permitting for projects like Keystone XL and many others.  Right now the federal government is holding up as many as a dozen necessary pipelines to get the oil and gas across the country and then shipped across the world.3. Build refineries and liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in the United States. The Energy Information Agency says the latest refiner ""began operating in 1977"" – or almost 40 years ago even though the U.S. population has nearly doubled since the mid 1970s and our energy production has doubled as well.4. Stop the Obama war on coal.  The environmentalists have tried to shutdown coal production, the next president should revive it.  This means putting a muzzle on the EPA to allow our energy resources to be harnessed and used in an environmentally responsible way.  Environmental rules have to be shown to be cost-effective, meaning that the cost to the economy of complying with the rules is justified on the basis of the environmental benefits -- and measured honestly.5. End all subsidies for all forms of energy. The left complains about taxpayer subsidies for oil and gas. The best way to promote efficient energy is to let the free market work and remove government handouts – particularly to the green energy sector.If we get this right, America can declare its independence from OPEC and Middle Eastern oil.  We can become the Saudi Arabia of the 21st century.
"
838,TAP,"Cable TV and phone companies have taken a regulatory spanking from the Obama administration. Will federal regulators ease up under the next U.S. president?The Federal Communications Commission won a big court victory in June on net neutrality rules governing broadband networks. Led by Chairman Tom Wheeler, the FCC has proposed new rules on consumer privacy and video competition that are opposed by AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA), Verizon Communications (VZ) and other telecoms, but which are supported by President Obama.If Hillary Clinton, the presumed Democratic nominee for president, wins in November, more regulations might be on tap for AT&T, Comcast, Verizon and all internet services providers, analysts say. Republican front-runner Donald Trump's views on telecom policy and mergers are a bit of a mystery, though Republicans normally favor a lighter regulatory touch.""The current regulatory regime is viewed as openly anti-cable, so at this point investors may believe that any change at all can only be good news,"" Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, told IBD.How soon Wheeler leaves the FCC after the new president is elected is open to debate. Traditionally, the FCC chairman resigns shortly after a new administration takes over. Wheeler, though, has kept his options open, and his term doesn't end until 2018.""If Hillary Clinton wins the election, there is a possibility that she asks Wheeler to stay on until she can find a suitable replacement,"" Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan said in a report. ""But we do not expect it would be a long process.""We also believe there would be not much change to the status quo if Hillary is president.""President Obama has been outspoken on broadband issues in his second term. In November 2014, he pressured the FCC to impose public utility-type regulation on internet services, citing the Communications Act of 1934's Title II rules. Wheeler proposed the new net neutrality rules along those lines.The rules bar ISPs from throttling, blocking or prioritizing web traffic. Wheeler also extended the rules to include wireless networks for the first time.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in June upheld Wheeler's Title-II based rules, but AT&T quickly vowed to appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. No appeal has yet been filed.The Obama administration has pushed to make broadband services more affordable for lower-income households, approving deals such as Charter Communications' (CHTR) purchase of Time Warner Cable, completed in May.For Comcast and other ISPs, though, probably the greatest potential danger is broadband price regulation. Wheeler has promised not to regulate prices for internet service, but a future FCC could possibly do so under Title II authority.While it may mean nothing, President Bill Clinton's first FCC chairman, Reed Hundt, rolled back cable TV prices in 1994. During the Democratic primaries, Hillary Clinton talked tough on broadband regulation, likely not wanting rival Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont to seize this issue.Cable stocks fell in October when Clinton wrote that U.S. ""prices for high-speed broadband are far higher"" than in some other countries, though she did not mention price regulation.""Clinton is widely viewed as more moderate than President Obama, but she has already singled out broadband in policy statements as something like a public utility,"" said Moffett.The FCC, meanwhile, is moving ahead with a proposal to require that internet service providers get customer consent to collect data for targeted advertising -- a policy that AT&T says would put it at a disadvantage vs. internet companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google or Facebook (FB), which do collect data on their users that helps target ads.In another move, the FCC aims to open up the TV set-top box market for more competition. The proposal would require pay-TV and tech companies to jointly develop new standards for devices providing access to cable TV programming. Potential set-top suppliers such as Apple (AAPL), Google or Amazon.com (AMZN) likely would provide their own programming guide and perhaps their own advertising to consumers, analysts say.Hillary Clinton's telecom policy would look like ""a third Obama term ... with the same implications in terms of corporate winners and losers,"" Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, said in a May research report.The presumed Democratic presidential candidate on Wednesday released what she called her initiative on technology and innovation. It had five main parts, with one of them a vow to assure that every U.S. household is hooked up to high-speed broadband, and that free Wi-Fi is available at public ""anchor"" institutions, such as airports.Trump, as president, would be a wild card, says Paul de Sa, an analyst at Bernstein Research.""A Democratic administration would build on the Obama achievements with a continued focus on competition, broadband and spectrum,"" de Sa told IBD via email. ""Under Trump, there's no idea how important media/telecom will be compared to other priorities or policy direction.""Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie Securities, agrees. ""(Trump) would introduce a level of unpredictability that would be harder for investors to handicap than Clinton,"" she said in a research report.Trump has criticized many media outlets, claiming their news coverage of his campaign has been unfair. Comcast's NBCUniversal and Trump cut ties in late June 2015. NBCU said it would no longer broadcast the ""Miss USA"" and ""Miss Universe"" pageants, which are produced by Trump, because of his views on immigrants. Trump did not star in a new season of NBCU's ""The Apprentice"" in the fall of 2015, though he did appear on the network's ""Saturday Night Live,"" as did Clinton.Comcast's top lobbyist, David Cohen, has been a fundraiser for Obama and Clinton, according to media reports. Federal antitrust regulators in 2015 thwarted Comcast's proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable.AT&T's top lobbyist, Jim Cicconi, has also come out for Clinton, the Wall Street Journal reported recently reported, though he's a longtime Republican who worked for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.Some analysts have speculated that Trump might be open to mergers that create new U.S. champions in telecom or other industries, but Moffett says that's unclear.""Trump is a complete wild card on just about every issue, so why should telecom be any different?"" Moffett said. ""Perhaps he will be pro-business, perhaps not. Would he view mergers favorably or unfavorably? What if one or both of the companies were foreign-owned, or if part of the rationale were to extract synergies that might move jobs offshore? The truth is, nobody has any idea.""AT&T shares rose 0.6% on the stock market today, hitting yet another all-time high. Verizon stock climbed 0.7%, also a new high, but still in buying range. Comcast edged up 0.1% while Charter Communications advanced 1.6%.

841,TAP,"Men may have long dominated the financial advisory field. But increasingly, signs show women are finally getting their shot.Amid a growing awareness of the “female market” for financial advice -- some data show women now controlling 51% of America’s personal wealth -- and the aftermath of some bias lawsuits, evidently more financial advisory firms are inviting women to be advisors as well as clients.“It’s a big deal,” said Michelle Lynch, vice president of Raymond James Financial’s (RJF) Network for Women Advisors. She added, “All the firms have some initiative now around women.”To be sure, female advisors are still comparatively few. Although women comprise more than half the population, they account for only 31% of financial advisors and 23% of certified financial planners (CFPs), according to a 2014 CFP Board report. And experts say that many women still aren’t even aware of the profession.But these days, programs in colleges, professional groups and company recruitment aim to boost the ranks of women advisors. Indeed, at Prudential Advisors, “our goal is to reflect the marketplace,” said Catalina Camoscio, the firm’s vice president of recruiting and development. Reflecting the marketplace would eventually mean “50% of (our) advisors” would be women.At big advisory firms, strategies to attract women -- often part of a firm’s broader “diversity” initiatives -- can include mentoring programs, college recruitment, hiring women returning to work after an extended leave, and the use of team advising.An example of the latter: A year and a half ago, Merrill Lynch Wealth Management (MLWM) expanded its training and development lineup with a Team Financial Advisor (TFA) offering. Participants take on one of five specific roles within an existing advisory team and receive 31 months of training.TFA recruits might include those starting a second career or new college graduates. Among TFA's attractions for women: It allows them “to work collaboratively with other advisors while contributing their expertise to the group,” said Linda Houston, division executive for New England at MLWM.Apprenticeships appear to be among the draws at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management (MSWM). For a year, apprentices work with a team of wealth advisors to broaden their skills before starting their own advisory practice within Morgan Stanley (MS). Results so far: about half the apprenticeship program’s hires have been women, reports Kara Underwood, MSWM’s head of diversity. (Morgan Stanley did not provide specific numbers of hires.)This year, Prudential (PRU) hopes to launch its team approach to financial advising and include recruitment as part of it. While this initiative could involve anyone, “we expect it to attract women because of the mentorship and collaboration it offers,” Prudential's Camoscio said.So how can women learn of, and tap, such opportunities? Experts cite key steps to consider:

842,TAP,"Express may not have the cachet of power brands like Nike and Under Armour, but the specialty retailer of clothing for consumers ages 20-30 thinks it has elevated its image among millennials using some of the same marketing tactics.Express (EXPR) has signed sports stars and models to serve as ""brand ambassadors,"" a variation on the promotions used by such sportswear giants as Under Armour (UA) and Nike (NKE). The effort may never become part of the public conversation like Nike's famed ""Air Jordan"" campaign featuring basketball great Michael Jordan, but it is unusual for fashion retailers to employ the move.All-Star third baseman Kris Bryant of the Chicago Cubs signed on in March with Express. He joins supermodel Kate Upton and Golden State Warriors basketball guard Steph Curry -- arguably the best player in the game today. Curry and Upton became brand ambassadors in 2014.""Express recognized the value of elevating a brand around ambassadors,"" Nomura Securities senior analyst Simeon Siegel told IBD. ""The athletic companies do that very well, but generally speaking, mall-based fashion companies have not utilized that approach. Express has embraced that and is appealing to millennials.""It's just one tactic Express is using to create buzz in the hotly competitive fashion retail arena. Since taking the helm in January 2015, Chief Executive David Kornberg has implemented a number of initiatives that have vaulted the company's financial performance after some years of tough times.His efforts are bearing fruit. Express has logged four straight quarters of at least double-digit earnings growth. Now, after a strong performance in 2015, Express is expected to keep up its winning streak.Kornberg has a number of new initiatives on tap, including the launch of new planning systems expected to come online soon, an upgrade to its e-commerce experience and a continued rollout of its off-price store concept.It also is improving store productivity through individual outlet closures. Express closed 27 stores in 2015, and another 17 are set for closure in fiscal 2016. It now operates more than 650 retail and factory outlet stores in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, and in Canada.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Express to see a 16% rise in earnings this year to $1.68 a share after an 79% year-over-year earnings gain in 2015. They forecast a 9% increase in 2017.But it could take some doing for Express to keep up the momentum, say analysts.""(The year) 2015 benefited from a regime change that drove some really strong improvements in the business in its first year,"" BB&T Capital Markets analyst Paul Alexander told IBD. ""I think they harvested a lot of low hanging fruit in 2015, but I don't see as much opportunity in 2016.""""Their goal is to continue to be lean on inventories, to continue to improve the fashion and to continue to be conservative (on the financial front),"" Alexander went on to say. ""This year, they're focused on rolling out state-of-the-art retail systems that should start paying off in 2017.""Kornberg modified the retailer's product makeup to incorporate more fashion items and bring newer fashions more often, as well as expand product categories and launch new collections, he said on the company's recent fourth-quarter conference call.It's no easy feat marketing and selling to millennials in an environment where it is competing for their business with cheap chic ""fast-fashion"" retailers like privately held Forever 21 and Sweden-based H&M.""They're definitely in direct competition for the millennial wallet with the fast-fashion guys,"" said Alexander. He says Express differs from these competitors by offering better quality merchandise and by having an assortment of clothing that covers a ""broad array of occasions,"" from casual and jeans to clothes for work.The company also put in new inventory management, speed-to-market and product testing disciplines. Express also continued to upgrade its systems and processes. And Kornberg laid out a financial plan.""Kornberg put an emphasis on consistent and steady, modest gains in both comps and margins, as opposed to swinging for home runs,"" said Alexander.Alexander sees Express growing earnings over the next few years.""But I worry if they don't get enough benefits out of implementing these new systems, competitive headwinds may weigh on EPS growth, and we will likely see the pace at which they grow earnings moderate,"" Alexander said.For now, Express is on a growth trajectory. One sign of that came during its holiday fourth quarter, ended Jan. 30, when earnings jumped 37% to 67 cents a share. Sales increased 5% to $765.6 million. Same-store sales, including e-commerce sales, rose 4% from a year earlier.Total e-commerce sales increased 8% to $156.3 million. Merchandise margin grew by 180 basis points, due to carefully managed promotions and inventory levels, the company said. Its gross margin rose to 34.0% from 31.7% a year earlier.Kornberg, who had been president, added the title of chief executive when Michael Weiss retired after a longtime stint in the post. He immediately set out to make some changes where Express -- which got its start in 1980 as a division of L Brands (LB), formerly Limited Brands -- had been lacking, analysts say.""The new CEO looked at this business and wanted to build a sustainable business model, which involved (reporting) a low-single-digit comp, and on top of that, if they spent a few years updating their systems, then the low-single-digit comp would translate to low double-digit operating income growth,"" said Nomura's Siegel.""The stock is now at a crossroads,"" Siegel said. ""They had a very successful year. Now investors will find out if it was because of the strength of the business, given the right processes are now in place, or if it was simply due to a year of strong products and the right merchandise.""Siegel believes it is the former. He says investors often mistake Express for ""the old, fashion-driven"" company it was as a part of Limited.""Express has the opportunity to see both upward earnings revisions and upward multiple expansion,"" Siegel said. ""I think it is an under-appreciated story. I think the appreciation will come when people see that Express is not the Express of old.""

843,TAP,"If Google and its Hands Free payments app can achieve a critical mass of brick-and-mortar stores, other digital wallet companies and payments processors could find themselves facing tougher competition -- at least, based on my test of the app.Hands Free is designed to eliminate the need to pull out a smartphone and tap it on a point-of-sale system when paying with Android Pay. It uses a combination of your initials, phone and picture to complete each transaction. And it works. Well.Google, which is a unit of Alphabet (GOOGL), rolled out Hands Free in March to at least 15 businesses with locations around the South San Francisco Bay Area. Since IBD's Silicon Valley bureau is located near several, I decided to test the idea of ordering and paying for something with only my voice -- part of the future we've been promised.After taking a selfie -- a photo is required to use the Hands Free app -- on my Nexus 5X phone, I headed to a nearby McDonald's (MCD), one of the chains participating in the pilot program. A colleague in the newsroom wanted a Diet Coke, and I was happy to oblige. Phone in my pocket, I walked up to the cash register, placed my order for a medium Diet Coke and then uttered the phrase ""Can I pay with Google?""The cashier skipped a beat and replied, ""Of course you can! Initials?"" I replied with mine. ""M.C. Hammer!"" she said, and pressed a few more buttons on the register.""Wearing a hat today, I see,"" she said, studying my hatless selfie on the register. And then she handed the beverage over with a receipt (I got an emailed receipt as well). Neither my phone nor wallet ever left my pockets.My order was small and the test limited, but it's clear that the implications could be far-reaching if consumers take to the idea. If Hands Free were available widely, I would certainly use it -- paying with just your voice is incredibly easy (and cool, too).At its core, Hands Free takes a swing at a big issue in payments (and e-commerce in general): how to make checkout as frictionless as possible.PayPal (PYPL) and its most recent endeavor on that front, One Touch, also attacks the friction problem. Apple (AAPL) Pay and rival Android Pay are also trying to innovate around the friction Silicon Valley perceives in paying with cash, a credit card or a mobile phone.With Google running a relatively small pilot program, it's hard to say at this early stage what impact Hands Free will have on its digital wallet.I doubt that being able to pay with Hands Free would alter where I go to buy things, but it just might be enough to convince me to pick Android Pay over its competitors.

844,TAP,"Shares of Carnival (CCL) reported second-quarter results that topped expectations and stuck to its guidance despite rising fuel costs and sinking currencies.The cruise operator's earnings per share during the quarter nearly doubled to 49 cents, beating views by a dime. Revenue rose 3.2% to $3.7 billion, narrowly passing views for $3.68 billion.The results came despite weaker currencies against the dollar and higher fuel prices. Chief Executive Arnold Donald praised the company's attempts to drive demand ""in excess of our measured capacity growth.""The company said that higher demand and growth discipline in a tough environment helped it hold the midpoint of its full-year earnings guidance of $3.25 to $3.35 a share, a narrower range than forecast in March but still $3.30 at its midpoint. Analysts expect $3.38.Carnival has tried to tap into an older U.S. population with more time to travel. It has also focused more on China, as the Caribbean becomes jam-packed with rivals.Shares closed up 0.2%, giving up steeper gains, on the stock market today. Royal Caribbean (RCL) dipped 0.5%. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) added 0.6%.

845,TAP,"Now that the new and improved Investors.com is in its second month, perhaps it's a good time for a refresher course on how to use it to find prime stock candidates.This column will focus on the IBD Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables, which you can find under the IBD Tables. From the home page, hover your mouse over the Stock Lists tab, then select ""IBD Data Tables"" from the resulting list.The Smart Tables, the first item on the list, reflect data from the previous trading day. When you select the item, you'll first get a list of the 33 sectors tracked by IBD. Click on one of the sectors to reveal a treasure trove of data that include the stocks categorized in the sector, along with key ratings such as Composite, Earnings Per Share, Relative Strength, SMR (short for Sales+Profit  Margins+ROE) and Accumulation/Distribution.You'll also find the prior session's price change, closing price, 52-week high, volume and volume percent change. Certain ratings and performance numbers are colored in blue (these are boldfaced in the weekly print edition): Composite of 98 or better, 52-week high, volume percent change of 50% or more, and stocks up at least 1 point. Stocks that fall 1 point or more are in red (underlined in print issue).If the sector contains a Sector Leader, the stock will be at the top of the list, along with additional data including quarterly profit and sales growth, pretax margins, return on equity and next earnings report date.Let's say you click on the internet sector. Facebook (FB) is a Sector Leader, so it shows up at the top. What's the light blue highlight for? That's another helpful feature to allow readers to quickly identify top stocks with EPS and RS ratings of 80 or better that have come public within the last 15 years.When searching for potential candidates for a stock watch list, it's best to stick with those with a minimum EPS and RS rating of 80. That indicates the stock outperforms 80% of all others based on those respective metrics. And, IBD research has found, many of the most-winning stocks in history made their biggest run within the first few years of their initial public offering.Naturally, there's still much due diligence to be done, including checking the daily and weekly stock charts, monitoring news and studying other key fundamental criteria. But the Smart Tables are a great starting point, offering users a quick and easy way to find more than a handful of promising stock ideas.

847,TAP,"Smith & Wesson (SWHC), a more than 160-year-old company synonymous with guns, is looking to expand beyond firearms and wants to acquire its way into what it calls the ""rugged outdoors"" market.The plan, which runs in tandem with a growth initiative the company discussed in March, is also seen as an attempt to tap into a higher-margin industry, shield itself from seasonal swings and guard against the risk of any future gun laws.""In particular, the rugged outdoors space is closely associated with our core firearms user,"" CEO James Debney said in March at a UBS conference in Boston. ""That's one of the reasons a lot less firearms are sold at retail in the summer vs. in the winter months, because they're out doing other outdoor activities -- fishing, hiking, camping and so on.""Smith & Wesson has also said it wants to add divisions to facilitate acquisitions and focus on selling outdoor products.The company's entry into the sector began with its 2014 deal to buy Battenfeld Technologies, which provided the gun maker with a high-margin company along with its array of hunting and shooting accessories.""I think they believe that this is a highly fragmented market that is begging for consolidation,"" Wedbush analyst James Hardiman told IBD.The outdoor market's margins contrast with those found in sales to law enforcement agencies, which offer bigger but infrequent transactions, Morgan Dempsey research director Brian Rafn said.After wresting a hefty discount from a gun manufacturer, a police department might demand ammunition, training, disposal of old equipment, and other responsibilities.""By the time you get through that, it’s a very, very, very low-margin business,"" Rafn told IBD, adding that the outdoors and accessories market is ""just a much cleaner business with fairly infrequent discounting.""Where exactly Smith & Wesson's outdoor plans will take it is unclear. The company declined to comment for this story. But don't expect too much in the way of branded apparel.""We're looking for new brands, we're not looking to take firearms brands into the outdoor space. They are firearms, and that's where they belong,"" Debney said at the conference. ""No Smith & Wesson hiking boots, fishing rods, sleeping bags, tents or anything like that.""Meanwhile, rival Sturm Ruger (RGR), whose roots are in hunting and other outdoors activities, is unlikely to make a big move in the space, Rafn said.But after a near-decade accessories boom, he questions whether the outdoors and accessories market might be topping out, noting that floor space at Gander Mountain, Cabela’s (CAB) and Bass Pro Shops for ""tactical equipment or tactical accessories or tactical clothing"" is starting to shrink.Smith & Wesson's outdoor ambitions also follow an all-too-familiar pattern of high-profile shootings and threats of new gun-control measures.While some observers say consumers' regulatory concerns have eased recently, panic purchases during the Obama administration and occasional overestimation of market demand have caused some wild stock fluctuations over the years.For instance, Smith & Wesson’s stock nearly doubled through 2012, a year marked by the Aurora, Colo., theater shooting and the school shooting in Newtown, Conn. The stock rose another 58% in 2013, but it fell 30% through 2014 as panic eased. Quarterly sales followed a similar pattern.And over the past 12 months, Smith & Wesson shares have nearly doubled, and Sturm Ruger's have climbed 40%, partly on expectations of more gun control laws after the terrorist shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., in December.""They’re not going to say this, but I do think it helps to diversify away from some your regulatory risks,"" Wedbush's Hardiman said of Smith & Wesson's acquisitive mood.""Obviously firearms, especially long guns and what they call modern sporting rifles -- but what a lot of people call assault rifles -- they’re certainly a long-term risk that there could be some regulation preventing some of those products.""Smith & Wesson has also suggested demand isn't driven as much by panic anymore.""The consumer buying right now is more intelligent, let's say, than it was several years ago, in which the shelves at firearms dealers were cleared, and a consumer would walk in and just buy whatever they could because they were afraid of regulation,"" CFO Jeff Buchanan said on the company's third-quarter conference call in March.Others downplay regulatory concerns as a factor in the company's outdoor efforts.Rafn said every company looks for ways to wrap a core product in accessories, doubting that Smith & Wesson ""is being scared into that.""Russ Thurman, publisher of Shooting Industry Magazine, sees the outdoor move as a way to strengthen Smith & Wesson's firearms brand.

849,TAP,"A rising tide has lifted a once-leaky ETF boat.That boat would be emerging markets.Flow data indicate a dramatic reversal in sentiment toward this recently unloved asset class. Investors have poured $5.5 billion into broadly diversified and regional emerging market ETFs so far in March, the most since January 2013, according to BlackRock (BLK) iShares.The bellwether iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) alone absorbed $4.5 billion through March 29 for its biggest monthly inflow since December 2012. That's nearly a fifth of the assets in the $24.32 billion ETF.""Investors are turning to a 'risk on' approach, with steadier commodities prices and a more stable outlook on key markets like China,"" Martin Small, head of iShares' U.S. unit, said in a news release.On Wednesday, EEM broke decisively through resistance at its 200-day moving average following Fed Chair Janet Yellen's cautious remarks on raising interest rates. It was trading above that key line for the first time since May.That's a particularly bullish sign because EEM is a popular fund for emerging market (EM) exposure with deep-pocketed institutional investors. They include pension plans, foundations and endowments. Investors will now watch whether the ETF can find support at the 200-day line.Emerging markets were gouged in the past year as commodity prices crumbled. EEM is trading 22% below its April high.However, it has jumped 11.9% month to date and 5.4% year to date. By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad U.S. stock market, is up 6.5% and 1.1% over those same periods.Low inflation in the U.S. and fewer expected rate hikes could further boost EM and dividend-paying stocks, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence.Lower U.S. interest rates tend to drive down the U.S. dollar. A falling dollar boosts commodities such as gold and oil, which are globally priced in the greenback. Commodity-exporting nations, such as Brazil and Russia, benefit in turn.Emerging markets -- Brazil in particular -- outperformed in the past month. Brazilian stocks have outpaced world peers this year amid political unrest that raised hopes of a path out of recession for the country. Investors reacted positively to Wednesday’s news that the political coalition under President Dilma Rousseff was crumbling.""If investors expect the Federal Reserve to be more accommodating, they're more willing to take on risk,"" Rosenbluth said. Many U.S. investors equate emerging markets with risk. Of course, higher risk in investing often means higher rewards.Investing in emerging markets helps to diversify portfolios. Investors not only tap into the growth potential of developing countries but also get attractive income.""The high yields are an additional benefit that investors may not fully realize,"" Rosenbluth said, while pointing out that yields may have risen as EM stocks declined.Diversified emerging market ETFs yield 2.62% on average vs. 2.17% for SPY. Some funds that target dividend-paying companies offer even tastier yields.SPDR S&P Emerging Markets Dividend (EDIV) invests in 101 stocks screened for size, liquidity, earnings growth and profitability.EDIV is up 12.8% month to date and 11.5% year to date. It yields 5.4%, but its constituents ""have a consistently strong record of dividends and earnings,"" Rosenbluth said. Solid stocks within the portfolio include MTN Group, a South African telecom services provider, and the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China.The management of China's largest commercial bank ""is focusing on driving quality earnings expansion through a more measured and controllable pace of loan growth, greater diversity of income and a high emphasis on asset quality management,"" according to S&P Global.The ETF has $254.6 million in assets and growing average daily volume.WisdomTree Emerging Markets High Dividend (DEM), EGShares EM Quality Dividend (HILO), ALPS Emerging Sector Dividend Dogs (EDOG) and iShares Emerging Markets Dividend (DVYE) also offer exposure to high dividend payers in emerging markets.They're among the best-performing EM ETFs year to date.Somewhat surprisingly to Rosenbluth, however, they fared no better in 2015's sell-off than nondividend-focused EM peers.""The volatility is not much lower, despite the income component,"" he said.

850,TAP,"Bankruptcy clouds shadow SunEdison (SUNE) this week, ahead of a Wednesday deadline to file its annual 10-K or, say analysts, default on $725 million in second-lien loans -- an inferno, at least two analyst say, that ties back to its yieldcos TerraForm Power (TERP) and TerraForm Global (GLBL).Late Tuesday, reports surfaced that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission might be probing SunEdison's liquidity stance. The Wall Street Journal reported that SEC investigators are examining how much cash SunEd had on hand last year.SunEdison stock plunged 55% in the stock market today on the investigation rumor, dipping to an all-time low below 1.""I'd say (SunEdison is) kind of on life support as we speak,"" S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Angelo Zino told IBD on Monday. ""We have absolutely no visibility into the financial outlook of the company. It's obviously very worrisome.""SunEdison last held an earnings call in November, about two weeks before it fired Carlos Domenech, SunEd executive vice president and CEO of both TerraForms. According to TerraForm Power's proxy statement, Domenech first initiated communications with Vivint Solar (VSLR).On July 20, SunEdison announced its plan to acquire residential solar installer Vivint. The deal briefly got a warm embrace on Wall Street, but shares of SunEdison and Vivint Solar have plummeted a respective 98% and 84% since then. In December, SunEd cut its bid on Vivint to reflect the drop in stock price, and this month Vivint scrapped its sale to SunEdison, citing financial concerns about the acquirer. A major TerraForm Power investor had been angling to block the deal as well. The transaction would have dropped Vivint Solar's 523-megawatt rooftop assets down to TerraForm Power.Since then, SunEdison delayed its annual 10-K financial statement on Feb. 29 and March 16, citing an ongoing investigation into its liquidity stance. The investigation arose from allegations by former and current executives of financial misconduct.Yield company TerraForm Power blamed SunEd for its own late 10-K. TerraForm Power is facing Nasdaq delisting as well as a potential slew of investor class action lawsuits related to the insider trading and fraud portions of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. TerraForm Power stock, down 8% early Tuesday, rallied to rise 1.7%, to 8.61.Zino maintains his hold rating on SunEdison stock, but over the past week investment banks Cowen and Stifel Nicolaus have dropped their coverage on SunEdison stock.Nine months ago, SunEdison was a different company, Zino says. In June, SunEdison's assets were valuable, the company had ready access to the debt financing and equity markets, and could tap its healthy TerraForm yieldcos. A yieldco is created to house assets, generate on-tap cash flow and yield tax-free dividends. TerraForm Power filed its IPO in June 2014. NRG Energy (NRG) followed in May 2015 with a superior strategy, T-Rex Group CEO Benjamin Cohen told IBD.T-Rex Group is an analytics-based advisory group for renewable stocks. NRG Yield (NYLD) held 71% non-renewable assets in conjunction with 29% renewable assets -- balancing older profitable assets with newer and more quickly-depreciating renewable assets.By appearing less profitable overall, the yieldco can pay less in taxes, Cohen explained. It's a completely legal strategy -- and investors ate it up. Soon, the yieldcos were producing more cash than the parent company could invest.""So they had to invest in unsecured assets,"" namely the pre-development stages of projects already dropped into the yieldcos. ""They were overpaying for assets . . . and that risk drove up the price of the assets.""The bubble burst.Days after announcing its plan to acquire Vivint Solar, SunEdison's TerraForm Global filed its IPO and launched on Wall Street at 12.44, 17% below its 15 IPO price. Shares dove 19% Tuesday, to 2.03.SunEdison may be the ""public poster child"" for the yieldco bubble burst, but SunEd's downfall isn't indicative of the broader solar market and asset class, Cohen says.""This is the failure of a capital market vehicle, as opposed to the failure of an asset class or the failure of one particular company,"" he said. But, he acknowledged, SunEd was slugged particularly hard in the yieldco blast and investors are leery of ongoing financial storms.""Equity investors are discounting the value of SunEdison because management hasn't proved its ability to execute on its strategy,"" he said. ""It seems overdone.""NRG Yield stock is down nearly 50% since its peak near 28 last June. The First Solar (FSLR)-SunPower (SPWR) jointly-owned yieldco, 8point3 Energy Partners (CAFD), went public last June at 21 and closed Tuesday at 14.27, down 1.2%.July 20 proved to be SunEdison stock's recent high point, at 33.45. Shares have traded around 1 since February.SunEdison was targeting aggressive growth via M&A and aiming to use yieldcos TerraForm Power and TerraForm Global to help pay for its investments, Zino says. Debt financing was available but more difficult, he says, considering SunEd's heavily-leveraged balance sheet.Investors worried that SunEdison's Vivint Solar acquisition was too much, too fast. Then, TerraForm Global opened far below its IPO price.""The fact SunEdison didn't have a fallback, the fact they were getting too aggressive with these M&A deals was part of the reason we saw the investment community sell off on these yieldco vehicles,"" Zino said.He added: ""Once they weren't able to tap the yieldcos anymore, that's what really put SunEdison in the situation it's in today.""Now, SunEdison is struggling to shop its assets around to third-party developers. In June, SunEd's yieldcos would have bought those assets. Not now. And lacking newer financial statements, no bank will touch SunEd, Zino said.""Until they are able to get a resolution to the 10-K filing, we wouldn't expect to see anything come out of the debt market, and it becomes problematic for the third-party market as well,"" he said. ""It becomes difficult for utilities to invest in SunEdison if they have no idea of the type of financial situation SunEdison is in.""And SunEd certainly can't tap the equity market.Said Zino, ""a precipitous decline in the yieldco prices had a direct impact on SunEdison stock and, as a result, we saw billions and billions (of dollars) in equity value wiped out from the yieldcos and SunEdison together.""

851,TAP,"Twitter (TWTR) said people using Apple's (AAPL) iOS or Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Android can now add descriptions to images in tweets, a benefit to the visually impaired.The update allowing descriptions -- also known as alternative text -- empowers ""everyone to ensure content shared on Twitter is accessible to the widest possible audience,"" said Twitter engineer Todd Kloots in a blog post Tuesday. .""Photos have been at the center of some of the biggest moments on Twitter,” said Kloots. ""As a core part of the Twitter experience, it's important that images shared on our platform are accessible to everyone, including those who are visually impaired.”People can use the feature via the ""compose image descriptions"" option in the Twitter app's accessibility setting. When an image is added to a tweet, the user can tap the ""add description"" button and insert a description of up to 420 characters to the image. Visually impaired people will have access to the description by using assistive technology, such as screen readers and braille displays, Twitter said.Smartphones have other accessibility features, including VoiceOver, the iPhone's built-in gesture-based app that reads text on a touchscreen aloud, and Google Android's TalkBack, through which visually impaired users can access anything on their phones.Voice-activated services, including Apple's Siri, Amazon.com's (AMZN) Alexa, Alphabet's Google Now, Microsoft's (MSFT) Cortana and others, can assist all consumers, including the visually disabled, as people increasingly rely on mobile phones for shopping, communicating and information.But surveys have found those voice-activated services aren't getting much use. Just 13% of U.S. mobile phone owners use a voice-controlled personal assistant on their device each day, according to a survey last June from 451 Research.The Americans with Disabilities Act requires websites and mobile applications to be accessible. Google announced its Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities last year with a $20 million grant for technology innovators in the nonprofit community who work on technology to make people with disabilities more independent.In addition to Twitter and Microsoft, Adobe Systems (ADBE), Dropbox, LinkedIn (LNKD), Yahoo (YHOO), Facebook (FB), Intuit (INTU) and others have jointly asked universities to train computer students in accessibility software design and are requiring new hires to demonstrate some familiarity with it, according to the Mercury News.Besides facing competition from rivals such as Facebook, Twitter is struggling to expand its user base as its user growth has slowed. Twitter has launched programs to reel in ""logged out"" users who visit Twitter's site but don't have accounts of their own, making them less coveted by advertisers.Twitter stock was up 2% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 16.Image provided by Shutterstock.

852,TAP,"Recent consumer IPOs were a more fitness-focused bunch than those of years past and have largely outperformed new-issue cohorts, offering a clue into who the hot newcomers may be when the current IPO chill starts to gradually thaw.Of the 15 consumer companies that went public in 2015, over half of them were tied -- directly or indirectly -- to the health and wellness trend. The Class of 2015 included fitness tracker maker Fitbit (FIT), gym operator Planet Fitness (PLNT) and SkinnyPop popcorn maker Amplify Snack Brands (BETR).“If you add fast-casual to your list, a lot of these have a focus on health,” said Kathleen Smith, co-founder of IPO research firm Renaissance Capital. “It resonates. Some of it is that the younger people realize they’re going to live longer and if you’re going to live longer you’ve got to be healthy and eat well and exercise.”Next up could be SoulCycle, an upscale spin-studio operator with a celebrity following. The prospective IPO, a popular choice for hipsters and workout junkies looking for an Instagrammable workout, most recently took its rave-like studio classes to SXSW, hosting ""cardio parties"" in partnership with Spotify.Even Fido’s in on it. July IPO Blue Buffalo (BUFF), which makes natural dog and cat food, is an extension of the consumer demand for more health-conscious, less-processed fare. And on the tech side, Mindbody (MB) went public last June with its class-booking and appointment-scheduling software for gyms and spas.One could even include the outdoorsy Duluth Trading (DLTH), a clothing company that caters to the “modern, self-reliant American” with plaid shirts and waterproof cargo pants for those who live a “hands-on lifestyle.”As more companies sprout from the soil of demand for health-conscious products, many of them tap the IPO market to fund growth, said Smith. That includes Shake Shack (SHAK), the fast-casual purveyor of antibiotic-free and hormone-free Angus burgers that went public at the start of 2015, and David’s Tea (DTEA), the Canadian chain that offers over 150 types of tea -- and not a single espresso drink.While a number of them are trading below their IPO prices, their performance has outpaced that of last year's new issues.Of the 170 companies that went public in 2015, the average return has been a 19.6% decline as of Monday's close, according to Renaissance Capital. But shares of the 15 consumer IPOs from last year, which includes all of the above names except Mindbody, have experienced a collective rise of about 1.1%.Planet Fitness, which went public at 16 last August, is up 18% from the market's low point of Feb. 11 this year to 15.60 by Monday's close. Amplify, which priced at 18 less than a year ago, has rebounded 44% from Feb. 11 to 13.60. Blue Buffalo has leapt 60% to 24.77, above its initial offering of 20 a share.That compares to the S&P 500's 11% rise in the same period. And investors have shown an eagerness to hop on board, though not all stocks have been cooperating with hopes for a fitter future.Within a few months of trading, Shake Shack’s stock more than quadrupled to a high of 96.75, and Fitbit more than doubled from its initial offering price. But they collapsed soon after that. Shake Shack lost two-thirds of its value and Fitbit three-fourths. Both are essentially flat since Feb. 11.“The investor interest is very high in fitness (and) healthy eating, but I think people struggle with exactly how to play the trend, as it is really relatively broad-based,” said Piper Jaffray analyst Sean Naughton, who covers Planet Fitness, Amplify and other consumer stocks.Plus, recent market volatility has put a damper on enthusiasm for privately owned businesses looking to take to the market. Only seven companies have gone public this year, said Renaissance Capital's Smith, vs. 28 during the same time frame in 2015.SoulCycle filed last July to go public but has yet to start trading. The company declined to comment, as it remains in a quiet period.“I think, overall, (SoulCycle has) performed rather well,"" said Smith. ""It’s not like there isn’t competition in this area.""The New York City-based chain raked in $112 million in 2014 revenue from its 38 locations, growing sales by nearly 49% from the prior year.But if the current market rally continues, the window for IPO issuance might be on the verge of reopening, after closing in December.Smith predicts that investors will see a trickle of companies ready to start trading sometime in April. With it might come names like SoulCycle or Honest Company, the baby and home product company founded by actress Jessica Alba.“When the market opens up, it will not be a tsunami wave of IPOs,” said Smith. ""(It will be) slow, steady, below-average.""She expects that health care, technology and consumer companies will likely lead the new-issue market this year, with a similar health-bent possibly flowing throughout.""The SoulCycles and Honest Companies -- we'll see more of it,"" she said. ""(And) more fast casuals.""But as competition heats up, smaller companies riding the health and wellness trend -- newly public or not -- have to watch out for traditional heavyweights fighting back.Legacy names like General Mills (GIS), Kroger (KR) and Target (TGT) have have been adapting to the consumer shift toward natural and organic foods, putting pressure on the likes of Whole Foods Market (WFM), Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and others.""Generally speaking, the better-for-you food players and the better-for-you grocery stores -- they’ve under-performed their traditional peers, really over the last eight months,"" said Piper Jaffray's Naughton.Image provided by Shutterstock.

855,TAP,"SodaStream (SODA) stock gapped up after the maker of sparkling-water systems a day earlier announced a beverage-making system that it says can serve up suds within seconds, sending shares of beer companies like Molson Coors (TAP), Constellation Brands (STZ) and Boston Beer Co. (SAM) down.The new system, called the Beer Bar, is available in Germany and Switzerland, and is set to hit other markets later this year and next. SodaStream is debuting the system with a light beer, Blondie, which the company said can be made by combining Blondie concentrate with sparkling water.""We are excited to launch a brand dedicated to serving the global growing trend of home-crafted beer,"" CEO Daniel Birnbaum said in a statement. One liter of Blondie makes about three liters of beer, the company said.SodaStream shares closed up 6.2% in the stock market today but had been up as much as 10.7% to reach the highest level since late June 2015.The stock broke out of a cup base with a 15.93 buy point on May 10, when the company's Q1 results sent shares up 23.7%. The gains were driven by strong demand in Europe, popularity of its flavor lines, and more efficient manufacturing and logistics, the company said. Shares are now above profit-taking sell territory.Monday's announcement comes as the beer industry consolidates to adapt to the popularity of craft beer, which since the early 2000s has given people a broader beer selection and turned basements across the U.S. into home breweries.Elsewhere in the stock market, alcoholic beverage distributor Constellation Brands, which said in November that it would buy craft brewer Ballast Point, fell 3%, dropping out of buy range. Molson shares slumped 1% but still remain in buy territory. Boston Beer Co. dropped 2.8%.Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD), which last month said it would buy craft brewer Devils Backbone, dipped less than 0.1%. AB InBev is also attempting to proceed with a massive merger with SABMiller. Rival beer giant Ambev (ABEV) lost 1.7%.

859,TAP,"People should know what’s coming. Especially a storm.That’s what AccuWeather founder and chairman Joel Myers thought as his aunt waited out a blizzard at his parents' Philadelphia home in 1947.Myers, then age 7, stayed up all night fascinated by the whiteout. “I started writing the weather conditions down every day,” he told IBD.The obsession snowballed into a career in the fledgling field of forecasting.Today his media company, AccuWeather, provides forecasts to more than 1.5 billion people a day, in 100-plus languages and dialects, and serves nearly half of the Fortune 500 companies.Analytics firm ComScore ranks AccuWeather.com as the No. 1 mobile weather website in the world and the fourth-ranked site in the U.S. based on unique users.The company’s forecasts reach the public through smartphones, tablets, radio, TV, newspapers  and the AccuWeather network cable channel.Sometimes it’s a matter of life and death.In 2015, a California railway rerouted trains based on AccuWeather’s flash-flood and mudslide warnings, saving crew lives and millions of dollars in cargo. In 2008, a Caterpillar construction machinery plant in Mississippi received 22 minutes' warning from AccuWeather before a tornado decimated the facility. All 80 employees reached emergency shelters and survived.In 2005, AccuWeather targeted Hurricane Katrina’s landfall 12 hours before the National Hurricane Center issued its first warning. Myers' outfit was even way ahead of that. Calling it a “catastrophe in the making in New Orleans,” AccuWeather predicted disaster three days before the storm arrived.“That was a dramatic example of superior accuracy. That’s been my life’s dedication,” said Myers, 76, who was recognized by Entrepreneur magazine’s “Encyclopedia of Entrepreneurs” as one of the greatest in American history.It started with “snow, snow, snow.”That’s what 3-year-old Myers chanted as he paced in front of the family’s living room window.His mother, Doris, called him “one-track-mind Joel.”Myers’ ability to focus bordered on fixation. “If I was interested, I couldn’t be dissuaded,” he said.By age 11, Myers was gathering instruments for an amateur weather station in the attic. Younger brothers Barry and Evan were drawn into the home-spun science project.“I started calling my weather reports in to the National Weather Service and the local radio station,” Myers said. “At age 14, they started saying my name on the radio.”Even then, Myers prized accuracy.He regularly rose at 6 a.m. to listen to meteorologists on radio stations. “They helped educate me,” he said.As Myers neared high school graduation, he plotted a future. “I decided to combine my love of weather forecasting with business,” he said.Myers’ parents tried to talk him out of it -- meteorologists typically ended up in low-paying government jobs -- but the boy was steadfast.“I was determined, and that’s what I loved,” he said.His enrollment at Penn State in 1957 was the right move. “It happened to have the best undergraduate meteorology program in the world,” Myers said.Forecasting was then a young field, requiring hand-drawn maps, keen observation and intuition.“Complete surprises were routine. But there were a handful of people who could do it, and Joel was one of them,” said John Cahir, a fellow student and now retired Penn State vice provost, dean and professor of meteorology.Myers was never satisfied, even when he was right.“He didn’t want to hear praise. He always wanted to know: Where did I go wrong? What were the weak spots? That was his habit of mind,” Cahir said.During a forecasting class, Myers predicted 4 to 5 inches of snow would fall the next day. The professor bet the brash student that precipitation would be nil.Myers won that wager -- and several more.“He lost 11 straight bets to me,” Myers said. “He chose me for an assistantship.”The assistant’s job was to prepare maps for the class. When the professor kept failing to show up, the student became the teacher.“Now I’m working like heck. I’ve got to keep this thing going,” Myers said.It became Myers’ class and one he would teach for 21 years. “I was able to do a lot of experimenting in class,” he said. “You learn the most by teaching.”Myers had students pick a city and forecast the weather in a head-to-head competition. “If they beat me, they got an automatic A at the end of the semester,” he said. “It was a lot of fun.”Observing students’ results helped Myers detect this essential clue to accuracy: If he took forecasts from promising students and averaged their results, he’d get closest to the actual conditions.That became the seed of AccuWeather’s approach: “Take the best forecasters and put them together as a team,” Myers said.A mentor at Penn State, Charles Hosler, gave the promising student a nudge. “He knew of my dream to take forecasting and turn it into a business,” Myers said.Professor Hosler had been providing forecasts to local firms and passed a natural gas company client to Myers, letting the young teacher set up an office in a rooftop closet on campus in 1962.“So the business started on the roof of the Deike building,” Hosler said. “Joel plowed right into that. He didn’t need much encouragement.”Myers' gas company client was paying $50 a month -- $400 in today’s money -- for daily forecasts. “We were off and running,” he said.In 1963, tragedy struck: Myers’ father, Martin, committed suicide.The calamity steeled Myers’ resolve to expand his business while teaching and pursuing his Ph.D. at PSU. Failure wasn’t an option.Rejection was.“I talked to 2,500 prospects before I had 100 customers,” Myers said. “I dealt with all the skepticism.”He won over ski businesses -- which needed conditions plus relative humidity for snow-making operations.“(My forecasts) were tailored to each mountain,” Myers said. “I had 60 to 65 ski areas in the Northeast that depended on me.” In 1971, Myers, now a Ph.D., started delivering forecasts to radio and TV stations and newspapers. His brothers, who also attended Penn State, joined AccuWeather and rose -- Evan to chief operating officer and Barry to CEO, while Joel remained president and chairman.While continuing to teach at PSU until 1981, Joel developed a reputation at AccuWeather as a demanding but fair boss who hired top talent -- often Penn State grads.His philosophy after launching AccuWeather.com as a free website in 1996: “Be the best at it, and it will work out.”The best is the most correct.“You hear about people overplaying the weather,” he said. “It’s important you don’t do that because you don’t want to lose credibility.”Myers put AccuWeather’s false alarm rate for tornado warnings at 11% compared with 88% for the National Weather Service.For business clients, “that difference translates into dollars,” he said. “To shut down a (factory) line -- that’s very costly. It’s a safety factor, and it’s a business factor.”AccuWeather’s 52,000-square-foot headquarters in State College, Pa., puts top technology into the hands of the most meteorologists in one location.“This is the center of it. There’s no other place like this in the world,” Myers said. “We’ve been in business for 54 years, and we’ve only had two years when revenues did not exceed the year previous.”Those years -- 2001 and 2008 -- were marked by economic storms. The company continued growing its media footprint and services for businesses -- from tailored weather forecasts and warnings to business analytics and forensics for weather-related accidents.Myers raised seven children while expanding the company, and he continues to write and speak about the meteorology business.On his radar now: how to tap into transformative innovations driven by accelerating technology.“The weather game is never over,” he said. “It’s a continuing story.”Built world’s largest weather-forecasting media company.Overcame: Skepticism, tragedy, competition.Lesson: Relentlessly pursue accuracy and communicate it clearly.“I’ve been blessed that a lot of people have bought into my dream of this being the crucible of the most accurate, meaningful, valuable forecast source in the world.”

861,TAP,"No. 2 residential solar installer Sunrun (RUN) could trigger Hawaiian solar growth with a Tesla Motors (TSLA) battery-backed storage offering following regulators' 2015 decision to cut net-metering subsidies, a Credit Suisse analyst said Monday.And despite a bulkier subsidy cut in Nevada that doesn't grandfather in existing customers, Sunrun will flare on its impressive access to capital, Credit Suisse analyst Patrick Jobin wrote in a research report. Jobin retained an outperform rating and 21 price target on Sunrun stock.Sunrun stock was up a fraction in afternoon trading on the stock market today, while shares of No. 1 installer SolarCity (SCTY) were down 1%. IBD's 21-company Energy-Solar industry group was down nearly 1%, after falling 1.5% Friday. It ranks No. 54 out of 197 groups tracked.Year to date, Sunrun and SolarCity stocks are down a respective 43% and 47%, under-performing the industry group that has fallen 22% on continued volatility in Nevada despite Congress' late December extension to a key federal subsidy.Still, ""industry dynamics continue to favor Sunrun and SolarCity and highlight increasing barriers to entry,"" Jobin wrote. ""Further, we were impressed with Sunrun's ability to outmaneuver peers in the capital markets.""Jobin sees a 214% upside to Sunrun stock.In Q4, Sunrun guided to 40% growth in 2016 vs. consensus expectations for 60%-80% growth, echoing SolarCity, which earlier indicated 44% growth vs. traditional annual growth of 80%.But Sunrun and SolarCity differ in their rationale. SolarCity is aiming to become cash flow positive. Sunrun is focusing on cost reductions and maximized returns and, this month, guided to a 15% year-over-year reduction in 2016 for its channel business.Instead, Sunrun now expects to double its direct business over the course of 2016.""The company is on the fastest path to reaching the 'Holy Grail' of residential solar leasing companies whereby the third-party capital can cover all upfront costs,"" Jobin wrote.Sunrun also unveiled a solar-plus-storage solution coined BrightBox to reinvigorate Hawaiian solar growth, after the state suspended payments to solar customers for excess energy fed back into the grid. The state was at 17% solar penetration when that vote came down.Firms like SunPower (SPWR), SolarCity, SolarEdge (SEDG) and Sunrun have long worked to make solar storage economical. Without it, utilities must buy the excess energy fed back into the grid. In 2015, however, Nevada and Hawaii cut net-metering payments to solar customers.Within a day, SolarCity and Sunrun said they would exit Nevada, the latter threatening to file suit. Now, Sunrun has managed to reduce its solar storage costs by 50% year over year, Jobin wrote. BrightBox customers are expected to reduce their utility bills by 15%.""The adoption of solar plus storage, if economic, can mitigate the risk in other states if utilities degrade the economics of net-metered energy,"" he wrote. And ""a solar plus storage solution in Hawaii should allow growth to resume.""In Hawaii, neighborhood constraints have restricted new customers from adopting solar. The BrightBox solution circumvents those restrictions, allowing Sunrun to tap into the remaining 83% of the state without solar.
"
862,TAP,"Back in 2014, when specialty-drug maker Allergan was fending off a hostile takeover bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals, one of its main reasons for resistance was its claim that Valeant would decimate its research and development capabilities.Indeed, at that time, Valeant boasted that it had figured out a way to spend far less on R&D than other large drugmakers, while still cranking out new drugs.Two years later, the scene looks very different. Valeant (VRX), plagued by scandal and financial troubles, is reworking its business model. And Ireland-based Allergan (AGN) is touting an approach to R&D it calls ""open science,"" following its merger with Actavis -- and after its near-merger with Pfizer (PFE) that would have been the industry's largest but was scuttled in April when the U.S. changed its tax rules concerning companies looking to locate their headquarters in lower-tax countries. Like Valeant, Botox maker Allergan doesn't have its own internal research infrastructure and spends less on R&D than your typical Big Pharma. But it still spends more than Valeant and other low-cost specialty pharmas through its collaborations with a host of small biotechs and other external developers in its quest for leading drugs.Allergan CEO Brenton Saunders and R&D chief David Nicholson recently spoke with IBD to explain more about what open science means and how it could help Allergan grow.IBD: A lot of companies acquire or license externally developed drugs, so how is ""open science"" differentiating? Saunders: Maybe we can start by giving you our perspective on open science and why we think it's the preferred model for Allergan.We start with the premise that innovation and investment in R&D is crucial to the success of Allergan. Our mission is to help people live their lives better by finding cures and treatments to unmet medical need. And so therefore, we need to be in the innovation business. When we look at how do we participate in the most efficient, effective way, we believe that open science is the most effective construct for Allergan. We are focused in seven therapeutic areas (and) trying to be leaders in all seven, but to build scale in discovery platforms could be potentially counterproductive for us.When we look at where innovation comes from, and how innovation in health care is best accomplished, we believed it was better to tap into this very vast ecosystem of innovators. These are academic research centers. They're venture-backed startup companies. They're private companies. They're R&D-based public companies, and they're research spinouts out of large pharmaceutical companies and beyond. When we look at the totality of that universe, it's much larger than anything we could ever build on our own.It also provides some additional advantages for us. One is it provides the ability to pursue the best ideas with the best probability of success and the potential to meet the most unmet need, because we're not wedded to internal programs that we have made significant investment to, and we'd have to justify canceling or bypassing in order to chase an idea we believe was better.I think it also creates an attitude difference. We don't have a team of people here who are opposed to going outside for fresh ideas. We don't have a ""not invented here"" syndrome, because we depend on open science to sustain our innovation flow, and so we need to be good at partnering and licensing and acquiring R&D assets, and so we've developed a core capability around it.Now, in order to be a good partner, part of open science means we need to be a development powerhouse and also a commercial powerhouse. Because generally people don't want to give you their ideas unless they have extreme confidence that, one, you can finish them, that you have all the requisite skills in research development, like pharmaceutical science or clinical development or regulatory affairs to get the science to become a drug. And they generally want to take a royalty or milestone payment with regard to commercial success -- so they want to believe that, in your hands, the approved drug can become a commercial success as well.Nicholson: One of our advantages, in that we don't have an internal research organization, is that we don't need to do technology-based collaborations to feed our research. We have collaborations that are exquisitely focused on products within our therapeutic areas.The open-science model for me is collaboration with this huge resource in the external world, the biotech industry. And our open-science model is focused exquisitely on novel, innovative product opportunities within our seven therapeutic areas. And I think that makes us almost unique in the industry.IBD: So when you say you don't have to license technology, are you talking about a platform or a delivery technology or something like that?Nicholson: When I'm talking about technology platforms, I'm talking about very, very fundamental research technology and discovery technology. Clearly, we are interested in technology that can be utilized within development for novel pharmaceutical science technology. For instance, we did a deal with Anterios recently that gave us access to technology that lets us get large molecules across the dermal barrier.Because we don't do discovery research, we don't have to have pure technology-based discovery collaborations. When we have collaborations in the early space, it's because that technology is already delivering development projects.Saunders: If you have deep discovery in platforms and technologies, it can take away some of your flexibility to purse novel or interesting new technologies, because you've made such an investment in that capability. It's almost a fixed investment, if you will.IBD: Since many companies are looking for drugs to acquire or license, how competitive is the scene out there?Saunders: There's some areas where it remains incredibly competitive. A good example is oncology, where there really is an arms race occurring in large pharma to acquire as much technology as possible, particularly as the technology is exploding. You can see that in some of the dealmaking and the price of some of the dealmaking lately in the cancer arena.In the seven therapeutic areas we compete in, there is some competition, but we generally are the 800-pound gorilla in those areas. We pride ourselves in our reputation of being easy to do business with, and being committed to strong and productive partnership skills. That's something that we believe is a competitive advantage, and something we take quite seriously.IBD: The appropriate spending level of R&D is much-debated of late. How do you decide the appropriate level?Saunders: My view on spending R&D dollars is very practical. We will invest in R&D where we believe the investment targets an unmet medical need -- i.e., it's innovative -- that the probability of success meets certain criteria, (and) that we have the capabilities to make it successful.So we, very differently than most of the rest of the industry, don't target our spend based on revenue numbers. We spend against programs that we think make a difference.Nicholson: This is part of our open-science model. Because we don't have the fixed costs that are normally associated with running a discovery organization, we make certain that we have a development powerhouse with a certain proportion of flexible spend. Therefore, we can flex up and down the amount of cash we spend on R&D, depending on what the pipeline needs.IBD: What's your preference as to the stage of development at which you enter into the process with these external programs?Saunders: One of the best-kept secrets about Allergan is that we would enter an agreement or collaboration at any stage of development -- early, mid or late. We've done that quite successfully. The drug we just launched for schizophrenia and bipolar mania, Vraylar -- we entered into that collaboration 14 years ago and really developed that drug from phase one all the way to approval. It was quite complex pharmaceutical science and development.People tend to talk about the R&D that we bring in at a later stage -- because it seems more real, right? It's closer in time. But the reality is, we are very open-minded to entering into those collaborations and R&D-related structures any time in the continuum, so long as it meets the criteria of meaningful innovation, probability of success and (that it) fits within our capabilities.IBD: Of course, the probability of success is more difficult to gauge the earlier it gets. How do you gauge that?Saunders: A lot of times you can manage that through structure. For example, we have a structured deal with a company called Rhythm Health. We really were impressed with the work Rhythm Health was doing with a condition called diabetic gastroparesis. There really hasn't been any meaningful pharmaceutical advances in diabetic gastroparesis in about 30 years.David and the team at Allergan evaluated the science and the work that was being done at Rhythm, and while early, we thought it was incredibly innovative. So we signed an option agreement with Rhythm where they will finish the phase-2b study, which will read out in a few months. If positive, we have the option to bring it into Allergan in phase three and finish the development.We did the same thing with a company called Trevena (TRVN) and an acute heart-failure drug. They reported those results a few weeks ago and the study failed, and therefore we didn't exercise the option.We don't have a one-size-fits-all. We will do a deal at any stage of development depending on the preferences of the partner, and the conviction in the science on our side that makes sense. One of the things that is a hallmark of Allergan is being open and flexible to principles of mutuality. How do you create a win-win for the inventor of an idea and the people who will be responsible to bring it to conclusion? We're always looking for mutuality in all our deals to create that win-win scenario to make everyone feel good and remain constructive and productive around bringing it to fruition.

863,TAP,"Investors have lavished more love on iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA (USMV) than on any other equity ETF so far this year.USMV has seen $5.28 billion in net inflow in 2016, helping assets balloon 82% to $13 billion.Investors in its category sibling, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV), are likely feeling deflated and perhaps even a bit miffed.SPLV has soaked in a relatively modest $1.8 billion during the same period. That's despite gaining 8.4% over the past year vs. 6.7% for USMV.Both are faring far better than SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad U.S. stock market that has tumbled 1.4% in the past year.So why is SPLV proving less popular, as reflected in its in inability to attract more new money?Partly because this exchange traded fund gets knocked by rivals for being little more than a utility fund, says Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at PowerShares.As of the May 20 quarterly rebalance, its weighting in the utilities sector actually went up a further 7.2% to more than 20%. It gained 13 stocks, including utility firms American Water Works (AWK), Entergy (ETR) and Public Service Enterprise (PEG). It also dropped 13 stocks, including T. Rowe Price (TROW) and Pfizer (PFE).SPLV screens for the 100 least volatile stocks in the S&P 500 and gives a bigger weighting to stocks with lower volatility.USMV also offers exposure to U.S. stocks with potentially less risk than the broader market. However, it constrains sector weightings to within a 5% band relative to the parent MSCI USA index.That holds appeal for institutional investors whose mandates and compensations are tied to closely following the benchmarks, according to Kalivas.""Our customers are more nimble advisors"" who are more apt to drift away from the benchmarks, he said.SPLV has no maximum or minimum sector-weight requirements. And that is a good thing, Kalivas argues. For example, the utilities stake in SPLV has varied greatly over the years. It was as high as 32% in 2011, went down to less than 3% in 2015, and is now ""marching back up,"" Kalivas pointed out.Right now, SPLV has no exposure at all to the volatile energy sector.""If a sector comes under stress and has a lot of volatility, you can avoid it (entirely),"" Kalivas said. He cites the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the earlier tech crisis as periods when SPLV's unconstrained methodology ""would have been a big help."" Neither SPLV nor USMV has a 10-year history.Critics point out that SPLV makes big sector bets in the utilities and consumer staples sectors. This ETF tends to get hit hard when sector or interest-rate risk comes into play.

How to take a confident lead:Step firmly. “Any time an organization has new leadership, there can be some tension around that transition,” said Howard Smith. He was named president of the Harlem Globetrotters in January.“My immediate job was to reassure the organization that this was not a turnaround situation,” Smith told IBD.Tout legacy.

To propel the organization into its next decade, Smith identifies “to be” goals and “to do” goals.The first asks: “What kind of organization do we want to be?” The second focuses on: “What do we do to deliver results?”Huddle up. To boost team unity, Smith made the decision to move the company’s employees to a new home office in Atlanta. This required relocating staff from Phoenix, Dallas, Philadelphia and Connecticut.“For the first time in 90 years, everyone is in one home office,” he said.Use tools. Another priority for Smith is tapping social media to connect with fans.The team has generated 280 million social media impressions since December, compared to 80 million over the same period last year. “The engagement with our fans has been tremendous,” he said.Achieve balance.

868,TAP,"The Supreme Court’s ruling last year that same-sex couples can marry nationwide struck many observers as historic. And it directly affected some financial advisors and their clients.For advisors who specialize in serving same-sex couples, the changes have continued since the Supreme Court's decision. From taxes to inheritance issues, the shifting landscape for their clients demands ongoing attention. Monitoring the news has become an especially important part of their job.“I keep up on changing laws that affect gay and unmarried people,” said Ken Waltzer, a certified financial planner in Los Angeles. “I have news feeds that get emailed to me so I can follow the latest developments.”A practicing physician for 15 years, Waltzer launched his financial advisory career in 2004. A few years later, he purchased a financial planning practice from a retiring advisor who is gay and had many gay clients.Today, about one-quarter of his clients are gay. He says that he doesn’t set a specific target for the number of gay clientele in his practice, but he wants to continue to focus on that niche.“I’m straight, but I grew up knowing a lot of gay people because my mother was in show business,” he said. “I’ve found that I enjoy working with same-sex couples and the LGBT (lesbian gay bisexual transgender) community in general.”Waltzer says that his experience as a doctor enhances his ability to counsel people from wide-ranging backgrounds. Over the years, he has learned to listen without judgment and respond with openness.“Sometimes, it’s a fine line between being a financial advisor and being a therapist,” he added. “Whenever people talk about money, it can get very emotional. If you’re going to have gay clients, you have to decide if you like the issues that affect this community, both emotional and financial.”Like Waltzer, Carol Berger came to financial planning as a second career. She spent 15 years as an engineer for an oil company in Texas.During that time, Berger looked for an attorney to help with estate planning for herself and her longtime female partner. She sought someone with experience working with same-sex couples -- and who exhibited empathy and understanding of their needs.“I wanted somebody who would know what to ask,” she recalled. “It’s really about feeling comfortable talking about certain issues.”In 2006, Berger moved to Georgia to become an advisor with a firm. Six years later, she started her own practice.“There weren’t a lot of advisors who were focusing on same-sex couples,” Berger said. “It was a natural thing for me to do.”A certified financial planner in Peachtree City, Ga., Berger says that about half of her clients are gay. But she’s also careful not to turn away straight clients.“I don’t throw it out there (that I advise gays) when I meet with heterosexuals,” she said. “But I don’t hide it either.”When Berger set up her firm in 2012, she joined professional organizations that enabled her to raise her visibility in the LGBT community. For starters, she became a member of the Atlanta Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce.“It wasn’t just for marketing but also to network within the business community,” she said. “I had a limited budget, and I didn’t throw a lot of money at advertising.”Berger earned Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Business Enterprise (LGBTBE) certification from the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce. As a result, she gained access to the Chamber’s diversity programs.“That helped get my name out there and get exposure,” she said.To round out her marketing, Berger also joined the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors and listed herself in its directory as working with “non-traditional couples.” She credits her outreach efforts with driving “a nice, steady growth” in her practice.Berger, 57, finds that estate planning is a major issue for same-sex couples. She notes that many of them assume that the Supreme Court decision on same-sex marriage relieves them of having to confront their tax and estate concerns.“They may not understand all the issues involved,” she said. “With the Supreme Court ruling, things have changed for the better. But they may think, ‘Oh, it’s all going to go to my partner.’ Not necessarily. It’s better to make sure everything is in place and spelled out.”Marketing to the LGBT community requires delicacy. If you push too hard, your efforts can backfire.Chris Harris, a financial advisor in Houston, Tex., estimates that about 25% of his practice is gay. He says that the key to tapping the LGBT niche is to come across as genuine.“I wouldn’t want anyone to target me just because I’m gay,” he said. “I find it a bit annoying when people pander to us on the perceived notion that we have more disposable income.”

872,TAP,"After shoring up its position in the hotly competitive discount arena by acquiring a larger rival last year, Dollar Tree faces the task of turning its newly acquired muscle into bigger sales and profits.If it is to be successful, Dollar Tree (DLTR), now the biggest U.S. discount chain, needs to get a better performance from its Family Dollar Store outlets, which were struggling prior to the merger.Wall Street is tentative on Dollar Tree's prospects.""There are some natural synergies that came out of the deal with regard to buying and some expenses,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Peter Keith told Investor's Business Daily. ""But the jury is still out on whether Dollar Tree can drive material improvement at the Family Dollar business. At this point, I believe what investors will want to see is better sales productivity from Family Dollar stores, which should in turn drive improved operating margins and overall profitability.""Dollar Tree closed on the purchase of Family Dollar Stores July 6 after a heated takeover battle with rival deep discounter Dollar General (DG). It paid $6.8 billion in cash and 28.5 million shares of the company’s stock valued at $2.3 billion.Prior to the merger, Dollar Tree enjoyed a long-running streak of double-digit quarterly profit. The merger has the potential for synergies and productivity gains, and could enable Dollar Tree to serve a broader range of customers, tap new markets and enhance market share in existing ones while enhancing the company’s financial performance and improving its growth prospects, the company said at the time of the buy.“The draw (for investors) is the opportunity the company has to dramatically improve the earnings power of the Family Dollar segment,” Northcoast Research analyst Nicholas Mitchell told IBD.But the integration and turnaround processes present challenges, say followers. While analysts praise Dollar Tree management’s capabilities, opinions are mixed on the extent to which Dollar Tree will achieve its objectives.“I think Dollar Tree is a very successful retailer and they're very good operators,” Stifel analyst Taylor LaBarr told IBD. “But it was a big step acquiring a company that was bigger than they are, with even more employees, more distribution centers and more stores. It is a big acquisition and integration task for any situation, but they’re also trying to fix and turn around a struggling retailer. So we really like the core Dollar Tree business, but it’s going to be a tough integration.”Dollar Tree’s stock price rose 9.7% last year, though it’s been up and down so far this year. Its stock price has also soared 44% since the retailer announced its intent to buy Family Dollar on July 28, 2014.Dollar Tree operated 13,851 stores across 48 states and five Canadian provinces as of Jan. 30. Stores operate under the brands of Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, Dollar Tree Canada and Deals. It expects to have 217 of the 222 Deals stores converted to the Dollar Tree brand and five to Family Dollar brands by July. Dollar Tree converted 52 Deals stores to Dollar Tree stores in January.Dollar Tree operates fixed-price point stores, selling everything for $1 or less, while Family Dollar operates multiprice point stores, selling the majority of its products at $10 or less.Post merger, Dollar Tree faces new rivals.When it acquired Family Dollar, Dollar Tree gained more direct competition with Dollar General, convenience stores, the front end of drug stores, and to some degree giant discounters Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT), says analyst Mitchell.“The acquisition made the business more complicated and levered up the balance sheet,” Mitchell said. “It used to be a very uncomplicated investment story that investors felt comfortable buying with the intention of holding the shares as a core position. These guys were so good at merchandising and real estate site selection that the cash flow could efficiently be reinvested in the business with expectations of earning a high return on the incremental capital.”Mitchell went on to say: “After it acquired Family Dollar, the story went from being a very clean investment story with very good unit economics and a strong competitive advantage to a story that's half the same and the other half a turnaround story. I would imagine that it has probably been a little more challenging than (management) thought it would be at the start, but they are making good progress cleaning up many of the underlying problems they inherited.”On the plus side, Dollar Tree has turned out two straight quarters of positive same-store sales for Family Dollar, which is a nice improvement, Mitchell says. It’s also cleaned up the Family Dollar stores, strengthened the end-of-the-aisle displays and improved the “in-stock” position in these stores, he says.“It’s going to take time to get the consumer back,” he added. “There’s a lot of work ahead that needs to be done. The final verdict on whether this was a smart move will be a function of execution in the next 12 to 18 months.”In the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, which ended Jan. 30, Dollar Tree’s adjusted earnings fell 13% to $1.01 per share. Revenue surged 117% to $5.37 billion, boosted by $2.68 billion in sales from the Family Dollar segment. Family Dollar stores saw a low single-digit rise in same-store sales, driven by growth in both traffic and the average ticket.In a note to clients on Dollar Tree’s fourth-quarter results, UBS analyst Michael Lasser was upbeat about the company's prospects.“After parsing back the one-time items, (Dollar Tree) put together another solid (quarter) that puts it on pace to substantially grow its earnings over time,” he wrote.He notes that the company has now seen growth in same-store sales in each of the last seven months.“Its traffic is accelerating, and improvements are being made,” he added. “This provides a more stable base from which its (same-store sales) can accelerate.”

Cakmak sees Alexa increasingly looking headed toward industry-standard position, the report says, especially with the opening of third-party device interoperability.On Jan. 4, Cakmak had downgraded Amazon from a buy to a neutral rating, citing competitive pressure in 2016.Amazon.com stock was up more than 1%, around 565, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 73, where 99 is the highest. The stock touched a six month low of 474 on Feb. 9, but has since rallied nearly 20% since.Amazon's Alexa is able to hail rides from Uber, play music, set timers, and manipulate smart devices in homes, such as the Nest thermostat from the Google unit of Alphabet (GOOGL), among other functions.On Friday, Capital One Financial (COF) announced that it was adding a ""skill"" -- what Amazon calls features -- to Alexa, that would let its customers interact with their financial information with voice commands.Capital One said in a statement emailed to reporters that their customers can do things like check their credit card balance, and make payments via Alexa.Several Amazon devices offer Alexa: the original Echo speaker, the smaller Echo Dot with a scaled-down speaker, and the Amazon Tap that requires pressing a button before Alexa can respond to requests.Google and Microsoft (MSFT) also offer voice-controlled virtual assistants.Faced with rising competition from Amazon, Wi-Fi streaming speaker maker Sonos is cutting staff and pivoting to work on voice-controlled features, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Sonos is a partner to Apple and other music providers.""We’re fans of what Amazon has done with Alexa and the Echo product line,"" Sonos CEO John MacFarlane said in a blog post Wednesday. ""Voice recognition isn’t new; today it’s nearly ubiquitous with Siri, OK Google and Cortana. But the Echo found a sweet spot in the home and will impact how we navigate music, weather and many, many other things as developers bring new ideas and more content to the Alexa platform.""He called Alexa/Echo the first product ""to really showcase the power of voice control in the home"" and said Sonos will ""invest what’s required"" to bring voice-controlled music experiences into the home and to market ""in a wonderful way.""

874,TAP,"Many ETF investors find themselves in that unhappy place between a rock and a hard place this year. Stalling global growth has seriously crimped stock portfolio returns, while delays to further interest rate hikes are likely to keep bond yields tightly leashed well into 2016.To the rescue come equity and alternative income sources, such as master limited partnerships (MLPs), real estate investment trusts (REITs) and high-dividend stocks. Exchange traded funds investing in these asset classes offer investors a shot at capital appreciation, while their attractive yields pad out portfolio returns.They're especially valuable investing tools for income-focused investors who may be planning for retirement.""When rates remain unusually low for an extended period of time, investors must consider yield-bearing investments other than bonds to bridge the gap between the prevailing rates and their income requirements,” says Jay Jacobs, director of research for Global X Funds, a provider of several ETFs that fall in this category.Click Here To See The Best Performing ETFS Year To Date
"
875,TAP,"Jacobs recently participated in a Schwab ETF OneSource panel on new approaches to income and dividend investing. His firm accounts for several of the best-performing ETFs year to date.Global X SuperDividend US (DIV) is up 2% through March 10 vs. a 2% fall for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY).So what are all the ETF strategies that investors can use to find income beyond bonds? What are their benefits? Just how risky are they?IBD conducted a virtual roundtable with Jacobs and three other ETF investing experts to find out.IBD: Where can ETF investors look for income as bond yields continue to fall short of expectations?Jeff Beeson, product development manager at Invesco PowerShares; $100 billion in assets under management: Fixed-rate preferred securities have performed well amid recent equity market and high yield turmoil.  If rates are stuck at current lows because economic growth is slowing, then preferred securities may continue to deliver high income with more ""bond-like"" returns than alternatives such as high yield and MLPs.Mike Dickson, director of structured financial solutions at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, N.C.; $2.18 billion in AUM: Overall we advocate tilting a portfolio towards more equity-centric allocations to generate income from the larger capital appreciation of the equity markets over time. A well-managed income portfolio should resemble a ""barbell"" investment strategy. Small allocations to low-volatility short-duration bond ETFs should be used to provide liquidity as a spending reserve, while larger equity and alternative allocations should be used to generate capital appreciation and replenish this spending reserve. Breaking down an income portfolio based on volatility in this manner ensures investors can take withdrawals even in down markets without locking in losses and having to sell losing positions.Jay Jacobs, director of research, Global X Funds; $2.7 billion in AUM: The three areas that have historically delivered high yields to investors outside of bonds are REITs, high-dividend stocks and MLPs. Investors are also looking to emerging alternative income spaces, like YieldCos.Robert D. Williams, principal and managing director, Sage Advisory Services; $11.9 billion in AUM: ETF investors can draw from several alternative and equity-oriented options that offer higher levels of income, including preferred stocks, MLPs, and REITs. Additionally, there are many equity-based high-dividend options including more narrowly focused sector ETFs, such as utilities, as well as many more broadly diversified options. Finally, for investors who want to gain exposure across different markets in one vehicle, several multi-asset income ETFs hold a combination of the above-mentioned market segments (as well as fixed-income) in one ETF.IBD: What benefits do alternative income sources bring to a traditional equity-bond portfolio?Beeson: Investors are frustrated with a lack of income in traditional fixed-income. They are looking to alternatives such as dividend equities, high-yield debt, MLPs, bank loans and REITs. While these generally offer higher income than aggregate-type exposure, they can alter the overall risk profile of an allocation. Investors should pay attention to how their alternative income allocation is potentially tilting the scales toward more equity-type risk for portfolios. That's why fixed-rate preferred securities stand out among alternative income sources, with the preferred market's higher correlation to the bond market.Investors may also want to think more tactically about their alternative income allocation, looking to rotate their risk exposures based on their outlooks, needs and tolerances. For example, MLPs have traditionally been a great source of alternative income for investors, but have experienced excess volatility over the last couple of years. A more tactical approach to this space would have potentially rotated in and out of this segment and helped individuals potentially avoid some of this volatility.Dickson: Diversification benefits are the most uncontested benefits offered by alternative income sources. As markets become more globally interconnected and the ETF markets continue to grow, it will become increasingly more difficult to truly diversify the independent risk factors driving portfolio returns. Alternative income sources provide exposure to more obscure areas of the market, which are often driven by independent risk factors that truly offer these elusive diversification benefits.Jacobs: Besides diversification -- exposure to assets that have historically low correlations to stocks and bonds -- alternatives can also potentially offer higher yields because of unique tax incentives.IBD: Which types of equity income and/or alternative income ETFs do you use in your portfolios?Dickson: For equity income exposure, we like ""smart beta"" products such as high-dividend and low-volatility ETFs, and less risky S&P sectors such as utilities and consumer staples. These exposures pay above-average yields and tend to outperform in choppy and flat markets, like we have seen lately. For alternatives, we like REITs and preferred ETFs for their yields, as well as how they play together in a portfolio. Preferred ETFs offer equity exposure but with lower volatility, while the low average correlations of REITs with traditional assets can dampen their equity-like volatility in a portfolio.Williams: The universe of equity and alternative income ETFs that we utilize are broken down into three categories:IBD: Do the risks surrounding MLP, REIT and high-yielding equity ETFs outweigh the tasty income?Beeson: Each of these asset classes is tied to unique considerations, but one consistent theme across all would be the recent correlation to oil and energy markets. If one believes we are poised for a recovery in oil, these asset classes may have room for meaningful recovery. But if oil is destined to bounce along these low levels or even drop further, there may be more pain ahead for these sectors, and investors may be rewarded to wait for a more attractive entry point down the road.Dickson: The risks certainly can, but they don’t have to. This is an area that active management can add a lot of marginal value. Active managers can help partition sources of volatility and minimize unknowingly becoming exposed to risky areas of the market. For example, MLPs suffered horribly over the past year due to the unstable oil market. Active management can monitor risk and hopefully avoid these types of drawdowns as the contagion spreads.Jacobs: Alternatives, like REITs and MLPs, can have more concentrated exposure to a particular sector than a broad equity or bond benchmark. When real estate or energy markets are in a sell-off, it can have a meaningful impact on those investments. It's key for investors to diversify among these alternative income sources, so they're not overexposed to one area.Also, ETFs that target high-dividend stocks can be more broadly diversified by sector than MLPs or REITs, but some strategies do not appropriately diversify risk across individual holdings, meaning they are very top-heavy with high weightings in just a few holdings. We believe that ETFs need to emphasize diversification across high-dividend stocks to mitigate stock-specific risks, while capturing the high yields that they offer.Williams: In certain periods, yes, the risk in these sectors relative to traditional fixed-income options will far outweigh the additional income. Investors must assess the overall purpose of the portfolio, their risk tolerance and ability to withstand negative performance. Understanding the risk or volatility of returns of an asset vs. its income advantage to safer options is a key question.There are periods where the margin of additional income is slimmer and not worth the risk. Consider high spreads or income advantage to Treasuries, for example. After the 2008 crisis, the additional income advantage was over 15%, while entering 2015 this advantage had shrunk to under 5%. For fixed-income oriented investors, adding non-fixed income requires even more caution, considering that volatility of returns in MLPs and REITs can be four to five times that of core fixed income. The drawdown in these sectors in even short periods of a month or a quarter can wipe out several years' worth of income advantage.IBD: What are some equity income and alternative income ETFs that investors may be overlooking?Beeson: PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio (SPHD) has delivered returns far in excess of the S&P 500 and over many large equity income peers during the past two years. SPHD not only looks to high-dividend payers, but also screens out many companies that may appear to pay a nice dividend but are suffering from price instability. That has helped SPHD provide strong returns, high income and low volatility that have really stood out in this more volatile environment.Jacobs: There are interesting value opportunities in high-dividend-yielding stocks, as well as in the midstream MLP space. Both areas are trading at wide spreads to 10-year Treasuries and are at significantly lower valuations than they had in 2014 and 2015.IBD: Is generating income only an issue for the retirement-minded investor?Beeson: In my opinion, no. Income is a crucial component to total returns.  Income can provide a stable backbone of returns for a portfolio, offsetting fluctuations in market prices. Many academic studies have highlighted the importance of dividends to stock market total returns over time, suggesting that dividends have historically played a greater role than price appreciation.Jacobs: During a sideways or declining market, income offers a unique opportunity to serve as a ballast for many portfolios, continuing to provide a potential source of returns. Income strategies, sometimes viewed as a satellite investment, can be a part of a core value-driven investment strategy for long-term investors, not just retirees.IBD: ""Bonds are less risky."" Agree or disagree?Dickson: Disagree. Bonds are less volatile than many assets classes, but volatility is only one measure of risk. For example, we focus on minimizing the likelihood of outliving one's money as a first principle for retirees. Heavy allocations to bonds are very exposed to this risk because bonds usually will not generate the returns necessary to fund inflation-adjusted retirement spending over time. We have found that while equities may have higher volatility, they minimize this risk, along with inflation and interest rate risk, by generating higher expected returns over long horizons and outpacing most desired spend rates.Beeson: The question highlights a notable gap between how institutional and retail investors think about risk. Institutional investors tend to think ""standard deviation,"" in which case bonds tend to be far less risky. But retail investors tend to think ""potential for loss,"" and that's where the picture gets cloudier.Right now, few are worried about interest rates spiking higher, but if we ever enter a scenario of accelerated growth, higher inflation and rising rates, then higher risk, as defined by potential for loss, may shift over to bonds.Retail investors may find a tactical approach to income an appealing option given this heightened sensitivity to absolute rather than relative returns. For example, a more tactical approach may add or remove high-yield debt exposure based on when it may be a more opportune time to own it.Jacobs: While low duration, low (or no) credit risk bonds can be very stable day to day, longer-dated, higher-yielding bonds can have equity-like levels of volatility. There is no ""one-size-fits-all"" assumption for risk when it comes to bonds, equities or alternatives.Williams: From the perspective of stability of returns, larger drawdown risk and overall volatility, core bonds are less risky for investors. The desire for income as a priority in a portfolio implies a more conservative risk tolerance and the desire for some return stability. Given this view, we believe investors should tap into the wide assortment of income options available, but maintain a core of traditional fixed income. Alternative income options can replicate the consistent income of traditional bond allocation, but they cannot replicate the volatility of a core bond portfolio in a bear market.Image provided by Shutterstock.

876,TAP,"Consumer purchases climbed a bit more than anticipated in June, exceeding a gain in incomes that prompted American households to tap into savings.The 0.4% advance in spending followed a similar gain in the previous month, a Commerce Department report showed Tuesday in Washington. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.3% gain in consumption, which accounts for about 70% of the economy. Incomes rose a less-than-projected 0.2%, while the saving rate declined to a more than one-year low.Purchases are broadening out beyond big-ticket items such as cars and houses as more Americans benefit from steady hiring, low inflation and cheap borrowing costs. The June figures underscore momentum heading into the third quarter after household spending grew in the previous three months by the most since 2014.""The consumer is on a solid track,"" said Thomas Simons, senior money-market economist in New York at Jefferies LLC, which correctly projected the spending gain. ""The momentum is going to continue into the third quarter and is fueled by strength in the labor market.""The advance in purchases was led by a rebound in spending on durable goods and more outlays for services.Gross domestic product expanded at a 1.2% annualized rate from April through June, less than projected after a first-quarter gain of 0.8% that was also lower than previously reported, Commerce Department data showed last week. Growth was driven by household purchases, which jumped 4.2%.Projections for June consumer spending ranged from increases of 0.1% to 0.7%. The Bloomberg survey median for incomes called for a rise of 0.3%, after a 0.2% gain in May.Disposable income, or the money left over after taxes, increased 0.1% after adjusting for inflation. It was little changed in the prior month.The saving rate declined to 5.3%, the lowest since March 2015, from 5.5%. Wages and salaries advanced 0.3% following a 0.2% gain.Adjusting consumer spending for inflation, which generates the figures used to calculate GDP, purchases rose 0.3% after a 0.2% increase in the previous month.Among other details, household outlays on services rose 0.3% after adjusting for inflation. The category includes tourism, legal help, health care, and personal care items such as haircuts, and is typically difficult for the government to estimate accurately.Spending on durable goods, which includes automobiles, increased 0.4% after adjusting for inflation. That followed a 0.1% drop. Spending on non-durable goods, which include gasoline, rose 0.3% for a second month.The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation remained contained, the report showed. The price gauge based on the personal consumption expenditures index increased 0.1% from the prior month and was up 0.9% from a year earlier.The core price measure, which excludes food and fuel, increased 0.1% from May and was up 1.6% from June 2015, the same as the prior three months. Inflation hasn't reached the Fed's 2% goal since 2012.

877,TAP,"PayPal Holdings' (PYPL) is expected to report Thursday that its second-quarter profit rose 9%, amid speculation the online payments processor could announce a deal of some sort with Visa (V), which also reports its own fiscal-third-quarter results on Thursday.PayPal's relationship with Visa has been a source of speculation. PayPal, spun off from eBay last year, and the credit card networks are both eyeing mobile payments, where Apple Pay, the mobile wallet of Apple (AAPL), is a rival.PayPal's quarterly profit is expected to grow 9% to 36 cents per share with revenue rising 13% to nearly $2.6 billion, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.""Expectations are low ahead of the Q2 print,"" said Jason Kupferberg, an analyst at Jefferies, in a report. ""We believe the core business continues to perform well and maintain our view that competitive concerns (regarding Apple Pay) are overdone.""IBD'S TAKE: PayPal stock is up about 12% so far in 2016. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup. PayPal could be acquired, some analysts have speculated, though the company has said it's not up for sale.PayPal moved up its earnings call to be the same day as Visa's, due right after Visa's call, RBC Capital analyst Daniel Perlin noted in a report.PayPal's online checkout service has used an automated clearinghouse (ACH) system set up by bank partners. That poses issues for Visa, and PayPal may cooperate more with credit-card companies, says Perlin.He says it's also possible that Visa ""plays hardball"" and imposes new digital wallet fees. PayPal may need to explain the economic impact of whatever happens with Visa, Perlin speculated in the report.PayPal shares rose 1.7% to 40.05 on the stock market today. Visa climbed 0.8%.

880,TAP,"The Obama administration moved Wednesday to crack down on one of the only alternatives to buying an ObamaCare plan in the individual health market.Sales of short-term insurance, for periods of less than a year, have surged in the past few years as relatively young, healthy and middle-class households found they could save a bundle on coverage -- even while paying the individual mandate penalty.Now the Department of Health and Human Services plans to effectively eliminate that alternative to ObamaCare-compliant plans by narrowing the allowable length of short-term coverage to under three months.That seems likely to largely close the door on insurers who saw this lightly regulated segment as an opportunity to make money in the individual market. UnitedHealth (UNH) has sought to tap this opportunity, even as it plans to pull out of almost all of the 35 ObamaCare exchanges where it's operating this year.But UnitedHealth may be more pleased about another Obama administration effort to stabilize the exchange-related markets as insurers are proposing double-digit rate hikes for 2017.HHS said it will revise its risk-adjustment program that’s meant to neutralize the risk that some insurers will rack up losses because they attract higher-cost members, even as others with low-cost members reap profits. By all accounts, the program has done a poor job. As a result, insurers offering broader networks and lower deductibles have taken a financial hit.The risk-adjustment model was based on the experience of the large-group employer market. Yet the ObamaCare exchange market is far different, with a large percentage of customers buying policies for only part of the year and often dropping coverage after running up big bills.UnitedHealth and Aetna (AET) were among the insurers who have complained about short-term customers. On the other hand, Centene (CNC), with typically high-deductible plans and narrow networks, has said it experienced no such issues. Now, HHS says that risk-adjustment will be changed in 2017 to factor in the behavior of partial-year enrollees. Then, in 2018, it will start taking into account prescription drug utilization.In announcing the plan to cut the allowable length of short-term plans to under three months, the Obama administration criticized insurers in that market for engaging in abusive practices.""Some issuers are now offering short-term limited-duration plans to consumers as their primary form of health coverage for periods that last nearly 12 months, allowing them to target only the healthiest consumers while avoiding consumer protections,"" the HHS press release said.Such policies don't have to abide by ObamaCare (Affordable Care Act) rules. As HHS put it: ""They can be priced based on health status ... can discriminate against consumers with pre-existing conditions, and do not have to cover essential health benefits.""To the extent that more attractive short-term policies keep the young and healthy out of the exchange risk pools, rates inside the exchange will be higher, and HHS warned that the problem could grow over time.But the fact that the administration is taking action to stop people who pay the individual mandate penalty from buying plans to their liking also should raise serious questions about ObamaCare. The growth of the short-term insurance market -- by more than 100%, according to a Wall Street Journal report -- is an indication of just how bad a deal many people think they get from ObamaCare.

881,TAP,"Ralph Lauren (RL) tumbled as much as 10% after predicting a plunge in sales this year, showing the challenges facing Chief Executive Officer Stefan Larsson as he tries to turn around the nearly 50-year-old brand. But stock pared lossesLarsson, who unveiled his vision for the company for the first time since taking the reins last year, will eliminate three layers of management, slash jobs and shutter stores as part of his “Way Forward” plan. The restructuring costs will amount to as much as $400 million, the company said on Tuesday. It also will refocus on its three core brands: Ralph Lauren, Polo and Lauren.The New York-based company, facing an industrywide slowdown and an aging customer, is revamping its operations to bolster sagging earnings. Larsson’s plan to reinvigorate Ralph Lauren will generate cost savings of about $180 million to $220 annually, on top of an earlier belt-tightening effort. The CEO’s other challenge is making the brand cool again: He’s drawing on his experience at Old Navy and H&M to speed up the company’s supply chain and connect with younger shoppers.“We see a clear path to tap into the potential and massively to drive brand strength growth and profitable sales growth,” Larsson said during the presentation. “It will take time though.”Ralph Lauren closed down 2.4% to 94.06 on the stock market today. The stock was already down 14% this year through Monday’s close., battered by investor fears that the company is mired in a long-term slump.Ralph Lauren now expects sales to fall by a percentage in the low double digits in fiscal 2017, which ends around March of next year. Analysts had estimated a 4 percent drop on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Clearing out inventory, shutting down stores and trying to wean shoppers off of discounts -- combined with weak customer traffic -- will all conspire to hold down sales this year.The brand has been suffering from sluggish demand at many malls and department stores, such as Macy’s, Hudson’s Bay and Nordstrom. A stronger dollar has also eroded the value of its sales overseas and curtailed spending from European and Asian tourists in North America.Larsson took the helm in November after the company’s namesake founder stepped down as CEO. Since then, the executive has shaken up management and pushed forward with a cost-cutting plan, including a reduction of 5 percent of its workforce. He’s been working to eliminate $125 million in annual costs, remodel stores and reduce its product count to keep inventory low.The plan unveiled on Tuesday goes further, and brings more short-term pain. In addition to the $400 million in restructuring expenses, the company will write off as much as $150 million in inventory that has to be liquidated.The idea is to eventually get prices -- and margins -- back up, said Chen Grazutis, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. The company expects its performance to stabilize in fiscal 2018, before emerging as a smaller, more profitable organization in 2019.“They are willing to take an hit on sales in order to refine their distribution and restore full price sales and margins,” he said.

882,TAP,"General Electric (GE) is the latest U.S. company to weigh options in Iran following the easing of sanctions related to its nuclear program, even as international rivals move more quickly.Prospects for doing business in Iran turned murkier on Tuesday, when Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps test fired more ballistic missiles despite international sanctions on its missile program.Still, top multinational companies want to tap Iran's young, well-educated consumers, and energy firms are especially eager to help Iran develop its vast oil reserves.GE Oil & Gas CEO Lorenzo Simonelli told Bloomberg that he recently traveled to Iran to ""understand what was taking place in the country.""""Iran is a big market from an oil and gas perspective,"" he said. ""We will abide by the sanctions, but it’s a market where we used to transact.""The remarks echo Boeing's (BA) last month, when the aerospace giant received a license from the U.S. government allowing it to ""engage approved airlines to determine their actual fleet requirements.""""We understand that the situation in the region is complicated and ever changing and we will continue to follow the U.S. government’s guidance as it relates to conducting business with Iran,"" Boeing said in a statement.While sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program have been lifted, the U.S. still has other sanctions still in place over issues like terrorism, ballistic missiles and human rights.U.S. companies that sell aircraft and aircraft components can now do so in Iran with permission, however. Foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies also have more flexibility.Outside the U.S., meanwhile, business with Iran has picked up. Airbus (EADSY) inked a deal in January to sell 118 aircraft to Iran Air, as the nation tries to modernize its outdated air fleets.Canada in recent weeks has lifted many of its sanctions on Iran, smoothing the path for Bombardier.

888,TAP,"Donald Trump has reason to be reluctant to release his tax returns. In a New York Times piece about Ben Rhodes, President Obama's deputy national security adviser, Rhodes cynically explains that today's journalism consists of young people whom he flat-out describes as ignorant. ""The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old,"" Rhodes said, ""and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. That's a sea change. They literally know nothing.""What do 27-year-old reporters know about how wealthy big-business people file their taxes? In the real world, moguls like Donald Trump hire accountants and tax attorneys to file what are known as ""aggressive"" returns -- seeking every possible deduction, exclusion, tax break or deferral.Given this, Donald Trump is likely audited nearly every year, with the IRS settling with him on some of these issues, often for less than the IRS initially claimed he owed. If Trump releases his taxes now, the IRS -- to avoid embarrassment or public criticism that they are giving a rich guy a break -- might be reluctant to negotiate down from what they initially argued he owes. Therefore, Trump is likely telling the truth that his attorneys advised him not to release his tax returns until after the audit had been settled.There's another legitimate reason that Trump may be reluctant to release his tax returns: media bias. During the 2012 presidential race, ABC News' Jonathan Karl falsely reported that at 14%, Mitt Romney paid a lower effective federal tax rate -- the percent of your total gross income paid in taxes after all deductions, exemptions and credits are applied -- than a $75,000/year auto mechanic.This would be true only if the mechanic had zero exemptions, deductions, etc. -- which, rich or poor, never happens. The IRS gives you a standard deduction just for breathing. Assume Mr. Auto Mechanic is married, with two children. After offsetting gross income with exemptions, deductions for things like mortgage interest and assorted tax credits, Mr. Mechanic's effective federal income tax rate -- the percentage of income actually paid in taxes -- is much lower than Romney's rate.At that time, the liberal Tax Policy Center reported that 91.4% of individual taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes (AGI) between $50,000 and $100,000 paid less than 15% in taxes. And 43.9% of the $50,000-$100,000 AGI taxpayers paid an effective rate between 5% and 9.99%, while 4.6% of this group paid no federal income tax at all.Also not lost on Trump is how then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., flat-out lied about Romney's taxes on the floor of the Senate. Reid said, ""The word's out that (Romney) hasn't paid any taxes for 10 years.""Later, post-election, Harry Reid admitted he said this without any evidence. Asked whether it was fair or if he had regrets at the lowball tactic, he said, ""Romney didn't win, did he?"" His admission generated no condemnation -- not even fake condemnation -- from fellow Democrats. The blatant lie does not seem to have affected his reputation or stature. Bygones were bygones. The end justified the means.Republicans seem to have learned little about how dirty the Democrats play. Mitt Romney, having been victimized by Reid, even used a Reid-like tactic to criticize Trump. About Trump's refusal to release his tax returns, Romney said, ""It is disqualifying for a modern-day presidential nominee to refuse to release tax returns to the voters,"" and suggested Trump was hiding a ""bombshell."" With Republican friends like these ...And then there's the usual selective outrage. No law requires a presidential candidate to disclose his tax returns, although it is certainly true that all recent presidents have done so. Similarly, there is no law that requires a candidate to release his grades or test scores. Most have done so or had them disclosed by the media. In Obama's case, it's now seven years into his presidency, and he's not turned over his grades and test scores, nor has the media demand that he do so. In fact, the media long ago lost interest in the matter.Warren Buffett is not running for president. But in making the case for higher taxes, he claims to pay a lower tax rate than does his secretary. He has never released his returns or those of his secretary to verify this assertion or to allow for an examination as to why he pays a lower rate -- assuming he does.For all these reasons, Trump drags his feet on releasing his tax returns. Eventually, media pressure and criticism will force him to do so.When he releases them, no matter what percentage he pays or the amount he pays, rest assured he will be accused of ""not paying his fair share."" As Trump puts it, ""That I can tell you.""

890,TAP,"Here is your Investing Action Plan for Wednesday: what you need to know as an investor.Quarterly results for Michael Kors (KORS) and Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) are on tap for Wednesday, following a string of depressing results out of the retail sector.Will the Federal Reserve rates soon? May U.S. auto sales from General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and others, the May ISM manufacturing index and the Fed's own beige book will offers strong clues.Many apparel and accessories retailers this year have been shaken due to competitive discounting, a warmer winter and a colder spring, and lackluster trends. Michael Kors, which sells luxury clothing and accessories like handbags and watches, has been no exception, and Nordstrom (JWN) is reportedly purging its inventory of Michael Kors bags.But Wall Street expects the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share to rise 6.6% to 96 cents on sales up 6.2% to $1.147 billion.Michael Kors' shares plunged below their 200-day line this month after dire sales and profit forecasts from Macy's (M), which cited poor demand in handbags. Fossil (FOSL), which makes some of the watches that appear on Kors' shelves, also reported ""a malaise in watches"" as wearable technology like the Apple (AAPL) Watch becomes more popular.Some analysts, however, remain upbeat. Jefferies this month said Kors has strengthened its brand internationally and could get a lift from spring trends and reduced promotions. Weaker demand out of China could also expand the cattle supply, Jefferies noted, potentially meaning cheaper hide prices and cheaper leather costs for handbags.Shares were up Tuesday by 2.2% to 42.72.Analysts expect discounter Ollie's Bargain Outlet's first-quarter EPS to come in at 17 cents on sales of $190.44 million.The stock, which came public in July, broke out of a cup-with-handle base in March, then climbed into profit-taking territory in April before heading back down.Ollie's has a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. Shares ended Tuesday down 2.1% to 25.07.Ford, General Motors and other big automakers are set to report auto-sales data for May.The reports come amid concerns that auto sales may be soon approaching their peak. Analysts have also grown more worried about a potential auto-loan bubble.WardsAuto expects an annualized rate of 17.3 million units, down from 17.4 million in April, while a J.D. Power and LMC Automotive forecast puts May sales at 17.4 million.Experian this month said open auto loans climbed past $1 trillion in the first quarter and said auto lenders should ""keep a close eye on delinquency trends to ensure the market remains healthy,” even though delinquencies were low compared to before the recession.S&P Global ratings last week also cited ""increasing risk in the market that packages and sells low-rated auto loans."" Ford edged down by 4 cents to 13.49 Tuesday while GM lost 0.4% to 31.28.The ISM is set to release its manufacturing index for May. The index, a measure of strength in manufacturing, fell to 50.8 in April from a 51.8 reading in March. Analysts expect it to dip to 50.6 in May.Still, that would mark the third straight month of expansion. A reading of 50 or above signifies manufacturing growth.Manufacturers cited in the ISM's April report suggested lukewarm economic conditions, with more stable prices for oil and other commodities helping.The Federal Reserve releases its beige book report on U.S. economic conditions. In April, the report indicated stronger wage growth and gains in customer spending.On Tuesday, the Commerce Department backed that view, reporting that April personal spending surged 1% vs. March, the fastest pace in nearly seven years. Personal incomes rose 0.4%.The Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed a 1.1% yearly gain in prices, up from March's 0.8% uptick.

891,TAP,"Diversified ETFs paying robust dividends often provide a refuge to investors rocked by choppy markets. Some of the highest dividend payers, however, offer far less safety and require far more caution.Five nonleveraged ETFs with decent trading volume offer yields of 10% or more. These funds tap into high-dividend companies in the energy, mining and real estate sectors. That makes them sensitive to the outlook for commodities, interest rates and the economy itself.Still, these exchange traded funds can play a key portfolio role. Their dividend payouts offer attractive equity income to retirees and others. They also significantly shore up the funds' total returns.They're worth a look now by income investors, because some are showing signs of strength as they come off multiyear lows.Some of the yield is baked into MLPs' structure: They must pass at least 90% of their income to their investors.AMLP has an annual yield of 9.73%. Its distributions are paid out quarterly.MLPs also enhance portfolio diversification. They're loosely correlated to other income-oriented asset classes, according to investment research firm Morningstar Inc.On the flip side, this ETF's unusual corporate structure has dented performance. AMLP has lagged its benchmark by roughly an average annual 3% since inception. Its top three holdings are Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) and Magellan Midstream Partners (MMP).As midstream businesses, MLPs are more insulated from crumbling commodity prices. They're not, however, entirely immune to a deep slump in the energy sector.

892,TAP,"Quarterly earnings once again took center stage, as stocks held solid gains into the close Friday, extending the major market indexes' win streak for a fourth straight week. All eyes will be on Dow components Apple (AAPL), Caterpillar (CAT) and McDonald's (MCD), which report Tuesday.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each rose 0.5%, while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3%. Volume dipped slightly across the board vs. Thursday, according to preliminary data. For the week, the Nasdaq was the winner with a 1.4% gain; the S&P 500 and Dow climbed 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.Alcoholic beverage, transportation and software makers led the upside in today's stock market action, while shoe and apparel makers, homebuilders and oil stocks lagged. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures slid 1.2% to $44.23 per barrel.Boston Beer (SAM) scored the biggest gain in the alcoholic beverage group with a 15% spike in massive trade. The stock reclaimed its 200-day moving average for the first time in nearly nine months after the maker of Samuel Adams and Twisted Tea issued a strong Q2 report.Starbucks (SBUX), which fell late Thursday after its fiscal Q3 revenue missed views, recovered with a 0.5% gain Friday in robust trade. Goldman Sachs lowered its price target on the coffee giant to 69 from 73.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) jumped 6% in fast turnover to close well above its 50-day line.

893,TAP,"Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena was the worst performer in European regulators' stress tests, the only lender to have its capital wiped out in the exam, as the region struggles to contain an Italian banking crisis.Monte Paschi's common equity tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of its resilience, dropped to a negative 2.2% in the adverse economic scenario, according to the results of the test, which put lenders through a simulation of a severe recession over three years. UniCredit SpA's ratio fell to 7.1%, as measured under fully-loaded capital rules, the second-worst result of the five Italian lenders being examined.While the exam of 51 lenders is breaking with past practice by having no pass/fail mark, it's intended to give supervisors across the European Union a common basis for measuring and bolstering lenders' financial resilience. The test has taken on additional importance as the Italian government weighs methods to shore up Monte Paschi, and the capital shortfall identified in the test may open the door to public support.""The EBA's stress test is not a pass or fail exercise,"" Andrea Enria, chairman of the EBA, said in a statement releasing the results Friday. ""Whilst we recognize the extensive capital raising done so far, this is not a clean bill of health. There remains work to do.""Allied Irish Banks, the second-poorest performer in the adverse scenario, had a CET1 ratio of 4.31%. Deutsche Bank's (DB) ratio fell 3.32 percentage points to 7.8% through 2018 from its starting point under the adverse scenario. More than three-quarters of the 51 lenders maintained a CET1 ratio of more than 8% in the exam.The legal minimum for all banks is a CET1 ratio of 4.5%. Regulators also ask banks to hold another 3.5% of risk-weighted assets in subordinated debt, as well as a series of buffers, which are made up of common equity. On top of that, supervisors add additional requirements for each lender, while banks deemed systemically important must have an extra cushion of capital to help absorb the damage their failure would cause.The European Central Bank, which supervises 37 of the lenders in the test, has said it will use a 5.5% ratio in the stressed scenario as an informal benchmark for lenders' resilience. The final requirement set will move up or down from that level to take account of banks' individual business models.The adverse scenario applies shocks to economic output, interest rates and exchange rates, as well as plunging real estate prices. Analysts have questioned the reliability of the exam because the scenario doesn't include flat or negative interest rates, the U.K. decision to leave the EU, and doesn't include any lenders from Portugal or Greece.Monte Paschi Friday approved a plan to tap investors for the third time in two years by selling stock to replenish capital, according to a board member. While Monte Paschi is seeking to raise funds through private means, Italy has held talks with the European Commission seeking approval to back the bank's recapitalization with state funds.Italy's lenders are saddled with about 360 billion euros ($402 billion) of non-performing loans, a legacy of years of economic stagnation. Unlike Spain's bailout in 2012, the Italian authorities didn't force banks to resolve the situation. The ECB has now taken over supervision of the country's biggest lenders and its demands for action have helped bring matters to a head.

894,TAP,"Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) first better-burger location, called Tasty Made, will apply its focus on higher-quality ingredients and menu minimalism to the ultracompetitive burger business.The menu for Tasty Made, which will open in Lancaster, Ohio, this fall, will consist only of burgers, fries and milkshakes made from ""high quality ingredients that are grown and raised with respect for the animals, the land, and the farmers who produce them,"" according to company statement.""Early fast food burger restaurants generally had focused menus,"" Steve Ells, Chipotle's co-CEO, said in the statement.""We think there's great strength in that original fast food model and wanted to create a restaurant built around that,"" he added. ""Making only burgers, fries and shakes with really great ingredients, we think we can appeal to peoples' timeless love of burgers, but in a way that is consistent with our long-term vision.""But the opening, and Chipotle's attempts to diversify and tap better-burger nostalgia, would come amid heavy competition among burger chains. Traditional fast-food giants like McDonald's (MCD) and Restaurant Brands International's (QSR) Burger King are likely to compete on value, while better-burger rivals like Shake Shack (SHAK), Habit Restaurants (HABT) and In-N-Out are trying to compete more on quality.Shares of Chipotle finished trading up 1.1% to 430.55 on the stock market today. McDonald's shaved off 6 cents to 119.42, Restaurant Brands rose 1.9% to 44.67, Shake Shack lost 0.3% to 40.22 and Habit climbed 1.9% to 16.44.IBD'S TAKE: While parts of the restaurant sector struggled during the second quarter, companies that have more focus on digital ordering -- like Domino's Pizza, Papa John's and GrubHub -- are up. Compare and contrast restaurant stocks at IBD's Stock Checkup. Reports of Chipotle's interest in opening a burger restaurants first surfaced several months ago. The company has also opened an Asian restaurant and backed a fast-casual pizza restaurant.But sales in the restaurant sector overall also appeared to slow during the second quarter due to aggressive value offerings and consumers' economic uncertainty.Chipotle's plans also come as the company tries to revive sales and customer sentiment following a foodborne-illness outbreak last year. The chain's second-quarter results showed struggles on that front, but its limited-time loyalty program, Chiptopia, has provided some relief on that front.Expanding its menu has also helped. Chipotle recently added chorizo to its menu in some restaurants, with plans to bring the item to all Chipotle locations by the end of the year.Ells noted during the company's earnings call last week that such a move was ""unusual"" for a chain that has kept its menu simple.""But we have never ruled out additions or changes to the menu, and chorizo is one of the few changes that we have made to the menu in 23 years,"" he said then.

895,TAP,"Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) reported the lowest quarterly earnings in 11 years and missed estimates by more than $1 billion as a mix of lower energy prices, weaker refining margins and production halts weighed on Europe's largest oil company.Profit adjusted for one-time items and inventory changes sank 72% from a year earlier to $1.05 billion, The Hague-based Shell said Thursday. Analysts had expected a $2.16 billion result.Chief Executive Officer Ben Van Beurden, who this year completed Shell's record purchase of BG Group, has vowed to boost savings from the acquisition following a two-year slump in crude. While Brent's 25% rebound last quarter provided some prospect of relief, the rally is now fading while the safety net provided by refining has given way. Production shutdowns in Nigeria, Canada and the Netherlands increased the pain for Shell.""This is a very big surprise from Shell,"" said Brendan Warn, a managing director at BMO Capital Markets in London. ""Things are not looking up in the third quarter either, with weakness in the industry's refining environment and Shell's oil production still under pressure.""""Lower oil prices continue to be a significant challenge across the business, particularly in the upstream,"" Van Beurden said in a statement. Second-quarter production was 3.51 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, compared with analyst estimates for 3.63 million.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Royal Dutch Shell and rivals like Chevron had entered buy range as oil prices rallied but are now below their entry points amid the recent sell off in crude.Shell's earnings miss is among the biggest in the industry this quarter. BP (BP) fell short by 12% on Tuesday, while Total (TOT) beat estimates by 31% on Thursday. Statoil (STO) reported a loss compared with a projected profit, but the surprise wasn't comparable in size to Shell's. Exxon Mobil (XOM) Corp., the largest oil company by market value, and Chevron (CVX) will announce results Friday.Estimates on Shell's website show the company missed expectations at each of its three main units -- upstream, which includes oil and gas production; downstream, including refining; and integrated gas, which houses its liquefied natural gas business.The upstream loss widened to $1.3 billion in the quarter from $469 million a year earlier. Profit from downstream tumbled 39% to $1.8 billion while earnings from integrated gas fell 38%.Shell plans $29 billion of capital expenditure this year and $25 billion to $30 billion a year through 2020. Van Beurden has said the company has the option to cut spending further and defer more projects if oil prices stay below $50 a barrel. Brent traded below $44 on Thursday. The benchmark crude averaged $47.03 in the second quarter, $63.50 a year earlier and $35.21 in the first quarter of this year.Shell completed the acquisition of BG for $54 billion on Feb. 15. The purchase gave it a 20% share of the global LNG market with production facilities from Australia to the U.S., as well as high-margin oil fields in Brazil. Van Beurden said last month that synergies from the deal will provide $4.5 billion in savings in 2018, up from an earlier estimate of $3.5 billion.The biggest oil producers also run refineries, which have benefited from low crude prices over the past two years, helping to buoy earnings as income from exploration and production dwindled. Global refining margins averaged $13.80 a barrel in the quarter through June, according to BP, yet they're now $10.70 as demand growth slows and inventories build.At the same time, crude's rebound has sputtered. Production shuttered by wildfires in Canada and by militant attacks in Nigeria is returning, and shale drillers in the U.S. are bringing back some rigs. While there's consensus among analysts that the worst of the oil glut is over, the International Energy Agency cautioned this month that ""the road ahead is far from smooth.""Related Stories:

902,TAP,"British statesman Winston Churchill never watched YouTube, nor was he a financial analyst. But Churchill’s quote that Russia “is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma” fits YouTube, the video website owned by Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google.Ad-supported YouTube is a revenue juggernaut. Some analysts estimate sales will swell 30% to 40% in 2016, to about $9 billion.But is YouTube profitable? Google has never said. Nor does it disclose viewership data or other financial metrics beyond a few broad statements.“There’s substantial uncertainty, particularly over the profit levels at YouTube, whether it’s break-even or if they're doing modest operating margins,"" RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney told IBD. “They have a lot of content royalty costs, massive bandwidth costs, storage costs, processing costs.""My guess is that with YouTube’s scale, they’re reasonably profitable, like double-digit margins, but there’s no way of knowing,” Mahaney said. He thinks investors crave a “clean look” at YouTube’s financials.Bank of America Merrill Lynch last year valued YouTube at $70 billion or more. That would be more than 40 times the $1.65 billion that Google paid for YouTube in 2006. BofA predicted YouTube's revenue will hit $13 billion in 2017.Its 1-billion-plus users and massive video library buoy Wall Street analysts' faith. They could place YouTube in a sweet spot to capture TV advertising dollars, as they shift to online video from broadcast networks and cable.But YouTube faces unprecedented challenges, as online video's burgeoning growth emboldens mighty competitors. Think Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX), among others.Broadcasters snipe at the quality of YouTube's videos, aiming to hold on to TV advertising. Competing in subscription-based services vs. the likes of Netflix and Hulu would take big content investments. Not knowing YouTube's costs, margins or growth history will make it hard to gauge how it's meeting the challenges -- and the potential for a blow to its value to Alphabet, whose overall market capitalization approaches $500 billion. Alphabet stock closed Friday at 747.60, up 1.5%.Costs already are rising. YouTube pays partners that generate traffic for YouTube. A popular site for music videos, YouTube is also renewing its agreements with major record labels. The Recording Industry Association of America in March charged that YouTube pays much lower royalties than Apple (AAPL) Music and Spotify.Observers speculate Google has sought streaming rights to on-demand TV shows and movies to bolster YouTube Red, its new subscription service. Some media reports suggest Google could go a step further and buy rights to live TV channels, making it a more direct foe of pay TV providers such as Comcast (CMCSA), AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ). Google is usually mentioned when broadcasting rights to major sports are up for grabs.So far, though, this has all proved to be mostly idle speculation. Analysts say Google has not been bidding aggressively to win streaming rights. It's not clear whether YouTube, long the top video site overall in unique visitors, aims to be the No. 1 aggregator of all video, says Joel Espelien, an analyst at the Diffusion Group, a video-focused research firm.""YouTube's DNA is in free video with ads, and that's difficult to change,"" Espelien said. ""But also they don't want to be thought of as the cat video guys. They want the YouTube brand in a mass-market context. So they experiment buying rights.""But subscription VOD/premium video is different (than free). It's hit-driven. There's no HBO without 'Game of Thrones.' I'm not sure YouTube can monetize rights. There are questions over recouping content investments. If YouTube bought (live) NFL rights, they could lose their shirt.""It is, however, getting more aggressive with original content. YouTube plans to release 15 to 20 original series and movies this year. But its originals are not big-budget shows like Netflix’s “House of Cards.” YouTube’s originals are mostly spun off from a roster of young stars who have found an audience with their free videos on YouTube.YouTube has focused on developing online personalities such as video game player PewDiePie, music video specialist Smosh and style guru Michelle Phan. Driving much of the traffic to YouTube, analysts say, are multichannel networks such as Fullscreen, Maker Studios, SonyBMG and Whistle Sports. Google has bought stakes in multichannel networks such as Vevo and Machinima, analysts say, to ensure their content stays on its website.“One day YouTube will be as large as -- if not larger than -- most, if not all, legacy media companies,” Bernstein Research analyst Carlos Kirjner said in a research report. “It is playing a central role in the secular shift of brand advertising budgets to the Internet. Yet, we know ridiculously little about YouTube.”All the estimates by research firms and analysts, says Kirjner, are ""based more on belief and anecdotes than on truly representative data. What's more -- beyond anecdotes either shared by Google or collected through discussions with ad buyers, creators and multichannel network operators -- we know very little about what is available on YouTube, what people watch and how much it gets watched.""The lack of transparency is unlikely to change, says Espelien. While Wall Street craves granular data, it's not in Google's interest to say much, he says. Content providers and advertisers get ""little snippets"" of information from YouTube, but not most of the data YouTube collects.""There's information asymmetry,"" Espelien said. ""It's an advantage for them. Wall Street tries to model businesses and make forecasts, but that doesn't mesh with tech companies trying to preserve an edge.""Google's broad message? YouTube is doing well. As Google CEO Sundar Pichai put it on Alphabet's Q1 earnings conference call: “YouTube still has incredible momentum, and we continue to invest heavily here.""The company does say YouTube has over 1 billion active monthly users, who watch hundreds of millions of hours of video each day, and that 80% of viewership is outside the U.S.Google also hasn’t said how many subscribers it's attracted to its ad-free, $10-per-month YouTube Red service. Google has launched a new 99-cent, three-month offer for YouTube Red -- possibly a sign it's not gaining traction.At an advertising gala in May, Google said YouTube now reaches more 18- to 49-year-olds on mobile devices than any network, including broadcast or cable. But it hasn't disclosed anything about what content they’re watching.What is certain is that Facebook and Amazon -- which offers its video streaming as one service in its Amazon Prime customer-loyalty package -- are taking aim at YouTube, as are Snapchat and Twitter (TWTR).Facebook and Twitter, via its Periscope service, are beefing up their live streaming, as YouTube does the same. YouTube in April began supporting 360-degree live streaming on its service.In early May, Amazon announced a new service initially designed for ""professional video producers."" Launch partners include media firm Conde Nast, the ""How Stuff Works"" website and Samuel Goldwyn Films. Amazon Video Direct could compete for the young creative talent attracted to YouTube. As does YouTube, Amazon offers revenue-sharing and royalties for content that attracts a certain level of traffic. YouTube has doled out bonuses to keep its top creative stars from defecting to Facebook or others. And holding on to popular multichannel networks such as Machinima, says Espelien, remains key. For now, YouTube's biggest threat is Facebook, says Mahaney. Facebook has hinted at creating a dedicated video service that would get prominent play on its social networking website. But even Facebook and Amazon can't easily match YouTube's scale, Mahaney says.""It's a long-term build for Amazon,"" Mahaney said. ""YouTube already has a billion people who go to it on a monthly basis. It's hard to see anyone matching them.""Facebook has users, too, but it's not purely entertainment, like YouTube.""Moreover, YouTube is best-positioned among rivals to tap into TV advertising budgets, some analysts say. That's because Google has worked to provide improved audience measurement tools.“Google is increasingly speaking a common language with TV advertisers on metrics that should drive increased share shift from TV to YouTube,” said Nomura analyst Anthony DiClemente in a research report.Interpublic Group (IPG), the huge global ad firm, in April said it would shift $250 million in TV spending to YouTube. Toyota (TM) will increase its ad spending by 400% in 2016, YouTube says.In early May, YouTube said it would launch a new product that lets big brands automatically buy ads for the site's hottest viral videos.The new offering is an offshoot from Google Preferred, which enables agencies to reserve spots among YouTube's most popular channels. YouTube ad rates are higher for Preferred than its usual rates, says Espelien.""Along with Hulu, Preferred has the best pitch to TV buyers of any pure-play digital platform,"" said Daniel Salmon, analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Hulu is a joint venture of Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Comcast.

903,TAP,"After an hour of talking about refranchising and earnings accretion, Jack In The Box (JACK) said Wednesday it will try to become a higher-end burger chain by tapping into two parallel trends that have developed over the last 20 years.The first: the evolution in diners' preferences away from deep-frozen chicken patties with abstract shapes to fresher, better-tasting fast-food items. The second: a shift within popular culture from cheeky to earnest.When Jack Box, the burger chain's balloon-headed, wise-cracking mascot, was created in 1995, the company was trying to tap into a pop culture then defined by ironic, adversarial posturing. But the company suggested Wednesday at its 2016 investor day that the irony once employed in some of its advertising -- the very device that makes many ads seem pointless, too clever, or halfheartedly mean to many older consumers -- no longer jibes with the culture or the chain's more recent focus on quality.""As we started to really shift the quality of our product and the service that we provide to our customers, it was no longer the right way for us to communicate our brand by letting humor dominate the messaging around our food,"" Richard Cran, vice president, marketing communications, said at the conference.""When Jack was created, the No. 1 reigning sitcom ... was 'Seinfeld,' "" Cran added. ""If you think back to how the finale of 'Seinfeld' ended, it ended with the four friends being put in jail for basically just being unpleasant people -- a little bitter, a little bit too sarcastic. And at times, Jack shifted toward that part of his persona too much.""A slide from the company's investor presentation further detailed the cultural changes. Pop culture, Jack In The Box said, had moved from being ""disenfranchised"" to ""empowered,"" from ""sarcasm"" to ""optimism"", or, say, from ""Pulp Fiction"" to ""The Hunger Games.""So after years of ads in which Jack Box materialized in stoners' dark, TV-lit basements offering food that either cured or helped them explore their loneliness, viewers might now be more likely to see the mascot embark on a what the company called a ""heroic but silent quest for better ingredients and better burgers.""Fast food's flight to quality comes even as the cheap, commodity-induced discounts that have also characterized the industry show no signs of easing. But Frances Allen, Jack In The Box's brand president, said the company's opportunity ""is not to stay in the very value-driven QSR space,"" referring to quick-service restaurants.And she said the company's goal, by 2020, was to move beyond QSR to become a ""top QSR-plus burger destination,"" referring quick-service restaurants branded as higher quality like In-N-Out and Chick-fil-A but aren't as high-quality as fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).Those ambitions could raise more questions about whether Jack In The Box might spin off Qdoba Mexican Eats, the fast-casual chain that the company acquired in 2003. Jack In The Box at the conference said it had a ""firm commitment"" to growing Qdoba but that it could consider alternatives if those plans didn't work out.Offering up a specific deadline by which to make that decision would be ""extremely irresponsible"" and distracting to leadership, the company said.Jack In The Box jumped 5.5% in the stock market today to 83.39. McDonald's (MCD), which held its annual shareholder meeting Thursday, inched up 0.4% to 123.79. Chipotle lost 1.3% to 452.03.

905,TAP,"Xilinx (XLNX) stock rocketed near the close Tuesday on a rumored $15 billion takeout offer, but Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri says Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) -- often cited as a potential Xilinx buyer -- would be better off targeting NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).Street Insider first reported the rumor of the offer, citing sources familiar with the matter, but didn't identify the bidder. Xilinx stock shot up 5.7% near the close Tuesday and was up a fraction in after-hours trading.Arcuri retained his outperform rating and 60 price target on Qualcomm stock. Earlier Tuesday, MKM analyst Ian Ing reiterated his view that Broadcom (AVGO) and Qualcomm are potential Xilinx suitors.But Arcuri says Xilinx wouldn't ""move the needle"" for Qualcomm, which may not be completely committed to the data center path. Xilinx's field programmable gate array (FPGA) chips are ideal for data center acceleration, Ing wrote in a research report.""In some ways, Xilinx would clearly accelerate Qualcomm's data center initiatives, but we wouldn't view a Qualcomm/Xilinx deal all that favorably for Qualcomm and would much rather see it buy an asset like NXP,"" Arcuri wrote in a research report. ""This would simply be a huge amount of money to spend for a deal that isn't transformational.""Acquiring NXP would allow Qualcomm to tap into offshore cash, which wouldn't be possible in the case of Xilinx, Arcuri noted. And as Xilinx suits up for a FPGA battle against Intel (INTC), it's planning on spending a lot of dough.""If we were Qualcomm, this factor argues it is better off to wait,"" he wrote.Still, Xilinx is the singular merchant FPGA player following Intel's $16.7 billion acquisition of rival Altera late last year, William Blair analyst Anil Doradla noted earlier Tuesday.The rumored takeout bid follows Xilinx's late Monday analyst day. But Doradla wasn't too impressed, saying the event ""lacked confidence."" Xilinx is focusing on cloud computing, embedded vision, industrial Internet of Things and 5G markets rather than its bread-and-butter wireless and wireline markets.

908,TAP,"Clever advances start with the inkling of an idea. How developers break gizmo ground:See possibilities. A little observation led Augment CEO Jean-Francois Chianetta to a big leap.He was shopping online and reading reviews that described a product as the biggest of its type.“With photos, you couldn’t really see that,” Chianetta told IBD.The mechanical engineer came up with a solution: “The first application with which you could visualize 3D models in the real world,” he said.Step forward. Termed augmented reality, Chianetta’s technology lets users superimpose 3D images over real-world settings via smartphones and tablets.Say a sales representative wants to show a retail client how a display case will look in his store.That rep can aim an iPad at the wall in question -- as if taking a photo -- and superimpose a 3D image of the display case onto the screen.Make it real. Client L’Oreal Professional, the beauty firm, uses the tool to help retailers eliminate guesswork when choosing point-of-sale displays.“You can also use it for design,” Chianetta said. “Before building the first prototype, you can show it to customers before it’s even manufactured.”Expand capabilities. Augment app users keep finding ways to tap the technology. Denture makers demonstrate how new teeth will look. A teacher used a 3D model of a molecule to quiz students.“For me from the start, I thought it could be used potentially by everyone,” Chianetta said. “I’m still surprised by some of the user cases.”Address a need. ChargeItSpot CEO Douglas Baldasare was on vacation in Miami with friends when he ran into a typical 21st century problem.“All of our phones were dying,” he said, and he saw they were surrounded by retail shops.“I thought: Why can’t I walk in there and charge my phone?” Baldasare said.Make it pay. While finishing his MBA at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Baldasare developed ChargeItSpot kiosks. They let shoppers charge smartphones in secure drawers.The upshot for retail clients, including Urban Outfitters (URBN), Nordstrom (JWN) and Whole Foods Market (WFM): Shoppers browse and buy while their phones charge.A study by market research firm GfK reported that shoppers using ChargeItSpot kiosks stayed twice as long in the store, “and they spent 29% more dollars,” Baldasare said.Spot weaknesses. Troubleshooting problems -- including a procedure for opening a drawer remotely when a customer forgets the security code -- was essential for getting retailers buy in.“The last thing they want is to have to manage the device,” Baldasare said.Enrich it. Retailers do want ChargeItSpot kiosks to look like they belong, so they’re wrapped in brand-specific colors and messaging.The kiosks also allow for opt-in collection of shoppers’ email addresses and mobile phone numbers, plus an option to deliver messages on store deals.“We’re looking at this as an engagement platform,” Baldasare said.Achieve finesse. “It takes a long time to get to simple.” That’s one refrain from Dana Oliver’s book “Mantra Design.”Achieving a user-friendly experience is worth the extra effort.“Trust me when I say no one wants to struggle with the application of a new technology, although customers will tolerate it momentarily if it offers them a capability they don’t presently have access to,” Oliver wrote.Rush to market with a clunky approach, and competitors will find a way to repackage it and beat you. Image provided by Shutterstock.

909,TAP,"India's benchmark Sensex index soared 7.1%  last week, its best weekly gain since 2011. But despite the world's fastest-growing big economy, the country's stock market is a global laggard as hopes for big structural reforms fade.Among U.S.-listed Indian companies, ICICI Bank (IBN) vaulted 23% for the week ended March 4, Tata Motors (TTM) jumped 15%, and Infosys (INFY) and HDFC Bank (HDB) advanced 9% each.Such bullishness would seem to fit the picture of a shining Indian economy. GDP growth is running at a 7% clip, and the central bank is cutting interest rates as cheaper oil imports lower inflation. Corporate earnings, at least until recently, were expected to show double-digit earnings gains for 2016.But here's a reality check: The Sensex is still close to bearish levels, 15% below its year-ago high. It hasn't had a consistent two-week advance since December. Last Tuesday's 3.4% jump was the index's best one-day advance since September 2013.In fact, ""Dalal Street"" -- local shorthand for the Bombay Stock Exchange and India's overall financial system -- belies U.S. investors' hopes. Indian markets lag not only most developed world markets this year, but also several emerging markets, many of which are in recession.""The equity markets are playing catch-up to the macro story"" in India, said Tushar Yadava, an investment strategist at BlackRock iShares. They were, he noted, priced for an immediate turnaround after the 2014 election of pro-business Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India was one of the stronger performing markets in 2014.The hoped-for reforms have proved as illusory as the great Indian rope trick.Land-acquisition measures stalled in the legislature. So did efforts to revamp byzantine taxes at the national and local level. The latest budget does much to appease the rural vote and ensure long-term stability, but few pro-growth structural reforms.Modi's aggressive agenda has been set back by a couple of political defeats, market watchers say.""Change is harder to implement than many had thought,"" Yadava said.IShares MSCI India (INDA), the largest exchange traded fund investing in Indian stocks, has tumbled 6% year to date. The $3.21 billion ETF covers the top 85% of the Indian stock market by market cap.By comparison, iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) is little changed. This bellwether exchange traded fund has an 8% weighting in India but also allocates to Brazil, Mexico, Russia and China, among other countries.The Indian stock market is among the more volatile in the emerging markets space, writes Patricia Oey, an analyst for Morningstar Inc.""India has a heavy dependence on foreign fund flows for investment and growth,"" Oey said in a 2015 report. ""When markets are in a risk-off mode, or when investors become concerned about a potential stall in economic reforms or a deterioration in macroeconomic fundamentals, foreign funds quickly flow out of Indian equities.""INDA's performance tends to be impacted by these factors as well as the volatile Indian rupee, she added.Still, Yadava points out that INDA is one of the fastest-growing ETFs in the iShares suite. It soaked up $1.946 billion in net inflow in 2015, which he describes as ""unheard-of for emerging markets.""Its $60.2 million sibling, iShares MSCI India Small-Cap (SCIN) absorbed $54.8 million last year, which is ""pretty meaningful inflows for its size,"" Yadava added.""Foreign investors have pulled a lot of money out of India in the last few months, and they're a major player in the stock market,"" said Neena Mishra, director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research.Their disappointment stems in part from the pace of Modi's reforms, in areas such as infrastructure growth and fiscal consolidation. But it encompasses ""the macro story,"" which is losing its polish.The rupee, one of the worst-performing emerging market currencies, is trading at 10-year lows against the dollar. That makes India investments less valuable for U.S. investors.The country's total public debt is a hefty 65% of GDP, according to the Economist.Moreover, an employment crisis looms. India's seeing a huge rise in its working-age population. By some estimates, more than a 100 million youth will enter this demographic band during Modi's tenure.""The need to make them work is high, and the need to move them from low productivity, rural jobs to the industrial sector is also high,"" Yadava said.Nor is India insulated from global growth headwinds, despite being a big beneficiary from cheaper oil imports.Corporate earnings remain lackluster amid weak domestic demand and soft commodity prices. Plus, credit is harder to come by as banks grapple with bad loans.""India Inc. Q3 earnings tepid so far,"" a headline in The Financial Express read Feb. 3. Among the laggards was Tata Steel, a sibling of Tata Motors.Still, the country offers a diverse stock market with more than 5,500 listed companies, many of which tap into domestic growth sectors.At HighTower Las Vegas, an independent RIA, the allocation to India has not changed due to the recent stock market decline. The firm's partners are considering an increase to their allocation, but have not done so yet.""India is a long-term story that will take time to develop,"" said Adam Thurgood, a managing director at HighTower Las Vegas.  ""The demographics are strongly in India's favor and demographic investment themes typically have multidecade time horizons.""In other words, invest in India for its prospects over the longer term. Mishra agrees.""After last year's sell-off and this year's, Indian stocks are not expensive when looking at their growth potential,"" she said.

910,TAP,"Vivint Solar (VSLR) junked its sale to SunEdison (SUNE) early Tuesday, only four days after SunEd settled with Latin America Power shareholders for $28.5 million, having terminated the acquisition of that company in October.SunEd shareholders had been leery of the deal, and SunEdison stock rocketed as much as 33% Tuesday before closing up 5.3%, though still trading just at 2. The stock is 94% off its 2015 high of 33.45, achieved July 20 -- the day the company announced its bid to acquire installer Vivint Solar.Under that agreement, SunEdison had until Feb. 26 to close the deal, and the company had ignored a pair of Vivint Solar notices stating as much, according to an 8-K filed by Vivint Solar early Tuesday. The deal would have been vacated March 18.SunEdison’s financials are seemingly too constrained to close the deal, Vivint Solar wrote. Last week, SunEdison delayed its 10-K filing, citing an ongoing investigation into its liquidity, and suspended a dividend program.Also last week, rumors surfaced that banks backing the Vivint Solar acquisition might pull their funding amid SunEdison's tenuous financial position. SunEdison representatives declined to comment on Monday and didn't immediately return an email Tuesday.In its filing, Vivint Solar said, “SunEdison’s representatives subsequently have informed the company that SunEdison is unable to the cause the closing to occur in the foreseeable future."" The company plans to seek all ""legal remedies available to it in respect of such willful breach.""The legal overhang is preferable to acquiring Vivint Solar, S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Angelo Zino told IBD on Monday, before the deal was terminated. Under the original deal, SunEdison is required to pay Vivint Solar a $34 million breakup fee.""I think investors would rather see the deal not close and handle an undisclosed legal settlement fee at some point in the future,"" Zino said. But he said it doesn't behoove Vivint Solar to force SunEdison into a bankruptcy.Like SunEdison shares, Vivint Solar stock has plunged since July 20. Shares jumped 45% that day, but they then fell more than 65% through Monday's close. Vivint Solar's fall on Wall Street, and pressure from SunEd activist investor Appaloosa Management, forced SunEdison to cut its bid on Vivint Solar in December. In midday trading Tuesday, Vivint Solar stock fell 20% Tuesday, to 4.17. Vivint has been the No. 2 U.S. residential solar installer, behind SolarCity (SCTY). SolarCity stock rose 3.7% Tuesday.""Vivint Solar fundamentals have been deteriorating,"" Zino said on Monday.Appaloosa owns 9.5% of SunEd yield company TerraForm Power (TERP). SunEdison planned to tap TerraForm Power and fellow yieldco TerraForm Global (GLBL) to fund its plan for hyper-growth via acquisitions, Zino said.TerraForm Global filed its IPO less than two weeks after the Vivint Solar bid was announced. Investor sentiment quickly soured on the yieldco model, taking SunEdison stock down with it.""SunEdison had a growth type of mentality, looking to aggressively spend on acquisitions and fund it via these yieldco vehicles,"" Zino said. ""So once that Vivint Solar transaction was announced, some investors got concerned they were maybe doing too much.""The Vivint Solar purchase was sold to SunEdison investors as a way to complete SunEd's portfolio, he said. SunEdison planned to drop Vivint Solar's 922-megawatt rooftop portfolio down to TerraForm Power. Appaloosa tried to prevent that, noting the rooftop assets were embroiled in debt.A judge tossed Appaloosa's injunction last week -- now a moot point, Credit Suisse analyst Patrick Jobin wrote in a research report Tuesday. TerraForm Power stock shot up as much as 15% Tuesday, on the failed Vivint Solar transaction, and closed up 3.8%, at 10.60. Before Tuesday, its shares had fallen nearly 70% since July 20.The vacated Vivint Solar bid frees SunEdison's near-term liquidity by $206 million, Jobin wrote. But it also highlights how precarious SunEdison's liquidity actually is.""Lest we forget, SunEdison has an ongoing board investigation into allegations from former executives that the company misrepresented their liquidity position, and has delayed filing their 10-K,"" he wrote.Jobin maintained his neutral position and 3 price target on SunEdison stock. Zino reiterated his hold rating on SunEdison stock.Financially, it no longer makes sense to drop assets down to TerraForm Power and TerraForm Global, Zino told IBD. Like No. 1 and No. 2 solar companies First Solar (FSLR) and SunPower (SPWR), SunEdison ought to be selling assets to third-party project developers -- the ""lifeblood"" of the solar industry.""The fact SunEdison hasn't been able to sell projects here in recent months, it raises a lot of questions for us,"" he said. ""What does the market actually look like for SunEdison's projects?""Project developers like Dominion (D) buy solar assets, providing up-front capital financing. SunEdison can't afford to keep large-scale projects on its already tight balance sheet. But the third-party market could be sour on SunEdison's assets, Zino said.""The third-party market looks good for SunPower and First Solar,"" he said. ""We haven't seen any problems on their end selling projects and generating cash. But the pricing environment for SunEdison may not be the same as it is for their competitors.""

911,TAP,"Amazon.com (AMZN) is doubling down on its voice-control tech Alexa as it wages a prolonged battle against Apple (AAPL), Google and others for a greater share of customer attention.The mighty, Seattle-based e-commerce firm announced Thursday that it was giving Alexa two new pieces of hardware that will beef up its roster of offerings.The voice-controlled household assistant will gain Amazon Tap and the Echo Dot.Tap is a smaller, portable version of Amazon's original Echo speaker, which works like other Wi-Fi speakers to play music but also serves as Alexa's cyber ears and voice.Unlike the Echo, Tap doesn't need an electric outlet -- it runs on a rechargeable battery. Like its larger sibling, Tap connects to phones and the Internet via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.The Alexa-powered Tap requires people to press a button prior to commanding it to do things like order a ride via app-based car service Uber, read e-books and the news, and provide weather reports. Alexa can also operate, via voice commands, the growing number of ""connected"" home devices such as thermostats and lights, and perform dozens of other tasks.Tap will begin shipping at the end of March for $130.Amazon also announced the hockey-puck-like Echo Dot, which is basically a miniaturized version of its Echo without a large, high-quality speaker. It has a built-in smaller speaker along with a microphone and can connect to existing speaker systems via wire, or wirelessly by Bluetooth. Amazon is limiting Dot sales to existing Echo or Amazon Fire TV device owners; to get one, people will have to ask Alexa.Amazon's stock was down a fraction to around 576 in afternoon trading on the stock market today. Amazon stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 80, where 99 is the highest. The stock more than doubled in 2015 but much like the rest of the market had a rocky start to 2016. But as the market has rebounded, Amazon stock has surged around 20% since Feb. 9.Executives have not disclosed to investors exactly how successful Amazon's foray into voice-control tech is, but according to a Business Insider report, Echo vastly outsold the rest of the wireless speaker market in 2015.Amazon lists Echo as its #1 best seller in the home audio speakers section of its e-commerce site and notes that while Echo is available for orders now, it won't actually be in stock again till March 12. The device debuted in 2014.Echo's runaway success is not good news for other firms making voice-control plays. Apple, for example, has Siri -- though unlike the Alexa-powered Echo, people must hit a button before activating Siri.Google has built a similar feature into its search engine and Android operating system. To activate the Google voice controller, people say, ""O.K., Google"" and proceed to command it to perform functions like setting appointments and timers.Google is a unit of Alphabet (GOOGL).Microsoft (MSFT) also has developed a virtual personal assistant called Cortana.

Piper Jaffray said it expects the iPhone maker to boost its stock buyback program by $30 billion to $50 billion and raise its dividend by between 5% and 10%.Smith & Wesson (SWHC) and Broadcom (AVGO) led the IBD 50 with respective jumps of 7% and 6% in heavy volume. After the close Thursday, Smith & Wesson's fiscal Q3 results trounced views, and the gun maker lifted its earnings guidance well above analyst forecasts. The stock remains in buy range after clearing a 26.64 entry.Broadcom also announced quarterly results that topped estimates late Thursday. The chip designer's stock gapped up past a 138.79 buy point of a double-bottom pattern.Netflix (NFLX) rose almost 4%, retaking its 50-day line in higher-than-normal trade. Shares of the video streaming provider have rallied 27% since Feb. 8. The stock's next hurdle is its 200-day line, which is 4% away.

Volume was higher across the board in the stock market today, according to preliminary figures. Winners topped losers by a 3-1 ratio on the NYSE and about 3-to-2 on the Nasdaq.Stocks started off slightly lower, as weekly jobless claims came in slightly higher than expected. The Institute for Supply Management's Non-Manufacturing Index for February was above forecasts, though it fell for a fourth consecutive month to a two-year low.Telecom, supermarket and medical stocks lagged. But energy, gold miners and automakers outperformed. West Texas intermediate crude oil was nearly unchanged at $34.64 a barrel.Broadcom (AVGO) jumped 7% in extended trading after reporting its fiscal Q1 results. The chipmaker's stock edged 0.3% higher during the regular session.Tesla (TSLA) sped 4%, retaking its converged 50-day line in about average volume. The electric-car maker's stock has rallied nearly 40% from its Feb. 9 intraday low, but is still 31% off its 52-week high. Stifel said it remains bullish on the long-term outlook for Tesla, according to Barron's. Stifel has a buy rating on the stock.On the IBD 50, NetEase (NTES) rose 3% in subdued trade. Shares are still below their 50-day and 200-day lines as they consolidate. On the downside, Universal Display (OLED) gave up  3% in above-average volume.

916,TAP,"Shoot for the stars. They’re closer than you think. Trajectory-setting advice:Seize today. “This is the most exciting time that I’ve been in business,” said “Moonshot!” author John Sculley.The former PepsiCo (PEP) and Apple (AAPL) CEO sees possibilities -- not just for developing innovative products or services, but also for launching billion-dollar businesses.It starts with a moonshot. The term refers to advances that reset the status quo, such as how the personal computer and smartphone changed the way we work and live.Grab advances. The sophisticated tools available to today’s entrepreneurs make big leaps possible.“We live in an era of exponential growth of not just one technology but several technologies,” Sculley told IBD.Advances in cloud computing, mobile devices and wireless sensors make breakthrough solutions possible.“At the same time, these technologies are rapidly being commoditized,” Sculley said.The price to store a terabyte of data used to be in the thousands.“Now it costs $4,” he said. “The cost of these technologies is just plummeting.”Dream big. Savvy entrepreneurs can tap these tools to create transformational -- not traditional -- businesses.“You start with a noble cause -- something that excites you,” Sculley said.That cause becomes a transformational business when leaders attack a big problem and “solve it in a much better way than anyone has ever done before,” he said.Take a lead. Artemis Networks founder Steve Perlman’s noble cause: taking on the wireless communication industry with technology that eliminates cell towers.Biotechnology billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong is leading a Cancer MoonShot 2020 coalition that aims to treat childhood cancer.Both are sector geniuses taking on giant problems.“But for the rest of us, there is the possibility of becoming adaptive innovators who want to make a difference in our own smaller universes, embracing a noble cause as a powerful driving force,” Sculley said.Reach carefully. Missteps can occur out on that limb. Take care, but keep inching forward.“What happens when failure isn’t accepted? Many highly talented people refuse to take further risks,” Sculley said.Experimenters make sure someone’s watching their back.“As a risk taker, if you want to limit risk, one of the best ways is to have another set of trusted eyes,” he said. “The mentor’s biggest role is to be just that.”Use your individuality. “Entrepreneurs are not interchangeable, like batteries or light bulbs; the best opportunity for you is unique to you.”So says “Unleash Your Inner Company” author John Chisholm. The 30-year Silicon Valley serial entrepreneur is CEO of John Chisholm Ventures, a consulting, angel investing and mentoring firm.Over the years, he’s advised hundreds of bootstrappers. The successful ones start by matching what they love doing with a willingness to work tirelessly.“Passion without perseverance is a fleeting fancy; perseverance without passion is drudgery,” Chisholm wrote.Pinpoint it. ""Start with your strength"" is common business advice. Chisholm suggests focusing on a consumer need -- the gap between a preferred state and the current state -- then using your skill set to solve that problem.Dig deeper. Scratch beyond the surface of what consumers say they want. Someone who asks for a better mousetrap might really need a barrier that keeps rodents out.“Think further out of the box -- that is, more broadly and creatively -- than your prospective customers do,” Chisholm wrote.

917,TAP,"Bulked up with acquisitions along with favorable financial results, Hormel Foods is whetting the appetite of investors seeking juicy returns.The stars are aligned in favor of Hormel (HRL) on a few fronts. Low hog prices in its core pork business have helped lift profit margins. Demand for protein products is strong.Plus, Hormel has made a number of acquisitions that have broadened its reach, such as the 2015 purchase of Applegate Farms, the No. 1 brand in the natural and organic value-added prepared meats category. The buy has helped the company tap into growing demand for natural and organic foods from millennials to aging baby boomers, and expanded its retail channel scope.Add to that double-digit profit gains in all but one of the past 10 quarters and you have a tasty recipe for success for the maker of Skippy peanut butter, Spam lunch meats and Jennie-O Turkey. Hormel has seen its stock price soar more than 45% since its Sept. 22 low of 29.93. After a recent breakout, it now hovers in the low 40s.""The stock is performing well,"" S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Joseph Agnese told Investor’s Business Daily, noting he has a hold rating on the stock. ""The commodity environment overall is very favorable with feed costs very low for the turkeys they raise and prices for hogs are down significantly. And they’re very well positioned in the food market (where there’s) strong demand for protein.""BB&T Capital Markets analyst Heather Jones added: ""A key driver of earnings upside and, thereby, the shares has been very significant margin expansion primarily driven by favorable input cost trends in their core pork business, their biggest segment, which sells fresh pork; bacon; pepperoni, etc. into retail and food service; and in their grocery products business with products like Spam.""Although Hormel’s turkey business was negatively impacted by the avian flu last year, it did a ""phenomenal"" job shifting products and selling them at a high margin as a result, Jones added.Recent acquisitions have helped buoy results. They include the $700 million purchase of the Skippy peanut butter business from Unilever (UL) in 2013 and the $450 million purchase of CytoSport Holdings, the maker of Muscle Milk products in 2014.Its latest buy, the $775 million purchase of Applegate Farms, was Hormel’s biggest to date.""The acquisition was perfectly aligned with our interest in adding brands that resonate with consumers that are younger and more socially engaged,"" said Chairman and Chief Executive Jeffrey Ettinger on the first-quarter conference call with analysts. ""This acquisition has also expanded our distribution into the natural and specialty foods channel that’s provided a faster path to creating a significant presence in this high growth, high margin segment.""Jones says the acquisition will help the bottom line.""But what’s important is the acknowledgment that a certain segment of the population is now focused upon where their food is coming from and how those animals were raised,"" she told IBD. ""The wellness trend, in a holistic sense, is not going away. To change a culture and build a brand and credibility in that space would have taken a lot of time and money. It was more expedient to buy a company in that space than to do it on a greenfield basis.""Agnese says, however, the Applegate buy wasn’t a game changer as much as a milestone marking where Hormel is headed.""The game changer is the company has shifted to making acquisitions of value-added products to diversify away from the historical pork and turkey commodity business and more toward a diversified packaged foods company with more stability,"" he added. ""With wider margins and more stability comes a bigger valuation multiple.""Applegate’s products are sold mostly through natural and organic foods specialty stores such as Whole Foods Market (WFM) while Hormel products are sold through traditional outlets.""Hormel can leverage the newly acquired relationship (with Applegate) to try to sell products in the natural and organic foods specialty channel,"" said Agnese. Having the Applegate brand under its umbrella will help Hormel sell products like Muscle Milk and the Hormel brands in the specialty channel, he adds.Hormel has been serving up some tasty financial results, though not all has gone smoothly. For its fiscal 2016 first quarter ended Jan. 24, earnings climbed 23% from a year earlier to 43 cents a share. Profits were up in all segments except its Jennie-O Turkey Store, which saw operating profit slip 2% from a year earlier as it continued to recover from the impact of the highly pathogenic bird flu that hit Hormel farms in Wisconsin and Minnesota midway through 2015, the company said.Total company revenue for the quarter fell 4% to $2.3 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 18% to $1.56 a share. They see a 5% gain in 2017 and a 9% rise in 2018.Agnese expects full-year 2016 revenue to rise 4.7% from 2015, on benefits from recent acquisitions, including Applegate Farms, he noted in a report. He estimates Applegate sales will total over $350 million in 2016.In a recent report to clients, Jones projected “relatively modest” earnings growth in 2017.""Barring a sizeable acquisition, we have difficulty discerning what factors could drive more substantial earnings growth,"" she noted.But Jones told IBD she expects Hormel to do more acquisitions.""I think they're very disciplined allocators of capital,"" she said. ""I don’t think they'll do an acquisition just to grow. It has to fit into their strength and it has to be the right price. They have challenges in growing volumes in their core business and have an excellent balance sheet. I think they'll do more acquisitions over the next few years.""

918,TAP,"Google Fiber, the super-fast Internet-access service spearheaded by Google's parent firm Alphabet (GOOGL), is about to become available in San Francisco.Google Fiber's Internet access will soon reach ""some apartments, condos and affordable housing properties"" in the tech-drenched Northern California city, using existing fiber networks rather than one built from scratch, wrote Michael Slinger, Google Fiber's director of business operations, in a blog post on Wednesday.Using San Francisco's existing fiber network will make the startup of the service come about more quickly, but it also means the service won't be available everywhere in the city. Still, it's a boost for tech-innovation hub San Francisco, where homes and businesses largely don't have Web access that's any better than in other parts of the country.Google Fiber started six years ago in Kansas City and the company has ""committed to bring Fiber to a total of ten metropolitan areas,"" said Slinger in the blog post. ""To date, we've focused mostly on building fiber-optic networks from scratch. Now, as Google Fiber grows, we’re looking for more ways to serve cities of different shapes and sizes. That’s why we're working with Huntsville, Alabama to tap into the city’s planned municipal fiber network.""In other news, Google is also widening use of a technology that loads Web pages more quickly while consuming less data -- in an aim to make it easier for people to navigate the Internet using their mobile phones.Google said Wednesday that it will display relevant pages in the Top Stories section of search-results pages that are built with its Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) technology. AMP is similar to efforts underway by Alphabet-rivals Facebook (FB), and its Instant Articles, and Apple (AAPL), and its Apple News service, which also aim to speed up how quickly articles load on mobile devices.Pages built with Google's new technology load about four times faster and use 10 times less data than typical pages, Google said.The AMP technology improves how ads are seen. Stopping ads from slowing-down readers' access to online articles could help deflect one of the main threats that the industry says could be facing digital ad companies -- the growing use of ad-blocking software.AMP works by having developers rewrite their pages in a slightly simpler and more limited language, and hosts the pages on Google’s infrastructure, according to a Bloomberg report.“No matter how many ads you put on the page the content comes first,” Bloomberg quoted David Besbris, a Google vice president of engineering for search, as saying. “If a user taps on something they will get the content immediately.”Alphabet stock closed up 0.5% in the stock market today, at 720.90.

Armed with that knowledge, brands can improve targeting and deliver better ads.""They'll provide greater feedback,"" J.R. Rigley, president and CMO at packaged-goods company J.R. Watkins, said about the expanded sentiment options last fall, according to AdWeek. ""We will know more about how viewers feel about the brand, which could be helpful to us. The con is that they might not like the content. But some of that could be good, too.""The Reactions sentiment-options feature had been in testing since October in Ireland and Spain, and was made available to all Facebook's 1.59 billion users globally on Wednesday.""We've been listening to people and know that there should be more ways to easily and quickly express how something you see in News Feed makes you feel. That's why today we are launching Reactions, an extension of the Like button, to give you more ways to share your reaction to a post in a quick and easy way,"" wrote Facebook product manager Sami Krug in a blog post on Wednesday.To add a reaction, users must hold down the ""Like"" button on their mobile device -- or hover above the ""Like"" button on a desktop computer to see the reaction image options -- then tap buttons to add one of the expanded range of emojis.Early this month, Facebook announced that it had doubled the length of video ads on Instagram to 60 seconds, and Wednesday revealed that it has over 200,000 advertisers on the photo- and video-sharing service.

"
921,TAP,"George Burns made audiences laugh for nearly a century. He sang with a kids’ quartet at age 7 on street corners, in saloons and on ferryboats, and then went on to become a star of vaudeville, radio, TV and movies.Comedy legend Carl Reiner directed him as the Almighty in the hit 1977 movie “Oh, God!” opposite John Denver, as an assistant supermarket manager chosen to deliver a message to the world.“George was really a workhorse,” Reiner, the author of the just-published “Why & When the Dick Van Dyke Show Was Born,” told IBD. “He was always so calm you never knew how much preparation he had done before he got there. We once had some weather problems and had to shoot a different scene, so I told him he could have some time to look over his lines. He told me, ‘Before I ever go into a project, I learn every scene and everyone’s part.’ He was ready.”Burns’ Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor in 1975’s “The Sunshine Boys” made him the oldest winner of any Oscar in history, at age 80, a record that stood for 14 years.Burns (1896-1996) was born Nathan Birnbaum in New York City, the ninth of 12 children of Romanian immigrants, living in three rooms without indoor plumbing. His father died from the flu seven years later, and Burns got a job mixing batches of cherry and chocolate syrup in the basement of a candy store.During breaks, he and two other boys sang harmonies. The postman heard them and offered to be their agent, bringing in a lead singer and passing the hat wherever they performed. They soon won an amateur night, but by age 10, Burns had quit the quartet and joined two of his brothers to tap dance in variety shows between silent movies.He gave conflicting accounts of why he chose his stage name (perhaps because his favorite brother was George, and Burns was a shortening of Birnbaum).“He found a way to eat for nothing, asking for a cup of hot water and then pouring ketchup into it, and he came to like it,” wrote Martin Gottfried in “George Burns and the Hundred-Year Dash.” “He even found that amusing to recall, and like all of his vaudevillizing of hard times, it reflected an easygoing attitude toward life’s bumpy ride. … Even if nothing but failure lay ahead, which sometimes seemed to be his fate, he never despaired.”After doing a bit of everything on stage, Burns was called up for World War I in 1917, only to be rejected for his extreme nearsightedness. As a result, he returned to the struggle of making it in showbiz.One of his dance partners, Hannah Siegel, was supposed to go with him on a 26-week tour, but her parents refused unless they married. They did, though Burns claimed they never consummated the relationship, and divorced after they returned in 1923. That’s when he met Gracie Allen, a 17-year-old Irish Catholic girl who danced with her sisters.Burns invited her to be the straight woman in a new comedy banter act in New York and on tour while he wrote. She was to ask questions, and he was to give funny answers, but it turned out he had to trade parts at times, since she got more laughs with her delivery than he could.“He knew for the first time in his life that he was in a smash act,” wrote Gottfried. “Gracie had given him an awesome gift … making him a success at the only thing he wanted to be. There was a magic about Burns, and it was related to his vitality, his determination, his optimism and his extraordinary ability to relate to another person.”In 1923, despite the religious differences of their families, they married and would adopt a daughter, Sandra, and a son, Ronnie.George and Gracie began to get attention as a replacement act, ready to jump in anywhere, anytime, if someone dropped out. That led to a six-month contract with a vaudeville circuit.Vaudeville began dying when radio became popular in the late 1920s. Their break came when Gracie was invited to be on Eddie Cantor’s program in 1931.Burns wrote a dialogue that “established her character with the radio audience -- the lovable, dizzy lady whose illogical logic raised confusion to a new height,” he wrote in “All My Best Friends.”The duo provided comedy relief for Guy Lombardo’s radio program. When the bandleader left in 1932, they inherited the slot on CBS, soon making them nationally famous. In 1937, they jumped to NBC.George and Gracie had also been appearing in short comedy films starting in 1929, completing 11 more over the next five years, while having parts in 15 features in the 1930s. In 1935, they were paid $75,000 (equal to $1.3 million now) for starring in “The Big Broadcast of 1936,” enough money to move to Beverly Hills, Calif.“For a show business family, the Burnses maintained a very un-showbusiness home,” wrote Gottfried. “It meant modest weekly allowances and reasonable nightly curfews. There were family meals, family trips and regular visits with the extended family. The house was casual, with a live-in couple, a houseman and a housekeeper/cook. … The one special touch was the constant laughter. Ronnie and Sandy agreed that their father was probably the funniest dad anyone ever had.”In 1949, Jack Benny, a friend from vaudeville who had his own show on the National Broadcasting Co., convinced them to leave NBC with him and return to CBS radio, just in time for the network to capitalize on the birth of TV.In 1950, “The George Burns & Gracie Allen Show” debuted on CBS television.Burns had been breaking the fourth wall, or talking directly to the home audience, commenting on the characters and joking. But the radio format seemed plodding on TV, so they developed what became the situation comedy formula, with recurring characters and running gags.Their children also made appearances, and the show ran until 1958, when Gracie retired because of declining health. She died six years later at 69.Burns threw himself into work to try to ignore his grief. George and Gracie had formed a production company, McCadden Corp., for more control and profit, and developed their own series, with their biggest hit being “Mister Ed,” starring Alan Young and his talking horse, a show that ran from 1961 to 1966.From 1964 to 1965, Burns produced and starred in the TV sitcom “Wendy & Me,” with Connie Stevens as his young neighbor, but it faced stiff competition and was canceled after 34 episodes. Its lead-in program was the McCadden comedy “No Time for Sergeants,” with Sammy Jackson as a country boy who joins the Air Force, but it also faced popular competitors and died at the same time.While producing these series, Burns performed stand-up comedy and his song-and-dance act to sell-out crowds at theaters around the country.In the 1980s, he also released three albums, with “I Wish I Was 18 Again” reaching No. 12 on the country music chart. Not busy enough, he also authored 10 best-selling books, his last in 1996: “100 years, 100 Stories.”In 1975, Burns revived his film career with “The Sunshine Boys,” co-starring with Walter Matthau as retired vaudeville partners and earning Burns the Best Supporting Actor Oscar.Two years later, “Oh, God!” was an unlikely hit, with Burns as the Lord telling an ordinary soul, played by Denver, to deliver a message to humans to shape up.“When someone asked who should play God, I thought immediately of George because on his TV series, he was always standing outside the house talking about what was about to happen, a godlike quality,” said Reiner. “I learned that when he was in vaudeville, he hated Al Jolson but appreciated his talent, so whenever they were playing in the same town, George would give up one of his performances to go watch Jolson and learn from the master of show business.”The movie grossed $51 million domestically, the seventh-highest for 1977, and it still receives rave reviews, with RottenTomatoes.com giving it an aggregate critical rating of 71 out of 100. Two sequels, “Oh, God! Book II” in 1980 and “Oh God! You Devil"" in 1984, also starred Burns, but they had other directors and didn’t do as well.Burns had been good health all his life, thanks to a daily regimen of exercise and swimming. At 96, he signed a lifetime contract to perform at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas, but by then his health was deteriorating. His last motion picture was the 1994 comedy mystery “Radioland Murders,” in which he played a 100-year-old comedian.Burns's joke was that he couldn’t die, since he was booked, but he passed on two months after turning 100. Apparently, he was being given top bill in another sequel to “Oh, God!”Star of vaudeville, radio, movies and TV.Overcame: Changing popularity of outlets for comedy.Lesson: A lively sense of humor will help you get through adversity.“I’d rather be a failure at something I love than a success at something I hate.”

924,TAP,"After a 25-year career as a petroleum engineer, Wes Peirce planned to retire. But he also craved a new challenge.Given his longstanding interest in investing, Peirce weighed whether to become a financial advisor. He figured his extensive contacts in the oil business might give him an advantage.""I wanted to keep busy and supplement my retirement income a little bit,"" Peirce said. ""I thought, 'I have a lot of friends in the (oil) industry.' I thought that if I became an advisor, my peers would make great clients.""Peirce realized that many of his colleagues had amassed sizable nest eggs. They were also approaching retirement and needed financial advice.""I knew that there are a lot of 55-year-olds in the oil business who have a pretty high net worth,"" he said. ""I didn’t know of any other financial advisors around here who specialized in petroleum engineers, so I thought that would give me an edge.""Armed with this knowledge, Peirce decided to plunge in. He founded Peirce Capital Management in 2007 in The Woodlands, Texas.To build a practice, Peirce contacted about 30 acquaintances in the oil industry. Only about three or four became clients, but that didn’t discourage him.""I constructed a business plan, and I had a low threshold for growth,"" he said. ""I could've been more aggressive in seeking more clients, but that wouldn't work for me. I preferred slow but steady growth.""Today, Peirce estimates that 80% of his clients are in the oil industry. As planned, he has gradually added clients through referrals at a manageable clip.Peirce, 58, reflects on his good fortune in launching his advisory career by tapping a rich customer base. He never needed to stray too far from an industry that he knew well.""I was in a natural niche with a depth of potential clients,"" he said. ""When you're picking a niche, you want to have confidence that you have a way in. You need to do ground-laying.""In analyzing whether to concentrate on a particular niche, smart financial advisors think like demographers and confirm that they have identified a viable segment of the market to pursue. They study the number of potential clients in that market, their assets and how many other advisors compete for their business.For Peirce, it all starts with a handful of what he calls ""core relationships"" with people in the niche. Once these individuals become clients, referrals and targeted marketing can build momentum for growth.""I'm not a salesman,"" he said. ""I can't go out there and cold-call. I didn't identify a niche and then contact a lot of strangers.""But Peirce knew his market well. He was familiar with the benefits that oil companies typically offer their petroleum engineers, and he understood how deferred compensation affects financial planning. That enhanced his credibility as he sought to convert his former peers into clients.When Robert Pyle launched his advisory practice in 1996, he sought to attract owners of small businesses as clients. He lived in Boulder, Colo., where tech and biotech startups were spawning an entrepreneurial boom. Pyle concluded that he could tap this growing niche in his community.A decade later, Pyle had built a successful firm, Diversified Asset Management. In 2007, Pyle helped a self-employed client and his spouse stash away more for retirement by setting up a defined benefit plan in which they made annual contributions of $100,000. Over the next seven years, they saved about $700,000.""Not that many financial advisors know how to set up defined benefit plans,"" said Pyle, a certified financial planner. ""It's complicated.""When evaluating a potential niche for your advisory practice, it helps to understand what specialized expertise you can provide to clients that other financial planners may lack. It's also important to confirm that there exists a sufficient pool of clients who can benefit from your expertise.""I knew that many business owners wanted to save the maximum for their retirement,"" Pyle said. ""So I put in the time, educated myself and made myself an expert on defined benefit plans. Now we’re doing more and more of these plans for our clients.""In addition to analyzing the marketplace to determine whether you should pursue a particular niche, consider your interest level and eagerness to serve that business segment. If you’re motivated to learn about your specialty, that's a good sign.""You have to identify a niche that you really enjoy and that you're really passionate about,"" Pyle said.

932,TAP,"Wall Street is settling into the first earnings season of the calendar year, and after the long weekend, IBD 50 stocks Starbucks (SBUX) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) are set to disclose quarterly results.Coffee giant Starbucks, which reports Q1 results after the close on Thursday, is expected to experience 12.5% earnings growth to 45 cents per share on a 12.3% revenue rise to $5.39 billion, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. The growth would mark a slowdown from previous quarters.The company remains bullish about expanding market share in China, even as that country experiences market volatility and less rapid economic growth. Starbucks plans to open 500 stores there in 2016, with the goal of opening 3,400 stores in China by 2019. CEO Howard Schultz says that China has the potential to become the company's biggest market.While other retailers flounder, Starbucks has remained a bright spot.

933,TAP,"Israeli firepower extends well beyond its military might. And the ""Start-Up Nation,"" as it has been called, may be getting less love in your ETF portfolio than it should.Big innovations from the tiny country include drip irrigation, network security firewalls and autonomous driving. Several exchange traded funds offer exposure to its dynamic economy and technological leadership for successful investing.However, ""the Israeli equity market is underrepresented in U.S. portfolios, especially given the new technology coming out of Israel,"" says Steven Schoenfeld, founder and CIO of BlueStar Indexes and an expert in investing in Israeli capital markets.Israel accounts for a 0.5% portfolio weighting in the MSCI EAFE index tracking foreign developed markets outside North America. It's easy to ignore a country that is 50 basis points of its benchmark, Schoenfeld said.Yet ""many Israeli technology companies are focused on transformational, 'disruptive' technologies that are and will continue to be driven by strong underlying growth trends,"" Blue Star Indexes said in an October 2015 report on Israel's global technology companies. They include some names that are former members of the IBD 50 list of top-rated stocks:Mobileye (MBLY) is a global leader in autonomous driving technology. The stock is modestly above its August 2014 IPO price of 25, but the company's software and chips power cars from General Motors (GM), Nissan (NSANY), Honda (HMC) and Daimler's (DDAIF) Mercedes-Benz.Mobileye has an IBD Composite Rating of 73 out of best-possible 99.Check Point Software (CHKP), a cybersecurity pioneer that is reportedly targeting a takeover of CyberArk Software (CYBR). Check Point invented the firewall for perimeter Internet security, while CyberArk focuses on protecting key access points within companies' IT systems.Check Point has a Comp Rating of 80 and CyberArk 83.Mellanox (MLNX) is a supplier of computer network switches, cords and adapters, whose products are used in the data-center and cloud-computing industries.Mellanox ranks seventh in the fabless semiconductor industry group, one of 197 tracked by IBD, with a Comp Rating of 91.Two Israel-focused ETFs track Blue Star Indexes, including Market Vectors Israel (ISRA) and BlueStar TA-BIGITech Israel Tech (ITEQ).ISRA holds 113 Israeli and Israeli-linked companies across the market-cap spectrum, including Check Point, Mobileye, Mellanox and CyberArk. According to Schoenfeld, the ETF has ""the broadest and deepest exposure to Israel"" of any U.S. exchange traded fund.Its older and larger rival, iShares MSCI Israel Capped (EIS), holds 62 stocks.Meanwhile, ITEQ holds 65 high-tech Israeli companies. Its portfolio constituents are listed worldwide but mainly in the U.S., and it includes many names missing from the largest and most popular technology ETFs.The ETF takes a broad view of technology, including not only computer hardware and software companies, but also agritech, defense tech and biotech.Israeli stocks have held up better amid 2016's sharp slump than the MSCI EAFE index they're a part of.EIS was down 3.9% year to date as of Jan. 13 vs. a 7.1% stumble for iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA).Follow Aparna Narayanan on Twitter @IBD_ANarayanan.

934,TAP,"It doesn't have an online shop. It doesn't promise luxury brands. And its fluorescent lighting and long, uninterrupted racks of merchandise aim in no way to replicate the glossy feel of a Bloomingdale's or Macy's.But Ross Stores (ROST) is widely considered a solid, if not particularly flashy, find as other retailers struggle against the Web tide, and as shoppers increasingly take their business to off-price channels.""They are so well positioned. They’re one of the best,"" Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar said of Ross, adding that the off-price industry overall has hit the ""sweet spot of pricing and distribution.""Ross is also a safe bet in this  increasingly hostile world for retailers, where online giants like Amazon (AMZN) are swallowing market share away from conventional brick-and-mortar stores by the plateful.The realities of the modern retail landscape reflect a consumer base that is increasingly drawn by Amazon's gravitational pull and the appeal of ordering things online. Last summer, Cowen had predicted that Amazon would topple Macy's (M) as America's No. 1 apparel retailer by 2017.""In 2016, we believe investors can't ignore Amazon, the growing giant in the retail world,"" Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen said in a recent note to clients. ""We suggest buying companies who can offer an 'un-Amazon-able' brand proposition.""Ross appears to have done just that. It is included in that brief list of companies impervious to Amazon's market-share grab, along with off-price retail rival TJX (TJX), upscale furniture retailer Restoration Hardware (RH), Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) and beauty-product vendors Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH) and Ulta (ULTA).The distinction is notable for this unassuming chain of off-price stores, since the rest of the retail field has been working hard to fend off the creeping advance of e-commerce.Macy's has turned each and every store into a mini-fulfillment center in order to expedite online shipping orders. Nordstrom (JWN), known for its tech spending, has set aside $1.5 billion, or 35% of its $4.3 billion five-year capital plan, for tech and supply chain investments.Even TJX has an e-commerce presence, though it remains a relatively small one. In general, selling items online isn't easy for off-pricers that have a revolving door of merchandise.""Such a potpourri is not necessarily conducive to traditional online (shops),"" said Cowen's Chen.Visitors to Ross's website won't see any online offers, and no way to peruse its inventory outside of a physical store. Could its lack of an e-commerce segment hurt the company down the road?""I don’t think it’s a big issue right now,"" said William Blair analyst Daniel Hofkin. ""Could it become a big issue over time? Sure, it could. At this time, they don’t feel it could be profitable.""An online shop would bring greater access to shoppers.""I think it merits exploration because the reality is, with the prevalent use of mobile phones, it’d be nice for them to tap into that device that everybody has,"" said Chen. But with a selection of mostly low-ticket items, ""the main issue is shipping costs.""Hofkin highlighted one benefit that TJX has seen from its online efforts; it is reaping incremental traffic from customers who stop by stores to make returns and wind up picking up a few things while they're there. That happens about 70% of the time, he said.But shoppers are likely to want to visit Ross stores in person, even stopping by brick-and-mortar locations as often as once a week, said Chen.""It’s about the treasure hunt -- that isn’t something that you can replicate online,"" he said.Ross also retains other advantages.Unseasonably warm weather late last year prompted an inventory pileup for many stores, which in turn prompted heavy discounting as cold-weather gear didn't leave shelves as quickly as hoped. Other retailers' inventory management was ""appalling"" last year and over the holiday season, said Morningstar's Weishaar.But Ross is not expected to shoulder the same burden from winter's toasty start as its department-store brethren -- in fact, weather woes for other companies can translate to cheap buys for off-pricers, which often source from overstocked suppliers.""(It can) allow (Ross) and TJX to buy some excess merchandise in the marketplace at substantially better prices, which can support future sales and margins,"" William Blair's Hofkin said via email. ""(Ross) also likely has less weather exposure, given its larger (California) and sunbelt presence.""Between 20%-25% of Ross Stores are located in California, he said.Analysts also highlight Ross's buying strategy. The company purchases a lot of ""packaway"" inventory, i.e. basics that can be bought at a low price now but then sold seasons later, regardless of what's in fashion.While high inventory levels aren't generally regarded as a positive for most retailers, Ross' 48% packaway level doesn't trouble Wall Street. Morgan Stanley's Kimberly Greenberger called it a ""strategic advantage"" and wrote in November that packaway ""typically provides (Ross) customers with the greatest value and produces the highest merchandise margin, enhancing financial returns.""How does Ross rate against its primary rival, TJX, the parent of T.J. Maxx, Home Goods and Marshalls? Both are broadly well-regarded. Both have been outperforming their retail peers.The TJX customers, though, tend to come from from a wider range of household incomes, and they generally spend more per visit than the average Ross customer. TJX products also have higher price points. T.J. Maxx, for example, stocks a selection of high-end items more in line with what one might find at Saks Fifth Avenue, including $600 Versace watches and Fendi purses that go for a ""discounted"" price that is still nearly $3,000.Ross also is a domestic play. As of the end of its most recent quarter, the company had 1,276 Ross Dress for Less locations in 34 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, plus 172 DD's Discounts across 15 states. Conversely, TJX operates stores in Canada, Europe and most recently Australia, with its 2015 acquisition of Trade Secret.Ross shares are up roughly 13% over the last 12 months, in stark contrast to its broader category, IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories industry group, which has fallen 16%.Ross's third-quarter earnings for the period ended Oct. 31 grew 13% to 53 cents a share, topping views by three cents. Revenue growth of 7% to $2.78 billion pulled ahead of forecasts for $2.77 billion.Management is ""solid as a rock,"" said Cowen's Chen. ""I think they have good strategies that are balanced.""What kind of speed bumps could Ross encounter in the future?Wage increases could put pressure on margins, noted several analysts. But the minimum wage hike in California -- which is now $10 an hour as of the start of 2016 -- could also help Ross, said Chen, as the lower-income shopper now has more money in his or her pocket.And deeper discounts at Macy's and other department stores could also lure in bargain hunters as competition for shoppers heats up.Ross declined to provide comment for the story. Its executives generally do not grant media interviews, said a Ross spokesperson.""There’s a certain degree of privacy because in the industry you don’t want to reveal too much to your competitors,"" said Chen, ""and because there’s competition for goods and competition for how you should change your store to capture share.""

935,TAP,"The market is in a confirmed uptrend, but it did pull back on Monday and Tuesday.That leaves many investors wondering whether the market has finished its latest made-in-China swoon.And still shaken by the plunges that began in August and again in December, many once again are wondering whether they should seek a safe haven from market volatility.Should they react to market volatility and uncertain, negative stock market news by going to cash or shifting to bonds -- which have risks of their own, given the prospect for interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve?A recent report from T. Rowe Price says investors are better off staying the course with the long-term portion of their portfolio.The numbers show how that strategy can help your overall portfolio and your retirement planning in particular.How so? T. Rowe Price cites these four reasons why buy-and-hold is the way to go, especially for investors in diversified mutual funds:1. From the start of 1926 through 2015, the S&P 500 index has enjoyed positive returns in every single rolling 15-calendar year period. No investors ever lost money by sticking with the broad market index through any of those rolling periods. And those periods included market setbacks much worse the recent sell-off, including the Great Depression and the 1999 tech bust.2. What about 10-year rolling periods? In the 81 since 1926, the S&P 500 carved out gains in 77 of them. The market advanced in 97% of 10-year rolling time frames.3. Still not convinced? In the 59 30-year rolling periods since 1926, the S&P 500 not only never suffered a negative return, its worst performance was actually an average annual gain of 8.5% for each of the 30 years.4. As for stocks versus bonds, it's no contest. Despite relatively brief -- but still very unnerving -- downturns in both the stock and bond markets, stocks dramatically outperform bonds over time. If you had invested $10,000 in the S&P 500 on Dec. 31, 1990, by Feb. 1, 2016 it would have grown into $98,764. In the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index it would have ballooned to less than half that much, only $44,977.That does not mean you should avoid bonds totally. It means don't bulk up on bonds -- much less cash -- when trouble strikes the markets.Stick with your game plan -- your allocations to stocks and bonds, based on your risk tolerance and how much time you have before you need to tap your portfolio for cash to pay bills. If you're 100% in stocks, stay that way. If you're 80% stocks, stick with them. Don't shift into and out of bonds, replacing stocks. If you do, you're bound to miss out on some of stocks' explosive growth, especially at the start of rallies.""When managing your investments, look beyond the volatility of the moment and focus instead on adhering to your strategy,"" senior financial planner Stuart Ritter said in the T. Rowe Price report. ""Continue to save and invest, and maintain an investment mix that is appropriate for your time horizon. These are the variables you can control—and they are the most likely to determine whether you succeed at reaching your investment goals.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

Terms were not disclosed.Detroit-based Compuware's effort would help make traditional Cobol mainframe data, like that pioneered by IBM (IBM), more usable and manageable by today's ""mainstream"" development and operations engineers, or DevOps, who may be unfamiliar with Cobol applications.Many big banks, large corporations and government agencies maintain decades-old mainframe data centers, at least for storage or backup, while simultaneously developing new open-source enterprise centers, on-premise or in the cloud, to handle operations. Compuware warns that the rapid pace of retirement among traditional mainframe managers is hastening a transition.Splunk, which specializes in software able to analyze terabytes of machine-generated data daily, closed down 2% Monday at 57.65. Atlassian, which recently went public at 21 and began trading Dec. 10, closed Monday down 8.9% at 27.41, its worst day ever. IBM closed down 1.2% at 135.95. Markets fell globally Monday, led by soft manufacturing data and trading jitters in China.""If your mainframe application development isn't 'Agile,' your business can't be agile,"" said Compuware CEO Chris O'Malley in a press release, referring to a quick form of collaborative software development. ""Our mission is to help customers achieve that essential business agility by empowering Agile DevOps teams to master the mainframe just as they do other platforms in the multiplatform enterprise.""Compuware said that Splunk will focus on security and compliance issues by feeding Compuware clients' mainframe data into Splunk's Operational Intelligence software and visualization tools.Atlassian's software development lifecycle (SDLC) management environment, called JIRA, will benefit Compuware clients' ""enterprises that need to better leverage their mainframe applications as back ends for customer-facing Web and mobile apps,"" Compuware said.Compuware also said that it had purchased substantially all of the assets of ISPW BenchMark, a Calgary, Canada-based software and service firm that modernizes mainframes and distributed systems to create a single point of control across the enterprise. ISPW President Paul Kuszyk said that the purchase will ""more aggressively invest in our capabilities to support an iterative and Agile approach to development and add more value by integrating into the broader enterprise DevOps ecosystem.""Compuware said that it's working with San Francisco-based AppDynamics to integrate the latter's application performance management software to help resolve issues with multiplatform applications that use DB2 database software on IBM z Systems mainframes.

957,TAP,"Bloomberg News contributed to this story.Standard Chartered became the third European bank in less than two weeks to announce sweeping job cuts, bringing the total planned reductions to more than 30,000, or almost 1 in 7 positions.The London-based lender said Tuesday that it will eliminate 15,000 jobs, or 17% of its workforce, as soaring bad loans in emerging markets hurt earnings.Deutsche Bank (DB), based in Frankfurt, announced plans last week for 11,000 job cuts, while Credit Suisse Group (CS) said it would trim as many as 5,600 employees.The three banks, which all named new chief executive officers this year, are undertaking the deepest overhauls since the financial crisis as stricter capital rules erode profitability.Standard Chartered and Zurich-based Credit Suisse will tap shareholders for funds, while Deutsche Bank scrapped its dividend for this year and next to conserve capital.""It's just further evidence that Europe's banks didn't adapt quickly enough to the post-crisis world and are now playing catch-up,"" said Christopher Wheeler, analyst at Atlantic Equities in London.More bloodletting may be on the way. Milan-based UniCredit is considering as many as 12,000 job cuts as it seeks to improve profit and capital levels, people with knowledge of the discussions said last week. The numbers, which are still under review, increased from 10,000 a month ago and may change depending on the outcome of asset sales. The largest Italian bank reports earnings next week.Including jobs lost through asset sales, John Cryan, Deutsche Bank's co-CEO since July, intends to eliminate 26,000 employees, or a quarter of the workforce, by 2018.Tidjane Thiam, Credit Suisse's new CEO, will shed jobs in the U.S., U.K. and Switzerland.At Standard Chartered, new CEO Bill Winters aims to save $2.9 billion by 2018. The bank will also restructure or exit $100 billion of assets after it reported an unexpected third-quarter loss. Winters scrapped the dividend for the second half of this year, the first such move since at least 1988.""These banks have to be seen to be doing something, especially if they have a new CEO in place,"" said Andre Spicer, professor at Cass Business School in London. ""Doing nothing is not an option.""Meanwhile, Walt Disney's (DIS) ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" appears to be outfitted with a Class 1 hyperdrive, breaking more records over the weekend as it reached $1 billion in global box office sales in just 12 parsecs — er, 12 days. The movie drew in a record-setting $149.2 million over its second weekend in theaters domestically, plus $137.7 million internationally, according to Variety, which posted the final tallies.And it hasn't even opened yet in China, the world's No. 2 movie market. The seventh installment opens there on Jan. 9.Disney shares are up nearly 14% for the year; the IBD Media-Diversified industry group is down 4%.Bloomberg News contributed to this story.

963,TAP,"Nicole Bennett wanted to pull cash out of her house in Antioch, Calif., to reduce a growing mound of debt. When Bennett's mortgage lender, Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC), refused the social worker because her credit score was too low, she turned to a technology startup called Point Digital Finance.
"
964,TAP,"In October, Bennett got the almost $40,000 she needed to pay down debt that was costing her more than $1,900 a month in car, personal-loan and credit-card payments. In return, Palo Alto, Calif.-based Point — which is backed by investors including Greylock Partners, Andreessen Horowitz and Vikram Pandit, the former chief executive officer of Citigroup Inc. (C) — wanted to own a piece of her property.
"
965,TAP,"""I have all this equity in my house, but I couldn't use it because of my credit score,"" said Bennett, whose FICO score was less than 600, on a scale of 300 to 850. ""I can breathe now because all my money isn't going out the door.""
"
966,TAP,"Financing to homeowners is loosening up after a 30% increase in property values nationally since the 2012 trough. While many lenders have been letting the most credit-worthy borrowers tap their homes' equity, Point is targeting customers who have been largely unable to trade accumulated wealth for cash or don't want to take on the additional monthly payments associated with traditional loan s.
"
967,TAP,"In the years leading up to the real estate crash, easy financing helped people buy homes they couldn't afford and then borrow against their equity as property prices rose. The collapse in home values ripped through banks that bought mortgage securities, helping trigger the U.S. recession. At Citigroup, CEO Charles O. ""Chuck"" Prince was ousted in 2007 in the face of mounting losses tied to subprime mortgages and replaced by Pandit, who himself left three years ago.
"
968,TAP,"Since home prices bottomed in 2012, banks have reduced the percentage of cash that borrowers can take out when refinancing and tightened credit standards for home-equity lines of credit, HELOCs — requiring higher FICO scores and full documentation.
"
969,TAP,"A typical HELOC is a second mortgage, repaid monthly with interest, that homeowners can use in full or draw on as needed. Point is making an investment in the form of equity, so customers have no obligation to pay the firm back until they sell or refinance their homes, for as long as a decade.
"
970,TAP,"That type of funding could ultimately cause financial issues for the homeowner, said Sarah Edelman, director of housing policy at the Center for American Progress.

971,TAP,"The Risk For Consumers
"
972,TAP,"""While it may be appealing to get an upfront lump sum of cash, the risk here appears to be that a consumer could end up with a more expensive product with harsher repayment terms than they would with a more conventional loan,"" said Edelman, whose Washington-based policy institute promotes economic mobility.
"
973,TAP,"Many Americans with high debt-to-income ratios and low credit scores have limited financing options. For personal loans, both LendingClub (LC) and Prosper Marketplace customers have average credit scores of 700 or above. And the traditional home-equity lending market has been open primarily to borrowers with good credit.
"
974,TAP,"""The home-equity market is still very restrictive,"" said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst for personal-finance data provider Bankrate (RATE), adding that FICO scores are a key factor in determining whether a person qualifies for financing. ""It starts getting tougher below 680. Below 620 it is both really hard and really expensive.""
"
975,TAP,"With Point, credit scores can be less than 620, but homeowners must have at least 25% to 30% equity in their houses. Point adjusts the cost of its investment based on the owner and the property, taking a larger percentage of price appreciation from riskier customers. Should the homeowner not pay Point, the firm has the right to sell the home to recoup its investment and take its portion of the gains.
"
976,TAP,"Those deciding not to sell their homes have to pay Point back at the end of the 10-year period, similar to a loan, with an annual effective interest rate that's capped at about 15%, comparable to rates on some credit cards or unsecured consumer debt. Annual rates at LendingClub range from 5.32% to almost 30% on three-year personal loans.

978,TAP,"Point is investing in properties it expects to appreciate in value, initially focusing on California, with plans to fund homeowners in other states next year, according to a company marketing document. Home prices nationally are set to rise about 5.5% this year and may increase an additional 5.9% in 2016, according to CoreLogic (CLGX).
"
979,TAP,"""If your home does well, we both do well,"" Point CEO Eddie Lim, who previously co-founded a payments platform acquired by Visa (V), said in an interview. ""If your home doesn't do that well, then this was one of the cheapest sources of financing that you could have obtained.""
"
980,TAP,"For investors, the firm is trying to unlock some of the equity in residential real estate and make it a more liquid asset class that can be traded, Lim said. He's raised money from investors — separate from the company's venture-capital backers — to fund the equity products. The firm already is selling them to family offices and hedge funds that buy residential-mortgage bonds and has plans to securitize them as well.
"
981,TAP,"Seeking Financial Stability
"
982,TAP,"Part of Point's plan is to improve the financial stability of its customers because the firm transfers funds directly to pay off their debts, according to the marketing document. Other backers of the company, which Lim started in January, include Ribbit Capital, SV Angel and Bloomberg Beta, the venture-capital arm of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.
"
983,TAP,"Point's customers, aside from Bennett, include homeowners such as an Apple (AAPL) employee who makes $128,700 a year and owns a Mountain View, Calif., house appraised at $1.38 million, according to the firm's marketing document. The logistics program manager, who owes about $715,525 on the property and has a credit score of 644, wanted $85,000 from Point to pay off debt from home renovations, the document shows.

"
1012,TAP,"By now - we are all well aware of the disaster that had taken place in global mkts since the beginning of the new year - that is unless you have been living under a rock - but either way - we have seen some $2.4 tril wiped out the value of global mkts....some of the blame can be placed squarely on broad macro themes, a breakdown in Apple (AAPL) shares, renewed nervousness concerning Mid East and North Korean geo-political issues, the coming earnings season, health of the consumer, etc.........but for the most part the most recent cause of mkt nervousness  has been front and center - China...  Right or wrong - they have become the scapegoat.....
"
1013,TAP,"Now - look - there is a lot of 'stuff' going on there.....slowing Chinese economy, currency devaluation,  plunging commodity prices....blah, blah, blah......but can we really pin total mkt action on this one 'developing, emerging mkt country'?  Hardly....but it is fun, isn't' it?   I mean you always look to deflect responsibility - or better yet - look to place blame....and for now - the Chinese economy seems to suit everyone just fine.....I mean we have to blame someone and we were tired of blaming the usual suspects...... Corp earnings, The FED,  Lack of inflation,   Housing slowdown,  Oil and other commodities,  - well you get the picture......
"
1014,TAP,"Yesterday  - as the world waited all day for Thursday night/Friday morning trading to begin once again in Asia the US mkt continued to come under pressure.   But again — no one threw the kitchen sink out the window or jumped off any roof.  Was it ugly, yes, was it frustrating, yes.  The Dow at one point was off more than 450 pts while the S&P was off over 46 pts……Nasdaq got slammed as well taking that index down more than 3% in early trade.…  It was the classic 'herd mentality' taking hold.....fear builds and people lose their sense of the bigger picture.....and the mkt swings and usually overshoots the reality......
"
1015,TAP,"After the absolute crushing that China took on Thursday - global mkts were naturally on edge.......Europe sold off and here in the US - the train kept coming......Mid morning yesterday — word spread that the Chinese gov’t was abandoning their circuit breakers - circuit breakers that were supposed to ease the chaos, but which in fact had only exaggerated it....and so — they did away with it…..which left European and American investors time to think about what that could mean.  Was it a good thing?  Would we witness the first major financial crisis of 2016?  Would the Chinese stock mkt implode on Friday?  And if so — what would be the knock on effect for Europe and the US…….
"
1016,TAP,"Well let’s get one thing straight….You don’t really think that the Chinese would abandon the curbs without making sure that the mkt would go UP  do you?How ridiculous would that be?  How would they be able to prove to the world that they were actually in control if they allowed their mkt to go over the edge?   I mean — You can just hear it, no?  Remember - China is a COMMUNIST country that is trying to be a CAPITALIST country with all of the state controls......so the gov't  made it very clear to investors —‘No selling allowed — otherwise we kill you….. Death by Firing Squad…’ and as so many of us sat glued to our computers last night at 9 pm……we waited and waited…..Japan, Australia opened lower — setting the tone…..US futures remained cautious….ticking slightly higher….as the seconds turned to mins and the Chinese mkt opened…..BOOM!!!!

Regulators removed the circuit breakers after plunges this week closed trading early on Monday and Thursday. The central bank set the currency’s reference rate little changed Friday after an eight-day stretch of weaker fixings that roiled global markets. State-controlled funds purchased Chinese stocks on Friday, focusing on financial shares and others with large weightings in benchmark indexes.    The scrapping of the circuit breaker system will help to stabilize the market, but a sense of panic will remain, particularly among retail investors, The ‘national team*’ will probably continue to buy stocks significantly to stabilize the market.""(*National Team = Gov't)

1026,TAP," Torture — the action of inflicting severe pain on someone as punishment: or to force them say or do something: or for the sole pleasure of the person inflicting the pain.  — that is what they do in war…..Chinese Water Torture — a process whereby water is slowly dripped onto a restrained person’s forehead, finally driving that person insane.  That is what they do to the stock mkt……slowly drive the investor insane…..By now - we are all well aware of the disaster that had taken place in global mkts since the beginning of the new year - that is unless you have been living under a rock - but either way - we have seen some $2.4 tril wiped out the value of global mkts....some of the blame can be placed squarely on broad macro themes, a breakdown in Apple (AAPL) shares, renewed nervousness concerning Mid East and North Korean geo-political issues, the coming earnings season, health of the consumer, etc.........but for the most part the most recent cause of mkt nervousness  has been front and center - China...  Right or wrong - they have become the scapegoat.....Now - look - there is a lot of 'stuff' going on there.....slowing Chinese economy, currency devaluation,  plunging commodity prices....blah, blah, blah......but can we really pin total mkt action on this one 'developing, emerging mkt country'?  Hardly....but it is fun, isn't' it?   I mean you always look to deflect responsibility - or better yet - look to place blame....and for now - the Chinese economy seems to suit everyone just fine.....I mean we have to blame someone and we were tired of blaming the usual suspects...... Corp earnings, The FED,  Lack of inflation,   Housing slowdown,  Oil and other commodities,  - well you get the picture......Yesterday  - as the world waited all day for Thursday night/Friday morning trading to begin once again in Asia the US mkt continued to come under pressure.   But again — no one threw the kitchen sink out the window or jumped off any roof.  Was it ugly, yes, was it frustrating, yes.  The Dow at one point was off more than 450 pts while the S&P was off over 46 pts……Nasdaq got slammed as well taking that index down more than 3% in early trade.…  It was the classic 'herd mentality' taking hold.....fear builds and people lose their sense of the bigger picture.....and the mkt swings and usually overshoots the reality......After the absolute crushing that China took on Thursday - global mkts were naturally on edge.......Europe sold off and here in the US - the train kept coming......Mid morning yesterday — word spread that the Chinese gov’t was abandoning their circuit breakers - circuit breakers that were supposed to ease the chaos, but which in fact had only exaggerated it....and so — they did away with it…..which left European and American investors time to think about what that could mean.  Was it a good thing?  Would we witness the first major financial crisis of 2016?  Would the Chinese stock mkt implode on Friday?  And if so — what would be the knock on effect for Europe and the US…….Well let’s get one thing straight….You don’t really think that the Chinese would abandon the curbs without making sure that the mkt would go UP  do you?How ridiculous would that be?  How would they be able to prove to the world that they were actually in control if they allowed their mkt to go over the edge?   I mean — You can just hear it, no?  Remember - China is a COMMUNIST country that is trying to be a CAPITALIST country with all of the state controls......so the gov't  made it very clear to investors —‘No selling allowed — otherwise we kill you….. Death by Firing Squad…’ and as so many of us sat glued to our computers last night at 9 pm……we waited and waited…..Japan, Australia opened lower — setting the tone…..US futures remained cautious….ticking slightly higher….as the seconds turned to mins and the Chinese mkt opened…..BOOM!!!!   Just like that it rocketed higher by 3% -  then sold off to -2.2%  (causing the first round of ‘deaths’)  which then served as a warning to anyone else who even considered hitting the SELL button…… Netflix should make a docu-series - ""China ! - How the State Manipulates Global Mkts""  I mean think about it…... UP, Really?  Well, yes in the short term...look that mkt is OFF 17% since Christmas.....so maybe it was a bit oversold.....The papers detail it precisely -  ""The Shanghei Composite Index closed 2 percent higher, after falling as much as 2.2 percent earlier. Regulators removed the circuit breakers after plunges this week closed trading early on Monday and Thursday. The central bank set the currency’s reference rate little changed Friday after an eight-day stretch of weaker fixings that roiled global markets. State-controlled funds purchased Chinese stocks on Friday, focusing on financial shares and others with large weightings in benchmark indexes.    The scrapping of the circuit breaker system will help to stabilize the market, but a sense of panic will remain, particularly among retail investors, The ‘national team*’ will probably continue to buy stocks significantly to stabilize the market.""(*National Team = Gov't)Ok..so guess what?  Yup....global mkts breathe a sigh of relief and the 'snap back relief rally' began.....European mkts WERE higher in initial trade but have since all turned lower - German industrial Production sorely disappointed - missing estimates at -0.3% vs. the +0.5% exp.... US futures are up nicely +15 pts  but off the highs of the early morning trade when we were up 25 pts....

1027,TAP,"Cybersecurity stocks zoomed higher Friday on Fortinet's (FTNT) back after the firm, late Thursday, topped Wall Street's Q4 billings views and announced a restructuring amid stalling growth.IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group rocketed 5.2% in early trading on the stock market today before settling to a gain of 1.8% in the afternoon. The group, though, is down 16% year to date.Shares of CyberArk Software (CYBR), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet led the way up Friday, rising 9.3%, 7% and 6.8%, respectively. Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) stock rose 2.6% on its own late-Thursday Q4 sales and earnings beat.But Proofpoint (PFPT) stock plunged 6.5% Friday, a day after the company beat Q4 sales views but reported that losses were expected to deepen in Q1.At least two analysts cut their price targets on Proofpoint stock Friday. Fortinet stock suffered at least one downgrade and two price target cuts.Fortinet delivered a ""billings beat that will be front and center this morning,"" FBR analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research report.For its Q4 ended Dec. 31, Fortinet reported $380.9 million in billings, up 35% year over year. The figure topped analysts expectations for $367.5 million and the company's three-months-ago guidance for between $364 million and $369 million, Ives wrote.Billings for 2015 were $1.2 billion, up 37%.Fortinet also reported 18 cents earnings per share ex items on $296.5 million in Q4 sales, up 21% and 32%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.Sales narrowly topped the consensus of 30 analysts for $296.2 million, and EPS met the model. Both measures were in line with Fortinet's guidance three months earlier for $293 million-$298 million and 18-19 cents.Fortinet wrapped 2015 with $1.01 billion in sales and 51 cents EPS ex items, exactly meeting Wall Street forecasts and in line with the company's earlier outlook.Current-quarter guidance for $270 million to $275 million in sales and 8-9 cents EPS ex items lagged the consensus for $277.7 million and 12 cents. Sales would be up 28% at the midpoint, but EPS would be flat to down 12.5% vs. the year-earlier quarter.The company expects Q1 billings of $315 million to $322 million, up 25% year over year at the midpoint of guidance. For 2016, Fortinet expects $1.5 billion to $1.52 billion in billings, a 23% year-over-year jump at the midpoint.Fortinet also announced a strategic restructuring within its U.S. enterprise sales force to focus on the midmarket and global enterprises ""following another quarter of disappointing growth,"" William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho wrote in a report. Ho maintained his outperform rating on Fortinet stock.Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski noted Q4 was the first in 11 straight quarters in which Fortinet failed to exceed the high end of guidance. Product revenue of $144.8 million trailed the consensus for $147.1 million and ""was the primary culprit,"" he wrote in a report.Nowinski reiterated his neutral rating and 30 price target on Fortinet stock.But subscription revenue of $151.8 million outgrew product revenue -- 34% year over year to 30.8% year over year -- and led Fortinet to a 73.1% gross margin in Q4 vs. consensus views for 71.6%, Nowinski wrote.During Q4, Fortinet signed 577 deals worth more than $100,000, 193 deals worth more than $250,000, and 74 deals for more than $500,000 -- vs. 384, 137 and 60 deals, respectively, in the year-earlier quarter, Ives wrote.""We believe this trend will continue into 2016, as Fortinet has a nice window of opportunity to move into larger enterprises,"" he wrote.Ives retained his outperform rating on Fortinet stock but cut his price target to 38 from 44.Analysts and investors split Friday on Proofpoint stock. Wall Street applauded Proofpoint's Q4 sales beat, but investors pulled out in droves after Q1 guidance showed losses deepening by 3-4 cents per share.Proofpoint stock sank by as much as 11.5% in Friday trading, touching a year-low.For its fiscal Q4 ended Dec. 31, Proofpoint reported $74.9 million in sales, up 33% year over year, and an 11-cent loss per share, deepening from a 9-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter.Billings of $97.5 million exceeded the consensus for $92.7 million, Credit Suisse analyst Philip Winslow wrote in a report.Sales narrowly topped the consensus view for $73.46 million, as well as Proofpoint's guidance three months ago for $72.5 million to $73.5 million. The 11-cent loss per share was in line with expectations of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters and Proofpoint's prediction of a loss per share of 11-12 cents.The year wrapped with a 36% year-over-year sales jump to $265.4 million and a 35 cents loss per share vs. a 40-cent loss in 2014. Analysts were expecting $264 million and a 35-cent loss per share vs. Proofpoint's guide to $263 million to $264 million and 35-36 cents.But the Q1 guide disappointed.For the current quarter, Proofpoint sees $75.5 million to $76.5 million in sales, up 32% at the midpoint of guidance, and a loss per share of 14-15 cents. The consensus expected a 9-cent loss, which would have been flat year over year, while sales were merely in line.Proofpoint upped its 2016 revenue and billings outlook to $345 million to $348 million, and $428 million to $431 million, respectively.The guidance doesn't take into account recent partnerships with Intel's (INTC) McAfee and Palo Alto Networks, Piper Jaffray's Nowinski wrote in a separate report. Both ventures involve threat-intelligence sharing and joint go-to-market strategies, and ""could drive upside to estimates.""Nowinski reiterated his overweight rating and 76 price target on Proofpoint stock.Winslow maintained his overweight rating on Proofpoint stock and called it ""one of our favorite small-cap ideas in our coverage."" Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury dubbed it ""the one to own"" and reiterated a buy rating and 80 price target.During Q4, Proofpoint's TAP (targeted area protection) product grew 100% year over year for the ninth consecutive quarter, Winslow wrote. Proofpoint also sees serious upsell and cross-sell opportunities, noting 44% of all customers use two or more products.Nandury expects Proofpoint to dig into its Fortune 100 and Fortune 1000 customers to gain market share over incumbents like Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Symantec (SYMC), Microsoft (MSFT), McAfee and Cisco Systems (CSCO).Check Point notched a 5-cent EPS ex-items beat for its Q4 ended Dec. 31, but the midpoints of its Q1 guidance fell short of Wall Street views.For its Q4, Check Point reported $458 million in sales and $1.20 EPS ex items, up 9% and 12% year over year, respectively. Both topped the consensus model for $457.1 million and $1.15.Three months ago, Check Point guided to $440 million to $470 million in sales and $1.10 to $1.18 EPS minus items.Check Point wrapped the year with $1.63 billion in sales and $4.17 EPS minus items. Sales were in line with the consensus view, but EPS topped Wall Street expectations by 4 cents, and Check Point beat the high-end of its own EPS guidance by 1 cent.For the current quarter, Check Point sees $395 million to $410 million in sales and 99 cents to $1.05 EPS minus items. On a year-over-year basis, that would be down 8% and 7%, respectively, at the midpoints of guidance.Wall Street projected $404.8 million and $1.04.Regardless of the soft view, William Blair's Ho reiterated his outperform rating on Check Point stock noting the company saw strong data center and subscription growth in Q4.And Check Point is bracing for competition, he wrote.""Our discussions with re-sellers and partners suggest Check Point has been much more aggressive in courting the channel and in trying to match pricing on deals than it has been historically,"" he wrote.It's also possible Check Point could mount up through an acquisition. On Thursday, Check Point CEO Gil Shwed didn't dismiss the question during the conference call.""We are looking at the entire spectrum,"" he told investors. ""And if we can find the right opportunity and mainly the right strategic match, it can be small, it can be large.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

1065,TAP,"Growth stock investors, take note: The future of some market winners may be driven by China's rapidly growing middle class. This section of the most populous country in the world is expected to offer big opportunities to companies able to tap into rising demand for a wide range of goods, from clothes to food to electronic gadgets.Jack Ma, the founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA), said in the company's annual report in October that China's middle-class population — now close to 300 million, or nearly the size of the entire U.S. — will grow to 500 million in the next decade.""China has an awesome consumer story,"" according to a post in May on the website of consulting firm McKinsey & Co. ""The reality is that Chinese consumers are going to continue to increase in wealth and complexity,"" said the report's authors, Jeffrey Towson, managing partner of investment firm Towson Capital, and Jonathan Woetzel, a director in McKinsey's Shanghai office.They added that Chinese consumers ""dwarf"" developing economies in nations such as Brazil, Russia and India in terms of household income.All of these countries get coverage in IBD's ""Global Leaders,"" today on Page B10.Retail Sales RisingHere's another fact to keep in mind: Ma says the level of consumption among the middle class is ""still well below their income level.""Chinese people tend to save much of what they earn because they lack retirement and health care safety nets.Nevertheless, retail sales jumped 11% in October from a year earlier to $445 billion, the biggest increase this year, according to the latest official data. Sales so far this year are running nearly 11% above last year's pace, led by a 35% jump in online sales.Ma has urged small and midsize Western companies to set up shop in China as the nation shifts from being an exporter to an importer that relies more on domestic consumption to fuel growth.Much of that consumption will be conducted online, which stands to benefit Alibaba and other online malls, such as JD.com (JD) and 58.com (WUBA).EMarketer, which tracks online commerce, says China is the world's biggest retail e-commerce market, estimating that it will account for just over 40% of global retail e-commerce sales this year.On Nov. 11 alone, Alibaba raked in $14.3 billion in the online shopping frenzy known as Singles' Day, an Alibaba creation that has far surpassed Cyber Monday as the world's biggest online shopping event.Costco Wholesale (COST) and Macy's (M) are among U.S. companies already selling to Chinese consumers through Alibaba. Other goods — such as apples from Washington state, seafood from Alaska and Ben & Jerry's ice cream — have also fared well in trials on Alibaba's TMall.com, according to news reports.Big OpportunitiesGoldman Sachs, in a 2015 report entitled ""The Rise of China's New Consumer Class,"" said only 11% of China's population has reached the middle class.""As their ranks swell, so will their effect on the global economy,"" Goldman said, adding, ""There will be huge opportunities for the entertainment, food service, technology and other industries"" able to understand Chinese consumer tastes and align pricing and product offerings accordingly.Cross-border purchases by China's online shoppers rose from less than $2 billion in 2010 to more than $20 billion in 2014, with the U.S. the destination of choice for clothing, personal care items and baby products, Bloomberg said April 21, citing eMarketer.Most Chinese consumers who engaged in cross-border shopping did so because they thought foreign merchants could assure better quality amid concerns about counterfeit goods on Chinese websites, eMarketer said on Sept. 22, citing the China Internet Network and Information Center.Alibaba itself has been hit by accusations that it hosts merchants selling fake goods, which prompted Ma to promise to eliminate counterfeits from the site.

1083,TAP,"Creativity comes from a jumble of activities, ways of thinking and style of interacting with the world.How anyone can tap into it:Lift lids. Originality and open-mindedness go hand in hand.“A frame of mind that’s explorative -- that’s so critical,” said Carolyn Gregoire, co-author with psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman of “Wired to Create.”Intellectual curiosity -- welcoming new thoughts and novel experiences -- fuels thinkers. “We found this is the No. 1 trait associated with creative achievement in arts and science,” Gregoire told IBD.Cloud-gaze. Some see daydreaming as idle in a results-driven world. Not so fast. It can be an apt tool for discovering the untapped.Scientist Charles Darwin took contemplative walks with his dog. Author Gertrude Stein drove around a farm until she found a cow that inspired her.“That was one of the quirkier examples,” said Gregoire of Stein. “For her, that was getting into her Zen state of mind. A lot of people have their own version of this.” Be a receiver. “Don’t Think!” That’s the sign author Ray Bradbury kept over his typewriter. Apple (AAPL) co-founder Steve Jobs deemed hunches “more powerful than intellect.”Through intuition, insights arrive unintentionally as our minds churn without applied guidance.Gregoire and Kaufman put it this way: “Insights are like gifts from the unconscious mind.”To elicit them, tune into your inner and outer worlds and listen for flashes of brilliance.Get away. Ideas need time and space to emerge, so don’t drown them out. “We talk a lot in the book about the importance of solitude,” said Gregoire.Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman retreated to an island cabin to think and write. Poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe also believed in alone time. “One can be instructed in society; one is inspired only in solitude,” he said.The 21st century executive has to be deliberate about blocking out hours for quiet contemplation.“We need that time away from people and away from technology to drop down into another state of mind,” Gregoire said. “I can’t overstate how important that is.”Dig dirt. Adult life is serious, but it shouldn’t be all the time.Imaginative play -- at any age -- opens the mind.“This is something that is so critical for creativity,” said Gregoire.In Swiss forest kindergartens, kids spend an entire school year outside, exploring, playing games and building structures with found objects. What do they gain beyond creative muscle? Social, emotional and motor dexterity.“Through play, they are getting all of these key skills,” Gregoire said.Stand tall. A different or uncommon view is what makes an iconoclast -- and sometimes an outcast.Courage is essential for nonconformists. They ask questions that seem impertinent and take positions that appear outlandish at first blush.Gregoire and Kaufman point out that highly creative people -- from inventor Thomas Edison to author J.K. Rowling -- face skepticism and rejection.Joke around. A 2015 study by Harvard, Columbia and Insead researchers found that sarcasm can spark original thought at work.The results, published in the journal Organizational Behavior & Human Decision Processes, found that participants who were placed in sarcastic conversation groups did better than those involved in sincere chatter on creativity tasks.The crafting of a sarcastic comment -- and interpretation of it -- requires abstract thinking, which exercises the mind.

1086,TAP,"Intercontinental Exchange Chairman and Chief Executive Jeffrey Sprecher has shown skill at winning at the high-stakes acquisition game.Sprecher acquired Continental Power Exchange, the predecessor to Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), or ICE, for $1 in 1997. His idea was to develop a more transparent and efficient electronic market for over-the-counter energy trades.Three years later, Sprecher and energy-trading partners converted Continental into ICE, and the company has made a number of acquisitions since then, including the New York Board of Trade in 2007, Creditex in 2008, the Clearing Corporation in 2009, NYSE Euronext in November 2013 and the Singapore Mercantile Exchange in 2014.In December, Sprecher rolled the dice again when he acquired Interactive Data Corp., a top provider of financial data and analytics, in a $5.2 billion cash-and-stock deal. The purchase from private-equity firms Silver Lake and Warburg Pincus is part of an effort to tap into a strong growth opportunity, the company says. IDC serves the mutual fund, bank, asset management, hedge fund, securities, and financial instrument processing and administration sectors.“It's the increasing need for more information to optimize capital efficiency when you manage risk,” Sprecher said on the company's third-quarter conference call.  ""And as bank balance sheets have become constrained and as regulation requires collateral for all risk positions, we believe that there will be increasing demand for the data, information and solutions as to the cost of holding, hedging and managing risk.”Acquisitions have helped ICE log steady double-digit earnings growth and strong revenue gains. It has grown from operating an energy swaps market into a global powerhouse operating a network of 11 global exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange.ICE’s exchanges include equity and equity options exchanges, as well as futures exchanges that establish benchmark prices for interest rates, equity indexes, energy, metals and agricultural commodities. ICE also operates seven central clearing houses.Roughly 70% of IDC’s revenue comes from providing evaluated pricing of “hard-to-value, thinly traded” fixed-income securities, with the other 30% from widely distributed data and technology platforms, the company says.""Historically, energy volume from the trading business has been the core of the business,” Jefferies analyst Daniel Fannon told Investor's Business Daily. “The business has increasingly become more diverse via acquisitions and organic growth. Last year it had growth on the nontransactional side of the business. The recent acquisition of International Data Corp. gave them more exposure to data, and should help that growth going forward.""Rob Rutschow analyst for Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia told IBD: “One of the aspects of the IDC acquisition that’s nice is it has a fairly (large) recurring revenue stream, which has lower volatility than its traditional trading business. (With IDC) ICE has the opportunity to try to take share from some of the large incumbents in the (financial data services) market.”He says ICE is a smaller competitor in the market when compared to Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters (TRI) and FactSet Research Systems (FDS).“There is an opportunity for ICE to take market share,” Rutschow adds. “ICE can expand IDC’s reach and scope with their base and proprietary data and scope.”Still, Rutschow says there are probably more risks to the IDC deal “than meets the eye.”“I think the risk is they had bad timing, given IDC is fixed-income oriented and we’re starting to see big banks reduce their head counts in their fixed-income business,” he said. “I see a potential risk in the fixed-income market data business in general.”ICE expects the IDC acquisition will be more than 5% accretive to full-year 2016 earnings.Prior to the buy, ICE’s data business spanned nine asset classes across the 11 exchanges and seven clearing houses it operates. It offers benchmark and valuation services for Libor, exchange-traded funds and a range of financial derivatives.“ICE had data (services) before the IDC deal, when they acquired the New York Stock Exchange,” said Fannon. “They are now focused on (data services) as a channel of new growth. They’re looking at ways to package the various data services in a more unified way to their customers. As markets become more fragmented and globalized, the need (for data) by customers on the trading side trading is increasing.”Jefferies' Fannon adds that the IDC acquisition is “rather significant” because it gets ICE into the fixed-income market in a “significant way” and it is similar to other aspects of its business.ICE also acquired Trayport from BGC Partners (BGCP) and GFI Group for approximately $650 million in December. Trayport licenses its technology platform to serve brokers for electronic and hybrid trade execution,  primarily in the European over-the-counter utility markets.Rutschow says acquisitions helped drive revenue and earnings higher year over year in the third quarter. For that period, ICE’s adjusted earnings rose 24% to $2.91 a share and revenue rose 10% to $816 million.He estimates overall transaction and trading-related revenue was flat in 2015. Rutschow expects that market data services, now around 25% of ICE’s business, will increase to 40% of the business. He estimates that its legacy energy trading business accounts for around 25% of ICE’s business and the rest of the trading business is also around 25%.ICE will report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 4 before the opening bell.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect fourth-quarter adjusted earnings to rise 16% to $3.01 a share. They see full-year 2015 earnings rising 23% to $11.86.“Fourth-quarter trading activity has been good, and generally it was a good quarter from a volume perspective,” said Fannon.Rutschow’s outlook is mixed.“On a longer-term cyclical basis there are a lot of headwinds over the next several years, including low prices for commodities,” he said.

"
1096,TAP," Set limits. Risk is a factor in any business. Decide how much is too much. ""A founder of a slow startup must know when to tap out and not go into further personal reserves or debt,"" Robertson told IBD. ""It always takes longer than you think.

""We want the freedom to make all of those decisions,"" Gravina said.Money decisions weigh on struggling bootstrappers and thriving entrepreneurs. Factors to follow on the funding landscape: Consider the sources. Entrepreneurs gathered capital from a variety of sources in 2014. The majority — 82% — funded themselves.Loans and lines of credit were sought by 41% of entrepreneurs, and 24% asked friends or family members for money.Just 1% sought venture capital, and 3% tapped crowdfunding platforms — and many used more than one funding source.That's all according to statistics from the National Venture Capital Association. Proceed carefully. The high failure rate among first-time entrepreneurs makes self-funding a dicey proposition.""It's amazing how many people plow through their life savings, sacrifice the well-being of their families and risk their physical health in a business endeavor that is doomed from the outset,"" said Rod Robertson, managing partner of Briggs Capital, a merger and acquisitions firm, who wrote ""Winning at Entrepreneurship."" Set limits. Risk is a factor in any business. Decide how much is too much. ""A founder of a slow startup must know when to tap out and not go into further personal reserves or debt,"" Robertson told IBD. ""It always takes longer than you think. Know how long you can go without a salary."" Build a circle. Don't forge alone. ""Find a knowledgeable and relevant advisor who has a great network and track record in your sector,"" Robertson said. An insider or veteran brings industry knowledge and connections. But beware this pitfall: ""A founder brings on the wrong advisor that misguides or tries to shanghai the company."" Hang tough. Pause before rushing for funding. ""Try to get along as far as you can without taking money,"" Robertson said.Seek capital too early, and ""your valuation will be low, and you will give up too much,"" he said. Figure it up.

1108,TAP,"By now, you probably have a good idea what your 2015 income will total. Your 2014 tax return will show what tax bracket you were in.Savvy planning now might help you make the most of this knowledge. You could tap your IRA, tax-efficiently.This can turbocharge your retirement planning. To see how it might work, suppose that a hypothetical Jim and Ann Bell are ages 62 and 60. Their reported 2014 taxable income was $200,000. The Bells expect their 2015 income to be about the same.So the Bells are in the 28% tax bracket. In 2015, it covers taxable income from $151,201 to $230,450.The Bells could withdraw up to $30,000 from their IRAs as income by year-end and remain in the 28% bracket: They'd owe $8,400 in tax on that $30,000 withdrawal.Why would the Bells do this? They might think they'll face a higher tax rate in the future if their taxable income shoots up.That could happen after they reach age 70-1/2, when they must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their traditional IRAs. By tapping their traditional IRAs now, at a 28% rate, the Bells will reduce future taxable RMDs.If the Bells don't need the money now, they can move the $30,000 to Roth IRAs. They'd still owe tax on $30,000 of IRA distributions, but they'd still have the rest of the money. And after five years and after age 59-1/2, all of their Roth IRA distributions will be tax-free.In this example, the Bells are older than 59-1/2. They won't owe a penalty on the $30,000 IRA distributions. Those under 59-1/2 may owe a 10% penalty when tapping their IRA.But there are exemptions. For example, IRA distributions up to the amount spent on college costs this year will be taxed but not penalized, regardless of your age.Zeroing InTaxpayers with somewhat lower incomes also can benefit from year-end bracket planning. In 2015, the 10% and 15% tax brackets cover single taxpayers with taxable income up to $37,450, or up to $74,900 for couples filing jointly.Note that these figures are for taxable income after deductions. Gross income on joint returns could be $80,000, $90,000 or even more, yet the taxable income could still be in the 15% bracket.Individuals and couples with such incomes could take IRA distributions by year-end 2015, up to the top of the 15% bracket. They could put the money into a Roth IRA — in effect, a Roth IRA conversion — if that's what they want.What's more, long-term capital gains taken by such taxpayers qualify for a 0% tax rate. A couple with $60,000 of taxable income this year could sell stocks and consequently realize nearly $15,000 of cap gains by Dec. 31 without owing federal tax on those gains.And higher-income taxpayers also can use the 0% tax rate, though indirectly. They can give appreciated assets to low-bracket taxpayers, including relatives.Suppose the Bells are helping Jim's parents financially. They might give the older couple $25,000 worth of mutual funds shares, purchased for $10,000.Then Jim's parents could sell the shares and report the $15,000 gain. As long as the senior Bells' income remains below $74,900, even with that gain, they'd owe 0% tax.If you decide to give away appreciated assets for this purpose, pay attention to the annual gift tax exclusion. In 2015, each individual can give up to $14,000 apiece to any number of recipients.No tax will be due. And filing a gift tax return won't be required.

1109,TAP,"The European Central Bank opened its money tap only slightly Thursday after raising market expectations of a more forceful move to jolt the economy out of its brush with deflation.Instead of expanding its asset purchases beyond 60 billion euros ($66 billion) per month, the ECB pushed back the purchase program's earliest end date by six months to March 2017. It left its key lending rate unchanged but dropped the interest rate paid on assets that banks park overnight at the ECB further into negative territory, from -0.2% to -0.3%.ECB President Mario Draghi called the move ""adequate,"" but economists saw it as the bare minimum, and investors weren't impressed: European stock indexes sold off more than 2%. The euro, which had fallen in anticipation of ECB action, surged nearly 3% against the dollar.The ECB's surprising caution also weighed on U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 falling 1.4% and the Nasdaq 1.7%. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury spiked 13 basis points to 2.31%, near its highest level since July.The dollar's strength against global currencies has helped to stall the U.S. manufacturing recovery, with the latest reading on national factory activity from the Institute for Supply Management showing an outright contraction.Fed Set To Raise RatesAs the ECB and other central banks make their monetary policies even easier, the Fed seems set to begin raising rates when it meets later this month. That may keep the dollar on the rise as investors seeking higher yields put money in dollar-based assets.Fed Chair Janet Yellen told Congress on Thursday that the dollar's strength, along with weak global growth, has depressed exports and resulted in ""a subtraction from growth.""""That makes us much more cautious in terms of raising rates,"" she said.A less aggressive path by the ECB, therefore, could ease the path of U.S. rates higher.The euro shot up 3.07 cents to $1.0956 after earlier flirting with a 12-year low of $1.05. Still, the euro is down more than 20% vs. the buck over the past 18 months.With core inflation in the eurozone falling to just 0.9% in November, and the jobless rate still at 10.7%, the question is why the ECB didn't follow through on its aggressive signals. Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS Global Insight, offered three possibilities, all of which may have played a role.German ResistanceOne is that ECB policymakers may not think that the central bank's own outlook warrants more aggressive action. That forecast has consumer inflation rising to 1.6% next year, not too far below the 2% target.""It may also be that the ECB wants to keep some ammunition up its sleeve"" should its forecast turn out to be too optimistic, Archer wrote.Draghi noted that the ""economic recovery in the euro area continues to be dampened by subdued growth prospects in emerging markets and moderate global trade. These risks have the potential to weigh on global growth and foreign demand for euro-area exports and on confidence more widely.""The third possibility: ""Draghi may have felt unable to deliver as much stimulus as he really wanted to due to objections from a significant faction within the ECB, led by the German contingent,"" Archer wrote.Draghi noted in his press conference that there was less-than-unanimous support even for the modest actions announced.Euro Below $1 Next Year?Still, the euro's snap-back rally may turn out to be short-lived.Jay Bryson, global economist at Wells Fargo Securities, noted that his bank's currency strategists see the euro falling below $1 by next summer for the first time since 2002.In other words, the ECB's decision not to do all that much is probably not a huge deal. Bryson said it may revisit its approach next summer — much as the Fed did with its multi-stage quantitative easing — and a more aggressive policy only ""helps at the margins.""While an even stronger dollar won't be great news for U.S. exporters, ""the biggest effect on export growth is growth in the rest of the world,"" Bryson said.The news on that front is just so-so, with Wells Fargo expecting a very modest acceleration from 3% global economic growth this year to 3.2% in 2016, as contracting economies like Russia and Brazil hit bottom, and eurozone growth picks up to 2% from 1.5%.

1112,TAP,"Just as the stock market goes through a correction, earnings for the tech companies in the S&P 500 are expected to record their first year-over-year decline in the past 10 quarters.A slowing China, weak global economy, strong dollar, poor PC sales and the shift to cloud computing continue to weigh on the tech sector, and the top tech companies' Q4 EPS are seen falling for the first time since Q2 2013.""Tech remains stuck in a low-growth environment, and the interaction of rising interest rates, a strong dollar, weak oil and commodities are increasing risk,"" said Bill Whyman, head of technology strategy research at Evercore ISI.Tech spending growth generally is slow, says Whyman, but he adds that underneath the surface, there is an aggressive shift in spending that favors companies connected to cloud computing, including providers of software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms and young, disruptive Internet companies.Apple, Facebook, Amazon Earnings On TapThus far, 13 of the 68 tech companies in the S&P 500 have reported earnings, including Intel (INTC) and IBM (IBM), which both provided tepid guidance that sent their shares falling.The tech earnings season gets into full swing starting Tuesday, with the biggest company of them all — Apple (AAPL) — set to report that day after the market close amid fast falling expectations for sales of its top product, the iPhone. On Wednesday comes Facebook (FB) and Qualcomm (QCOM), both after the close. On Thursday it's Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), also after the close. Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) reports on Monday, Feb. 1, after the close.The consensus estimate for the 68 tech companies in the S&P 500 is for earnings per share minus items to fall 3.4% from the year-earlier quarter, the fourth quarter in a row of deceleration. Subtracting Apple, which has the largest impact of any company in S&P 500, tech earnings would fall 6.7%, according to estimates collected by Thomson Reuters.For the S&P 500 as a whole, analysts call for EPS ex items, such as stock options and one-time expenses, to fall 4.5%. That drop is largely due to the ailing energy sector, which is expected to see its EPS tumble 73%. Excluding the energy sector, EPS is expected to rise 1.6% overall.Tech companies have long been the innovation trendsetters, turning in strong earnings that usually put the industry at or near the top of the best-performing groups in the S&P 500. Not now. In terms of earnings performance, tech is in the middle of the pack among the 10 industry groups in the S&P 500.""The tech sector is now more of a mirror of the S&P index as whole,"" said Gregory Harrison, earnings analyst at Thomson Reuters.The tech industry has been stuck in slow-growth mode at the same time it's going through a once-in-a-decade secular shift — the move to cloud computing — which has shattered old ways of using technology, says Evercore ISI's Whyman. Rather than buy large computer servers and storage systems for business operations, companies and other enterprises are lowering costs by turning to Internet-based cloud computing services provided by companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet.Cloud Computing Drives TechnologyCloud computing is the dominant force in technology and will continue to accelerate, says Whyman. Among other things, cloud computing has spurred the emergence of SaaS, provided on demand as needed. SaaS leaders include Salesforce.com (CRM).Moreover, many providers of cloud services are buying lower-cost hardware from Taiwan and mainland China, opting for stripped-down hardware of their own design instead of brand-name products. That is rattling some of the largest information technology companies, such as IBM, Cisco Systems (CSCO), Oracle (ORCL) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), all of which are undergoing major transitions.This disruption is happening amid slower sales of PCs and now-slowing growth for smartphones and tablets.Global PC shipments fell 8.3% in the fourth quarter vs. Q4 2014, to just under 76 million units, according to preliminary results by market tracker Gartner. It was the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment declines. For the year, PC shipments fell 8% to 288.7 million units. Gartner expects PC shipments to fall this year as well, but only by 1%, and it anticipates a soft recovery later in 2016.Global semiconductor sales fell 2% in 2015 to $334 billion, Gartner says, attributed not just to PCs, but also in part to weakened demand for electronic equipment amid the cloud shift and the continuing impact of the strong dollar.Strong Dollar Hurts Tech ResultsThe strong dollar, which makes U.S. exports more expensive, is more difficult for tech companies than other sectors.""A big variable remains the U.S. dollar, as it has a huge impact on tech,"" said Whyman. ""Tech derives more revenue from outside the U.S. than any other S&P sector.""Apple, despite the popularity of its products and huge size, is not immune to the fallout. When Apple reports earnings on Tuesday, its performance in China will be closely watched. China accounted for an estimated 25% of all iPhone sales in 2015. Slower economic growth in China and slower sales of smartphones globally are expected to pressure its earnings growth. The consensus on Apple is EPS growth of 6% year over year, which would be its slowest growth in eight quarters.As always, analysts will focus on corporate guidance, and the outlook might be especially important in this earnings cycle amid a rough start to 2016 for global stock markets.""The range of uncertainty is widening, so there is a greater interest in clues as to what 2016 might hold,"" Whyman said.Among the 12 subsectors in the S&P 500 tech group, application software leads with an expected average EPS increase of 44%. The group includes Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Salesforce.com.The Internet software and services group is expected to have the second-best performance among the tech subsectors. This includes Facebook and Alphabet, which continue to ride the rising tide of mobile and online ad growth. Facebook is expected to show EPS growth of 26%, while Alphabet is expected to post growth of 18%.Friday, some of the biggest tech companies reporting earnings in the coming week rose ahead of the major stock market indexes.Apple stock lifted 5.3% to 101.42, Facebook gained 4% to 97.94, Amazon rose 3.7% to 596.38 and Microsoft logged a 3.6% boost to 52.29.

1113,TAP,"When Barack Obama first seized the White House back in 2009, his website promised ""the most transparent administration in history.""In 2013, the Democrat announced: ""This is the most transparent administration in history."" And if you like your doctor.....Now comes the Congressional Research Service to document that, well, that's just another Obama promise/claim.The CRS just published a detailed look at what are called Federal Advisory Committees. Yes, yes, it sounds arcane. That's how the Washington bureaucracy gets away with so much stuff. Make it sound as boring as humanly possible, like a Joe Biden speech on Scranton. And the people will leave you alone, tune out.But don't you dare. For one thing, you're shelling out a third of a billion dollars for these things. And you don't even know what they do. That's $915,000 every single day.Congress -- yes, those folks again -- created the Federal Advisory Committee Act in 1972. Like many Washington ideas, it sounds like a swell one going in. Allow the feds to tap into the experience and knowledge of experts outside government. Consolidate all those unregulated advisory committees and boards that were, well, allegedly advising the federal government. They'd have to report who was on them, what they got paid, what if anything they did. All that.The cool thing is anybody can create a FAC -- Congress, a president and any of his agencies. According to the Research Service's new report, during the 2014 fiscal year, of the 989 existing Federal Advisory Committees with 68,179 appointed members 825 of those committees held 7,173 meetings that cost $334 million.It's quite an honor to be on these things. Prestigious line on a resume. You get expenses paid to meetings and government folks appear to listen. Health and Human Services has the most advisory committees, 264. Agriculture is second with 166. Homeland Security is down near the bottom with just 27 because it knows pretty much everything already.The number of committees has been pretty steady during the last fiscal decade at around 980. However, there was a real spurt in 2011 up to 1,029 committees. That was when Obama was organizing his reelection campaign. But that's probably coincidence.Here's what we've been leading up to: In the 2013 and 2014 fiscal years only 23% of the committee meetings were open to the public, as they're supposed to be without compelling reason. To put it another way, 77% of all the advisory committee meetings were closed to the people paying for them. Thanks. Now get out.Coincidentally, those increased secret meetings occurred after Obama's reelection when voters lost all leverage on this guy.As our astute colleague Chuck Ross over at the Daily Caller points out, ""Overall, the ratio of open meetings was higher during the George W. Bush years than during the Obama years.""But wait! That would mean the current administration can't possibly be the most transparent administration in history. And that, in turn, means that Barack Obama has been wrong every time he made that claim. We need a Federal Advisory Committee to explain how that could be?RELATED:Joe Biden meets with transparency czar, but the meeting is closedNew polls show Carson and Cruz surging and Trump kinda wobblyThat deadly firefight against ISIS wasn't combat, Obama aides sayObama draws another red line, but this one is against U.S. military

1201,TAP,"Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and other oil majors reported huge declines in earnings last week, and top U.S. shale producers are seen reporting equally large drops in earnings this week as oil prices remain under pressure.OPEC has kept output high to hold prices down as it competes with U.S. shale producers, hoping that cheap crude will cool their fracking activity, a more expensive method of producing oil than conventional drilling.So far, the shale industry has been more resilient than expected as it slashed costs, focused on the most productive oil fields and deployed new technology and practices. But those moves might not be enough anymore, and producers may have to follow Big Oil with more spending and job cuts.Questions have also cropped up over how shale firms will maintain cash flow with oil prices still low, banks getting tighter and investors in capital markets turning skittish.Continental Resources (CLR), a bellwether in the shale sector, announces Q3 results Wednesday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Continental to swing to a 12-cent per-share loss from a profit of 81 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue is seen falling 45% to $638 million.Oasis Petroleum (OAS) is also on tap for Wednesday. Analysts expect the company's EPS to sink 88.5% to 6 cents and revenue to decline 35% to $238.7 million.Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) will announce on Wednesday too. The shale firm's EPS is expected to plunge 80.7% to 21 cents, and revenue is seen falling 20% to $560.2 million.Concho Resources (CXO) is slated for Thursday. Analysts see EPS diving 81% to 21 cents and revenue down 20% to $560.2 million.EOG Resources (EOG) also reports Thursday.

1213,TAP,"And BOOM - it happened!  They pushed oil up and thru the weekly middle Bollinger Band line yesterday....sending oil up 4% - ending the day at $47.90..... and this triggered a wave of buy orders in the energy names....and boy did they have a field day......Exxon Mobil  (XOM), Chevron (CVX) all enjoying the company of the long term asset manager - as so much money was put to work......Now look - these names have performed better in the last month.....expectations of weaker earnings did not scare away the investor...in fact - like we have said - these names have gotten slaughtered,  but the story is changing and many now see an opportunity....(This is not new news - we have been saying this for a while now.....)
"
1214,TAP," Now this excitement did send stocks higher from the opening bell - at one point taking the mkt up 150 pts.........and although  buying interest faded a little as we moved into the closing bell - it was not enough dampen the excitement.  But this does pose a issue.....yesterday's move did push us further into extremely overbought territory.
"
1215,TAP,"For the last few weeks, it seems that the plan was to push the mkt back to the old highs......and so far - it seems to be working.....as we are only 25 pts away from the 2015 highs on the S&P and only 50 pts away from the S&P breaching the long term uptrend line at 2159 (drawn back from December 2014). Nasdaq is 100 pts away from its high and 240 pts away from its longer term uptrend line while the Dow is 400 pts away from its highs and 840 pts away from breaching its longer term upwards trend line at 18,740......  None of those moves is out of the question at all....as they only represent between a 2% & 4% move from here on the indices....
"
1216,TAP,"Q: Did the FED manufacture this rally?   A: -DUH!    And if the mkt senses that they do nothing in December - then we can prepare for an even more potentially dramatic move up.....
"
1217,TAP,"I mean look - you have to accept the fact that this rally is NOT being driven by earnings - which so far are down 3.9%....and nor is it being driven by fundamentals.....so it does make it difficult to see how the mkt can move 'much' higher - but compared to some of the alternatives - what else are equity investors to do?
"
1218,TAP,"Now yesterday we learned  that factory orders took another HIT -  dropping for 11 straight months down 1% but  guess what - new cars sales were up.  Now this is an interesting stat.....new car sales....or are they new car leases?  The sharing economy has created a boom for disrupters like UBER and LYFT and other car sharing businesses...so  rising car sales or leases does make sense....but does that mean that the consumer or the broader economy is firing on all 8 cylinders?   Hardly.......But that is the story we are being told.....80% of the macro data continues to disappoint - while 20% of the macro data 'surprises' us....so I guess we should eliminate the 80% and just go with the 20%....

1221,TAP,"So the Dow and S&P may stop short right in here - making an intermediate-term top  after the jobs report is released.  The S&P is now up 12% off the October lows of 1870.....That is a dramatic move in 4 weeks.....so a topping pattern and some digestion is appropriate.....I would not be surprised if we saw the mkt back off and test the 'flattening'  200 dma at 2062....over the next week or so.....Now if oil prices mysteriously continue to climb, then  we could test the summer highs ..... Look for major oil resistance at $54..... Where is GS on this call - last I heard they were calling for $20/ barrel - sooner rather than later.....Thoughts?

1253,TAP,"The lifting of sanctions against Iran could be a double-edged sword for Schlumberger (SLB) as it gets ready to report fourth-quarter results Friday amid a round of layoffs and oil prices that have plunged to below $30 a barrel.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the oilfield service provider to report a 58% drop in quarterly earnings to 63 cents per share. Revenue is seen falling 38.2% to $7.8 billion.In December, Schlumberger said it would cut more jobs in the fourth quarter ""in light of expected reduced activity for 2016."" Industry peers Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) have already slashed tens of thousands of jobs due to weak demand for their services as U.S rig counts fall as low crude prices make many projects unprofitable. Halliburton has a deal to buy Baker Hughes, which regulators have yet to approve.Halliburton is scheduled to announce quarterly results Monday.On Saturday the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog confirmed that Iran has curbed its nuclear program, allowing Western sanctions to be lifted and unfreezing $100 billion in assets. Oilfield-service companies may get a boost if their equipment can be used for drilling. But the return of Iranian crude on the world market will push oil prices even lower as Saudi-lead OPEC is unlikely to scale back production to make room for Iran's additional output. Depressed oil prices would put more pressure on U.S. shale firms and reduce business in America.The International Energy Agency said markets will stay oversupplied this year. Oil prices have been down since the start of the year on weak manufacturing data out of China and oversupply worries.U.S. and Brent crude prices were trading below $29 per barrel late Tuesday.Schlumberger closed down 0.3% to 62.82 in the stock market Tuesday. Halliburton fell 3.4% and Baker Hughes dipped 0.25%.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter @IBD_GRich.Starbucks' (SBUX) fiscal-first-quarter results are expected to decelerate slightly from previous quarters, but same-store sales are seen getting a boost from the coffee titan's mobile aggressiveness, among other factors.When the Seattle-based java giant reports after the close on Thursday, analysts expect earnings of 45 cents a share, a 12.5% year-over-year climb but a slowdown from preceding quarters' growth of 16% and 24%.Revenue is seen growing 12.3% to $5.39 billion. The company has logged 18% sales growth for the last three consecutive quarters.Domestic same-store sales will likely come in ahead of estimates, says one analyst.""Our recent checks of 5% of U.S. locations indicate Americas comp growth in the high-single digits, above current 7.7% consensus,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan in a Tuesday note. He expects 8%-9% comp growth.While that would be in line with 8% growth in Q4 and Q3 and a 7% gain in Q2, it would mark significant acceleration from the prior year's 5% increase.Shares were up 1.3% in the stock market today.On Tuesday, the company announced the launch of a partnership between Spotify and over 7,500 U.S. Starbucks locations, in which customers can use the Starbucks mobile app to identify what music is playing in the store and listen to Starbucks-curated songs on the streaming music service.The move aligns with Starbucks' greater mobile strategy as it continues to push its smartphone app, which is tied to a sizable loyalty program. My Starbucks Rewards had over 20 million members as of its Q4 report in late October, and mobile payments accounted for 21% of all U.S. transactions.""Given the continued benefit from differentiated food offerings, mobile ordering, delivery, continued compelling beverage (limited time only offerings), throughput, and loyalty and mobile adoption initiatives, we believe Americas comp growth is poised for sustained mid- to high-single-digit comp momentum,"" said Setyan.Starbucks' mobile-order-and-pay feature, which allows customers to order ahead of arriving at the store, remains a ""potential game changer"" as it gains users, he wrote.Meanwhile, Starbucks continues to introduce new food and drink offerings, including alcoholic beverages in some stores.Additionally, Starbucks has been optimistic about market expansion into China, with plans to open 500 stores there this year, and a broader goal of operating 3,400 stores in the country by 2019. CEO Howard Schultz said in prepared remarks last week that it is ""conceivable"" that China could become the company's largest market, surpassing its Americas unit.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter @IBD_ELow.RELATED:China GDP Growth Is Weakest In At Least 25 YearsStarbucks Leads IBD 50 Stocks With Earnings On TapStarbucks To Expand; China May Become Biggest Market.

1254,TAP,"Single women in or nearing retirement can have it tough. Consider the lot of Sari Simmons: To make ends meet, this personal care provider works 40 hours a week and collects Social Security.But with no ""surplus"" money for savings, and high health care costs, this 63-year-old won't soon be retiring. ""Being single,"" explains Simmons, of New Jersey, ""you can't rely on anyone else to share (in covering) your expenses.""Her story is hardly unique. Even as hordes of baby boomers push into retirement years, some with slim savings, data show unmarried women are particularly at risk.""Single women tend to have earned less and saved less. Their lower earnings lead to smaller Social Security benefits,"" noted financial planner David Rae of Los Angeles. ""Add the fact that women tend to outlive men, and you have a recipe for financial disaster.""Consider: Fully 26.9% of divorced women 62 or older, who divorced after age 50, are poor, according to a new study by Susan Brown and I-Fen Lin of Bowling Green State University. Among ""gray"" (62 or older) women who never married, 25.3% are poor, while 13.7% of late widows are impoverished. By comparison, 11.4% of older men who divorced after age 50 are poor, as well as 13.6% of never-married men.Of course, many single women aren't hurting financially. And for those who are struggling, help is available — from careful budgeting and spending, to working in ""retirement"" years, to maximizing one's Social Security benefit. As author and financial advisor Kimberly Foss holds, ""It's never too late"" to take action.Among the steps to consider:• Emergency fund. "" The very first thing that's needed is an emergency fund,"" said Foss, of Roseville, Calif. Initially, this would cover a minimum of three months' living expenses, moving up to a six months' minimum. ""Without that fund, people would end up dipping into investable assets,"" Foss said. One way to get started, she suggests: Acorns provides a smartphone app that takes spare change from everyday purchases and automatically puts it into a diversified portfolio.• Understand Social Security. The website ssa.gov fully details Social Security's benefits, including provisions specific to widows and divorcees, and the Medicare program, notes financial advisor Carmen Wu.• Make a budget. Define necessary ""fixed"" costs and ""variable"" lifestyle expenses, such as vacations and dining out, says Wu, of Vienna, Va. Determine how to afford the desired retirement. If fixed expenses won't be affordable, consider options such as a smaller home, a reverse mortgage or continuing to work.• Tap assets strategically. A method suggested by financial advisor Pamela Sams: ""Start with your guaranteed retirement income, such as a pension, annuities and Social Security. (But if possible, wait until age 70 to claim Social Security.) Fifty percent of your retirement income should come from those consistent, fixed resources,"" said Sams, of Herndon, Va. Perhaps ""several years later, look to assets whose value changes with the markets, including your brokerage accounts, 401(k) and IRAs. If possible, delay tapping into your (standard) IRA until you must start doing so at age 70-1/2.""And for those who don't feel financially savvy, help is available. Experts point out that retirement income calculators are widely available on the Internet, on such sites as bankrate.com and aarp.org.And, of course, people can turn to a financial advisor. But those who can't afford one can seek help from the Financial Planning Association (FPA). Through its chapters, it provides free financial advice to those who cannot otherwise afford it, says advisor Wu.

1278,TAP,"Past success doesn't guarantee future prosperity. Vitality lessons from longstanding firms: Aim for stars. John Mahdessian had big ideas when he took over Madame Paulette, the high-end New York City dry cleaner his great uncle opened in 1959, which his father ran until 1987.About that time, Mahdessian's father fell ill, and John redirected his Wall Street ambitions to the family business.The 56-year-old firm is now the dry cleaner of the jet set, including musician Jay Z and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg.""I took the whole industry to another level. I made it sexy,"" Mahdessian told IBD. Earn that shine. Such a reputation requires ingenuity and elbow grease. The breakthrough for Mahdessian came in bags of water-damaged and mildewed gowns a socialite wanted saved. ""Every night for almost a year I took on these challenges,"" he said. ""I had to take apart each and every piece.""Mahdessian experimented with chemicals to clean the fabrics.A year later, 90 of the original 100 garments were saved.""We are now the final authority on what can be and cannot be restored,"" Mahdessian said. Demonstrate hustle.  When an Armani boutique owner brought in an ink-stained shirt, Mahdessian left an indelible impression.After quickly rendering it spotless, ""I had it delivered back to Madison Avenue before the guy got back to the boutique,"" he said.Bend-over-backward service establishes a reputation.""I've always catered to the most demanding clients in the world,"" Mahdessian said. ""I don't like disappointing people in general."" Embrace the past. Walking around 103-year-old M.S. Rau Antiques leaves this impression on shoppers: ""It's like a museum, but you can take things home,"" said Bill Rau. His grandfather opened the store in New Orleans, and his father and uncle ran it before Rau became CEO in 1995.""I believe it's very easy to constantly evolve but keep true to who you are,"" he said. ""Any business that doesn't try to grow dies. You can't stay stagnant."" Push ahead. Rau admired his grandfather's eye for valuable items and honed his own ability to anticipate consumer shifts. ""Markets and tastes and moods change faster than ever before,"" he said.What's hot today can be ice cold tomorrow.""It's like the water from a tap — it just stops,"" Rau said. ""You have to stay on top of the market changes."" Solidify your foundation. Style drives Nemo Tile. The New York City store opened in 1921 and grew into a mass distributor of floor tile.""We have to be above what everyone else is doing in the market,"" said Matt Karlin. ""We buy materials all over the globe."" Retain spirit. The third generation running the operation, Nemo Tile's Karlin took this lesson from his grandfather:""Having cash available is king. I'm constantly watching my overhead, watching my cash balance.""From his father, Karlin learned to keep tabs on customers.""I like to be in the showroom,"" he said. ""I'm here and I get to listen to what people are saying."" Strengthen structure. After taking the president's chair in 2012, Karlin addressed the business' lack of management structure.The company now had clearly delineated executive roles beyond sales.He also hired marketing experts to strengthen the brand and opened a showroom in Philadelphia last spring.""It's our first real step outside our comfort zone,"" Karlin said.

1309,TAP,"Breaking into China's rough-and-tumble online-to-offline world hasn't been easy for Baidu, the country's dominant search engine. In June, the company pledged to invest $3.2 billion over the next three years to bolster its offering of online-to-offline retail services by fortifying its group-buying website Nuomi, which Baidu (BIDU) acquired in 2014.
"
1310,TAP,"On Monday, continuing its O2O quest, Baidu-backed Chinese online travel firm Qunar Cayman Islands (QUNR) announced it had reached a deal with Ctrip.com International (CTRP) through a share swap as Ctrip.com attempts to tap the rising number of Chinese travelers heading overseas. Qunar is a major part of Baidu's O2O portfolio.
"
1311,TAP,"But right now, two China Internet heavyweights — Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) and Alibaba Group (BABA) — already dominate the rapidly expanding O2O space.
"
1312,TAP,"The key is being the first to attract users, said San Francisco-based China industry expert Kevin Carter.
"
1313,TAP,"""Basically, there's a land grab going on,"" said Carter, who oversees China-focused and emerging markets ETFs. ""It is expensive. But you can't (gain dominance) if you don't spend the money to build and promote.""
"
1314,TAP,"China's rising population and increasing number of Internet users is driving the O2O trend — using the Web to drive online shoppers to buy products and services offline.
"
1315,TAP,"Also contributing to the rapid rise are China's tech-savvy 20-to-30 year olds, a growing consumer group that investment bank Credit Suisse in a recent industry report called a ""well-educated, well-pampered and well-entitled"" group with money to spend.

1316,TAP,"China E-Commerce Market: $718 Billion In 2017
"
1317,TAP,"Baidu, slated to report its earnings on Thursday, remains committed to capturing more e-commerce, a market that's expected to grow at an annual rate of 25% over the next few years, from $390 billion in 2014 to $718 billion in 2017, according to a recent study released by management consulting firm A.T. Kearney.
"
1318,TAP,"Baidu is eyeing opportunity in China's 24 cities that each have more than 8 million inhabitants — making them the size of New York City or bigger — CEO Robin Li said during the company's Q2 conference call in July.
"
1319,TAP,"""O2O is an area where China has leapt ahead, because the Chinese service sector and local business owners have eagerly embraced what Internet technology can do for them and because Chinese Internet companies are being willing to invest in educating the market and shaping consumer behavior,"" said Li.
"
1320,TAP,"""Because of the early-stage nature,"" he said, ""we'll have to invest aggressively to make sure we will be successful.""
"
1321,TAP,"In June, Li spelled out the company's road map for its O2O push during a press conference in Beijing, after Baidu added more than $1 billion to its war chest through a new bond offering — as it spends to grow in the Chinese Internet market. Back in June 2014, Baidu had sold $1 billion in five-year bonds.
"
1322,TAP,"""I took a look yesterday, and right now Baidu has over 50 billion RMB ($8 billion) in cash on its books,"" Li said then. ""We're going to take RMB20 billion ($3.2 billion) of that and do Nuomi right.""
"
1323,TAP,"Baidu paid $160 million to get a 59% interest in Nuomi in 2013 and acquired the rest of it last year.
"
1324,TAP,"Spending to build its O2O network ""will tend to be front-loaded, as this is the critical period when we're really competing to grow our users and shape market behavior,"" Baidu spokesman Kaiser Kuo said in an email.
"
1325,TAP,"A major part of that spending will go toward discounting, industry experts say.
"
1326,TAP,"""If you want to grow market share and acquire users, you really need to give incentives,"" Summit Research/W.R. Hambrecht analyst Henry Guo told IBD.
"
1327,TAP,"For example, to accompany a 50%-off restaurant coupon, Guo said, ""maybe Baidu will give another 20% off and that 20% (comes) out of Baidu's pocket.""
"
1328,TAP,"The effort follows Baidu's initial high-profile foray into O2O just over a year ago, when the China search leader entered a three-way alliance to establish a shopping venture.
"
1329,TAP,"Baidu, Tencent Team With Wanda
"
1330,TAP,"In August 2014, China's Dalian Wanda Group, a commercial property, hotel and film conglomerate, announced that it would team up in an $814 million O2O partnership with Baidu and Tencent.
"
1331,TAP,"The three companies set out to establish the Wanda E-commerce Company, a Hong Kong registered joint venture, with Dalian Wanda Group holding a 70% equity stake. Baidu and Tencent each hold 15%.
"
1332,TAP,"In Q2, Baidu said gross merchandise value from its O2O operations reached $6.5 billion. While Baidu has other O2O efforts, including doctor booking and laundry services, the sales figure currently represents only revenue from group-buy website Nuomi, food delivery service Baidu Takeout Delivery and online travel-booking service spinoff Qunar.
"
1333,TAP,"The share exchange transaction announced Monday gives Baidu 25% voting interest in Ctrip, while Ctrip will have about 45% voting interest in Baidu's Qunar. The transaction is valued at an estimated $3.4 billion.
"
1334,TAP,"The deal could raise profitability at both operations, which are now locked in an industry pricing war marked by heavy discounting that has dragged down the Chinese online travel sector for the past several years. The companies are vying for a bigger share of the estimated $229 billion that Chinese tourists will spend this year while traveling overseas, an amount expected to nearly double to $422 billion by 2020, according to a report by consultancies China Luxury Advisors and the Fung Business Intelligence Center that Reuters cited on Monday.
"
1335,TAP,"Going forward, the Ctrip-Qunar duo will control between 70% and 80% of the hotel and air ticket market, Guo said in an industry research note on Monday.
"
1336,TAP,"""We expect the two companies to coordinate their growth strategy of strengthening their position in this explosive online travel market in China,"" he wrote. ""This deal significantly increases the likelihood of a profitability-improvement trajectory over the next couple of years for both companies.""
"
1337,TAP,"Aggressive promotions and cash rebates to hotel customers have caused Qunar's non-GAAP operating margin to sink to -46% in 2014 from -10% in 2013, Guo noted, as Ctrip's non-GAAP operating margin decreased to 4.8% in 2014 from 23.6% in 2013.
"
1338,TAP,"With investors queasy about Baidu's O2O prospects in the face of hefty competition and sharp price-cutting to gain customers, Baidu stock has fallen 16% since the end of June. The stock is down 34% from an all-time high of 251.99 in mid-November 2014. Monday Baidu stock closed up 5.5% at 166.24, while Ctrip.com vaulted 22.1% and Qunar jumped 7.9%.
"
1339,TAP,"Baidu Earnings Thursday
"
1340,TAP,"Baidu got at least three downgrades after the company missed on Q2 earnings and gave weak revenue guidance in July amid continued heavy spending on its O2O business.
"
1341,TAP,"The company reports Q3 earnings on Oct. 29. Baidu is guiding Q3 revenue of $2.93 billion to $2.99 billion — up 34% to 37% year over year but short of the $3.02 billion analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast. (Their present consensus in local currency, RMB 18.377 billion, edges the midpoint of Baidu's revenue guidance, RMB 18.375 billion.) Baidu has warned that rising competition and its increasing focus on less-lucrative mobile users would pressure its earnings.
"
1342,TAP,"China's Big 3 — Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent — are typically rivals on multiple fronts, including in O2O, an e-commerce business model designed to attract customers online then direct them offline to purchase goods and services from brick-and-mortar locations.
"
1343,TAP,"Alibaba-Tencent Team Up
"
1344,TAP,"But earlier this month, Tencent — China's leader in mobile gaming and mobile chat — and Alibaba — the country's dominant e-commerce provider — united their competing Groupon (GRPN)-like tech startups in an estimated $15 billion deal designed to snatch more O2O share.
"
1345,TAP,"Alibaba, which is slated to release earnings early Tuesday, is backing No. 1 Chinese local deals site Meituan.com. Tencent, China's leader in mobile gaming and mobile chat, owns 20% of No. 2 deals site Dianping.com.
"
1346,TAP,"Those two startups specialize in deals for restaurant meal delivery, movie tickets and other offline services.
"
1347,TAP,"Those are the same areas of focus for Baidu-owned Nuomi, which ranks No. 3 in China's frenzied O2O industry.
"
1348,TAP,"Tencent has the most users in China, with 843 million monthly active users on its QQ instant messaging service and more than 600 million on its mobile social platform, WeChat, Tencent president Martin Lau said during a Q2 conference call with analysts in August.
"
1349,TAP,"While spending billions to build its own O2O effort, Baidu has come to the party late, Carter told IBD.
"
1350,TAP,"Despite its major O2O expansion, Carter called Baidu ""the least innovative"" of China's Internet Big 3 in that segment.
"
1351,TAP,"It's still Internet search and search ad sales that continue to be the defining business segment for Baidu, according to Carter.
"
1352,TAP,"Tencent, on the other hand, ""has been the most innovative in terms of monetization and in terms of sheer product offerings,"" Carter said.
"
1353,TAP,"Ride-Sharing Frenzy
"
1354,TAP,"While taxi hailing apps are another major O2O area, Carter said that ""Baidu has not directly made its presence known there.""

Investors eye a cascade of corporate earnings this week, with several elite IBD 50 stocks among roughly 20% of S&P 500 companies on tap to report. The stock market opened lower today, but edged up…
"
1387,TAP,"Earnings season for top-performing stocks begins to ramp up this week, with reports due from IBD 50 companies like Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and A.O. Smith (AOS).Hawaiian HoldingsAirline company Hawaiian Holdings (HA) carries passengers to Hawaii, Pago Pago, Samoa and Tahiti, among other places. It will announce earnings late Monday and is expected to record a 56% jump in EPS to $1.23 on a 1.8% drop in revenue to $628.3 million.Continued low fuel costs are helping boost the bottom line for Hawaiian and the rest of the airline industry. But even nonfuel costs are improving for Hawaiian. Earlier this month, the carrier revised its Q3 growth estimate for cost per available seat mile and now sees it rising 1.5%-2.5% vs. its prior outlook for a 2.5%-5.5% increase.Hawaiian's stock formed a cup-with-handle base after six months of consolidation and rose above a 25.69 buy point on Oct. 8, closing at 26.21. Since then, it's climbed about 13%.Chipotle Mexican GrillThe fast-casual chain is on tap to release earnings late Tuesday. Analysts are looking for 12% EPS growth to $4.63 on a 12% boost in sales to $1.22 billion. Both represent the fourth straight quarter of deceleration.But Chipotle Mexican Grill recently returned carnitas, a popular burrito and taco filling made of pork, to its menu in most of its stores, raising expectations for a re-acceleration in sales growth.Longer term, Chipotle's hiring of former Starbucks (SBUX) Chief Information Officer Curt Garner as its first CIO is seen as a sign that the burrito chain is getting serious about boosting digital engagement with its customers to lift sales further.Manhattan AssociatesAtlanta-based Manhattan Associates (MANH) reports Tuesday after the market close. Consensus is for a 13% increase in earnings per share to 36 cents on a 12% rise in revenue to $141.1 million.One specialty for the supply-chain management software developer is warehouse management. On Tuesday, ARC Advisory Group's warehouse market analysis ranked Manhattan as the leading global supplier of such applications and services.Manhattan Associates has a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, and its stock is outperforming the market. It's working on the right side of a first-stage cup base with a 69.91 buy point.A.O. SmithIBD's New America section recently featured this 141-year-old maker of water heaters.A.O. Smith, which reports early Wednesday, operates under its namesake brand as well as American Water Heaters, GSW, Lochinvar and other brands. It's the top water heater and boiler maker in the U.S. and China. Analysts forecast a 34% hike in EPS to 79 cents on a 12% advance in revenue to $649.9 million.BB&T; Capital Markets analyst Kevin Maczka recently told IBD that the company ""is doing a terrific job,"" adding, ""They have strong growth drivers,"" including a strong market position and new, more energy-efficient water heaters.AlphabetAlphabet reports Thursday after the market close. Consensus is for a 13% hike in EPS to $7.20 on a 12% increase in revenue to $18.53 billion.With the recent reorganization of the Internet giant, investors are eager to see for the first time how Alphabet breaks out its core search-business financials from its other ""moonshot"" businesses.They include a life sciences business that is developing glucose-sensing contact lenses so diabetics don't have to make painful pinpricks to obtain blood samples. Alphabet is also developing self-driving cars and finding ways to extend human longevity.But while some analysts and investors have been hoping that the additional transparency might pressure Alphabet to rein in spending, Bank of America Merrill Lynch recently said that the new structure could actually result in an acceleration of spending, as the noncore units become freer to expand.Follow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook.

1401,TAP,"The kind of opportunity that technology and energy markets once offered is beckoning investors to property near biotech clusters. Emerging from the recession, technology and energy markets commanded the attention of commercial real-estate investors that wanted to tap into improving occupancy and rental rates largely absent elsewhere.
"
1402,TAP,"A similar dynamic is germinating in biotech clusters, which are typically marked by a high concentration of life-science companies near academic research institutions.
"
1403,TAP,"Tenant demand is driving fundamentals in the nodes, particularly in Boston, San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area.
"
1404,TAP,"In the biotech bellwether of Cambridge, Mass., the average vacancy rate for lab space was 7.3% at the end of the second quarter of 2015, about half of what it was a year earlier, according to brokerage Cushman & Wakefield.
"
1405,TAP,"The average rental rate of $62.47 per square foot marked a year-over-year increase of 25.7%.
"
1406,TAP,"In July, Pasadena, Calif.-based real-estate investment trust Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) sold a 70% stake in a 305,000-square-foot building housing Cambridge's Biogen (BIIB) to TIAA-CREF for $190 million.
"
1407,TAP,"The price reflected a ""cash capitalization rate"" — the initial cash yield to an investor — of a relatively low 4.5%.

1412,TAP,"Driven largely by life-science firms, 64 health care companies raised $5.8 billion in IPOs through three quarters this year after 102 health care companies raised $9.2 billion in 2014, according to Greenwich, Conn.-based Renaissance Capital, a manager of IPO-focused ETFs. The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index's plunge of 21% over the past three months — following a 127% gain in 2013 and 2014 — is expected to curtail IPO activity, according to the firm.
"
1413,TAP,"Half The Vacancy Rate
"
1414,TAP,"Venture-capital firms pumped $2.3 billion into biotech companies in the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 32%, according to the MoneyTree Report from PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association, based on data provided by Thomson Reuters.
"
1415,TAP,"CoStar Portfolio Strategy, a division of Washington, D.C.-based property researcher CoStar (CSGP), found that the average vacancy rate of 5.1% in the top 10 biotech clusters in America was more than half the national office vacancy rate. It further noted that a third of the $18.4 billion of NIH funding in 2014 flowed into academic research institutions near those top 10 clusters, including those in Boston, San Diego, Baltimore and Philadelphia.
"
1416,TAP,"Rich Robbins, CEO of San Rafael, Calif.-based Wareham Development, downplays the link between NIH funding and occupancy, noting that biotech companies have access to several sources of capital and naturally gravitate toward research institutions. But he's keenly aware of the need for space in San Francisco Bay Area life-science submarkets, many of which had average vacancy rates of 5% or less in the second quarter, according to brokerage Kidder Mathews.

"
1426,TAP,"While Alexandria is adding 130,000 square feet to its existing 597,000-square-foot life-science center in the neighborhood, a lack of biotech space has led to rents of around $80 a square foot, he says.

1445,TAP," Home monitoring is becoming more popular. The Netgear (NTGR) Arlo is a home monitoring video system that uses small, wireless cameras.
"
1446,TAP,"Prices start at $179 for a system with a single camera, though Arlo systems with up to five high-definition cameras are available. Your gift recipient can start with the base system and add additional cameras as needed.
"
1447,TAP,"Arlo is easy to set up. It includes a base station that plugs into an ethernet router or switch, magnetic mounts and hardware, and a start guide.
"
1448,TAP,"Arlo stores video in the Internet cloud; a free account holds seven days' worth. Longer storage times are available for monthly fees that range up to $14.99 a month for 60 days of recording from as many as 15 cameras.
"
1449,TAP," For the do-it-yourselfers on your list, Bondic is the perfect gift. While it's not glue, it's great for sticking things together and performing repairs on plastic and other materials.
"
1450,TAP,"Like the stuff your dentist uses, Bondic is a thick gel; it cures into a solid when exposed to ultraviolet light. Squeeze Bondic onto the surfaces to be repaired or glued, then shine the included tiny UV light on the gel for at least four seconds. It turns the gel into a durable solid.
"
1451,TAP,"Bondic kits, available at http://notaglue.com/, start at $22 and include a pen-like gel dispenser.
"
1452,TAP," Speakers are a great way to listen to music, but most people don't have a lot of room for traditional wired models.
"
1453,TAP,"The compact (2 x 7.4 x 4.3 inches), 2.2-pound Roar 2, from Singapore-based Creative, provides up to eight hours of great-sounding music from its three internal speakers. It pairs with Bluetooth devices such as a smartphones and tablets, including those that support tap-and-connect near field communication (NFC).
"
1454,TAP,"The Roar 2 can also record voice or music from its internal microphone to a microSD card, play music from a microSD card or Sony (SNE) PlayStation 4, or even recharge a phone or tablet from its built-in USB port. The portable speaker comes in black or white, and costs $170.
"
1455,TAP," Large-screen TVs are coming down in price, but they still can't produce an image as large as a video projector.
"
1456,TAP,"The Epson Home Cinema 2040 is, at $699, priced about the same as a good-quality 50- or 60-inch TV; but with 2200 lumens of brightness, it can project a 300-inch image onto any light-colored wall.
"
1457,TAP,"The Home Cinema 2040's resolution is high-def quality, and if your gift recipient likes watching sports or movies, they are going to love the large image. The Home Cinema is easy to set up, has an internal speaker and can accept input from cable and satellite boxes or a PC.
"
1458,TAP," Keurig (GMCR) K-Cup brewers are well known. The $350 Keurig Kold works somewhat the same as the coffee brewers, but it uses pods that produce carbonated and non-carbonated drinks such as Coke, Diet Coke and iced teas.
"
1459,TAP,"There are no CO2 canisters — the pods produce the carbonation. Each pod makes an 8-ounce drink chilled to 39 degrees. The pods sell for about $1.25 each, which is more expensive than just buying cans or bottles.
"
1460,TAP,"But if you know someone who just has to have the newest gadget available, the Keurig Kold is an, ahem, kool gift.
"
1461,TAP," Earbuds are unobtrusive and are perfect for listening on the go. But if you have an audiophile on the gift list, the $309 Meze 99 Classic over-the-ear headphones are a thoughtful gift that will be appreciated every time the recipient listens to music.
"
1462,TAP,"While the headphones might look a bit unwieldy, they are comfortable to wear for extended periods and feature soft memory-foam ear cups. The rear of each ear cup is finished in walnut with gold trim. Each pair comes with a 1.2-meter cable, 6.3-millimeter gold-plated adapter, an airline adapter and a hard carrying case. Best of all, they sound as great as they look.
"
1463,TAP," Is someone on your gift list an avid chef? Then the $329 SousVide Supreme Demi from Eades Appliance Technology will let him or her explore a cooking method that many professional chefs use.
"
1464,TAP,"SousVide cooking uses food sealed in a watertight vacuum bag immersed in a water bath held at a specific temperature. The food reaches that temperature and is fully cooked. The chef fills the Demi with tap water, immerses the bag containing the food to be cooked, and sets the temperature and time. After several hours, the food is ready and cooked perfectly.
"
1465,TAP,"The company also offers a variety of vacuum food sealers and bags to go along with the SousVide cooker.

Tech IPOs have only accounted for 11% of IPOs for the year, the least in seven years, say analysts, but there's a big name on tap in mobile payment-processing company Square, helmed by Twitter (TWTR) co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey.He has been Twitter's interim CEO for the last few months but will likely be named the social media company's permanent CEO ""as early as tomorrow,"" said Re/Code sources Wednesday.Square's devices can turn a tablet or smartphone into a point-of-sale system, allowing merchants from food-truck owners to cabbies to take near-field communication payments, chip cards and magstripe cards. The system also takes Apple (AAPL) Pay.Twitter shares closed up 5.3%. Square is expected to file its S-1 soon, said Fortune sources.Renaissance Capital's Matt Kennedy told IBD that the company could start trading ""as early as the first week of November,"" though he noted that investors will question whether Dorsey can adequately dedicate himself to both Square and Twitter.Upscale indoor cycling chain SoulCycle, which filed its S-1 in late July, will likely start trading later this year, according to The Street. Known for its celebrity following and fans' cult-like devotion, the spin studio's brand is big, relative to its 40 or so locations.Shares of Fitbit, which hit a high of 51.90 on Aug. 5 after its June IPO price of 20, finished Wednesday's session up 6.8%.

The spinoff from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) could price the week of Oct. 12, it said.Tesla shares finished 0.7% higher.Further down the road is another Italian company, Eataly, that might have plans to start trading, with a public offering likely to happen as early as 2016, according to Italy24 .The upscale eatery-supermarket hybrid, which also hosts wine tastings and cooking classes, has locations across the globe, including New York, Florence and Tokyo.Former Luxottica (LUX) head Andrea Guerra reportedly starts in his new position as executive chairman of Eataly on Thursday.RELATED:4 Big Name Tech Stocks Initiated: Buy Which Ones?Tech IPOs Suffering From Sluggish Market PerformanceIPO Market Coming Back To Life With 10 Ready To DebutPlanet Fitness IPO Strengthens Muscle, Without GruntsNeed-To-Know IPO: Is SoulCycle The Next Fitbit?.

1542,TAP,"Whip out the shades. Acuity Brands' (AYI) fourth quarter shined brighter than Wall Street expected, easing worries about possible dimming as the LED-lighting-fixture company looked toward future smart street lights and interconnected systems.Shares recently faced pressure after rival Eaton (ETN) said at the Citi Industrials Conference on Sept. 17 that lighting had been weak since July, recalls Cowen & Co. analyst Jeffrey Osborne. But Acuity's 29% Q4 earnings growth to $1.63 a share and 14% revenue rise to $759.5 million pleased investors Wednesday, sending shares up 3.7%. Analysts had expected $1.62 on $754.9 million in Q4.For the year, per-share earnings grew 36% to $5.39, topping views by a penny. Revenue grew 13% to $2.71 billion, slightly ahead of consensus estimates of $2.7 billion.""I think investors went into the call with lower expectations of growth rates because of industrial peer commentary,"" Stifel analyst Sven Eenmaa told IBD. But Acuity showed ""very strong execution. That is clearly a positive. It looks like not a whole lot has changed in terms of market growth. Execution remains strong. They're executing on strategy.""Sales grew across most product categories and regions, with LED-based lighting solutions accounting for more than half of total Q4 net sales. And LED product sales grew ""by almost 50%"" this last quarter, CEO Vernon Nagel told analysts.Seven Years Ago: What's LED?Contrast this to seven years ago, when Acuity ""sold virtually no LED-based fixtures."" Nagel said the company invested ""significantly"" to become the digital-lighting market leader.He also noted that the key nonresidential construction market is still about 20% off its 2008 peak, while Acuity's net sales have grown 34% over that time. Acuity's business is split fairly evenly between new construction and renovation.""Our profitability and cash flow for the quarter and full year were records for Acuity, even as we continue to invest in areas to support our strong sales growth as well as opportunities with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio ... a huge opportunity to be a critical part of the backbone for enabling the Internet of Things,"" said Nagel.Interconnectedness is growing as ""smart"" homes and commercial buildings tap into the so-called Internet of Things.Buying Distech Controls, a building-automation and energy-management firm, ""makes a lot of sense"" for Acuity, said Cowen's Osborne. Distech integrates lights, HVAC, closed-circuit television and other energy efficiency systems.""The Holy Grail is to have a platform that can be the quarterback of that system,"" he said. ""Distech is one of the building blocks.""Management expects that its acquisition of Distech, completed in September, will be ""modestly accretive"" to the company in fiscal 2016. Acuity disclosed on Monday a partnership with Silver Spring Networks to co-develop a ""networked street-light control solution"" for cities, utilities and other networks, including ""smart"" street lights that can automatically dim or brighten depending on the weather.Internet Of Things Needs TimeAnalysts say Acuity's foray into the Internet of Things is mostly strategic and has yet to affect revenue, but the company could start to see material results in few years.""It remains a largely lighting and LED story, but they're sowing the seeds to drive growth here a couple of years (out),"" said Eenmaa.Acuity is a member of IBD's Building-Construction Products/Miscellaneous industry group, which ranks No. 21 out of 197 groups. Fortune Brands Home & Security (FBHS), Apogee Enterprises (APOG) and Mohawk Industries (MHK) are among its publicly traded peers in the group.Aside from Eaton, Acuity's competitors in the lighting space include Hubbell (HUBB), Philips (PHG), General Electric (GE) and several smaller companies.Lower-cost LED products have helped Acuity. Conversely, the trend has weighed on LED light-bulb maker Cree (CREE), which said in June that it would restructure its LED business to reflect overcapacity and downtrending prices.Cree shares are off 20% this year. Acuity stock is up 30% to 182.69.Strength In DiversificationAnalysts wonder about the August decline of AIA's Architecture Billings Index (ABI), a nonresidential building activity indicator. The index dipped below the key 50 mark to 49.1 from July's 54.7, though AIA's chief economist, Kermit Baker, said the ""minor dip should be quickly reversed.""Acuity is well-diversified enough to withstand August's downtick, said Stifel's Eenmaa.Acuity does not provide earnings guidance, but management highlighted the improving North American economy and consensus estimates for the region's lighting industry to grow in the ""mid- to upper-single-digit range"" for the company's fiscal 2016.Nagel expects its gross profit margin to ""improve over time.""Outpacing The MarketManagement is optimistic about its growth prospects.""Further, we expect to continue to outperform the growth rates of the markets we serve by executing our strategies to focus on growing renovation and tenant improvement projects, expand into underpenetrated geographies and channels, and grow from the continued introduction of new products and lighting solutions as part of our integrated, tiered solutions strategy,"" said Nagel.

1577,TAP,"One of the big trends in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry has been this year's flow of new money into developed world equity ETFs, both <href=""#unhedged"">unhedged and currency <href=""#hedge"">hedged. WisdomTree estimates that nearly $100 billion of this year's $171 billion in ETF industry inflows cascaded into these funds through the end of October.But the vast majority of assets in international equity ETFs—and the vast majority of net inflows this year—has been concentrated primarily in developed world <href=""#large-capitalization%20%28large-cap%29"">large-cap strategies. While equity returns for the <href=""#msci%20europe%20index"">MSCI Europe and <href=""#msci%20japan%20index"">MSCI Japan indexes have, thus far in 2015, exceeded those generated by the <href=""#s&p%20500%20index"">S&P 500 Index, the bigger <href=""#bullish"">bull market has actually occurred in the smaller-company segment of the developed world.If we look at year-to-date returns through October 30, we can see by how much <href=""#small%20caps"">small-cap indexes have outperformed compared to broad market indexes comprising primarily large-cap companies in Europe, Japan and the developed world. For definitions of indexes in the chart, visit our glossary.What's interesting is that the excess return produced by the small caps compared to their large-cap brethren is not just a 2015 phenomenon. Excess returns have held up over the last year, three years, five years and the better part of the last decade going back to the inception of the WisdomTree Indexes back in May of 2006.When One Compares Returns across Asset Classes, Additional Light Bulbs Light UpThe double-digit gains European and Japanese small caps have generated thus far in 2015 have not only surpassed the broad European and Japanese benchmarks (MSCI Europe and MSCI Japan), they have outperformed the major asset classes investors typically tap to construct a globally diversified portfolio: large caps and small caps in the U.S.1; <href=""#msci%20eafe%20index"">MSCI EAFE Index and <href=""#msci%20emerging%20markets%20index"">MSCI Emerging Markets Index; <href=""#msci%20us%20reit%20index"">REITs2, U.S. Treasuries, investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds3; commodities4and gold5. Moreover, year-to-date in 2015, small caps measured by the WisdomTree Japan SmallCap Dividend Index and the WisdomTree Europe SmallCap Dividend Index outperformed each of the major indexes designed to measure how each <href=""#smart%20beta"">smart beta factor is performing: <href=""#msci%20momentum%20index"">MSCI Momentum, <href=""#msci%20usa%20quality%20index"">MSCI Quality, <href=""#msci%20usa%20value%20index"">MSCI Value, <href=""#msci%20low%20volatility%20index"">MSCI Low Volatility or <href=""#msci%20size%20index"">MSCI Size.What accounts for the divergence in returns? Part of it can be explained by sector concentrations, country and currency exposure. Another reason: Small-cap stocks are less tied to the global economy and often more sensitive to inflections in local economies. This can be partly explained by the historic tendency of small-company stocks to outperform large caps. This is one of the reasons that back in 2006 WisdomTree became the first ETF manager to launch international small-cap ETFs. At that time, WisdomTree knew that international small caps not only added potential for higher returns compared to large caps but they could also provide diversification benefits to a globally diversified portfolio. Since its inception in 2006, for example, the WisdomTree Japan SmallCap Dividend Index had a <href=""#correlation"">correlation of .49 to the S&P 500. Adding components with lower correlations to one's U.S. equity exposure has the potential to lower the overall <href=""#volatiltiy"">volatility of a globally diversified portfolio.Conclusion
"
1578,TAP,"Because most <href=""#passive"">passive indexes and <href=""#active"">active international managers tend to concentrate primarily on large-cap stocks, international investors may miss the potential of small-cap companies unless they make a conscious effort to include them in their portfolios. We believe international small-cap exposure can help investors complete their international allocations. Returns this year in Europe, Japan and the developed world add additional real-time evidence to support our thesis.Unless otherwise stated, data sources are Bloomberg and WisdomTree.1S&P 500 and <href=""#russell%202000%20index"">Russell 2000 Index.

The IRS found no money laundering issues in the 2012 matter and Ebix announced in January that it had resolved the audit with an assessment resulting in a roughly $1.4 million impact on its net income for 4Q 2014.

""It's still early in the U.S., but it's clearly a competitive move in the insurance sector.""Van Rhee, though, maintains his buy rating on Ebix stock, with a 40 price target.""I think it's underappreciated in terms of the current valuation,"" he said.Ebix, though, has endured some rough seas.Shareholders sued Ebix in 2011, accusing company executives of padding Q4 2009 revenue. In 2014, the company agreed to pay $6.5 million to settle this suit.In 2012, news surfaced that the IRS was looking into Ebix's income tax returns for 2008 through 2012 amid speculation that Ebix was booking U.S. revenues to low-tax foreign subsidiaries. Later that year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched a related investigation into the company's accounting practices. The IRS found no money laundering issues in the 2012 matter and Ebix announced in January that it had resolved the audit with an assessment resulting in a roughly $1.4 million impact on its net income for 4Q 2014. That apparently ended the SEC probe into the firm's accounting practices, though the SEC made no official announcement.In May 2014, Ebix had to terminate an agreement to be acquired by a unit of Goldman Sachs (GS) for $820 million, after being notified by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia that it had opened an investigation into allegations of intentional misconduct in pending shareholder class-action lawsuits.These issues put the firm in the cross hairs of short-sellers. A year ago, Ebix was near the top of the S&P 1500's most-shorted stocks.But its problems have mostly been resolved, and short interest has fallen from 13.07 million shares at the start of the year to roughly 9.8 million as of mid-August, according to Nasdaq.With the air cleared, Ebix made four acquisitions last year, all for undisclosed sums.

1720,TAP,"Premium burger chain Shake Shack (SHAK) has developed an in-demand brand and coveted cool status with urban foodies. But the stock's rollercoaster path and premium price don't always inspire confidence on Wall Street.The New York-based restaurant chain is expected to bring in 3 cents in Q2 per-share earnings on revenue of $42.8 million when it reports after the close Monday. Despite positivity about Shake Shack's potential, several analysts continue to stay neutral on the stock.""While we continue to believe in Shake Shack's potential to ultimately generate at least $1.5 billion in revenue and north of $350 million in EBITDA, we remain on the sidelines given its rich valuation of 84 times our 2016 EBITDA estimate, particularly as we expect some inherent volatility in Shake Shack's quarterly results given its small restaurant base and real-time exposure to commodities,"" wrote William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia in a July 20 note.Zackfia, who has a market perform rating on Shake Shack, added that management could potentially boost full-year revenue and same-store sales guidance following the company's ""strong results"" in the first half of 2015.Shake Shack has fewer than 70 locations worldwide — a low figure when compared with, say, Jack in the Box's (JACK) 2,200 or so restaurants or even Habit Restaurants' (HABT) 115-plus locations — but it has created a well-known name for itself.Developed by restaurateur Danny Meyer (of Gramercy Tavern and Eleven Madison Park fame), Shake Shack offers all-natural, vegetarian-fed Angus beef burgers and homemade frozen custard. Its high-end origins and socially conscious menu seem to resonate with foodies who don't mind paying a premium for what is usually a fast-food staple: burgers.Investors have thus far appeared willing to pay a premium for its stock as well.Shake Shack went public in late January after being priced at 21 per share. Shares hit a high of 96.75 on May 22, then sank back down to 48.21 by July 16, later popping 18% in just one day as its post-IPO lockup expired in late July.Shake Shack ran up 10.8% to 71.64 on Friday.

"
1724,TAP,"A rule written by the Securities and Exchange Commission under a 2012 law will go into effect sometime next year — a date has yet to be determined — and it's designed to help startups and small businesses tap into a wider pool of money. On Oct. 30, the SEC voted 3-1 to approve the rule, known as Title III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS, Act.
"
1725,TAP,"The present system permits only accredited investors, people who earn more than $200,000 per year or those whose net worth exceeds $1 million aside from their primary residence, to buy equity in startups. The new rule will permit anyone to put in $2,000 or 5% of their annual income into projects worth up to $1 million over a 12-month period. Investors whose net income and net worth are more than $100,000 may put in 10% of that net income or net worth.

"
1727,TAP,"In the view of supporters, it's a watershed moment.
"
1728,TAP,"""They've democratized (access to capital),"" said Alon Hillel-Tuch, a co-founder of RocketHub, a crowdfunding website based in New York and owned by EFactor Group. ""This means it's no longer in the hands of wealthy angels and venture capitalists.""
"
1729,TAP,"Crowdfunding in the U.S. traditionally hasn't been much more than relatives or friends kicking in a few bucks to help a budding entrepreneur realize a dream, if only for a fleeting moment. Still, even such non-equity crowdfunding in that or other similarly crude forms is expected to generate $34 billion in financial support for startups this year, according to an April 2015 report by research firm Massolution.

"
1733,TAP,"Seedrs, a U.K.-based crowdfunding company, last week announced plans to launch operations in the U.S. The company said it has helped fund more than 270 companies, raising $5.4 million per month.
"
1734,TAP,"Equity crowdfunding has been legal in the U.K. for some time, though that nation's financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, isn't supportive. It issued investors a stark warning last year, saying: ""It is very likely that you will lose all your money.""
"
1735,TAP,"On this side of the Atlantic, the SEC put in safeguards to protect unsophisticated investors from getting ripped off or enduring big losses due to bad or foolish choices. An SEC-registered fund portal or broker-dealer must be used for the transactions. Transferring securities purchased via crowdfunding won't be allowed for one year, with some exceptions permitted. Currently, the likes of Indiegogo and Kickstarter don't accept equity.

1736,TAP,"Not everyone is enthusiastic about the new rules.

1737,TAP,"""The rules are extraordinarily complicated,"" said Joseph Grundfest, a Stanford Law School professor and former SEC commissioner. ""They're not going to be cheap and easy to comply with. There will be a meaningful compliance cost for every dollar that's raised.""
"
1738,TAP,"It's also riskier to invest in startups, the vast majority of which fail. Well-funded venture-capital firms can withstand such losses and chalk it up to the cost of doing business, while mom-and-pop investors don't have as big of a cushion.

1739,TAP,"""There are a lot of i's to dot and a lot of t's to cross,"" he added. ""Tragically, lawyers and accountants don't work for free.""

1741,TAP,"""If you've got a really good idea, you'll probably be able to persuade a sophisticated investor to fund you,"" Grundfest said.
"
1742,TAP,"While the new system likely will have its flaws, Hillel-Tuch says the burdensome costs of Title III are the lesser of two evils. An unregulated or under-regulated market for Main Street startup investors would lead to abuses in the system and an even harsher government crackdown, he said.

1747,TAP,"Airman 1st Class Bill Robinson was part of the team trying to rescue a downed pilot in North Vietnam on Sept. 20, 1965. Enemy ground fire nailed their helicopter.
"
1748,TAP,"After crash landing, the four-man crew and pilot were captured.
"
1749,TAP,"The Vietnamese would not release Robinson for 7-1/2 years, making him the longest-held enlisted man in U.S. history.
"
1750,TAP,"""When you are being tortured, you concentrate on the moment and getting through that and not worry about what happens next,"" Robinson, 72, told IBD from his home in Madisonville, Tenn. ""The key to survival mentally and physically for me was being brought up by my mom in a Christian home.
"
1751,TAP,"""I always remembered that she told me I would never be given a burden greater than I could bear. But I had to do a lot of tall praying for 2,703 days.""
"
1752,TAP,"Robinson was born in the cotton mill town of Roanoke Rapids, N.C., in 1943. His mother, Lillian, had trouble making ends meet because his father, William, was with the Army overseas, on the road selling something or with a girlfriend, and rarely sent money.
"
1753,TAP,"Lillian died when Bill was 15, and he moved in with his grandparents.
"
1754,TAP,"Three years later, he joined the Air Force and did basic training in San Antonio, then stayed on to learn to repair helicopters.
"
1755,TAP,"Off To Asia
"
1756,TAP,"Assigned to a B-52 bomber wing in Altus, Okla., he was with a group that flew parts and personnel to 12 Atlas nuclear missile sites. In 1963, his unit ferried negotiators between North and South Korea.
"
1757,TAP,"In April 1965, Robinson went to Bangkok, Thailand, to provide support for a helicopter rescue group.
"
1758,TAP,"President Lyndon Johnson had ordered Operation Rolling Thunder over North Vietnam that February, and it would continue for nearly four years, the longest bombing campaign in U.S. history.
"
1759,TAP,"Crews of planes shot down were being captured by North Vietnamese. Trying to prevent that were rescue teams in the modified Kaman HH-43B Huskie, a chopper with heavy armor and firepower that could travel 110 miles on one trip.
"
1760,TAP,"Robinson flew on two rescue missions as the crew chief or flight engineer. For the one in May, he would receive the Silver Star, the third highest combat decoration, eight years later.
"
1761,TAP,"On Sept. 20, his crew consisted of Capt. Thomas Curtis, the pilot; 1st Lt. Duane Martin, the co-pilot; and Airman 3rd Class Arthur Black, the pararescue medic.
"
1762,TAP,"They flew as the low bird assigned to pick up Capt. Willis Forby; the high bird hovered to scout and provide covering fire.
"
1763,TAP,"Escorting them all were A1-E Skyraider fighters.
"
1764,TAP,"Arriving at the site at 3,700 feet, Robinson's chopper fell into communist cross hairs, with harrowing results: The local militia took all five men prisoner.
"
1765,TAP,"Robinson, just 22, arrived Oct. 1 in Hanoi. During the war, fifteen prison camps operated in the region, most of them filthy, with rats, mosquitoes, cockroaches and ants crawling over the prisoners' plates of rice. Soup was often boiled grass.
"
1766,TAP,"Occasionally came a hairy piece of pork fat or a vegetable that had been fertilized with human feces.
"
1767,TAP,"Sometimes the Americans went weeks without being allowed to bathe. Temperatures were often blistering or freezing, with inadequate clothing and blankets.
"
1768,TAP,"Disease was rampant.
"
1769,TAP,"At first, the enemy used torture to try to extract confessions of war crimes.
"
1770,TAP,"Pointing to the trials of Nazi and Japanese leaders after World War II, North Vietnam wanted to justify executions. After an international backlash, it backed down but attempted to use confessions for propaganda purposes and to gain information about military operations.
"
1771,TAP,"The code of conduct for the U.S. military urged noncompliance, which POW leaders saw wasn't realistic. ""Our officers told us to resist until we were going to suffer permanent bodily harm and then to try our best to avoid divulging anything that was of importance,"" Robinson said. ""We would joke about it, like when I came back after a beating and told my cell mate, 'You should have seen what I did to him,' because a sense of humor helped us survive.
"
1772,TAP,"""I developed my three-day motto: Yesterday was the day that I was captured, today is today, and tomorrow is the day that I go home.""
"
1773,TAP,"The communists used a variety of techniques to force the POWs to talk, making the Americans:
"
1774,TAP," Sit bent over for days in caves that were only 4 feet high and half-filled with cold water.
"
1775,TAP," Run through trenches blindfolded and with hands tied behind their backs, which resulted in hitting their heads against obstacles.
"
1776,TAP," Kneel for long periods with an iron bar between their kneecaps and the concrete floor; it made their knees bleed and swell up.
"
1777,TAP," Sit — in a darkened room, a single beam of light shining in their faces — on a cinder block that rose eight inches high, with their hands behind their backs, putting all the weight on their tailbones.
"
1778,TAP,"Surviving
"
1779,TAP,"""Virtually every early captive in the North has stated that the two keys to survival and resistance were the chain of command and the development of ways to communicate with other prisoners,"" said Glenn Robins, author of ""The Longest Rescue: The Life and Legacy of Vietnam POW William A. Robinson."" ""Early on, they were often in separate cells and developed a code to tap messages. They found they could talk through brick-and-mortar walls by pressing a tin cup against the wall, used sign language and scratched messages on the bottoms of plates and cups.""
"
1780,TAP,"Occasionally, the POWs were allowed to write to their families and receive replies, in compliance with international rules of war.
"
1781,TAP,"Robinson became one of the most famous POWs when he was one of seven pictured in the April 7, 1967, issue of Life magazine.
"
1782,TAP,"Robinson found that helping others gave him a sense of purpose. So he repaired leaky faucets, rolled cigarettes or built mousetraps.
"
1783,TAP,"In 1969, officers decided that Robinson should be one of three to receive battlefield commissions, raising him to second lieutenant on completion of a six-month oral course when guards weren't around.
"
1784,TAP,"With the Paris Peace Accords in January 1973, the North Vietnamese released the names of 577 prisoners of war. Robinson was in the first group to be freed on Feb. 12, arriving at Clark Air Base in the Philippines for good meals, medical checkups, debriefings, updates on world events since captivity and phone calls to families.
"
1785,TAP,"Proud Comeback
"
1786,TAP,"""Although their Vietnamese captors had attempted to strip the American prisoners of their dignity and self-worth, the vast majority had remained faithful to their oaths of enlistment and the values expressed in the Code of Conduct,"" Robins wrote. ""By donning their military uniforms, medals and ribbons (after being freed), the former prisoners reclaimed one personal signifier of their loyal service to the U.S. military and to their nation.""
"
1787,TAP,"After Robinson arrived for the emotional homecoming in Roanoke Rapids, he could barely sleep for several days. His sister, Jackie, was astounded that he wasn't bitter about his experience: ""I have never seen anyone with a more positive attitude or outlook.""
"
1788,TAP,"But the next two decades were full of troubles for Robinson.
"
1789,TAP,"He abandoned his dream of becoming a pilot and settled for supervising aircraft maintenance.
"
1790,TAP,"His 1975 marriage to Sue Gill was miserable. She forced him to retire in 1984 after 23 years of service with the rank of captain.
"
1791,TAP,"After her death in 1993, he married Ora Mae Creel and adopted her daughter as well as Sue's. Ora Mae went with him to Vietnam for a documentary about his experiences in 1995, and they plan to visit what was South Vietnam for the first time in December.

1792,TAP,"They became active in establishing the National Prisoner of War Museum at the former Confederate prison in Andersonville, Ga. Robinson is now in constant demand as a speaker and posts on the Longest Rescue Facebook page.

1798,TAP,"California's already tight housing market is facing another long-term complication: drought. The state's dry spell is creating challenges for developers at a time when home prices are soaring because of limited inventory. The metropolitan areas of San Jose, San Francisco and San Diego had the nation's biggest gap between the number of new jobs and residential building permits from 2012 to 2014, according to a recent report by the National Association of Realtors. Now the drought, into its fourth year, stands to curb affordability further.

""Housing demand continues to grow and supply doesn't.""California's already tight housing market is facing another long-term complication: drought. The state's dry spell is creating challenges for developers at a time when home prices are soaring because of limited inventory. The metropolitan areas of San Jose, San Francisco and San Diego had the nation's biggest gap between the number of new jobs and residential building permits from 2012 to 2014, according to a recent report by the National Association of Realtors. Now the drought, into its fourth year, stands to curb affordability further.""It's contributing to price appreciation by restricting supply,"" said Mark Boud, founder of Real Estate Economics, a housing-consulting firm based in Irvine, Calif.Developments in areas such as Newport Beach, a tony Orange County town where the median home price is $1.59 million, have been caught in the crosshairs of environmentalists seeking to limit new building.

1850,TAP,"\Salesforce.com (CRM) announced its second major push into the vertical software arena within a week on Wednesday, as it unveiled a venture into the health care industry — a market that some contend has near-limitless growth potential and countless avenues for tech companies to pursue.Salesforce, though, isn't straying outside its comfort zone as it makes this push. The company has geared its health care effort around a strategy that involves sticking to its knitting in customer relationship management software, or CRM. While other tech companies have waded into the health industry in various incarnations — offering everything from electronic medical records to robotic surgeons — the cloud-computing developer says it plans to shy away from that, focusing only on the relationship between health provider and patient.'Treating Patients Like Consumers'Dr. Joshua Newman, a one-time practicing physician who is now the chief medical officer at Salesforce, is gearing the company's efforts toward an area that he says is sorely lacking in modern medicine.""What (health care providers are) bad at is relationships, phone calls, support, education, (the) patient experience — the waits are terrible,"" Newman said in an interview. ""People don't know what's going to happen to them. They don't have anyone to call. You can't get your lab results. The kinds of things we appreciate in every other industry, health care has been notoriously bad at.""Among its planned offerings, Salesforce is working on software that will let doctors, nurses and technicians all communicate in a sort of chat room to get up-to-date on a patient's condition, rather than on making countless phone calls. It would also allow health providers and patients to stay in frequent communication so that patients won't have to wait hours or days for answers on, say, prescriptions or therapy. In the past, providers have tried to keep patient communication to a minimum, he said.""The reason why is they've never gotten reimbursed for those things. In fact, it costs you money to call a patient. It costs you money to send emails, to have someone come in for something you don't get reimbursed for,"" he said. ""Health care just now is realizing the importance of treating patients like consumers.""Wealth Management MoveSalesforce plans to unveil specific products in October and start marketing them by February. Its announcement comes a week after the San Francisco-based company said it was venturing into the financial industry, another vertical business that it hopes will help the company meet a goal of reaching $10 billion in annual revenue. Salesforce is about two-thirds of the way there. Under its Dreamforce initiative, Salesforce has a number of other vertical initiatives — developing programs that are tailor-made for a certain industry — planned in other realms such as autos, media and retail.Both Salesforce executives and industry analysts agree pursuing a vertical strategy provides the next big growth opportunity for the software industry.What's in question, however, is just how lucrative health care will be. Research firm Gartner suggests vertical-specific software revenue designed for medical use is less than half that of government or banking programs. Health care also lags behind media, manufacturing and insurance in generating software revenue.Part of that is because the industry itself would rather devote its dollars to medical research, said Gartner analyst Jennifer Mazzucca.""(Information technology) has been relegated to not necessarily being the priority that it should be,"" she said.Big Software Will See You NowShe adds, however, that the reach of health care likely extends well beyond what current figures show, and is luring such companies as IBM (IBM) and Apple (AAPL) into vertical health care strategies, along with other industries where they can go vertical. Both IBM and Apple have formed an alliance to develop vertical-specific software.Plus, revenue attributed to other industries or entities, such as government or insurance, often have health care dollars attached to them, Mazzucca said.What's also unclear is how much growth potential there is in the industry, though it seems vast to many. The World Bank estimated overall U.S. health care spending at around $2.9 trillion in 2013, one-sixth of the nation's productivity. It also has an inflation rate that often is double or triple that of the rest of the economy, meaning its share of GDP will continue to grow.Translation: The life sciences industry can devote at least $50 billion a year to technology improvement, said Nitsa Zuppas, chief marketing officer at Veeva Systems (VEEV), which specializes in programs for pharmaceutical or biotech firms. She says Veeva itself can tap into a $5 billion market in the areas where it specializes, which includes tools to help pharmas get a proposed drug from lab to market.What also is promising about health care is that much of it remains in the dark ages when it comes digitizing. Zuppas points out that much of the regulatory approval process continues to be done the old-fashioned way — on paper — while it offers a program designed to rapidly expedite that process.""You have to have these documents forever, plus 10 years,"" she said. ""We see a huge opportunity.""Follow Russ Britt on Twitter @IBD_RBritt.

1851,TAP,"The must-have feature of Apple's (AAPL) ninth-generation iPhone could be its super-speedy, power-efficient main processor. Apple bears are dismissing the upcoming iPhone 6S as a minor upgrade to the current iPhone 6 series phones with no great new features. They are wrong, says Srini Sundararajan, a semiconductor industry analyst with Summit Research.
"
1852,TAP,"Current consensus on the next iPhone is that it will have a Force Touch display, which can tell the difference between a press and a tap, as well as improved cameras. But they're overlooking the possibility that the iPhone 6S could have a processor that is ""perceptibly superior to the current iPhone 6,"" Sundararajan said in a research report Thursday.The A9 chip in the iPhone 6S will offer performance ""to kill for,"" he said. It will be faster and more power-efficient because it will be fabricated at 14 nanometers, Sundararajan said.""The A9 processor will likely be 20% more powerful, 12-15% smaller in size and 35% more power-efficient,"" he said. The chip is also expected to offer a big graphics performance boost.Samsung is fabricating most of the early A9 chips, he said.Apple is also likely to double the RAM content of the next iPhone to 2 gigabytes from 1 GB and raise the minimum and maximum levels of NAND flash memory, he said.""The 6S will have better computational horsepower, which will make every function better,"" Sundararajan said. ""Which means a lot of programs will be faster and have better stability.""The technical improvements with the iPhone 6S could be enough to allow Apple to continue to grow its iPhone unit shipments even as it faces tough comparisons to the wildly successful iPhone 6 series.RELATED: 'Battleground stock' Apple unmoved by Apple Music news

1855,TAP,"Powered by rising home sales and prices, and lots of pent-up demand, the pace of remodeling spending is positioned to pick up. Industry experts expect remodeling spending to see a nice uptick this year amid strengthening housing market fundamentals, though they vary on just how much.
"
1856,TAP,"A recent flurry of good news on key housing indicators bodes well for remodeling:In June, existing home sales rose 3.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million from May, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales are now at their highest level since February 2007 and are up 9.6% from a year earlier.The median existing home price for all housing types in June was $236,400, up 6.5% from a year earlier and above the peak median sales price of $230,400 set in July 2006, says the NAR.Suppliers Stand OutA rise in remodeling spending should aid high-rated companies such as giant home improvement retailer Home Depot (HD), top home improvement and building products makerMasco (MAS), and global flooring company Mohawk Industries (MHK). These companies stand to benefit from increased spending on home spruce-ups like new flooring and renovations such as kitchen redos, the type of projects that may have been deferred in the past.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Masco, Home Depot and Mohawk to see double digit year-over-year profit growth in 2015, 2016 and 2017. They expect Israeli quartz surface maker Caesarstone Sdot-Yam (CSTE) to see double-digit profit growth in 2016 and 2017.""We think by the end of the year remodeling spending nationally will reach an all-time high,"" Kermit Baker, senior research fellow at Harvard's Joint Center For Housing Studies, told IBD. ""It looks like it's almost fully recovered from the (housing) downturn, where new construction is still well below where it was before the downturn.""Broadly, we're expecting to see mid-to-low single-digit growth in remodeling this year and then it will begin to accelerate at the end of the year moving into 2016 for the next year or two,"" said Baker, who directs the Remodeling Futures Program at Harvard's housing center.Total home improvement and repair spending peaked at just under $325 billion in 2007, he says. The Joint Center estimates it will rise 2.5% in 2015 from a year earlier to $325 billion. Baker projects spending growth will probably get to the long-term trend of 5% until there's another downturn.Home-Price Gains Are PivotalThe single most important trend driving the Joint Center's forecast is recovering home prices, he says.""Seeing home prices recover is crucial to consumers having the confidence to undertake a remodeling,"" he said.Another driver, he adds, is the fact that homeowners who had deferred some projects during the downturn from 2008 to 2011 are now ""attacking the list of projects they put off.""Such projects include bath and kitchen remodels and room additions. Baker says these types of projects have seen the ""strongest recovery"" from the downturn and should continue to do so as the market continues to grow.The Joint Center's key metric for tracking the growth of improvement spending specifically on owner-occupied properties is the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity (LIRA).The LIRA provides a short-term outlook of national homeowner improvement spending, estimating the annual rate of change in spending for the current quarter and prior three quarters. In Q3 that four-quarter moving total is forecast to reach $151.1 billion.The LIRA projects annual home-improvement spending growth of 2.8% in 2015 accelerating to 4% by the first quarter of 2016, says Joint Center research analyst Abbe Will.""Major drivers of this anticipated growth are the recent pick-up in home sales activity, sustained growth in retail sales of home improvement products and ongoing gains in house prices across much of the country,"" Will said.The biggest ""trigger"" for remodeling spending, says Baker, is the sale of a home, particularly an older one.Ken Fears, director of housing, finance and regional economics for the NAR, says there's a ""strong correlation"" between home sales and remodeling.""With an increase in home sales volumes, you're likely to see an increase in remodeling because people will have a source of funds from the sale to tap into to do the remodeling,"" he said.He expects remodeling trends to ""track the general trend"" for existing home sales.The NAR forecasts existing home sales will rise 6.6% this year, followed by a 4.1% gain in 2016.A Different ViewThe National Association of Home Builders calculates remodeling spending differently from how the Joint Center does it.NAHB senior economist Michael Neal says residential remodeling spending on owner-occupied properties fell by 24.3% from a year earlier in 2014 after it was hurt by harsh weather in the year's first half and kept falling in the second half.""However, because of the severity of the fall, the level of private residential improvement spending in 2015 will be below its level in 2014, by about 12%,"" Neal told IBD.""But beginning with the fourth quarter of 2015, private residential improvements spending will exceed its year-ago level, and year-over-year growth will continue into 2016 and 2017, by 13.2% and 3.1% respectively.""Piper Jaffray analyst Peter Keith says he expects to see a ""continued uptick"" in spending on larger-ticker home remodel projects such as kitchen and bath remodels.""I think we will see very strong same-store sales growth from the home improvement retailers,"" he told IBD.Keith notes that comments from both Home Depot and Lowe's Cos. (LOW) management indicate that sales volumes in certain categories such as lumber and concrete ""that are often utilized in larger-ticket projects are still well off their total previous highs in 2006 or 2007.""Large Projects Get UnderwayMorningstar analyst James Krapfel, who covers companies such as Masco and Mohawk, concurs that the mix of remodel and repair spending has ""shifted to more expensive projects, like full kitchen remodels, that tend to carry higher margins for the companies.""Daren Blomquist, vice president at property data tracker RealtyTrac, says due to rising home prices more people have equity in their homes than in the past. RealtyTrac research shows that people who have a mortgage and are ""equity rich,"" with at least 50% equity in their homes, have grown to 10.9 million this year, or about 20% of all homeowners with a mortgage, up from 9.9 million last year.""That puts more people in a good position to take out a HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) and use (the funds) to remodel their homes,"" he told IBD. ""In the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015, we saw a jump in HELOCs as more people regained their equity and felt comfortable enough to leverage that equity.""Current low interest rates may well prompt homeowners to take out some form of financing sooner rather than later, says Andres Carbacho-Burgos, associate director at Moody's Analytics.""Interest rates are so low now on whichever form of financing you look at, people may think if they're going to improve their homes and have to borrow to do so for large projects, now is the time,"" he said. ""They may think 'if I wait two to three years to borrow to pay for this I may have to pay higher rates.'""

1858,TAP,"Rep. Sam Johnson gives the Republican Party's Weekly RemarksWednesday is Veterans' Day, and as you might imagine, it has a very special meaning for me. Today, I want to tell you why.I served in the Air Force for 29 years. I flew combat missions in both the Korea and the Vietnam wars. And in 1966, when I was serving in Vietnam, I was shot down and taken prisoner. I spent nearly seven years in the Hanoi Hilton. And when I got out, I weighed about 140 pounds. (Scroll down for video of these remarks.)I got through those years by the grace and mercy of God and He gave me all the support I needed in my fellow POWs—great men like Jerry Denton and Jim Stockdale. We weren’t allowed to talk. So the first night in my cell—after I got out of the torture room—they taught me the tap code. The three of us did everything we could to fight back against our captors. So we were blacklisted as hardcore resisters.Soon we were moved to the place we called 'Alcatraz' POW camp along with eight others. The 11 of us became the 'Alcatraz Gang.' There, we spent 42 months in solitary confinement with our legs shackled.There was no news from home, and our captors did their best to make us feel forgotten. But my Alcatraz buddies and I were a family. We banded together, encouraged one another, and kept each other’s spirits up.I still remember one night in particular. I had spent 74 days in leg irons, and it had been a long time since I had seen the sky and the sun. I felt finished. But that night, a typhoon tore through the city of Hanoi. The floor of my cell filled with water, and I huddled against the wall as far away from the rain as I could. I began to pray as I had never prayed before. And I felt a strange sense of peace in the darkness.The next morning, my cell was flooded with the light of dawn. The storm had stopped. The boards off our window were taken off and I had an overwhelming sense of the presence of God at that moment. I knew I was going to be all right. And just a few hours later, guards came into my cell and removed my legs from the stocks.Telling that story reminds me of something a fellow captive etched on one of the walls.It read, 'Freedom has a taste to those who fight and almost die that the protected will never know.'You know, freedom isn’t free. It has a cost. And that cost is paid first by our veterans and their families—because when one member joins, it is the whole family that serves.When our veterans come home, we should do all we can to make sure they get the care they need when they need it. That is the least we can do.For now, I just want to wish all our servicemen and women a very happy Veterans’ Day.God bless you all, and God bless America. I salute you. ####Previous weekly party remarks are available here.RELATED:GOP: Let's sell U.S. energy abroadThank you, Mr. President, for all you've done to DemocratsMost transparent presidency closes more meetings than everObama aides explain how deadly gunfight with ISIS isn't combat

1859,TAP,"Are we there yet? The trend toward self-driving car technology figured in Tesla Motors (TSLA) and Mobileye (MBLY) quarterly reports this week, and it's likely to show up in Thursday afternoon's Q3 report by Nvidia (NVDA).Electric car maker Tesla said its 'Autopilot' system is enabled on about 40,000 Model S sedans and Model X crossovers for collision avoidance and autonomous emergency braking. An add-on option also lets them steer, change lanes with the tap of a turn signal, and parallel park.Mobileye makes some of the safety technology, with chips that interpret what car cameras are seeing. It recently launched its first ""deep learning functions"" on Tesla's Autopilot.Mobileye has some technology in 23 car brands, and it just put its most advanced version into a Nissan (NSANY) Intelligent Driving prototype car at the Tokyo Motor Show, underway this week.Chipmaker Nvidia is in all sorts of visual computing, even making a streaming-TV box that competes with Apple (AAPL) TV. Nvidia works with more than 50 companies to help power autonomous driving efforts.Analysts see regulations on autonomous emergency braking, or AEB, helping to drive car safety tech sales.Nvidia has a high IBD Composite Rating of 93, Mobileye a 76, and Tesla a low 21. Both Tesla and Mobileye stocks were trading up Wednesday after their quarterly reports Tuesday.Follow Donna Howell on Twitter @IBD_DHowell.RELATED: New Tech Powers Car Buying As People Want Safety Most.

1887,TAP,"A Marine Corps motto is ""Improvise, Adapt and Overcome."" Similarly, organizations that can quickly spot a challenge or opportunity faster than their competitors and respond effectively are likelier to deliver results, says Pamela Meyer, author of ""The Agility Shift."" She notes that Gap (GPS), the established clothing firm, is closing 175 stores in North America, while Zara, ""its more agile counterpart, is thriving.""

1888,TAP,"Bill Jensen, author of ""Future Strong,"" adds that 40% of today's Fortune 500 companies will not exist in 10 years.

1889,TAP,"Tips on adapting your company and people to challenges:
"
1890,TAP," Deputize employees. Agile leaders, teams and organizations do not miss opportunities or slow their response time because ""they are waiting on approval, or for someone with the correct job description to become available,"" Meyer emphasized. Effective executives hire and coach others to lead and respond to opportunities and challenges as they arise.
"
1891,TAP," Cross-train them. A solid way leaders at all levels become more agile, Meyer said, is to regularly seek out new opportunities and assignments: ""UPS (UPS) and many other organizations have a recruit-from-within policy that is designed to ensure their leaders rotate through a wide range of experiences, from package delivery to leading a team in another country. Such experiences build competence and capacity to be effective when things don't go as planned.""
"
1892,TAP," Get smarter. Meyer suggests creating a web of relationships and resources to respond to unexpected challenges. When they arise, ""there is not always time to gather and analyze complex data,"" she said. ""It is through their relational web that agile people tap their wider resources, knowledge and expertise to respond effectively. The time to discover and build this relational web is not in the midst of crisis, but through their day-to-day interactions.""
"
1893,TAP,"Meyer adds that outfits of all sizes employ resources ranging from Google (GOOGL) groups to corporate social networks. These help the firms' people tap their relational web and access the skills, knowledge and talent they need.
"
1894,TAP," Recognize. When evaluating performance, value and reward agility and learning, as they go a long way toward reinforcing winning behavior, says Meyer.
"
1895,TAP," Jump outside comfort zones. To realize your firm's limitless capacity, ""you must disrupt and reimagine those systems, long before best practices are established or all the risks have been mitigated — that takes leadership courage,"" Jensen said.
"
1896,TAP,"He notes that multinational management consulting giant Accenture (ACN) is eliminating its formal yearly review process for its 330,000 people, with CEO Pierre Nanterme making that leap so that his company can select the right person rather than solely measuring and evaluating people by numbers or statistics.

This is why investors need to work hard to build their trading and research skills, and to know when to properly buy a stock, and how to read the signals that say it is time to sell.The 'N' in IBD's CAN SLIM investment system stands for ""new"": new products, new markets, new management — a company that is reformed or has a fresh strategy.All of these factors may point to a stock that is about to upshift and go places.On the other side of the coin are fundamental factors such as earnings, revenue, margins, debt and return on equity. These factors figure significantly into determining whether a new idea can ultimately fly. Some of the greatest ideas in history failed because the minds behind them couldn't successfully manage a company.IBD's New America feature aims to focus squarely on these aspects of potential leaders. It works to catch them early in a turnaround, soon after they turn profitable or when a groundbreaking product is released. The section then tends to track the stock throughout its advance.Ambarella (AMBA), a current leader on the IBD 50 list, is a good example.

1981,TAP,"Salesforce.com (CRM) is trying to become a $10 billion company as well as tap into a target-rich environment, and it may well have made huge strides toward both with its announcement Tuesday of plans to offer wealth management services software to the cloud.
"
1982,TAP,"The big player in cloud customer relationship management software, Salesforce said it will start offering this financial services package — called the Salesforce Financial Services Cloud — as part of its design to go ""vertical"" in a number of fields instead of just offering what it calls a ""horizontal"" product that can be used in a number of industries.
"
1983,TAP,"Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has made no secret of his plans to grow the company by leaps and bounds over the next few years, with a goal of reaching $10 billion in annual revenue, and this is one key avenue the company is using to achieve that through its ""Dreamforce"" initiatives.
"
1984,TAP,"""It expands the number of people who could use their software,"" said Samad Samana, analyst for FBR Capital Markets. ""This is what I call the natural evolution of an enterprise software company.""
"
1985,TAP,"Salesforce officials say they plan to bring several product offerings to market that home in on specific industries. Health care and the auto industry are just two of the other industries that will be targeted.
"
1986,TAP,"Offering software that helps money advisors speak with clients provided the most immediate opportunity, said Simon Mulcahy, senior vice president and general manager of Salesforce's financial services unit. It also was the industry where Salesforce's normal CRM customers were the loudest.
"
1987,TAP,"""The feedback was so strong,"" Mulcahy said. ""This is a paradigm that is not there at the moment.""
"
1988,TAP,"Financial advisors and clients traditionally have maintained a formal relationship in which the advisor spends a significant amount of time preparing paperwork for a face-to-face appointment with a client. That's the extent of the relationship in many cases, Mulcahy said.
"
1989,TAP,"What Salesforce hopes to do is digitize the ties between advisor and client so there can be constant communication between the two, even in informal settings. Advisors would be able to look at a client's portfolio from the back of a cab or in a coffee line and offer advice instantly online.
"
1990,TAP,"Mulcahy says Salesforce picked financial services first because the company's existing financial services customers — who advise everyone from high net-worth clients down to the average retail investor — sought ways to deepen relationships with clients.

1997,TAP,"Salesforce, which carries a high Composite Rating of 93 from IBD, ended trading essentially flat in the stock market today.Salesforce.com (CRM) is trying to become a $10 billion company as well as tap into a target-rich environment, and it may well have made huge strides toward both with its announcement Tuesday of plans to offer wealth management services software to the cloud.The big player in cloud customer relationship management software, Salesforce said it will start offering this financial services package — called the Salesforce Financial Services Cloud — as part of its design to go ""vertical"" in a number of fields instead of just offering what it calls a ""horizontal"" product that can be used in a number of industries.Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has made no secret of his plans to grow the company by leaps and bounds over the next few years, with a goal of reaching $10 billion in annual revenue, and this is one key avenue the company is using to achieve that through its ""Dreamforce"" initiatives.""It expands the number of people who could use their software,"" said Samad Samana, analyst for FBR Capital Markets. ""This is what I call the natural evolution of an enterprise software company.""Salesforce officials say they plan to bring several product offerings to market that home in on specific industries. Health care and the auto industry are just two of the other industries that will be targeted.Offering software that helps money advisors speak with clients provided the most immediate opportunity, said Simon Mulcahy, senior vice president and general manager of Salesforce's financial services unit. It also was the industry where Salesforce's normal CRM customers were the loudest.""The feedback was so strong,"" Mulcahy said. ""This is a paradigm that is not there at the moment.""Financial advisors and clients traditionally have maintained a formal relationship in which the advisor spends a significant amount of time preparing paperwork for a face-to-face appointment with a client. That's the extent of the relationship in many cases, Mulcahy said.What Salesforce hopes to do is digitize the ties between advisor and client so there can be constant communication between the two, even in informal settings. Advisors would be able to look at a client's portfolio from the back of a cab or in a coffee line and offer advice instantly online.Mulcahy says Salesforce picked financial services first because the company's existing financial services customers — who advise everyone from high net-worth clients down to the average retail investor — sought ways to deepen relationships with clients.""We're not moving in and exploring.

2025,TAP,"With no new streaming video player in two and a half years, Apple (AAPL) is losing ground in the market. Apple's set-top box, Apple TV, slipped to fourth place in U.S. sales of streaming media devices last year, research firm Parks Associates reported Thursday.Roku continues to lead in streaming media device sales, accounting for 34% of units sold in 2014. Google (GOOGL) was second with 23%. Amazon.com (AMZN) overtook Apple for third place. Amazon grabbed 16% of the market, compared with 13% for Apple.Together the top four brands accounted for 86% of all streaming media devices sold to U.S. broadband households in 2014, Parks said.""The market consolidation around these four brands forces new entrants to develop more creative features and functionality to tap into the strong consumer demand for streaming content,"" Parks analyst Barbara Kraus said in a statement. ""Devices with additional functionality such as the Intel (INTC) Compute Stick may be a sign of things to come, where streaming is not the primary function but an extra feature to provide additional value.""Nearly 20% of U.S. broadband households own at least one streaming media player, such as a Roku 3, Amazon Fire TV or Apple TV. And 8% own at least one streaming stick, such as a Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV Stick, or Roku's HDMI Streaming Stick. About 2% own both form factors.Based on usage, Roku has an even more commanding lead.Among U.S. broadband households that own a streaming media device, Roku is the most used at 37%, followed by Google Chromecast at 19%, Apple TV at 17% and Amazon Fire TV devices at 14%, Parks Associates says.Apple hasn't updated its Apple TV streaming device since January 2013, when it upgraded the components on its third-generation device. In March, Apple cut the price on the current Apple TV device to $69 from $99.Some analysts expect Apple to come out with a new version of Apple TV as soon as next month when it launches the iPhone 6S. Media reports say the fourth-generation Apple TV could come with its own app store for games and more video services. It also could come with a new remote control with support for Siri voice commands.The popularity of streaming media boxes has grown as consumers have shifted from linear pay-TV programming to on-demand Internet video from services such as Netflix (NFLX) and Hulu.

2052,TAP,"The zombie apocalypse is inevitable, all reasonable people can agree. But there's no reason to ""Fear The Walking Dead"" (premiering on AMC (AMCX) Sunday night). Here are seven stocks that should do well in a zombie outbreak, including Elon Musk's Tesla Motors (TSLA) and cousin firm SolarCity (SCTY).The zombie apocalypse portfolio may sound ridiculous, but as of Wednesday night it had soared 399% since AMC's ""The Walking Dead"" premiered in late 2010. That's much faster than the 70% gain in the S&P 500.Here's why the seven stocks are on the list, and while others, like General Electric (GE), are not.Tesla Batteries For Off-GridTesla Motors is a new zombie portfolio stock. Its all-electric cars and Supercharger network always seemed intriguing for a future with empty gas pumps. But the move into battery storage is what makes Tesla a zombie stock. Many analysts have argued that Powerwall batteries aren't cost-effective, because it makes financial sense for Americans to sell excess solar power to the grid, then tap the grid when needed.But in a world where everyone is off the grid, Tesla's batteries would be a godsend, and a perfect complement to solar panels.SolarCity Shines OnThat's where SolarCity comes in. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is chairman and a top shareholder of the solar panel installer, which is run by Musk's cousin.SolarCity is the largest solar installer and has paved the way with innovative financing to help cover upfront panel costs for residential and business customers, while reaping the benefits of tax credits.Having dependable — and quiet — power could make life much more bearable when the Great Outdoors is a never-ending trail of terror.Generac Generators Are Also A Bright IdeaIn a similar vein, Generac (GNRC) generators provide an option for off-grid power. The company benefitted hugely from Superstorm Sandy and other natural disasters, and there's no greater disaster than a zombie apocalypse.(Some have pointed out that General Electric, for instance, also makes generators. And a record GE energy storage deal was announced Thursday.But General Electric is a diversified conglomerate. The zombie apocalypse portfolio wants stocks that are heavily exposed to the undead.)Smith & Wesson: The Quick And The UndeadWhile being able to turn on the lights is a nice idea, there's no denying that in a world of threats living and dead, being armed is a basic necessity. Smith & Wesson (SWHC) and Sturm Ruger (RGR) firearms are just common sense.Cabela's: Your Zombie OutfitterCabela's (CAB) is a leading outdoor sporting goods store. It's a good place to buy hunting rifles, ammo, but also camping gear, outdoor clothing and other survivalist-type gear.GNC: Don't Forget Your VitaminsWhen you're staving off zombies, you also have to stave off scurvy. Obtaining a well-balanced diet with essential vitamins and minerals won't be easy. Whole Foods Market (WFM) will no longer be offering fresh organic kale and heirloom tomatoes. GNC (GNC) stores offer light, compact vitamins, minerals and other powders for the on-the-go zombie survivalist.Update:Zombie stocks had a rough Thursday as the S&P 500 suffered its worst loss since February 2014. Tesla lost 5.1% while SolarCity dimmed 4.5%. GNC, Generac and Cabela's fell about 2%, while Smith & Wesson and Sturm Ruger shed about 1%.That's bad news for investors. But it may suggest that a zombie outbreak is just a little less likely. And keep in mind this salient fact: The Federal Reserve has never raised interest rates heading into an apocalypse.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.

And this coming week six IPOs are on tap to raise more than $1 billion total.""It was an excellent week for IPOs,"" said Scott Sweet, senior managing partner at research firm IPOboutique.com. ""The biotech area continues to be white hot.""ProNAi Therapeutics (DNAI) was the week's big winner, soaring 81% on its first day. ProNAi, which is developing drugs against cancer and other diseases, raised $138 million after pricing at 17. The stock fell 2.6% on Friday at 30.Chiasma (CHMA) rallied 25% on its first day, then traded flat on Friday. It develops oral orphan medicines, which treat rare diseases. The company raised $102 million with an upsized IPO that priced at 16, above the expected 13-to-15 range.Health care accounts for 49 of the 112 IPOs this year, triple that of the No. 2 sector, technology, according to Renaissance Capital. Healthy takeover activity is helping to fuel medical IPOs, Sweet said. Auspex Pharmaceuticals came public in February 2014 and was bought by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) for $3.2 billion in March.Cybersecurity Stocks HotThe Rapid7 (RPD) IPO showed the strong interest in cybersecurity stocks. Rapid7 priced at an above-range 16 and raised $103 million.It follows the September 2014 IPO of CyberArk Software (CYBR), which is up 254% from its IPO price of 16. Qualys (QLYS) is up 208% from its September 2012 IPO. Cybersecurity companies are showing strong growth in revenue, though not all are profitable.Rapid7 reported Q1 revenue of $23.6 million, up 41%, the third straight quarter of accelerating growth. But it lost a net $7.7 million amid heavy sales and marketing spending. And the company signaled that near-term profits aren't a concern.""We're investing heavily in solutions, services and talent to help our customers,"" CEO Corey Thomas told IBD after Rapid7 stock began trading. ""I believe in building a great, sustainable business that will be profitable when the time comes.""Two other IPOs debuted Friday with less fanfare. Ooma (OOMA) fell 16% to 10.82 after pricing at 13, below the range of 16 to 18, raising $65 million. Ooma provides Internet telecom services for homes and small businesses using a cloud-based platform.MCBC Holdings (MCFT), parent of sports-boat maker MasterCraft, rose 6% to 15.92. It had priced at 15, the high end of its range, raising $91.5 million.The week's largest IPO was Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI), which raised $143 million by pricing at 16, above its 13-15 range. The close-out retailer rose 32% in Thursday's debut, then fell 5% to 20.04 Friday.Buffalo Feeding FrenzyOn tap is Blue Buffalo Pet Products (BUFF), a natural pet food maker set to raise $501 million.""It's already many multiple times oversubscribed. There is exponential demand for shares,"" Sweet said. ""It's looking like a moonshot,"" a term used to describe stocks that pop 100% or more on the first day of trading.Blue Buffalo is set to price Tuesday and begin trading Wednesday under the ticker BUFF. It's offering 29.5 million shares at a range of 16 to 18, but all proceeds will go to current investors.Blue Buffalo reported 2014 net income of $102 million, with revenue rising 28% to $917.8 million.

2059,TAP,"Breakthroughs don't always start with a flash. Sometimes genius follows a mumble, grumble or silent moment. Start a ripple. Work is where big ideas happen, or so we hope.""Beyond Measure"" author Margaret Heffernan encourages incremental steps toward an inspirational culture. ""Small changes — listening, asking questions, sharing information — alter beyond measure the ideas, insights and connections those systems are capable of producing,"" she told IBD.Heffernan's first order: Think.""If we let it, our mind will wander beyond cliche, jargon, second-guessing,"" she said. Embrace stillness. Go to a meeting and say nothing. Just listen.Intuit (INTU) founder Scott Cook tunes in for surprises — comments that contradict or challenge his assumptions.As Ford Motor's (F) manager of global trends, Sheryl Connelly writes down anything with which she disagrees. Later she delves into that notebook for details ""she hadn't appreciated in the heat of the moment,"" Heffernan said. Probe. Murky ideas are easy to dismiss. Pixar President Ed Catmull told Heffernan most of the Disney (DIS) animation studio's blockbusters seem, initially, like clunkers. To ferret out winners, Pixar execs explore them all. ""The first glimmer of an idea or observation is like gold dust — highly cherished but hard to spot and not immediately valuable,"" said Heffernan. Reserve time. When Harvard University professor Leslie Perlow studied a software company, she noticed how engineers struggled to juggle routine meetings with time for creative work.Her proposal: Make 8 a.m. to noon three days a week quiet hours, during which no meetings or interruptions are allowed.Productivity soared — and workers became more respectful of others' time and were mindful to avoid unnecessary disruptions. Express. Every culture has reasons people avoid speaking up.Many cultures favor conformity.In Singapore, saving face is a priority. ""I've concluded that conflict aversion and a desire to please are universal, eviscerating our energy, initiative and our courage,"" Heffernan wrote. Invite dissent. Executives might assume reaching a consensus means everyone's communicating. The opposite is occurring.""Unanimity is always a sign that participation isn't wholehearted,"" Heffernan said.Make sure everyone's contributing thoughts, rather than staying mute to go with the group. Explore the fray. Instead of avoiding clashes at work, see those disagreements through — and pay attention to what lies under the surface of strife. ""Buried under the dragon's foot is always a gem — something to be learned from conflict,"" Heffernan said. Tune into discord.  Everyone doesn't have to get along to advance. ""Grumpy orchestras tend to play better and happiness is the output, not the input, of their work together,"" Heffernan said. Tap outside thoughts.  It's easy to think the office is where serious thinking happens, and what happens at home is trivial in comparison. ""This is a profound error,"" Heffernan said.A Procter & Gamble (PG) product manager told Heffernan a part-time worker became essential to the team by bringing the perspective of a typical consumer. Break away. Clear head space is essential. ""Volkswagen (VLKAY) turns off email outside of office hours,"" Heffernan said. ""We need time to let our minds wander and find the insights and inspirations no amount of focus will ever bring.""

In addition to replacement sales from existing customers, Apple should continue to gain market share in the high-end smartphone segment from Google (GOOGL) Android switchers, Walkley said.""Our global wireless surveys over the June quarter indicated strong iPhone 6/6 Plus smartphone sales as the iPhone remained the top-selling smartphone at all four Tier-1 U.S. carriers, with overall sell-through share estimated near 50%,"" Walkley said. ""Apple's very strong iPhone 6 upgrade cycle should continue through calendar 2015 due to ongoing upgrade sales and high-end market share gains.""Apple should be able to grow its iPhone installed base to over 500 million users by year's end, he says.""This base should drive strong future iPhone replacement sales, earnings, as well as cash flow generation to fund strong long-term capital returns programs consistent with the $200 billion program announced on April 27,"" he wrote.Walkley reiterated his buy rating on Apple stock with a price target of 160.Apple stock fell 2.5% Wednesday to 122.60, a more than three-month low.Meanwhile, a Wall Street Journal report says that Apple is asking its suppliers to make between 85 million and 90 million units of its two new iPhone models by year's end.

2091,TAP,"Ingenuity belongs to the inquisitive. Business questions to ask, and answer: Be an explorer. ""You can't just use Google (GOOGL) to make all your decisions,"" said Phil McKinney, author of ""Beyond the Obvious.""Breakthrough thinking comes from willingness to probe.McKinney came up with 150 business-related questions and culled them to 48 for the book. The trick to spurring new thought?""Construct your questions in a way that causes you to look at the problem in a unique or different way,"" he told IBD. Go there. A good question gets you up out of your chair. When he was a chief technology officer at Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), McKinney frequented electronics stores to talk to employees and customers in the midst of the buying process.That's how he found out that people over age 50 weren't buying the company's laptops. That particular model's aluminum keys were hard to read. ""The only way to figure that out is to be out there talking to the customer,"" he said. Detect dissatisfaction.  Don't just ask what constituents like. McKinney's lines include:""What do my potential customers dislike about the buying experience?""What is surprisingly inconvenient about my product?"" Find outliers. Want to expand your company's offerings? Ask: ""Who is using my product in a way I never intended?"" McKinney said.Furniture store Ikea finds answers at IkeaHackers.net. That's where people post hacks — ways they've boosted furniture functionality. Expand client base. McKinney recommends finding new customer categories by asking: ""Who am I not selling to because I think they can't or won't pay for my product?""Pricey designer handbags were out of reach for many women until Web startup Bag Borrow or Steal let customers rent those classy clutches for a monthly fee. Reshape it. Another business expander: ""Can I recombine existing components to create new products for customers I don't currently serve?"" McKinney said.Publisher Conde Nast did that with an app that creates customizable city guides for readers.Vacationers headed for Italy can use it to access travel tips, recipes, fashion stories and architectural points of interest from Conde Nast's various magazines. Tap hidden assets. ""What are we throwing away because we assume it has no value?"" McKinney said.Zoos paid for animal manure to be hauled away, until someone thought to sell it to gardeners.Telecom firm Teligent, where McKinney worked in 1997, threw away records of calls that weren't completed. He sifted through the refuse and crafted a service that detailed what calls failed to get through — so businesses could pick up on missed client opportunities. Look sideways. Tap into others' expertise by asking: ""What industries are analogous to ours, and what can we learn from them?"" McKinney said.A megachurch could look to Walt Disney World (DIS) to learn crowd management techniques for improving traffic flow and parking. Find openings. Want to jump from the corporate to the startup world? Ask what product or process gaps exist in your sector.""Start from these nuggets to figure out how your company can solve a gigantic problem, provide a novel approach or reinvent a broken process using technology,"" said Sally Poblete, founder of Wellthie.

A move higher won't mean much until one or both of the indexes retake support at their 50-day line.

2120,TAP,"Online payment processor PayPal is much likelier to partner with China's Alibaba Group than Amazon.com (AMZN) after its spinoff from eBay, speculates Morgan Stanley, which raised its price target on eBay.Brian Nowak, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, raised his price target on eBay (EBAY) to 68 from 52 in a research report Thursday, on views an alliance with Alibaba (BABA) could materialize. He valued PayPal, which has expanded into mobile payments, at 38 per share. The spinoff is expected to take place in Q3.EBay stock was up a fraction in early-afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 62.Nowak says one concern about PayPal is competition from Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) in mobile wallets.""Intensifying competition from the biggest mobile platforms (Apple and Google) could make it challenging for PayPal to establish a leadership position in (mobile commerce),"" Nowak wrote. ""We see the emergence of Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay clouding its outlook in mobile and potentially weighing on its multiple.""Others also cite competition.Overseas expansion, however, could boost PayPal's growth, says the Morgan Stanley analyst. He says one possibility is PayPal teaming with China Mobile (CHL), that country's biggest provider of wireless phone services.While some analysts have speculated that PayPal could be a takeover target following its spinoff from eBay, Nowak sees it staying independent near term and forming partnerships.""Winning acceptance with Alibaba seems more likely than Amazon to us, given that PayPal has more to offer to Alibaba's China-based sellers,"" Nowak wrote. ""From a consumer perspective, we think Amazon's one-click functionality may trump the appeal of using the PayPal wallet in the first place.""A PayPal/Alibaba partnership may be more compelling, as it offers Alibaba the potential to tap into U.S.-based buyers. Joseph Tsai, vice chairman at Alibaba, noted in an interview last year that PayPal's footprint outside of China is complementary to its own within China, implying potential for synergies.

2138,TAP,"One way to look at this year's Morningstar Investment Conference, whose first full day is Thursday, is that it is all about opportunities — opportunities for finding low-risk income, for women as investors as well as financial advisors, and for finding mouth-watering investments.The three-day gathering, which is the 27th annual edition of the popular industry powwow, began Wednesday in Chicago.As usual, the conclave is scheduled to feature marquee investors, this year including Oakmark's Bill Nygren and FPA's Steve Romick, as well as strategists Jeremy Grantham of GMO, David Kelly of JPMorgan and Rick Rieder of BlackRock.Morningstar expects the conference to draw about the same numbers as last year: almost 2,000 attendees, including nearly 1,100 financial advisors.Advisors flock to the conference seeking wisdom for their clients, including those in or near retirement.Women's issues were slated to be well aired in four of Wednesday's preconference sessions.One of the sessions concerned what happens when women's financial needs differ from men's. For one thing, wives tend to survive husbands more than vice versa, so more women need nuts-and-bolts advice about handling asset transfers, Laura Pavlenko Lutton, a director of manager research for Morningstar, told IBD. Also, surviving female spouses need portfolios structured for longevity.One Wednesday panel, moderated by Lutton, was queued up to look at whether female investors behave differently than men.Thursday SessionsA Thursday morning Morningstar Investment Conference panel is due to discuss whether frontier markets are worth pursuing.Panelist Laura Geritz, lead manager of Wasatch's $1.2 billion Frontier Emerging Small Countries and $457 million International Opportunities , told IBD before the conference that several Asian markets are most attractive to her, in part because they have large, healthy, well-educated populations.Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan are also near customers and investors in China and India.Another Thursday morning panel is plugged in to look at robo-advisors and how much of a threat they pose to human advisors.Panelists will look at the latest innovations from automated advisory services and discuss how financial advisors can decide whether robo-advice is a threat or potential supplementary tool.Another Thursday panel is lined up to tackle the benefits of companies with wide competitive moats. They might be the high costs of entering an industry or name brand dominance.The familiarity of household products like Vanish, Calgon and Woolite provide the U.K.'s Reckitt Benckiser with its moat, says Bruno Paulson, a manager of Morgan Stanley's $562 million Institutional Global Franchise and $24 million Institutional Global Quality .In a Thursday afternoon session, panelists Laird Landmann of TCW, Gibson Smith of Janus and Elaine Stokes of Loomis Sayles are on tap to discuss unearthing value in bonds.In the day's final session, Oakmark's Nygren and FPA's Romick are booked to discuss whether stock-picking is dead in an era that toasts low-cost, passive investing.

2139,TAP,"Synaptics stock has been hammered by reports Apple is internally developing an integrated touch controller/display driver (TDDI) chip for use in future iPhones.Synaptics (SYNA), a leader in touch interface technology, has pushed TDDI integrated circuits as a key growth driver. Renesas SP Drivers, acquired last year by Synaptics, is a longtime iPhone supplier.Apple's (AAPL) homegrown TDDI chip also will have an integrated fingerprint sensor, DigiTimes reported Monday. Synaptics has been working on an integrated fingerprint-TDDI system since it acquired Validity Sensors in 2013.By using one chip with touch controller, display driver and fingerprint sensor technology, Apple could make an iPhone without a physical home button, DigiTimes said.The first iPhone without a home button likely is more than two years away, a source told AppleInsider.The elimination of the home button would be a radical redesign to the iPhone, AppleInsider said. The button is used for waking the display, returning to the home screen, accessing the iOS quick app switcher and for Touch ID security functions.Eliminating the home button would allow iPhones and iPads to have larger displays. Apple news website BGR called the home button ""wasted space"" on iOS devices.Apple could use its new Force Touch technology to create a virtual home button that is only activated when you push down on a specific area of the screen with enough pressure. Force Touch currently is available only on the Apple Watch, but is rumored to be coming to the next handsets, the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, due out this fall.Force Touch can distinguish between different touches like a tap and a press, creating new usage scenarios.Synaptics stock fell a fraction Tuesday. On Monday, after the DigiTimes report, Synaptics stock fell 4.9% to 93.56. It fell 3.1% on Friday. Synaptics stock hit an all-time high of 102.50 on Thursday.Last week, Synaptics said Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has adopted the Synaptics ClearPad family of capacitive touchscreen systems and its family of display driver integrated circuits.

"
2169,TAP,"It's (almost) summer. Time for school graduations, and let's not forget dad on Father's Day.
"
2170,TAP,"Dads and grads love getting tech gifts, so here are a couple ideas we recently tested:
"
2171,TAP," Party time means music, and probably loud. If your grad's (or dad's) current speaker system is starting to sound a little wimpy, it may be time for Ulimate Ears Megaboom Bluetooth speaker. At $299.99, the Logitech (LOGI) product is available in a multitude of colors, the Megaboom has a rechargeable lithium-ion battery that provides up to 20 hours of music and 360-degree sound. And it's LOUD, cranking out up to 90 decibels, which is about as loud as it gets before damage to your hearing begins to set in. It sounds great, and it's waterproof, so if it gets knocked into the pool, the party doesn't stop.
"
2172,TAP," Summer is also a great time to catch up on reading. Similar to streaming music services, Magzter Gold provides all-you-can-read issues of over 2,500 different magazines, with more being offered weekly. The Gold subscription, which lets dad or grad read numerous magazines, is only $9.99 a month. And there's no contract, dad or grad can cancel if they decide they'd rather watch YouTube.
"
2173,TAP," If someone you know is getting a new Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6 for Father's Day or graduation, why not give them a new $89.99 LifeProof Nuud case to keep it safe? The case is fully submersible up to 6.6 feet and is water-tested before it's packed, so the phone encased in it can withstand being dropped, or even dunked, into a pool. It comes in several colors and color combinations and has available belt clips and other mounts, so your grad or dad can clip it onto their bike or car dashboard.
"
2174,TAP," How smart does a smartwatch have to be? The new Apple Watch does a multitude of things, but not everyone wants that much technology on their wrist. The Martian Notifier smartwatch not only costs a lot less, at $129, but is a great-looking analog watch that pairs with your smartphone to notify you of calls and texts from a large number of apps that have selectable vibration patterns. A tap on the watch's display screen dismisses the notification. With a variety of colored bands, you can select just the combination that suits your recipient.
"
2175,TAP," Nothing says road trip like summer graduation. Before you let your graduates start theirs, gift them with the Cyntur JumperPack mini. At $99.99, it's somewhat more expensive than a set of jumper cables. But this compact portable battery doesn't require that someone stop and help out your graduate if they need a jump-start. In addition to the jumper cables that are packed with the book-size unit, there is also a 2.1-amp USB port, so your grads can top off their tablet or smartphone to call for roadside service if needed. Just charge it up with the included AC charger before they leave, and the JumperPack Mini will hold its charge for a year.
"
2176,TAP," Can a suitcase be a tech gift? Sure, if it's the new 22-inch Carry On With Integrated Suiter by Genius Pack. Besides an optional smartphone/tablet on-the-go charger, the Carry On has a checklist and separate compartments for toiletries and other must-haves for a summer trip. And if your dad or grad gets a bit overambitious with their packing, a zipper lets the bag expand an additional 2 inches. There's also a one-way air valve that lets the bag compress in depth by an inch or two, like those vacuum storage bags you see in the department stores. There's even an integrated suit carrier so your dad or grad will look good when they get to their destination. Finally, a separate compartment, accessible from the outside, stores worn clothing so it doesn't soil the clean clothes still packed in the luggage. The $218 Carry On has compartments for a water bottle, and even an optional mini-umbrella.
"
2177,TAP," A cool tech toy makes a great gift for grads of any age. Darkside Ollie, from Sphero.com, is a $129.99 can-shaped robot with interchangeable tires on each end that is controlled by a smartphone or tablet app from as far away as 100 feet. It comes with a USB cable to charge it and several sets of tires for different surfaces. Darkside Ollie glows in different colors, and there are smartphone and tablet apps that let your grad program the small robot. Darkside Ollie can go as fast as 14 mph, which lets it do tricks like jumps, flips and drifts. And if you gift a pair, you can have Darkside Ollie races.It's (almost) summer. Time for school graduations, and let's not forget dad on Father's Day.Dads and grads love getting tech gifts, so here are a couple ideas we recently tested: Party time means music, and probably loud. If your grad's (or dad's) current speaker system is starting to sound a little wimpy, it may be time for Ulimate Ears Megaboom Bluetooth speaker. At $299.99, the Logitech (LOGI) product is available in a multitude of colors, the Megaboom has a rechargeable lithium-ion battery that provides up to 20 hours of music and 360-degree sound. And it's LOUD, cranking out up to 90 decibels, which is about as loud as it gets before damage to your hearing begins to set in. It sounds great, and it's waterproof, so if it gets knocked into the pool, the party doesn't stop. Summer is also a great time to catch up on reading. Similar to streaming music services, Magzter Gold provides all-you-can-read issues of over 2,500 different magazines, with more being offered weekly. The Gold subscription, which lets dad or grad read numerous magazines, is only $9.99 a month. And there's no contract, dad or grad can cancel if they decide they'd rather watch YouTube. If someone you know is getting a new Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6 for Father's Day or graduation, why not give them a new $89.99 LifeProof Nuud case to keep it safe? The case is fully submersible up to 6.6 feet and is water-tested before it's packed, so the phone encased in it can withstand being dropped, or even dunked, into a pool. It comes in several colors and color combinations and has available belt clips and other mounts, so your grad or dad can clip it onto their bike or car dashboard. How smart does a smartwatch have to be? The new Apple Watch does a multitude of things, but not everyone wants that much technology on their wrist. The Martian Notifier smartwatch not only costs a lot less, at $129, but is a great-looking analog watch that pairs with your smartphone to notify you of calls and texts from a large number of apps that have selectable vibration patterns. A tap on the watch's display screen dismisses the notification. With a variety of colored bands, you can select just the combination that suits your recipient. Nothing says road trip like summer graduation. Before you let your graduates start theirs, gift them with the Cyntur JumperPack mini. At $99.99, it's somewhat more expensive than a set of jumper cables. But this compact portable battery doesn't require that someone stop and help out your graduate if they need a jump-start. In addition to the jumper cables that are packed with the book-size unit, there is also a 2.1-amp USB port, so your grads can top off their tablet or smartphone to call for roadside service if needed. Just charge it up with the included AC charger before they leave, and the JumperPack Mini will hold its charge for a year. Can a suitcase be a tech gift? Sure, if it's the new 22-inch Carry On With Integrated Suiter by Genius Pack. Besides an optional smartphone/tablet on-the-go charger, the Carry On has a checklist and separate compartments for toiletries and other must-haves for a summer trip. And if your dad or grad gets a bit overambitious with their packing, a zipper lets the bag expand an additional 2 inches. There's also a one-way air valve that lets the bag compress in depth by an inch or two, like those vacuum storage bags you see in the department stores. There's even an integrated suit carrier so your dad or grad will look good when they get to their destination. Finally, a separate compartment, accessible from the outside, stores worn clothing so it doesn't soil the clean clothes still packed in the luggage. The $218 Carry On has compartments for a water bottle, and even an optional mini-umbrella. A cool tech toy makes a great gift for grads of any age. Darkside Ollie, from Sphero.com, is a $129.99 can-shaped robot with interchangeable tires on each end that is controlled by a smartphone or tablet app from as far away as 100 feet. It comes with a USB cable to charge it and several sets of tires for different surfaces. Darkside Ollie glows in different colors, and there are smartphone and tablet apps that let your grad program the small robot. Darkside Ollie can go as fast as 14 mph, which lets it do tricks like jumps, flips and drifts. And if you gift a pair, you can have Darkside Ollie races.

2205,TAP,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 6S looks like it will be a tad thicker than the current model to accommodate the use of a Force Touch display.Apple first used the Force Touch display on Apple Watch. The display can tell the difference between a tap and press, creating new usage scenarios. Force Touch is expected to be the biggest selling point of the next-generation iPhone.KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo this week said the iPhone 6S will be 0.2 millimeter thicker, 0.15 mm taller and fractionally wider than the iPhone 6, Forbes reported.While the design changes are slight, it would mark just the second time a new iPhone has been thicker than its predecessor.The current flagship model, iPhone 6, is 6.9 mm thin. (The iPhone 6 Plus model is 7.1 mm thin.) Its predecessors, the iPhone 5 and 5S, were 7.6 mm thin. Before them, the iPhone 4 and 4S, were 9.3 mm thin.Going back further, the iPhone 3G and 3GS, were 12.3 mm thin. The original iPhone was 11.6 mm thin.A recent survey by Strategy Analytics found that consumers in the U.S. and U.K. consider battery life more important than handset thickness.""When thickness of a device was considered, respondents initially showed overall preference for the thinner prototype (6 mm rather than 8 mm),"" Strategy Analytics analyst Paul Brown said in a statement. ""Yet when told that the thicker device could provide a third more battery life, the majority of respondents instead opted for the thicker prototype. What is clear is that respondents prioritize battery life over a thin design. Crucially however, this does not mean that manufacturers can make very thick devices in order to provide much larger batteries.""The ninth-generation iPhone, unofficially called the iPhone 6S, also is expected to feature an upgraded front-facing camera with a flash and a higher-resolution rear camera.RELATED:Apple iPhone 6S forecast up, Watch outlook weakening.

2208,TAP,"There's nothing like a steady stream of acquisitions to bulk up a company's market position. Add to that ongoing internal expansion, strong demand, and a push into new market segments and regions and you've got the power behind the strong growth at Acadia Healthcare Co. (ACHC)Acadia is a provider of inpatient behavioral health care services. It operates 224 behavioral health care facilities with roughly 9,000 beds in 37 states, the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico. Acadia provides psychiatric and chemical dependency services to its patients in a variety of settings, including inpatient psychiatric hospitals, residential treatment centers, outpatient clinics and therapeutic school-based programs.The company has been on a long-running winning streak, with nine straight quarters of double-digit year-over-year profit growth. In each of the last three quarters, both profit and revenue were up more than 50%.Investors have taken notice. Acadia's stock price has jumped 25% since the start of the year.Becoming A Bigger PlayerAcadia, a major consolidator in its fragmented industry, is primed to keep up the robust growth pace as it benefits from a combination of acquisitions, which expand its reach in new and existing markets. And it continues to grow organically by adding new facilities and upping the bed count in its existing ones.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year 2015 earnings to climb 39% to $2.14 a share. They see a 25% gain in 2016 and a 30% increase in 2017.""Acadia has a very good balance between organic growth and acquisition-driven growth,"" Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut told IBD. ""It has been delivering fairly consistent organic revenue growth of about 10% since 2011.""Acadia's growth strategy, he adds, is to keep growing organically at a 10% ""clip"" from new facility development and bed additions and to ""supplement"" that growth with acquisitions.He estimates that Acadia is on track to reach a revenue run rate (annualized revenue) of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion as it exits 2015.The company's goal, he adds, is to increase the run rate to $4 billion by the end of 2018.Such lofty growth has been a draw for investors, says Tanquilut.""There aren't too many companies that can grow consistently at this healthy pace and at a very sustained level,"" he said. ""By 2018 it's looking at a $4 billion revenue run rate from (almost) nothing in 2011. For growth investors and those looking for consistent, sustainable upside, (this is) a company that has a track record of consistently delivering those two things.""Adds Deutsche Bank analyst Darren Lehrich: ""The company has benefited from two drivers of growth — acquisitions and organic growth — which have come together very nicely the past several years,"" he told IBD. ""They've been able to turn high single-digit to low double-digit same-store growth (in existing facilities) into very strong organic growth. They have a lot of operating leverage as the occupancy rates in the facilities continue to grow. It's a demand driven dynamic.""Lehrich says Acadia has created a ""pretty stable pipeline"" of new facilities and bed expansions. Every quarter, he adds, Acadia adds beds to facilities in existing markets where it sees high occupancy rates and the need for more beds.""When they add those beds they fill them instantly,"" Lehrich said. ""It's a very important tailwind to their growth rate: making decisions to meet market demand where they know they can fill those beds up over time.""Demand for Acadia's services, he adds, is being driven by a few factors, including better benefits for behavioral health care services and more awareness of psychiatric disorders in communities, homes and schools.Founded in 2005, Acadia went through a metamorphosis when a new seasoned management team entered the scene in 2011. The team was led by industry veteran and CEO Joey Jacobs, who came to Acadia from Psychiatric Solutions, which was acquired by Universal Health Services (UHS) in 2010.Evolving AcadiaJacobs and his team put Acadia on the acquisition trail at the start and have been on a buying spree since.Most recently it announced three acquisitions, two in the U.K., closed on June 1, and one in the U.S., which it expects to close on July 1.A key acquisition was the purchase of Partnerships in Care for $661.7 million in July 2014, analysts say. Partnerships in Care is the second largest independent provider of inpatient behavioral health care services in the U.K. It marked Acadia's entry into the U.K. market.""That acquisition diversified them outside the U.S. and opened them up to a new market opportunity,"" said Tanquilut.""The National Health Service in the U.K. is increasingly shifting more psychiatric services to private operators,"" he said. ""That is in the early stages of playing out. (The U.K.) is a new growth path for them. The U.K. has an even better growth profile than the U.S.""Another key purchase, which closed in February 2015, was the $1.3 billion acquisition of CRC Health Group, its biggest deal so far. CRC is a provider of treatment services related to substance abuse and other addiction and behavioral disorders. It's the largest player in the substance abuse space, says Tanquilut.""The substance abuse space is probably one of the fastest growing sub-segments in the health care space,"" he said. ""Acadia is driving even more growth by going beyond their legacy acute behavioral health care business.""In the first quarter, earnings jumped 54% from a year earlier to 43 cents a share. Sales surged 82% to $365.8 million.The strong first quarter growth in revenue and earnings, ""primarily"" reflected the acquisitions of CRC and Partnerships in Care, CEO Jacobs said in a statement.More deals are on tap.""There is acquisition pipelines across all our markets,"" Jacobs said on the conference call. ""We expect to announce additional transactions during the rest of 2015.""Tanquilut says management's experience in behavioral health care and in doing M&A works to the company's advantage.""They have a good reputation among other providers,"" he said. ""When people are looking to sell, they know they are good operators and they will take care of their assets. That's part of the reason why Acadia is a good acquisition growth story. Management has a lot of experience and knows where to go to find deals.""Acadia is part of IBD's Medical-Outpatient/Home Care industry group. It leads the group with a Composite Rating of 98 out of a possible 99, along with AmSurg (AMSG), while larger Mednax (MD) has a still-strong 93.

2256,TAP,"""It's a very high bar and that is exactly why it may not happen,"" he said, ""but I think anything could happen here.""Why might Salesforce.com be sold? Decelerating revenue growth and market saturation, analysts say — and also a belief by some that the cloud software pioneer just might be at its apex.The No. 1 provider of customer relationship management software became the subject of takeover rumors after a Bloomberg report on April 29 said it has hired bankers to field offers, after receiving an unsolicited buyout offer from an unnamed company.Analysts have since namedOracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (SAP), Google (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) as potential buyers.There are few possible suitors because of the size of Salesforce.com (CRM), which has a market cap near $47.5 billion.The company's annual sales have soared from barely $1 billion in fiscal 2009 to $5.4 billion for fiscal 2015 ended Jan. 31.Yet, year-over-year quarterly revenue growth has slipped from the high 30% range to the low 20% range in the past two years, and that lower growth is expected to continue, says Steve Koenig, an analyst for Wedbush Securities. Salesforce is set to release fiscal Q1 earnings after the close Wednesday. The consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters calls for revenue from the April quarter to rise 22% from the year-earlier quarter to $1.5 billion.""I think they are decelerating in terms of new business activities probably faster than people realize,"" Koenig told IBD. ""It's not going to accelerate.""This fiscal year, analysts expect sales growth of 21%, down from 32% in fiscal 2015, 33% in fiscal '14, 35% in fiscal '13 and 37% in fiscal '12.Salesforce.com is sliding out of the high-growth group of tech companies, said a financial analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity.""There is no double that we are past the peak growth, so does (Salesforce.com CEO Marc) Benioff want to tap out at the top?

"
2260,TAP,"Wireless phone companies aim to improve spotty network coverage and add data capacity by turning to ""small cell"" technology — a strategy that may also enable them to tap unlicensed, Wi-Fi-type radio spectrum in the long run.
"
2261,TAP,"Crown Castle (CCI) is the cell tower operator most likely to benefit, as it aims to play a large role in small cell deployment by wireless firms.
"
2262,TAP,"Crown Castle in April made its second major small-cell-related acquisition, buying Sunesys for $1 billion in cash. In 2011, Crown Castle bought NextG for the same price.
"
2263,TAP,"Verizon Communications (VZ), a Crown Castle customer, is leading the charge to small cell technology as data demand surges on its 4G LTE network. Wireless firms generally use large cell towers across the U.S. to whisk calls, video and email to mobile phone users. Wireless firms also use large radio antennas installed on building rooftops, church steeples, billboards, or even farm silos and fake trees.
"
2264,TAP,"But small cell technology is gaining ground in urban areas. The low-power ""base stations"" are located in shopping malls and outdoor public spaces. They're often mounted on lamp posts or utility poles, and are roughly the size of a suitcase.
"
2265,TAP,"There are about 150,000 full-size cell towers, operated by tower companies Crown Castle, American Tower (AMT), SBA Communications (SBAC) and others.
"
2266,TAP,"The number of small cell base stations is potentially much bigger, depending on whether AT&T (T), Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) follow Verizon's lead. Sprint, amid a network upgrade, is expected to deploy small cell technology in 2016.
"
2267,TAP,"""We think there's an opportunity for small cells in most urban environments,"" Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's CEO, told IBD. ""It's a vast geography.
"
2268,TAP,"""When we look at maps that we're working on and the locations we're building out today, you can come to the conclusion that this is going to go in virtually every major suburban and urban area. We're talking about building out block by block.""
"
2269,TAP,"The rub for Crown Castle and its rivals is that rising use of small cells might mean wireless firms will need fewer big towers, which analysts say are highly profitable to operate.
"
2270,TAP,"Moreland, whose company operates 40,000 towers, disagrees.
"
2271,TAP,"""We can find no evidence, nor a carrier customer who is suggesting it's an either/or proposition,"" he said. ""It's complementary and additive.""
"
2272,TAP,"Cell towers aren't going away, but small cell technology is coming on strong, says Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics.
"
2273,TAP,"""Carriers are going with small cells because they need to upgrade capacity in a particular spot, like an office building,"" Entner said. ""So instead of building a larger, more expensive tower site, they prefer to do a more topical solution.""
"
2274,TAP,"For smartphone users, small cell deployments should mean fewer dropped calls and faster video downloads. Mobile phone users share radio signals and spectrum capacity, with service degraded as more devices are connected.
"
2275,TAP,"Small cell technology also could help wireless firms tap a new source of airwaves, unlicensed spectrum.
"
2276,TAP,"As for licenses airwaves, AT&T spent $18.2 billion in the recent AWS-3 spectrum auction, the most of any company. Verizon spent $10.4 billion.
"
2277,TAP,"Those additional airwaves, however, won't be enough to meet long-term demand. Verizon is interested in augmenting its licensed spectrum with new airwaves that federal regulators plan to set aside for Wi-Fi-type networks.
"
2278,TAP,"The Federal Communications Commission in April voted to make 150 MHz of spectrum in the 3.5 GHz frequency band available for mobile broadband and other commercial uses. The FCC also is studying whether to open up nearly 200 MHz of spectrum in the 5 GHz band.
"
2279,TAP,"Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable (TWC) are among the cable TV firms interested in using 5 GHz airwaves to expand public Wi-Fi services, analysts say.
"
2280,TAP,"Meanwhile, Verizon is keen on using unlicensed spectrum, and it's been testing a 400-node small cell system in Boston.
"
2281,TAP,"Amir Rozwadowski, a Barclays analyst, says Verizon has focused on its small cell initiative for about 18 months. He says Verizon's interest in small cell systems goes beyond near-term data capacity needs and is related to the ""multiyear evolution of its network.""
"
2282,TAP,"Rozwadowski added in a research report that Verizon is already putting in the foundation for a shift to next-generation 5G mobile networks. Wireless firms globally are expected to deploy 5G networks after 2020.
"
2283,TAP,"To get small cell systems in place in urban areas, Verizon has been working with building owners and local regulators.
"
2284,TAP,"Verizon also has been in talks with suppliers of fiber-optic wiring that connects small cell systems to the Internet and long-distance phone networks, or the so-called backhaul system. The fiber hook-ups speed up mobile data performance.
"
2285,TAP,"Zayo Group Holdings (ZAYO), which leases fiber connections to cell tower operators, has told analysts it's interested in the burgeoning small cell market.
"
2286,TAP,"As for Crown Castle, its April 30 acquisition of Sunesys, a unit of Quanta Services, boosted the wireless tower company's ability to provide fiber-optic hook-ups for small cell backhaul services.
"
2287,TAP,"Analysts say Crown Castle made the move in part to meet Verizon's needs. Sunesys owns or has rights to nearly 10,000 miles of fiber in major metro markets. So, Crown Castle now can provide fiber services similar to the likes of Zayo. That's a new business for Crown Castle, notes Rozwadowski.
"
2288,TAP,"Kevin Smithen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital, likes Crown Castle's investments in small cell technology and its Sunesys acquisition.
"
2289,TAP,"""Small cells will be a central pillar of (4G) network architecture for Verizon and Sprint in the second half of 2015 and especially 2016 and for T-Mobile and AT&T moving forward,"" said Smithen, in a report. ""Sunesys allows Crown Castle to jump-start its business plan by several years by shrinking build-out time and spending for metro fiber networks.""
"
2290,TAP,"In 2014, small cell contracts accounted for 7% of Crown Castle's overall revenue, more than at American Tower and SBA Communications. As in the case of cell towers, Crown Castle expects small cell installations to be share-able among multiple wireless carriers, boosting profits.

2313,TAP,"Media Bias: George Stephanopoulos' $75,000 gift to the Clinton Foundation says a lot about the major media. Not only are they dominated by the left, but their stars have often worked for the very people they're supposed to cover.Political operatives become journalists, and journalists become political operatives. It happens all the time.But Stephanopoulos didn't just take a job as a talking head or pundit. He was elevated to a high-profile news position. He poses as an objective journalist when, in fact, his entire background has been political.It's a long resume, including stints as an aide to Democratic Rep. Edward Feighan of Ohio in the 1980s, deputy communications director of the Dukakis-Bentsen presidential campaign in 1988 and floor manager for House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt from 1989-91.But he really made his reputation in Bill Clinton's 1991 campaign. In ""The War Room,"" a 1993 documentary of that race, Stephanopoulos comes across as politically ruthless. At one point, he menacingly tells someone on the phone: ""I guarantee if you do this, you'll never work in Democratic politics again."" He was 30 years old.Once in the White House, Stephanopoulos became a spinmeister par excellence, dealing with Clinton's so-called ""bimbo eruptions"" and the many other scandals that surfaced — Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate, Nannygate, coptergate, and so on — too many to number.When former FBI agent Gary Aldrich wrote ""Unlimited Access,"" an unflattering expose of the Clinton White House, Stephanopoulos attacked. He called Aldrich a ""pathological liar"" and, with others, pressured ABC's ""Nightline,"" CNN's ""Larry King Live"" and ""Dateline NBC"" to cancel Aldrich appearances.Even liberal journalists came to distrust Stephanopoulos. As we noted in 1996, Clinton's first press spokesman in 1992 was moved to another job within just months ""because everyone in the White House press corps quickly learned not to believe a word he said.""So how did Stephanopoulos the fact-challenged operative become Stephanopoulos the objective journalist?A little tap dancing is all it took. After losing a bruising battle to become Clinton's chief of staff, Stephanopoulos quit in 1996. The highly partisan aide ""portrayed himself as nonpartisan after leaving the White House and was hired by ABC News in 1997 as a news analyst,"" wrote Shirley Anne Warshaw in ""The Clinton Years.""In 1999, he completed his self-rehabilitation with a political confessional titled, ""All Too Human: A Political Education."" In it, he offered mild criticisms of the Clintons, and bemoaned his own lost political innocence.That did the trick. In 2002, he became anchor of ABC's Sunday news program, ""This Week.""Fact is, George Stephanopoulos' donation to the Clinton Foundation underlines that he is no objective journalist, but rather an emblem of Washington's revolving-door journalism and pervasive left-wing bias.The Media Research Center last year estimated that 30 Obama administration members either had gone into journalism or from journalism into the White House. Remember that as you read or watch the news.We continue to ask: Is it any wonder the public no longer trusts the media to tell the truth?

These events affect businesses and keep CEOs on edge.""It's something that's talked about more than before,"" said Steve Jones, CEO of Universal Services of America, a security firm. To deal with such scenarios, ""the industry continues to evolve. The security programs are getting more comprehensive."" Stay alert. An early warning boosts the ability to respond. Hints of a coming protest or worse can help businesses head off trouble.""We spend a lot of time monitoring social media sites to keep our customers abreast of what's going on,"" Jones told IBD. Mix old, new school. More firms tap uniformed guards and tools like surveillance cameras.The ideal mix? ""(Electronic) eyes all over the facility,"" Jones said. ""Plus people who are able to respond. The two work together."" Stay current. Cost once kept some companies from adopting video surveillance tools.""It used to be very expensive. You had to have a big company for that,"" said Lee Odess, vice president with Brivo Systems.The security firm specializes in video surveillance and cloud-based access control systems. Tech advances have driven costs down while reducing infrastructure needs. ""The footprint of our product is very small,"" Odess said. ""As technology continues to evolve, the price continues to come down."" Streamline it. Building access control has grown up from metal keys to plastic cards to cloud-based mobile apps. Executives now use smartphones to manage the physical security of multiple facilities, set schedules for access by person, time and location, receive notifications via email and text, and monitor live video streams.""I can manage my business even when I'm not there,"" Odess said. Master tools. The proliferation of smartphone apps helped clients accept a mobile approach to managing security. ""Our adoption rate just skyrocketed. People were just comfortable with it,"" Odess said. Expand functionality.  Security tools are being adapted for other purposes.Customers paying with their smartphones at coffee shops could also use their phones to be granted bathroom access rather than having to ask for a key.Scanning a suite holder's ticket at a football stadium could signal to staff that the suite needs service. ""The second you walk in, it can notify food and beverage,"" Odess said. ""Security can be convenient. There is value to what we do beyond security."" Combine them. Tired of using a key for the door and multiple passwords for the company computer system?Some organizations combine physical access control and IT identity information on a single card or smartphone app.""This streamlined approach provides the end user an easier, more seamless experience, whether accessing a physical location such as their office or digital information such as financial records,"" said Kevin Prewett, vendor management director with electronics distributor Ingram Micro (IM). Think future. If scanning a hand or eyeball to verify identity seems the stuff of science fiction, think again.""Biometric access control has been around for decades, but only now is it becoming a possibility for many end users,"" said Prewett. ""Today, fingerprint, hand, facial and iris recognition technology is much more accessible to smaller customers.""

2323,TAP,"Oil prices are nearing a magic number that could spur shale producers — who have become more efficient — to pump more, but Saudi Arabia will likely keep prices from rising much higher so it can defend its market share.
"
2324,TAP,"The world's top oil exporter has shown no signs of easing up on its strategy of keeping prices low to drive out higher-cost producers like U.S. shale firms. Saudi crude production hit a fresh record high last month: 10.3 million barrels a day.Saudi Arabia could put another million barrels a day or more on the market, said James Williams, an analyst at WTRG Economics. It would come in addition to the 2 million barrels a day in surplus output already coming from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.That means that the oil prices preferred by U.S. shale firms, which have become the swing producers that rebalance world oil markets, will be more pivotal.""OPEC's role shifted to allow U.S. shale producers to determine the maximum price for oil,"" Williams told IBD.Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm has said that a U.S. crude price of $70 per barrel would spark more production growth. Whiting Petroleum (WLL) recently said that it would add drilling rigs if crude prices hit $70.Hitting A Ceiling?Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) plans to add rigs in July if prices continue to stay around the low 60s or higher, and EOG Resources (EOG) said that it would boost production if prices stay around $65 per barrel.Markets have taken notice. Doubts are growing about whether oil's strong rally since April can be sustained. On Friday, U.S. crude futures dipped 0.3% to $59.69 a barrel, adding to a retreat from more than $61 a barrel, reached days earlier.Meanwhile, the collapse in U.S. oil rigs is starting to bottom out. Baker Hughes (BHI) said that the rig count dropped by eight in the last week, the smallest decline since December. And Energy Department data show that U.S. oil output has already peaked and is now tilting lower.WTRG's Williams said that there isn't a single magic number that would work across all shale companies, because production costs vary by play and within zones in each play. But he said that a U.S. price of about $75 per barrel would be enough to start increasing production.Any ramp-up in U.S. output could happen quickly. Even as prices plunged last fall and winter, shale companies continued drilling wells but held off on completing them. As a result, they can keep the oil in the ground in order to store it until prices rise enough for them to extract it profitably.Sitting On A 'Fracklog'A recent analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence puts this so-called ""fracklog,"" or backlog of wells, at 4,731, with 322,000 barrels a day underground.With this looming fracklog, and with oil prices nearing a green-light threshold for U.S. producers, OPEC members will likely maintain production levels at their next meeting June 5.In addition to forcing U.S. firms to cut production, the cartel's other goal is to stimulate the world economy with lower oil prices, according to Williams. Customers in key markets like Asia would then boost demand, helping OPEC and Saudi Arabia grow their market share.But as fracking becomes more efficient, the breakeven price for shale could get much lower, potentially pushing the Saudis to take the long-term threat of U.S. producers more seriously.U.S. firms have narrowed their focus to the most productive areas of a shale play, a practice called high grading. Oilfield-services companies have had to lower prices. Technology and techniques are still improving. For example, drillers have been ""zipper fracking"" — to tap multiple wells from a single drilling pad — to keep costs down.""There has been a lot of skepticism on (the Saudis') part regarding the long-term viability of U.S. shale,"" said Tamar Essner, energy analyst at Nasdaq Advisory Services. ""It just seems that they don't really believe in it as a long-term thing.""But she added that Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members are waiting to see what shale producers will do next as they become more efficient.

Ray Warner, a professor of law at St. John's University in New York. The court's ruling said that a ""straightforward"" reading of the Bankruptcy Code doesn't support Dewsnup v. Timm, the 1992 Supreme Court decision that set the precedent for protecting second mortgages. This week the court pointed out in its seven-page decision that it had not been asked to overrule Dewsnup.

2382,TAP,"Alisha Slaughter goes onto Pinterest at least once a week in order to organize different pieces of her life. She ""pins"" Web images with information on gardening, interior design ideas, holiday crafts, recipes, patterns for her family's clothes, and search engine optimization strategies to help with her marketing business.
"
2383,TAP,"""It's kind of like what you would do with magazines in the olden days,"" said Slaughter, an Aptos, Calif., resident who has been using Pinterest for four years. ""You'd see an article or ad and say, 'Oh, I want to remember this,' and you'd rip it out.""
"
2384,TAP,"Pinterest, a privately held, San Francisco-based social media company, was launched in March of 2010 by co-founders Ben Silbermann, Evan Sharp and Paul Sciarra. The site helps people collect and organize images and other visual material they find on the Web.
"
2385,TAP,"And lots of people want to do this. The site has 70 million users, based on statistics from Paris-based research firm Semiocast. According to the GlobalWebIndex market research study, Pinterest was the fastest-growing social network in 2014, with its number of active users nearly doubling.
"
2386,TAP,"Cashing In On Pins
"
2387,TAP,"The question is: Can Pinterest translate that active and growing user base into dollars? Investors say yes. Pinterest recently raised an additional $367 million in venture funding, pushing it past the $1 billion mark overall and giving the company a valuation near $11 billion. While the company is mum, it's widely considered a candidate for the next big tech IPO.
"
2388,TAP,"Investors include big Silicon Valley VC firms Andreessen Horowitz and Bessemer Venture Partners. According to Pinterest spokeswoman Jamie Favazza, the company might raise as much as $211 million more . The company, though, declined more comment.
"
2389,TAP,"Most Pinterest users, or ""pinners"" like Slaughter, are women. A recent Pew Research study found that 42% of women who regularly go online use Pinterest, compared with 13% of men. But Favazza said Pinterest ""doubled our male user base in the U.S. this year. Last year our male user base in the U.S. grew 73% year over year, and has been picking up in the past six months (54%) vs. the prior six months (40%), which is outpacing overall Pinterest growth.""
"
2390,TAP,"But Anna Bennett, a Pinterest consultant at whiteglovesocialmedia.com, says the predominance of women on the site is one reason businesses should take notice of Pinterest's potential.
"
2391,TAP,"""The bottom line is that women dominate household purchases. We make more of the decisions,"" Bennett said.
"
2392,TAP,"""Also, people on Pinterest have a buying mindset. They embrace brands,"" said Bennett, who advises businesses on how to use Pinterest to meet their goals.
"
2393,TAP,"""More and more people are actually sharing content from businesses,"" she said. ""So it's just a natural platform for businesses to be in, whether they are trying to sell something or just drive traffic back to their sites.""
"
2394,TAP,"The Pew Research report found that 17% of Pinterest users access the site daily, and 29% weekly. Last year, the number of site users rose from 21% of Internet users to 28%, said Pew. That puts it on par with LinkedIn (LNKD) and above Twitter (TWTR) as well as Facebook 's (FB) Instagram.
"
2395,TAP,"Pinterest started targeting businesses in 2012, gradually rolling out features to help businesses understand and better target potential customers. For example, Rich Pins, introduced in 2013, are pins with information that accompanies an image in a pin. A Rich Pin from a retailer might have a picture of a garment, along with pricing, product availability and where to purchase the item. Through Rich Pins, businesses can get information about their audiences and what they might buy.
"
2396,TAP,"Last year, Pinterest rolled out its first paid ads, called Promoted Pins, with a select number of businesses. With the program, advertisers can pay to have their pins placed in front of a bigger audience than the organic audience they have cultivated through just their presence on Pinterest. In January, Pinterest opened the program to all businesses.
"
2397,TAP,"In an interview at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit last October, co-founder Silbermann talked of the natural alignment between Pinterest users and businesses wanting to advertise to them.
"
2398,TAP,"Subtle Advertising
"
2399,TAP,"""The nice thing about Pinterest is that people are there to discover things, and many of the things they're discovering anyway are things made by companies, like products, services, and media. There's a really tight alignment between why people are there in the first place, and objectives of advertisers,"" he said.
"
2400,TAP,"The Promoted Pins are subtle, blending in with the other ""organic"" pins on a site. The only indication that they're ads is the small gray ""Promoted Pin"" text and icon at the bottom of the pin. You need to roll over the ad to see who the advertiser is.
"
2401,TAP,"The ads are so subtle, some Pinterest users don't know they're there.
"
2402,TAP,"""Ads? I haven't even noticed them,"" Slaughter said.
"
2403,TAP,"Joanne Bradford, head of partnerships at Pinterest, says the ads are working.
"
2404,TAP,"""The Promoted Pins perform just as well, and sometimes even better, than the organic pins. Moreover, advertisers achieved about a 30% bump in earned media (also known as free media, or publicity) from their campaigns,"" stated Bradford in a blog post.
"
2405,TAP,"But in his recent report titled ""Pinterest Is Not Ready for Prime Time,"" Forrester Research analyst Nate Elliott says the company must make some changes to truly serve as an effective marketing venue for businesses.
"
2406,TAP,"""Marketers struggle to find value from branded Pinterest boards, collecting few followers and even fewer likes and re-pins. Likewise, Pinterest's ad platform offers only limited targeting options. To generate greater marketer value, Pinterest must tap into the rich data that people contribute to the site,"" he writes.
"
2407,TAP,"Bradford's blog post, though, says Pinterest is upgrading Promoted Pins for better ad targeting. Also, to help companies more effectively use the site, she says the company is launching a ""Pinstitute,"" where businesses can learn to connect with pinners and see better results.
"
2408,TAP,"Bennett says Pinterest has been delivering substantial benefits to the businesses she works with, both from traffic to their sites and from data collected.
"
2409,TAP,"""Businesses that know how to use Pinterest have already seen increased traffic to their websites, and definitely improved ranking in Google search results,"" she said.

2413,TAP,"Rumors of a big-screen iPad perked up this week with a report that Apple (AAPL) hopes to use a new type of touch panel for the jumbo-size tablet.Citing unnamed sources in the supply chain, Korea IT News reported Monday that Apple has requested silver nanowire display samples from LG Display (LPL), Samsung Display and others for the so-called iPad Pro tablet, AppleInsider reported Monday.The silver nanowire touch display would be more flexible than current displays and could enable the deployment of Force Touch technology. Apple uses Force Touch in the Apple Watch to distinguish between different touches like a tap and a press. Apple is rumored to be looking to add Force Touch to its next smartphone, the iPhone 6S, this fall.The iPad Pro would have a 12.9-inch display, vs. the 9.7-inch display of the current iPad. It might even use a stylus for applications that involve writing, drawing or annotating.That development would put the iPad Pro in direct competition with Microsoft's (MSFT) Surface Pro 3, a 12-inch tablet that converts to a notebook when connected to a thin and lightweight keyboard accessory. Microsoft is expected to announce a follow-on product, the Surface Pro 4, this summer, timed with the release of Windows 10.The iPad Pro might not be released until 2016, AppleInsider said.Apple is looking for ways to lift its sagging iPad sales. The company has teamed with IBM (IBM) to develop enterprise applications for the tablet.RELATED:Apple iPad, Tablets' Best Growth Years Are History.

2414,TAP,"Apple's (AAPL) next iPhone will add a ""rose gold"" color option and use a stronger case that is less susceptible to bending, a problem that plagued some iPhone 6 handsets, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a research report Tuesday.
"
2415,TAP,"The iPhone 6S is due out this fall. With the new color option, the top-of-the-line iPhone family presumably will come in four designs: silver, space gray, yellow gold and rose gold, AppleInsider reported .
"
2416,TAP,"Kuo described the rose gold edition of the iPhone 6S as a luxury model, but did not say how much it would cost. He also didn't specify whether the rose gold model would be made of actual gold like the recently released high-end Apple Watch Edition, which starts at $10,000. Current iPhones are just gold colored.
"
2417,TAP,"The ninth-generation iPhone also will incorporate the Force Touch input technology used in the Apple Watch. Kuo says this will be the biggest selling point of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus.

2423,TAP,"Californians who once built water projects to rival the Panama Canal, but who now have resorted to drinking their own sewage, gazed longingly at the recent floods in Texas and saw hope for their desiccated state. Will hope turn into reality? Come on, this is California.
"
2424,TAP,"The deadly deluges in Texas and Oklahoma have been blamed on El Nino, the weather condition that produces significantly wetter conditions in the Southwest and elsewhere. The silver lining in Texas' dark clouds is that El Nino is headed west and threatens — or, in this case, promises — to drop enough rain to end the three-year drought in the Golden State just like in the parched Lone Star.
"
2425,TAP,"To be sure, El Ninos are unpredictable. But weather scientists are betting this one is powerful enough to last through California's rainy season, which typically begins in October and ends in April.
"
2426,TAP,"""Can one big year ease the drought conditions? Yes, it can,"" Michael Anderson, climatologist with the California Department of Water Resources, told the Los Angeles Times. ""It can definitely replenish the surface storage and can have some benefit to starting to replenish some of the groundwater.""
"
2427,TAP,"This will come as relief in more ways than one for squeamish Californians who've been slow to warm up to the latest environmental scheme offered as a ""solution"" to the water shortage — wastewater reclamation.
"
2428,TAP,"""Toilet to tap"" is what they call it, and consumers are being assured it can be made as clean to drink as what they buy in a store. Besides, it's cheaper than desalination (heaven forfend that Californians should tap into the ocean right outside their windows); people in Namibia and Toowoomba, Australia, say it tastes just fine; and, heck, astronauts drink urine aboard the Space Shuttle.
"
2429,TAP,"How far they've come (down) out West. A hundred and two years ago, Los Angeles' chief engineer opened the Owens River Aqueduct after just five years of construction. By pipeline and ditch, water was brought by gravity 234 miles across mountains, canyons and deserts — an engineering feat second only to the Panama Canal. And now, toilet water.
"
2430,TAP,"You'd think they'd do something to capture all the water these El Ninos would dump. But this is environmentally correct California, which would rather let rivers flow to the sea than dam them up and thereby endanger tiny fish.
"
2431,TAP,"On these pages last month, scholar Victor Davis Hanson estimated California could have built 40 to 50 subsidiary reservoirs for the $68 billion that's now projected for an L.A. to San Francisco bullet train.
"

2433,TAP,"Given the recent history, we bet all you'll hear if and when El Nino arrives is hand-wringing about mudslides threatening stars' homes in Malibu.Californians who once built water projects to rival the Panama Canal, but who now have resorted to drinking their own sewage, gazed longingly at the recent floods in Texas and saw hope for their desiccated state. Will hope turn into reality? Come on, this is California.The deadly deluges in Texas and Oklahoma have been blamed on El Nino, the weather condition that produces significantly wetter conditions in the Southwest and elsewhere. The silver lining in Texas' dark clouds is that El Nino is headed west and threatens — or, in this case, promises — to drop enough rain to end the three-year drought in the Golden State just like in the parched Lone Star.To be sure, El Ninos are unpredictable. But weather scientists are betting this one is powerful enough to last through California's rainy season, which typically begins in October and ends in April.""Can one big year ease the drought conditions? Yes, it can,"" Michael Anderson, climatologist with the California Department of Water Resources, told the Los Angeles Times. ""It can definitely replenish the surface storage and can have some benefit to starting to replenish some of the groundwater.""This will come as relief in more ways than one for squeamish Californians who've been slow to warm up to the latest environmental scheme offered as a ""solution"" to the water shortage — wastewater reclamation.""Toilet to tap"" is what they call it, and consumers are being assured it can be made as clean to drink as what they buy in a store. Besides, it's cheaper than desalination (heaven forfend that Californians should tap into the ocean right outside their windows); people in Namibia and Toowoomba, Australia, say it tastes just fine; and, heck, astronauts drink urine aboard the Space Shuttle.How far they've come (down) out West. A hundred and two years ago, Los Angeles' chief engineer opened the Owens River Aqueduct after just five years of construction. By pipeline and ditch, water was brought by gravity 234 miles across mountains, canyons and deserts — an engineering feat second only to the Panama Canal. And now, toilet water.You'd think they'd do something to capture all the water these El Ninos would dump. But this is environmentally correct California, which would rather let rivers flow to the sea than dam them up and thereby endanger tiny fish.On these pages last month, scholar Victor Davis Hanson estimated California could have built 40 to 50 subsidiary reservoirs for the $68 billion that's now projected for an L.A. to San Francisco bullet train.But the train is Gov. Jerry Brown's baby, not that of his father, Gov. Pat Brown, who along with other ambitious projects, such as a first-class university system, built a State Water Project to get water from north to south, where half the people lived.Given the recent history, we bet all you'll hear if and when El Nino arrives is hand-wringing about mudslides threatening stars' homes in Malibu.

2450,TAP,"China Web portal and video game firm NetEase offers some of the most popular online games in China, including U.S.-based Activision Blizzard's titles ""World of Warcraft"" and ""StarCraft II.""NetEase (NTES) recently made the switch to developing mobile games, as revenue from video games played on mobile devices is expected to rise to $45 billion in 2018, from $29 billion this year, according to a May report from mobile-Internet advisor Digi-Capital.Looking to bring its most popular titles to more English speakers, NetEase opened its first U.S. office, in Redwood Shores, Calif., in February. That 26-employee unit expects later this year to release its first mobile game designed specifically for a Western audience, and to expand to 60 workers by year's end.With games companies having to boost ad spending in an increasingly crowded space, it's much more expensive for newcomers in any market to get noticed, Tim Merel, managing director of Digi-Capital, told IBD via email.""NetEase is a great company in China,"" Merel said, ""but breaking through against established incumbents in the U.S. is challenging for any market entrant.""Chinese games companies set up shop in the U.S. ""to either establish international management teams as a step toward true globalization, or as a source of great games that can be brought back into the Chinese domestic market,"" Merel said.Other Chinese games companies have established offices in the U.S. over the past decade and have been among the top acquirers and investors in U.S.-based games companies during the last few years, Merel said. China Internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), which already owns or has big stakes in Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Riot Games, is adding Kim Kardashian to the mix. Tencent announced in April that it will invest $126 million in Glu Mobile (GLUU) to tap the U.S. company's success in producing smartphone games featuring Kim Kardashian and Katy Perry.In addition, last month Tencent reportedly invested $60 million for a 20% stake in San Francisco-based mobile-games startup Pocket Gems.NetEase says its strategy for its U.S. office is to take blockbuster hits from China and retool them to appeal to gamers in the U.S. and elsewhere in the West.Video game industry veteran David Ting, who came to NetEase from Blizzard Entertainment, is leading NetEase's new U.S. office. IBD recently spoke with Ting about that effort.IBD: Besides translating the language, what else goes into transforming games developed in China into ones likely to catch on here?Ting: The Chinese user interface tends to be complex; you have all of these functions exposed as buttons. It's very, very busy. There's very complex evolution and there's a lot of math involved in making choices within the game. So, if you're playing, say, a role-playing game or an MMO (a multiplayer video game capable of supporting large numbers of players simultaneously), there's a ton of options and a ton of choices. Chinese players love that, they feel that's part of the challenge.One of the things that we do here is try to simplify and also try to make it so that it's economically sensible for the (U.S.) players to ... enjoy the game. So we adapt the economy. For example, a mechanism in Chinese games is that some of the elite weapons for characters in our upcoming game, ""Speedy Ninja,"" may cost thousands of dollars, if you compute out the probability table of the weapon drops. We try to adapt it so it's acceptable and fair for the Western audience.IBD: Is that thousands of actual U.S. dollars, or some sort of in-game pretend currency?Ting: Real dollars. For example, if you want to max out the best ninja inside the Speedy Ninja game that we are publishing in China, literally it's close to $7,000 to do that.One of the things in China is that there's the phenomenon of the ""whale."" When they decide to play a game, the ""whales"" are always trying to be the best.It's not rare that these ""whales"" ... will spend tens of thousands of dollars to basically charge up their account with premium currency so they can max out their characters. So they get this advantage as they play through the game. That's one of the typical mechanics in these free-to-play games.IBD: What have you found to be an acceptable dollar amount in the U.S.?Ting: We're experimenting with a beta user group. We know we want to dramatically drop the price so it's more affordable and so that people can enjoy the game on a more ... level playing ground.IBD: Does your team have non-game initiatives?Ting: Our focus is games first, but that does not bar us from doing other things in the future. We also serve as a U.S. conduit. (With) other NetEase divisions, we actually help and assist with some of their deals. We also have (business) relationships, so we open doors for them so that (they) don't cold-call people. We deal with them on a friendly ground. One of the advantages of having a U.S.-based office (is) having expertise in the market. (It) is extremely important and it really helps us to make people feel like we are a U.S.-based entity vs. a China-based entity.IBD: In December, NetEase teamed up with U.S. video game company SGN to bring SGN's hit mobile matching-puzzle game ""Cookie Jam"" to China. How do your partnerships work in the U.S.?Ting: We want to be proactively helping this ecosystem so that mobile gaming will be a bigger phenomenon in the U.S. It's a saturated market (here). One of the feelings I have is that maybe it's a lack of innovation or maybe the product quality is not at par. So we're going to proactively be speaking and sharing our experience as we hopefully get some demonstrated success with the rest of the ecosystem. That's a phenomenon in the West that's a bit rare in the East.Also from a partnership perspective, we believe there are opportunities where there are mutually beneficial situations for us to work with other companies. We currently don't need another U.S. company to launch our games. In the future, in the event that we scale to a certain capacity and size, (the door may be opened) for us to have those discussions, but not at this moment. Right now, we are really heads-down on our product.IBD: How many games will your office have released in the U.S. by year's end?Ting: We have a number in our pipeline. When (they hit) the right (metrics), we'll release them. We'll have at least one release this year, which is ""Speedy Ninja.""We have a few more in incubation (that) will go through that same cycle that I described, which is the closed-beta soft launch. If the metrics look good, then we'll release a few more. As we learn in the market, we are taking the findings back to China, so when we start on fresh new projects, all the findings are factored in. It's a constantly evolving process.

2476,TAP,"Breakthrough ideas are exciting, requiring a multibrain approach. How entrepreneurs tap fresh thinkers: Run with it.  After getting a taste of satellite technology in college, Kay Koplovitz launched the all-sports cable station Madison Square Garden Sports in 1977.She didn't know it all, but she did it anyway. ""I am an example of a person with no technical background who used satellite technology to build a business,"" she told IBD. ""I knew it would be a different business model.""The channel, now known as USA Network, ranked No. 1 among cable networks in primetime viewership for 13 straight years. Bring them together. When she was building USA Network, and while she was launching the Syfy channel, Koplovitz created task forces to advance efforts. She believes in pooling people from various departments and levels. ""Good ideas could come from anywhere and anyone in the company,"" she said. Find the risers. The approach helped Koplovitz determine who had insights and confidence to lead. ""It wasn't always the most senior person in the room who came forward,"" she said. Reach out. In ""Been There, Run That,"" the book that Koplovitz edited, she compiled wisdom from leading female entrepreneurs. Net proceeds from the book will go to Springboard Enterprises, a national network she launched in 2000 to help up-and-coming businesswomen build and fund their startups.Every entrepreneur should tap into a human capital network. ""It is extremely vital in propelling you toward success,"" she said. Designate ears. ""Get some idea scouts,"" Michal Tsur and Leah Belsky advise in their ""Been There, Run That"" chapter on innovation.Tsur has been called the Iron Lady of Israeli startups and is president of open source online video platform Kaltura. Belsky is an Internet strategist and senior vice president with Kaltura.Their in-the-know habit: Find employees who are close to customers and listen to them. Contemplate. Ever talk with people while commuting to work? A spark of insight at mundane moments is what Belsky and Tsur dubbed ""the miracle of the train."" Bring in users. When you're at the prototype stage, put a target customer on your team. That ""Been There, Run That"" tip comes from Diana Zuckerman, a founder of several health care companies.Zuckerman argues that customers no longer simply consume.""They want to contribute and create,"" she said. ""Involving them at the earliest stages not only helps ensure you've got a product people actually want, but it will prove to be effective marketing as well."" Aim for variety. Look for a balance of character strengths when you're assembling a startup team.""You need individuals with street smarts, wicked creativity, honesty and unwavering tenacity,"" Zuckerman said. A sense of humor and thrifty outlook also help. Go old school. Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists hunting for ideas regularly look to research labs at leading colleges.Julie Goonewardene, University of Texas associate vice chancellor for innovation and strategic investment, offers this advice to breakthrough seekers: Zero in on an industry or area of expertise and read journals on that topic. Research the researchers. Many have extensive websites that chronicle what they're working on. Reach out. ""You could start with the university tech transfer office,"" said Goonewardene. ""These folks are paid to know what's going on in their institutions and, more specifically, in the university's research labs.""

2478,TAP,"In recent months, several media reports have warned of an impending implosion in emerging market (EM) finance. In many of these reports, journalists have warned that after years of easy money from the Federal Reserve (Fed), emerging market fixed income would soon come under considerable pressure. In response to these reports, we seek to highlight the three most common myths surrounding emerging market corporate credit. Below, we restate their claims and refute their conclusions about emerging market fixed income. In our view, valuations in emerging market corporate debt could represent an attractive entry point for patient investors who are focused on total returns. Myth #1: Rapid Growth in EM Corporate Issuance Implies Higher Default Risk A similar concern surrounds not only the serviceability of the debt, but also the massive increase in the EM corporate bond market over the past eight years. In fact, the amount of debt outstanding has increased tenfold over this period!1 For some journalists, this increase points to an increased likelihood of default. However, what many fail to realize can be distilled into a few key points: 1. Composition of emerging market financing has evolved a. Historically, emerging market corporations have borrowed money from European banks in the form of loans. 
"
2479,TAP,"i. As European banks have sought to reduce risk and de-lever, they have retreated from new loan issuance to EM corporations.2 
"
2480,TAP,"ii. As more EM corporations developed a longer credit history, they sought to extend the maturity profile of their borrowing by issuing more bonds. 
"
2481,TAP,"iii. While net leverage levels have increased for some issuers, most emerging market corporations remain much less leveraged across the ratings spectrum than their competitors in developed markets.3 
"
2482,TAP,"b. Access to global credit markets is a testament to the development of EM economies and the emergence of many EM corporations as global industry leaders. 2. Leverage in emerging markets was, and still is, considerably lower than in developed markets. 
"
2483,TAP,"a. Emerging markets currently account for over 40% of global economic output4 but only 12% of the bond market5. 
"
2484,TAP,"b. Therefore, even though the market has increased by a significant multiple, it has been increasing from an extremely low base. 
"
2485,TAP,"c. EM corporate debt has grown at about the same pace as the European high yield market over this period. However, EM corporate issuance has been dominated by investment-grade borrowers.6 
"
2486,TAP,"d. By gaining access to longer and more diverse sources of capital through the global fixed income markets, EM corporates may now actually pose less risk to investors, given that they do not need to constantly tap or roll over credit lines to continue to grow their businesses. 
"
2487,TAP,"Myth #2: EM Corporations Are in Trouble Due to U.S. Dollar Strength

2488,TAP,"Currency investing is hot right now. The premise for concern about ""King Dollar"" isn't wrong, but its focus may be misplaced. Critics believe that since EM corporations have borrowed in U.S. dollars, they have an asset-liability mismatch. Since the U.S. dollar is stronger than most emerging market currencies, the cost of EM corporations' debt in local currency terms prompts concern about their ability to repay. While a mismatch might exist for some domestically focused operated companies, the investable universe of emerging market corporate debt is quite broad, and it includes many industries that generate hard currency revenues.7 
"
2489,TAP,"In our view, dollar strength is less of a concern because a majority of these large, EM issuers, such as commodity producers, have dollar-denominated revenues that will be used to service their debt. While these businesses inevitably sell a portion of their oil, copper, steel, or gold domestically, they are actually producing these goods for sale on the global markets. Today, most international commodity markets use the U.S. dollar as their principal settlement currency. As long as these companies can generate revenues in excess of their costs, they should be able to continue to service their U.S.-dollar-denominated debt. In fact, for companies with considerable local-currency costs and dollar-based revenues, margins could actually increase, since dollar revenues rise relative to local costs, which decline along with the local currency. For example, JB Y Compania, S.A. de C.V., the owner of Jose Cuervo Tequila, derives over 60% of its revenue from exports to developed markets outside of its operations in Mexico.8 
"
2490,TAP,"Additionally, the maturity profile of the debt is what really matters. Issuers that have debt maturing in the next year have essentially two options: roll over the debt with a new issuance or set aside cash to pay off bond-holders. If a management team is going to require a large pool of dollars, the company will often seek to currency-match the assets and liabilities on its balance sheet in order to avoid fluctuations that could result from changes in currency rates near maturity. Also, after the last several years of low global interest rates, many companies have fully extended the maturity profiles of their debt, further reducing roll-over risk. Myth #3: Investors Aren't Committed to EM Corporate Credit 
"
2491,TAP,"Among the major concerns, we find this one the least compelling, in light of reported under-weight exposure to emerging markets via the latest investor surveys.9 The argument goes that in searching for income around the world, U.S. and European investors have recklessly invested in anything with higher yields. As a result, risky borrowers in emerging markets have had too much access to cheap funding, and investors are exposed to increasing defaults once these flows subside. While U.S. dollar borrowing costs have fallen in emerging as well as developed markets (as global bond yields fell), a sizable premium still exists among comparable businesses operating in each region. 10 Additionally, just because bond yields rise, that does not immediately mean that a borrower is likely to default. In most instances, leverage remains manageable for these businesses. While a rise in rates may be painful for some hot-money investors, dedicated emerging market investors, along with regional players from emerging markets (such as pension funds or insurance companies), would likely step in when other investors lose their heads. As we have seen several times, private banks, sovereign wealth funds, and insurance companies in Asia and the Middle East appear willing to deploy capital in other emerging markets as the asset class continues to evolve. 
"
2492,TAP,"Although inflows to emerging market dedicated strategies have slowed, we believe that current fundamentals from select issuers represent an attractive opportunity for nimble, active managers. As in any other credit market, we could see negative surprises that challenge our outlook. But for investors who stay focused on fundamentals, many issuers with strong core franchises and well-established business models may represent attractive entry points near current levels.

2494,TAP,"Important Risks Related to this Article 
"
2495,TAP,"Investments in emerging, offshore or frontier markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in developed markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse governmental regulation and intervention or political developments. In recent months, several media reports have warned of an impending implosion in emerging market (EM) finance. In many of these reports, journalists have warned that after years of easy money from the Federal Reserve (Fed), emerging market fixed income would soon come under considerable pressure. In response to these reports, we seek to highlight the three most common myths surrounding emerging market corporate credit. Below, we restate their claims and refute their conclusions about emerging market fixed income. In our view, valuations in emerging market corporate debt could represent an attractive entry point for patient investors who are focused on total returns. Myth #1: Rapid Growth in EM Corporate Issuance Implies Higher Default Risk A similar concern surrounds not only the serviceability of the debt, but also the massive increase in the EM corporate bond market over the past eight years. In fact, the amount of debt outstanding has increased tenfold over this period!1 For some journalists, this increase points to an increased likelihood of default. However, what many fail to realize can be distilled into a few key points: 1. Composition of emerging market financing has evolved a. Historically, emerging market corporations have borrowed money from European banks in the form of loans. b. Access to global credit markets is a testament to the development of EM economies and the emergence of many EM corporations as global industry leaders. 2. Leverage in emerging markets was, and still is, considerably lower than in developed markets. Myth #2: EM Corporations Are in Trouble Due to U.S. Dollar Strength Currency investing is hot right now. The premise for concern about ""King Dollar"" isn't wrong, but its focus may be misplaced. Critics believe that since EM corporations have borrowed in U.S. dollars, they have an asset-liability mismatch. Since the U.S. dollar is stronger than most emerging market currencies, the cost of EM corporations' debt in local currency terms prompts concern about their ability to repay.

2496,TAP,"SolarEdge Technologies, an increasingly prominent player in electronics that tap energy from the sun, is poised to shine following its early 2015 initial public offering, heating up on strengthening commercial and residential demand in the U.S.The Israel-based SolarEdge (SEDG), which produces optimizers and inverters to turn solar energy into electricity, went public on March 26 with an offering price of 18 and closed its first day of trading at 20.70. SolarEdge stock has climbed since to around 39.Its debut earnings release as a public company helped fuel the surge. In early May, SolarEdge posted quarterly revenue of $86.4 million, up 18% from the prior quarter and more than 180% year over year. Its fiscal 2015 third-quarter non-GAAP profit of 20 cents a share burned past analysts' views for 8 cents.For the current quarter, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average forecast EPS of 22 cents, and 54 cents for the full fiscal year.""They are executing very well,"" Mike Matousek, a trader at U.S. Global Investors, told IBD. ""They are making some good money. ... This is the definition of a growth story.""SolarEdge is a part of IBD's Energy-Solar industry group. It has the group's second highest Composite Rating after Canadian Solar (CSIQ).What Drives The Solar IndustryAnalysts anticipate robust growth for SolarEdge during this calendar year and next in the U.S., in large part because both commercial developers and homeowners are trying to complete projects before a federal tax credit for solar energy expires at the close of 2016, IHS Technology analyst Christine Beadle told IBD.The Investment Tax Credit, or ITC, is a 30% credit on solar energy systems — think of solar panels on roofs — for both homes and businesses.Beadle says that because it is not known if the tax credit will be extended — or reduced if it is extended — many Americans looking toward long-term energy savings, particularly in sun-soaked and high cost of living states, are moving with haste to capitalize on the tax breaks.""It's very much to do with the incentives,"" Beadle said. ""It's really incredible, the speed at which people are going.""Beadle's IHS colleague, solar analyst Cormac Gilligan, forecasts rapid growth this year for the PV (photovoltaic) inverter market in the U.S. PV inverters convert direct-current (DC) solar-panel output to alternating current (AC) suited to the power grid. PV installations in residential and small commercial projects — a SolarEdge sweet spot — are projected to grow more than 40% this year, Gilligan told IBD.""This represents a huge opportunity for inverter suppliers like SolarEdge,"" Gilligan said, noting that the greatest growth is anticipated in California, Arizona, Massachusetts, New Jersey and North Carolina.Gilligan says that while the solar market in the U.S. is likely to hit its peak for the current decade in 2016, owing to the tax credit expiration, energy-conscious homeowners and small-business owners are expected to continue to drive growth in PV inverters. He says that from 2017 onward this decade, residential and small commercial markets are predicted to grow 15% on average annually in the U.S.About 75% of SolarEdge's business is in the United States.Gilligan says that in 2014, SolarEdge ranked among the top five PV inverter suppliers in the U.S., owing in large measure to a partnership with solar industry giant SolarCity (SCTY). Gilligan adds that the rest of the top five inverter makers are ABB (ABB), Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS), Enphase Energy (ENPH) and SMA Solar Technology. He declined to provide specific ranks for each, saying that IHS divulges that information only to clients.He noted, however, that SolarEdge is ""gaining market share rapidly"" on the four companies ahead of it in the 2014 rankings.SolarEdge did not respond to IBD's interview requests. But following its earnings release, Roth Capital Partners analyst Philip Shen said in a research report that the company had told analysts that it expects the vast majority of its sales to continue to be in the U.S. and that it ""expects to penetrate the majority of the top customers in the U.S."" over the course of 2015.Teaming With TeslaSolarEdge also this year announced a collaboration with Tesla Motors (TSLA) on its Tesla Powerwall in-home stationary battery, which can store the energy from solar panels for later use.""Together, we are taking the first step towards widespread adoption of integrated solar energy generation and storage in the residential market,"" Lior Handelsman, marketing and product vice president of SolarEdge, said in a May news release.Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in the electric carmaker's latest quarterly conference call, in early May, that response to the battery systems has been ""overwhelming."" At the time, Tesla had taken 38,000 Powerwall pre-orders and 25,000 pre-orders for its larger-scale Powerpack, the latter mostly from utilities.Jed Dorsheimer, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said in a May research report that ""Energy storage has the potential to serve as an additional growth driver"" for SolarEdge. ""We are already starting to see this segment bear fruit, not yet on the top line but with increased visibility from Tesla Energy's recent battery announcement.""U.S. Global Investors' Matousek notes that many solar energy stocks sank along with oil prices in 2014. Given that solar energy is an alternative to expensive fossil fuels, he says, it made sense for investors to anticipate that solar demand would slow as prices at the pump dropped and reduced near-term incentives to shop for lower energy alternatives.But, he adds, oil prices will inevitably rebound. Already, he says, with the modest recovery this year in crude prices, investor attention has turned back to the solar realm, benefiting the likes of SolarEdge's stock.When oil prices start climbing substantially, Matousek said, ""the solar companies will get talked about even more. ... With energy, people look where they can save. Money goes where it is treated best.""

It was the third straight day of decline for Apple shares. Apple stock is down 5.7% since Monday's close, just ahead of the company's fiscal second-quarter results.Late Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple Watch production was slowed after a key component from one of two suppliers was found to be defective. The part involved is the taptic engine, which provides an electronic tap on the wrist for alerts.Reliability testing during production in February found that the component from one vendor started to break down over time. Taptic engines from the other supplier didn't experience the same problem, the Journal said. No watches with the faulty part are believed to have shipped, but the issue caused a production slowdown that limited the initial supply of the smartwatch.Media reports this week also noted that tattoos can disrupt sensors on the bottom of the Apple Watch. Inked skin confuses sensors that detect when the watch is being worn and measure the wearer's heart rate, Reuters reported.Some media outlets have speculated that the Apple Watch also might have a problem detecting the heart rate of people with dark skin.Alexis Madrigal, Silicon Valley Bureau chief for Fusion, wrote an article on the subject titled ""Will the Apple Watch's coolest feature work for people of color?""RELATED:Apple's vague Watch comments dissected on Wall Street.

2526,TAP,"The world as we see it in 2015 is nothing like what it was 20 or even 10 years ago. Evolving industries and geopolitical shifts in the last few decades call for a new paradigm that protects American workers and consumers while also maintaining a robust economic output.Emerging markets in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region create abundant possibilities. But while nations like China take full advantage of these new economic opportunities, the U.S. has inexplicably fallen behind.A diminished American presence in international markets leaves room for others to write the rules. This has the potential for striking heavy blows to our national and economic security.While we have an overall trade surplus with our trade agreement partners, the United States now operates under a trade deficit when looking at all of our international trade.This is not due to a lack of U.S. goods and services to sell. Rather it's due to our inability to fully tap into developing regions along with a hesitation towards getting into additional trade agreements. This mentality of the past doesn't work in the 21st century.Negotiations for two of the largest trade agreements in history are currently underway, through the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).TPP is an expansion of trade to 11 Pacific Rim nations, including Japan, and TTIP would be a monumental arrangement with 28 European Union member nations. Combined, these two agreements could give U.S. manufacturers, farmers and producers greater access to nearly 1 billion new consumers.In order to increase our exporting capacity, the U.S. must be on a level playing field with other nations and continue to tap into emerging markets. With already extremely low tariffs, other nations have relatively easy access to our markets.As a result, American consumers save more than $13,000 per year on goods and services. But we need to sell more abroad.By increasing our exports with these two agreements, we will expand our base of 20 current free trade partners, which amounts to $718 billion — half of all U.S. exports. In 2012 alone, the U.S. exported $1.5 trillion worth of goods abroad.Although we have an overall trade surplus with our trade agreement partners, it's those nations with which we don't have trade agreements where we have a nearly $500 billion annual trade deficit, resulting in fewer American jobs along with decreased wages.But we can't break into more markets if we can't get foreign nations to tear down their trade barriers. The best and only mechanism for Congress to advocate for the American worker and our industries while also holding the president accountable is trade promotion authority, or TPA.Recently, Congress introduced TPA legislation that empowers Congress in trade negotiations. Under the Constitution, the president negotiates trade deals. TPA is what demands accountability. It sets negotiating objectives — 150 of them — and includes stringent consultation and transparency requirements.If Congress feels that the administration is not adequately addressing our stated objectives, then we can stop the agreement in its tracks. Furthermore, the Constitution allows Congress to have the final say before any agreement becomes law — a fact that is reaffirmed under TPA.As TPA legislation makes its way through Congress, trade negotiators are making progress in TPP and TTIP negotiations currently underway, but there's little sunlight on these talks. TPA will provide much needed transparency to the American people and allow members of Congress the opportunity to champion the businesses and labor force in their districts.The only truly constitutional way for the United States to achieve the most successful outcome with these agreements and gain access to these heavily sought after markets is to empower trade negotiators and strengthen congressional oversight.Through TPA, Congress is exercising its authority to regulate foreign commerce by allowing these agreements to be held accountable by the American people.When it comes to trade, America needs to lead. If we don't, someone else will, and it's unlikely they will act with our best interest in mind. We prefer to lead now by passing trade promotion authority this Congress. Tiberi, who represents Ohio's 12th district, and is on the House Ways and Means Committee and serves as chairman of the subcommittee on trade. Emmer represents Minnesota's 6th District and is on the House Foreign Affairs and Agriculture Committees.

2531,TAP,"Betrayal: Another Obama amnesty program is well underway — at Guantanamo, where three dangerous al-Qaida operatives have quietly been OK'd for release in three months. And now a close aide to the 9/11 mastermind is also on tap for release.
"
2532,TAP,"After already freeing an al-Qaida bomb maker last month — over the objections of U.S. intelligence, which warned, ""He would be capable of re-engaging as an explosives expert or trainer"" — the parole board that Obama set up to clear out Gitmo is now poised to rubber-stamp for release a close associate of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

2533,TAP,"Gitmo's so-called Periodic Review Board, made up of State Department and Justice Department officials, is hearing from defense lawyers for Abdul Shalabi, a former bodyguard to Osama bin Laden also connected to Mohammed while he was in Karachi, Pakistan, plotting the 9/11 attacks.

"
2536,TAP,"Military intelligence notes that Shalabi was trained ""for participation in a suicide attack or deployment to the West"" and warns that his family in Saudi Arabia didn't stop him from becoming radicalized before 9/11.
"
2537,TAP,"So what makes anybody think he'll swear off jihad now?
"
2538,TAP,"Shalabi's defense team argues that a Saudi rehabilitation program that uses ""art therapy"" to de-radicalize terrorists will make sure he's reformed.

2556,TAP,"Fleetmatics Group, an Ireland-based developer of software for managing vehicle fleets, has boomed the past four years and is forecast to keep driving earnings growth this year and beyond.
"
2557,TAP,"Companies of all sizes are progressively looking to improve the efficiency of their vans and trucks. Many of these fleets, however, are only beginning to tap the software-as-a-service (SaaS) options that the likes of Fleetmatics (FLTX) provide. It leaves a long runway to grow the customer base, the company says.
"
2558,TAP,"""We are building a business with the belief that global penetration rates could grow significantly over the next decade,"" Brian Norris, Fleetmatics' vice president of investor relations, told IBD by email.
"
2559,TAP,"Fleetmatics provides Web-based software to track data on everything from fuel usage to driver behavior, and says it helps clients swiftly analyze their operations, boost efficiency and lower costs.
"
2560,TAP,"Norris cites research by both Berg Insight and Frost & Sullivan that sees the global market for mobile technology which bolsters vehicle fleets as a multibillion-dollar-a-year industry. But it's a market that, as he puts it, ""is lightly penetrated"" — just 10% to 15% now, according to the research.
"
2561,TAP,"That means Fleetmatics can keep growing substantially without having to worry about stealing market share from an emerging field of competitors, Norris says.
"
2562,TAP,"Sweet Spot In Fleets
"
2563,TAP,"Fleetmatics is heavily focused on smaller fleets, those with roughly five to 75 vehicles, as they represent the majority of the market and are the most likely to still need the company's products and services.
"
2564,TAP,"""The simple reality is, most (smaller) operators do not have an existing solution in place today,"" Norris said. He adds that Fleetmatics is targeting growth primarily in North America and Europe, with the former now the most fertile ground for growth but with long-term expansion opportunity abundant across mainland Europe.
"
2565,TAP,"Fleetmatics is the industry leader on the smaller end of the market, in terms of the size of its subscription base. But the company also works with larger operations, including midmarket fleets (75 to 500 vehicles) and big enterprises (more than 500). Solid growth in these two categories helped Fleetmatics finish the fourth quarter of 2014 with 552,000 vehicles under subscription, up 24% from a year earlier.
"
2566,TAP,"In a February report, Fleetmatics said that its fourth-quarter 2014 earnings per share jumped 91% from a year earlier, to 44 cents, on revenue that grew 28%, to $64 million. For all of 2014, the company posted EPS of $1.09, up nearly 27%.
"
2567,TAP,"The company, which is in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise Group, has a high EPS rating of 97 out of a potential 99. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average forecast Fleetmatics' EPS growth at 18% for this year and 27% in 2016. Fleetmatics' stock is up 31% this year.
"
2568,TAP,"Michael Rindos, an analyst at Aegis Capital, told IBD that Fleetmatics' subscriber growth shows that the company has an aggressive sales force and a sales model that effectively demonstrates how it helps its clients increase efficiency and lower costs. ""It's a company with strong momentum in a growth market,"" Rindos said.
"
2569,TAP,"In a March research note, he forecasts that Fleetmatics will add between 110,000 and 115,000 net new subscribers this year. He says the company's current market — the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Ireland, Australia and the Netherlands — contains 31 million vehicles with low double-digit penetration rates. Globally, there are more than 70 million vehicles.
"
2570,TAP,"""It's a land grab for customers right now,"" Rindos said, particularly in the U.S. but also across the world. He says the fleet market — from trucks driven by plumbers, for example, to vans operated by cable company technicians — is vast.
"
2571,TAP,"""The depth of the industry is significant,"" he said.
"
2572,TAP,"Rindos calls the fleet-management solutions market ""highly fragmented"" and notes that competitors in it include Trimble Navigation (TRMB), LoJack (LOJN) Orbcomm (ORBC). Iridium Communications (IRDM), TomTom, Ituran (ITRN) and I.D. Systems (IDSY). A Berg Insight report from late 2014 ranks Fleetmatics as the top player in the Americas, then Trimble. In heavy trucks, it calls Omnitracs a key rival and Zonar Systems a strong player. Verizon (VZ) Networkfleet and NexTraq focus on service fleets, it added.
"
2573,TAP,"Potential Seen For M&A
"
2574,TAP,"Rindos notes that Fleetmatics has ""plenty of free cash and maintains a strong balance sheet with little debt."" That, he told IBD, puts it in good shape to push for growth both organically and via acquisitions.
"
2575,TAP,"The company says it is actively scanning the merger-and-acquisition landscape, with a special focus on Europe. In February it bought France-based Ornicar SAS, a fellow SaaS provider of fleet management solutions. In announcing the deal, Fleetmatics said France is the largest market in Western Europe, with more than 6.5 million vehicles, and is lightly penetrated at about 13%. Ornicar SAS brought more than 15,000 active subscriptions.
"
2576,TAP,"Fleetmatics previously expanded into the Netherlands and Mexico.
"
2577,TAP,"""Building off our leadership position in North America, we believe Mainland Europe is a logical next step for geographic expansion as it has a larger market opportunity than North America and is slightly less penetrated,"" Norris said. ""Building off our entry into the Mexican market, we also view Latin America as a target longer term.""
"
2578,TAP,"Aegis Capital's Rindos also said that Fleetmatics has plenty of room to deepen its ties with current customers by selling them ""meaningful add-on"" services, making the typical customer more profitable.
"
2579,TAP,"A client, for instance, may use Fleetmatics' software to monitor fuel consumption by tracking drivers' speed, idling and routes — finding ways to help reach end locations more efficiently. The client could add on more Fleetmatics' technology to take delivery scheduling into the cloud, for instance, meshing its scheduling with its driver routing.
"
2580,TAP,"Analyst Bhavan Suri of William Blair also sees growth potential on this front.
"
2581,TAP,"Given that Fleetmatics has the largest customer base in the small-fleet market, it has plenty of opportunity ""to further mine this base to add more vehicles and additional products,"" Suri said in a March report. The analyst added that Fleetmatics gets a ""meaningful portion"" of sales leads via customer referrals, a cost-efficient method, and ""this is a significant differentiator as Fleetmatics' competitors have materially smaller customer bases to mine.""
"
2582,TAP,"CEO Jim Travers said at a March conference that there will be new ways for Fleetmatics to expand. He says its software helps clients improve driver safety, for instance, as drivers who know an employer tracks behavior more often avoid risk-taking, and that's piqued the interest of insurance industry leaders.
"
2583,TAP,"""The insurance industry has been very active in looking at businesses like ours ... because we are collecting real-time data about what's happening,"" he said. ""There hasn't been anything that we have been engaged with yet that we can announce ... but there are some significant interests from those commercial (insurance) providers and how they might leverage our data.""Fleetmatics Group, an Ireland-based developer of software for managing vehicle fleets, has boomed the past four years and is forecast to keep driving earnings growth this year and beyond.Companies of all sizes are progressively looking to improve the efficiency of their vans and trucks.

2584,TAP,"With earnings season swinging into high gear, more highly rated companies are set to report in the coming week, including Under Armour and Biogen.They are two of the four IBD 50 stocks on tap, providing a spotlight on what direction these market leaders will take from here.Manhattan AssociatesThere are big opportunities for the small but rapidly growing supply-chain management software maker.As online retail grows, companies are forced to adjust how they deliver merchandise. That helped Manhattan Associates (MANH) top analyst estimates last quarter.The Atlanta-based company is projected to see a 12% increase in Q1 earnings per share to 29 cents on a 12% hike in revenue to $126.9 million when it reports results Tuesday. It would be the company's 15th straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth though it will also be the slowest since 2012.Under ArmourThe activewear maker continues to get high marks from analysts as the feisty underdog challenges market leader Nike 's (NKE) dominance.Stifel analysts on Wednesday said they expect Under Armour's (UA) Q1 results will rise on fundamental strengths, citing strong lines in core apparel, footwear and international segments. Stifel has a buy rating and raised its price target to 95 from 85.Susquehanna on Wednesday said it expects 45%-plus growth in international sales to start the year, after Under Armour landed in Brazil, Chile, Southeast Asia and the Middle East last year. Susquehanna kept a neutral rating but raised its target to 77 from 71.Under Armour is projected to report a 5-cent per-share profit when it reports Q1 results Tuesday, down from 6 cents a year ago, on a 25% jump in revenue to $803 million. Those rates would also mark sharp slowdowns from recent quarters.O'Reilly AutomotiveThe auto parts retailer is the top-rated stock in the nine-company Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts group and second only to giant AutoZone (AZO) in revenue.Like others in the group, O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) has benefited in from lower gas prices that are putting more people on the road, leading to higher demand for tires, oil and other supplies stocked at O'Reilly's 4,300-plus stores.Sterne Agee recently said it expects that trend to remain a tailwind for the sector in coming months.Wall Street expects O'Reilly's profit to climb 20% to $1.93 per share on a 7.3% rise in revenue to $1.85 billion.BiogenThe Cambridge, Mass.-based biotech drugmaker has been hitting new highs as it continues to report positive results for promising new drugs.On March 20 its stock shot up 10% after it said phase-1 study results for its highly-anticipated new Alzheimer's drug candidate, aducanumab, topped Wall Street expectations, leading Cowen to raise its price target to 500.Biogen (BIIB) got another shot in the arm on April 14 when it said it will present data this week demonstrating significant improvement in patients in a mid-stage trial of anti-LINGO-1, its treatment for acute optic neuritis, a disease that damages the eye's optic nerve.Biogen is expected to report a 58% earnings hike to $3.91 per share on a 25% rise in revenue to $2.66 billion when it reports first-quarter earnings Friday.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

2638,TAP,"Promises: Not long after FCC chairman Tom Wheeler swore that the FCC takeover of the Internet wouldn't result in new taxes or fees, it appears likely that new taxes will show up on Internet bills in the near future.In a speech a few weeks before the FCC voted to approve its ""net neutrality"" rules, Chairman Tom Wheeler promised there would be ""no tariffs, no new taxes"" as a result.Later that month, FCC spokeswoman Kim Hart promised that the new regulatory scheme ""does not raise taxes or fees. Period.""If that sounds suspiciously like Obama's promise that under ObamaCare you would be able to ""keep your plan. Period,"" there's a good reason.In mid-March, Wheeler told a House panel that he couldn't, in fact, rule out a new Internet fee to help pay for the government's ""Universal Service Fund"" (USF).By shoving the Internet into the agency's Title II regulatory scheme — which was set up 80 years ago to regulate the telephone monopoly — Wheeler made it possible to do so.He said a special board representing federal and state governments was weighing whether to impose that tax. Right now, the USF is paid for by a tax added to long-distance bills.""How they resolve things in the future I do not know,"" he told the House committee.Does anyone in their right mind believe that state and federal governments will say no to a brand new revenue source now that they can tap it?The Los Angeles Times doesn't seem to think so. An article published Thursday leads with: ""Recently adopted net neutrality regulations soon could make your monthly Internet bill more complicated — and potentially more expensive.""It quotes Hal Singer of the centrist Progressive Policy Institute, who figures the USF fee and various other charges that state and local government are likely to add to Internet bills will cost consumers around $11 billion a year.Wheeler has suggested that any new federal Internet fee could be offset by a lower charge on phone bills, so it would be a wash to the consumer.Right. Just last December, Wheeler authorized a $1.5 billion boost in the USF budget so he could spend more on subsidies for school and library broadband services, on top of the 47% boost in the fund's budget since 2004.Welcome to the brave new world of ObamaNet.

2642,TAP,"What do some of the most wildly successful CEOs have in common? They started with passion. Not the fetishized version of passion, says Steven Kotler, co-author of ""Bold: How to Go Big, Create Wealth and Impact the World,"" but passion that fuels learning, focus and dogged persistence.Kotler lauds CEOs Elon Musk, Richard Branson, Larry Page and Jeff Bezos as visionaries who tap the potential of accelerating technologies like 3D printing, computing robotics and artificial intelligence to pursue what they love.""If you want to play at this speed and scale,"" Kotler told IBD, ""passion and purpose are key.""Look at how passion: Spurs curiosity. When you're interested in something, you learn about it. Musk, often a serial entrepreneur for igniting ventures such as PayPal, SolarCity (SCTY), SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA), is ""the quintessential autodidact,"" wrote Liz Wiseman in ""Rookie Smarts."" ""He read the entire Encyclopedia Britannica when (he) was 8 or 9 years old, taught himself computer programming at 12, left his home in South Africa at 15 and put himself through the University of Pennsylvania.""Musk earned degrees in physics and business, plus taught himself aerospace and electrical and automotive engineering. ""One of the reasons Musk is a serial entrepreneur is that he is an obsessed serial learner,"" Wiseman wrote. Boosts stamina. ""Entrepreneurship is really difficult,"" Kotler said. ""When your product is teetering on the brink of destruction, without passion you're going to give up. If you have a bigger mission, bigger than you and your ego, it will drive you through the night.""Passion is the basis for resilience. It's the reason folks idolize Musk, Kotler says. ""In 2008, he was borrowing money to pay his rent and now he's so successful,"" he said. Why? Musk decided way back in college what he was going to do and stayed the course. Drowns out the naysayers. Virgin Group's Richard Branson is proof. Already a successful music exec, he was crazy for starting an airline, many said. What did he know about the plane business?But it made perfect sense to him. Tired of the dreadful flying experience he had as a frequent traveler, he set out to create an airline where people would walk onto an airplane and say, ""Wow, this is wonderful,"" he told Kotler and co-author Peter Diamandis.The way up wasn't easy. Branson had to sell his stake in Virgin Music to come up with $800 million to keep Virgin Atlantic alive.Despite these obstacles, Branson persisted, and his planes took off. Helps focus. Passion amplifies productivity, Kotler says.It also helps you get out of the quick-turnaround mindset that can hamper long-term success.""The speed of business keeps accelerating,"" Kotler said, ""but we have to learn to slow down, too.""Take time to ponder ideas that could affect your business down the road. Amazon's (AMZN) Bezos is doing just that when he's considering drones for delivery services.Lots of people can't grasp the idea of drones making deliveries, but Bezos already sees potential. What he knows for sure: Customers want products fast. Current shipping methods don't have much room for improvement. Drones could be the answer. Lifts goals. Far-reaching ideas start out with a desire to solve simple problems that affect many people. Example: Google's (GOOGL) Larry Page wondered if there was a better way to organize information.""He didn't start out with a massive idea,"" said Kotler. ""it was first a question he was passionate about answering,"" which led to a search empire.

2671,TAP,"China's ""new normal"" is slower, but higher quality, economic growth, with a target of 7% this year. To improve the quality, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, in his closing press conference at the National People's Congress, called for getting ""the relationship right between the government and the market,"" and he laid out a program ""to boost vitality of the market.""
"
2672,TAP,"The premier's message is important because China's economic imbalance reflects a more fundamental imbalance between the market and the state — or, more precisely, between the individual and the state. Yet the Chinese Communist Party's monopoly on power and its mantra that stability comes from power, not freedom, continue to thwart fundamental reform.
"
2673,TAP,"Economic life has been liberated to a large extent since 1978 by allowing the non-state sector to flourish via freer markets and more secure property rights. But the bottom-up economic reform process is in sharp contrast with the top-down political system.

"
2677,TAP,"China's future will depend on resolving this tension in favor of freedom and the individual while constraining state power to the protection of persons and propriety. In this respect, Premier Li's remarks during his press conference deserve careful attention.

2679,TAP,"The premier wants to reduce the costs of business by also making it easier to enter business. He recognizes that increasing opportunities for opening new businesses will increase supply, which in turn will ""boost market demand"" (Say's Law of Markets). He wants young entrepreneurs to put their ideas into practice, and he wants government to ""lift all restrictions so that they can put their talent to good use.""
"

"
2688,TAP,"""Reducing the powers held in the hands of government,"" he says, ""has actually helped us to tackle downward pressures on economic growth.""

2696,TAP,"It was hinted. It was leaked. It was tweeted. It was finally given.In a speech before thousands of students at Liberty University, Texas rookie Sen. Ted Cruz announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination. He's the first official contender of what will be many within a month and he started early to stop sinking in the polls.He's a Tea Party favorite -- a favorite, not the only favorite. There will be competition for the starboard side of the GOP base in these next 12 months -- Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, maybe Huckabee and Santorum. But Cruz staked out very conservative turf. And he did it in classic Cruz style, if anything can be classic about someone on the national scene only 26 months.As in his college debates and court cases, Cruz stood alone on-stage. No podium. No banners. And -- wait for it! -- no teleprompter.Because, you are meant to realize, Cruz needs no reminders, no help saying what he truly believes. He's speaking every word from the heart. How else could someone utter 2,376 coherent words without a single note? Including weaving in personal stories of a childhood in a troubled family.The performance blew away conservative pundits (""A dazzling speech""--Rush Limbaugh) and editorial boards (""He's hardly the brittle, conservative killjoy the mainstream media try to portray. On the contrary, he is charming, funny, scarily smart, a brilliant debater and more than well qualified to lead this nation""--Investor's Business Daily.)Like most federal candidates in recent times, Cruz vowed to change Washington. And the Easter Bunny will soon deliver candies to every house.But it was an excellent performance, a good start. Which Cruz needed. Every campaign's best day is its first, which is its last day in full control of anything. It's exciting then, full of promise, free of threats and the weariness and disappointments that inevitably come. Scroll down for the complete Cruz transcript and watch the full C-SPAN video there too.Whereas another short-term senator who sought the presidency can never speak without a teleprompter and without mentioning himself dozens of times, Cruz' favorite word this day was ""Imagine."" He said it 38 times, evoking the country that's drawn millions of immigrants with hope and ambition and the country that could be again with a true conservative at the helm undoing the damage of the incumbent.""Instead of a federal government that works to undermine our values, imagine a federal government that works to defend the sanctity of human life and to uphold the sacrament of marriage.""""Instead of a federal government that wages an assault on our religious liberty...imagine a federal government that stands for the First Amendment rights of every American.""""Instead of a president who boycotts Prime Minister Netanyahu, imagine a president who stands unapologetically with the nation of Israel.""""Imagine a president who says 'We will stand up and defeat radical Islamic terrorism and we will call it by its name.'""On the Democrat side, they're now imagining how unanimous must be their vote for the lone realistic candidate, whose mis-steps are mounting even as her poll numbers are sinking.On the Republican side, this is just the beginning of the competition. Imagine the newly-formatted debates to come with the likes of Cruz, Walker, Bush, Rubio, Perry, Paul dueling over issues of real substance, not the phony ones ginned up by the MSM.

2719,TAP,"ESPN bills itself as the Worldwide Leader In Sports, and the slogan is not mere hyperbole. ESPN is available in 94 million pay-TV homes in the U.S., and its channels air in more than 200 nations.Clearly, Burbank, Calif.-based Walt Disney (DIS) has benefited wildly from buying an 80% stake in ESPN in 1995. For openers, ESPN, which broadcasts jewels ranging from the NFL and NBA to Major League Baseball and all sorts of college sports, provides a gateway to the hearts and minds of 18- to 34-year-old males. Advertisers covet that viewing audience.But ESPN is also essential for Disney as the worlds of media and technology continue to blur. As such Silicon Valley heavyweights as Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) make inroads into what has been regarded as traditional media ecosystems, media companies likewise must begin to act more like technology companies if they hope to remain relevant.In January, Dish Network (DISH) announced Sling TV, which lets subscribers watch cable channels over the Internet (what the industry calls OTT, for over the top) without mandating a satellite subscription. For a mere $20 a month, OTT subscribers get access to ESPN and ESPN 2, as well as such channels as Disney, the Food Network, HGTV, TBS, TNT and CNN.It's the first time that Disney has made ESPN available online without a cable or satellite subscription. ""It's the thing a lot of people really miss when they don't have a pay-TV service,"" Dish's outgoing CEO Joe Clayton said in announcing Sling TV at the Consumer Electronics Show. ""They want live sports. They want ESPN and ESPN2.""Disney, though, must protect its ESPN franchise. The company had to consider the move seriously for competitive reasons, say observers.""ESPN is a primary profit center for Disney and annually contributes close to $7 billion from subscriber fees alone to the corporate bottom line,"" Neal Pilson, former president of CBS Sports and now a TV industry consultant, told IBD.""ESPN and Disney have sophisticated and talented executive leadership, so it's hard to imagine they would agree to any OTT deal between ESPN and Dish that might, in any way, jeopardize the revenue stream ESPN continues to generate from the traditional cable/satellite industry.""But OTT has become a rallying cry, if not a mantra, in the industry.""ESPN has been dipping its toe into the OTT space for over a year, mulling whether streaming an ESPN channel might work,"" said Porter Bibb, an analyst with MediaTech Partners. ""It will — and it will be forthcoming sometime in the next year or so.""The MSOs (multisystem operators, or pay-TV providers) won't dare penalize ESPN, but ESPN knows the multibillion-dollar fees they currently extract from MSOs aren't going up and upon contract expiry — which in most cases runs to 2020 — will start to go down.""ESPN needs to replace that revenue with the only alternative, which is OTT.""Downgraded On Ad ChallengesBTIG analyst Rich Greenfield likes ESPN, but on Monday he downgraded Disney stock to neutral from buy, in part on the increasing challenges for broadcast TV ad revenue.""Disney is clearly best-positioned among its broadcast/cable network peers, with its must-have sports-driven ESPN networks and non-advertising-driven Disney channels,"" Greenfield said in a research report Monday. ""However, we are increasingly struggling with the question of whether anyone in the sector can flourish as consumer behavior shifts away from traditional television viewing, not to mention a complete lack of interest in wasting time on commercials.""But in Q4, Disney reported higher earnings that surpassed Wall Street's forecasts, thanks in large part to ESPN. Disney had adjusted earnings per share of $1.04, topping the 92 cents estimated by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Net income jumped 33% to $1.8 billion.Disney's media networks division, which stars ESPN, clocked in with $1.5 billion in operating income, up 20%.ESPN is crucial to not only Walt Disney's fortunes but also its image, particularly among investors. Under CEO Bob Iger, Disney has established an enviable record for making good on its promises to Wall Street.While Disney's assets range from theme parks to the ""Star Wars"" franchise, ESPN is rapidly becoming arguably its most transferrable property worldwide. As Viacom's (VIA) MTV unit has somewhat declined in buzz value over the years, ESPN now stands alone at the top of the cable-channel heap.Controlling A DemographicIn a way, Disney is following a tried-and-true formula with ESPN. Disney, of course, is the content king when it comes to enriching the lives of young people with programming that continually appeals to this special demographic — and doing it in many forms, ranging from old-fashioned TV to DVDs and Blu-ray innovations.""Walt Disney, for a long time, has had a control over our childhood, from Mickey Mouse and Snow White to Cinderella and trips to Disney World and the old Sunday TV show with Walt Disney himself,"" noted Robert Thompson, who teaches a course in television and American culture at the Newhouse School of Syracuse University.""ESPN basically owns the culture of men, especially young men,"" Thompson said. ""Sports translates so well to new technologies and all media forms, such as second screens, third screens (and) streaming.""Sports — especially professional football, which ESPN broadcasts — is the golden goose. The Oscars broadcast this year declined 15% in the ratings, but the Super Bowl goes up.""Disney's mandate is to keep ESPN the worldwide leader of sports — and the destination for the key demographic of young adult men.To do it, Disney must continue to tap into the new technology.""Dish/Sling is the beneficiary for the moment and is small enough not to rile the big MSOs,"" Bibb said. ""But the writing is on the wall, and ESPN will be right there with HBO, the other 'must-have' cable network, on the Net. And it will be there sooner rather than later.""

2721,TAP,"Monday's launch of the European Central Bank's massive monetary policy initiative stirred global markets. It also created some opportunities for U.S. investors. The program's announcement in January launched a rally in Europe's stock and bond markets and placed even greater pressure on the euro. The plan increases the eurozone's existing stimulus efforts by about $50 billion per month to $62 billion, beginning with government bonds and bond issues by European institutions.

2722,TAP,"ECB President Mario Draghi said the purchases will run through September 2016 and possibly longer if inflation does not reach a more-or-less steady 2% by that time. Eurozone consumer prices fell in the three months through February, their first year-over-year declines in more than five years.

2728,TAP,"When you're developing cutting-edge technology, it's easy to get carried away. Just ask John Sculley. Apple's (AAPL) chief executive from 1983 to 1993, Sculley had already gained a reputation as a marketing whiz from his earlier years running Pepsi (PEP). In 1992, he oversaw Apple's launch of the Newton, the first handheld personal digital assistant.

2750,TAP,"You can get exhausted just reading Herbie Hancock's resume. He played with the Chicago Symphony at age 11. He joined Miles Davis' Second Great Quintet at 23. He was a pioneer in the use of synthesizers in pop. He helped popularize turntable scratching in hip-hop. He's produced 53 records, which have won 14 Grammy Awards, including the 2008 Album of the Year, only the second time that jazz has been so honored. He still pushes the boundaries after five decades of innovation.""I just started working on a new album with Flying Lotus, with probably less of a plan than any other record I've ever made,"" Hancock, 74, told IBD. ""I'm just trusting the flow of things in the moment, which is something I've been doing more even on concert tours, where we start with just one person playing, we listen deeply and let the chips fall where they may.""Windy City RiseHancock was born in 1940 on Chicago's rough South Side.His dad was a government meat inspector. His mother noticed that Herbie was eager to tap at the keyboard of a neighbor's piano, so she bought him one for $5 from a church basement.By 7, he was taking classical music lessons — and in four years, he was on stage playing a Mozart concerto.Hancock skipped a grade and at 12 entered high school, where he made his first white friends.""Some black people look for racism, but I made a point of not looking for it, because looking for it feeds a victim mentality, which doesn't help anyone,"" he wrote in ""Herbie Hancock: Possibilities,"" his memoir.He began listening to the influential Hi-Lo's, an a cappella quartet, prompting him to put together his own vocal group. It never occurred to him that he could play something other than classical on the piano until at 14 he saw a jazz pianist improvise at a school dance.Hancock asked him how he could learn how to go beyond the score and was advised to listen to the masters on records and try to mimic them. The teen began to analyze and take apart what he heard. ""Improvising is like opening a wonderful box where everything you take out is always new,"" he wrote.At 16, he entered Grinnell College in Iowa on a scholarship, majoring in electrical engineering to fulfill the promise to his mother to learn a trade. But as a sophomore, he organized the school's first jazz concert and, as a junior, added music as a second major. He fell one credit short of graduating in 1960, then returned to Chicago to launch a jazz career. His parents weren't happy about it, but let him live at home until he decided to move to the big-time jazz market, New York.By the end of 1961, Hancock had played with a group on two records impressively enough that the top jazz label, Blue Note, signed him.Thanks to a mentor's advice, he insisted on retaining publishing rights, which would provide an important source of income.Sweet StuffHe recorded his first solo LP with six songs the next year, and now Hancock was headed for stardom. The album reached 84 on the Billboard 100, propelled by the single ""Watermelon Man.""That caught the attention of the famous Davis, who threw him into jazz improv in 1963. ""We never had traditional rehearsals; we just did some brainstorming, and every night was a high-wire act, with each of us soloing without any limits,"" Hancock said. ""It was the same with recording. Miles was a great teacher, forcing me to think through answers to my questions.""Hancock continued to record solo on the side. ""Empyrean Isles"" in 1964 and ""Maiden Voyage"" in 1965 would become some of the most influential LPs of the decade, pushing jazz into new territory.Then in 1966 came his first film score, for the avant-garde classic ""Blow-Up.""After an argument with Davis in 1968, Hancock left the band and formed his own sextet. The same year, he married his girlfriend, Gigi Meixner, and she and their daughter, Jessica, now play key roles at Hancock Records.Hancock left Blue Note for Warner Bros. in 1969. His next records pushed further into electronic music, using synthesizer keyboard instruments. The recordings of the early 1970s were too groundbreaking to be commercial, though they became respected over time.Hancock next turned to Buddhism, with its emphasis on practical goals and inner peace. ""It helped me discover my humanity and that of others, and the value of this can't be overstated in a connected world,"" he said. ""Its values of collaboration and living in the moment are also central to jazz.""A Head For MusicIn 1973, feeling that he had drifted too far into the outer space of experimental music, Hancock made a break to the other end of the spectrum: forming the Headhunters.Their first album, ""Head Hunters,"" infused jazz with funk, a rhythmic, danceable form that emphasized melody and harmony. It was the first jazz LP to go platinum (selling 1 million records) and is second only to one by Davis as the biggest jazz seller of all time.After a second hit album by the group, Hancock went off to do solos and film scores.The big screen turned into huge stuff, with his music for 1986's ""Round Midnight"" — in which he also acted — winning an Oscar for best original score.In 1983, his quintet VSOP II put out the album ""Future Shock,"" using turntable DJs to scratch, or lift, segments from records for sound effects, a technique that had been confined to hip-hop music.The band's record label, Columbia, predicted that the album would end Hancock's career. Instead, it hit platinum sales. The single ""Rockit"" earned Hancock his first Grammy, for best R&B instrumental. The video won five MTV video awards.In the 1990s, Hancock racked up four more Grammys with tribute albums to Davis and Ira and George Gershwin along with the single ""Manhattan."" In 2007, Hancock released ""River: The Joni Letters,"" a tribute to Joni Mitchell, collaborating with Tina Turner, Leonard Cohen and Norah Jones. It won three Grammys, including Album of the Year.Hancock's latest CD — 2010's ""The Imagine Project"" — had help from friends Dave Matthews, Pink and Chaka Khan. It won Grammys for best pop collaboration and best improvised jazz solo.""The old business model for music is dead,"" said Hancock. ""Records used to pay the bills, and tours were a way to promote them; now they're almost loss leaders to support concerts. But the cool thing is that people are finding new ways to create attention through things like Instagram and Twitter."" He's no slouch in social media, with 100,000 Twitter followers and 800,000 Facebook likes.The Los Angeles Philharmonic named Hancock its creative chairman for jazz for 2010-12, the Kennedy Center Honors recognized him for achievement in performing arts in 2013, and Harvard University chose him last year to give six lectures as a professor of poetry. Not bad for a kid who dropped out of college.Never Old""Herbie Hancock is the fountain of youth in music,"" said Steve Talaga, who teaches composition and jazz piano at Hope College in Michigan. ""Every record and every live appearance is brimming with freshness and inspiration that are jaw-dropping, the result of hard work and constant learning. He's an elemental force in music today.""Going his own way has sometimes been costly, but Hancock ultimately won over the critics and kept $12 million, according to CelebrityNetWorth.com — evidence that being an artist doesn't mean you can't also have money.

2767,TAP,"Investors gave Apple (AAPL) a slap on the wrist Tuesday, a day after the company detailed its upcoming Apple Watch release. Apple stock was down more than 2% in early afternoon trading on the stock market today. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company earned mixed reviews for its spring product launch event Monday in San Francisco. Besides the new smartwatch, Apple unveiled a super thin and light MacBook notebook computer and a lower-cost Apple TV set-top box.Apple revealed pricing and applications for the Apple Watch, which will launch on April 24 in nine countries, with models ranging from $349 to $17,000.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves said the Apple Watch is the world's best smartwatch, but questioned if the world actually wants smartwatches.""We remain somewhat skeptical of the device's ability to drive mainstream adoption,"" he said in a research note Monday. He expects Apple to sell out of its initial shipments of the device because of Apple's fervent fan base, but has doubts about its mass market appeal.""The Watch's primary functional value seems to be the convenience of being able to do certain tasks without taking your phone out of your pocket,"" Hargreaves said. ""This is nice, but does not appear game-changing since people are likely to continue carrying iPhones for the foreseeable future.""The Apple Watch links wirelessly to iPhone 5 and 6 series phones for communications, information and fitness apps. It comes in three collections (standard, sport and luxury) and two screen sizes (32 and 42 millimeters, or 1.25-1.65 inches).Design is the killer feature of the Apple Watch, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said in a report Monday. Technology is a supporting feature, he said. Munster says Apple Watch will compete against traditional watches, not other smartwatches.""The design of the watch and the Apple brand are the two biggest selling points and the technical features are a value add vs. a standard watch,"" Munster said.Apple Watch likely will have a slow ramp, with adoption building over the next six quarters. The December 2016 quarter will be the inflection quarter for the Apple Watch, he said.He says the low-end Sport model should account for 55% of unit sales, followed by the midrange model at 45%, he said. The gold luxury Edition model, which starts at $10,000, will be only a small fraction of sales. Munster raised his forecast for average selling price for the Apple Watch to $550 from $500 after Monday's presentation.Calendar 2015 unit sales estimates among Wall Street analysts range from 8 million to more than 20 million.Apple CEO Tim Cook did a better job of articulating the purpose of the Apple Watch at the event Tuesday than he did when it was first announced last September, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said in a note Monday.Apple is positioning its smartwatch as an accurate and customizable timepiece, an intimate communications device, and a health and fitness tracker, she said. Those primary use cases are supplemented by glanceable information and notifications and functional apps like using Apple Pay for mobile payments and unlocking hotel room doors.Apple will sell millions of units of the Apple Watch off the bat, but it may not catch on with the mass market, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Brian Blair said in a note Tuesday.""The Watch certainly extends the smartphone functionality onto your wrist and puts critical application features a tap or two away, but the question will be whether it offers enough utility and is enough of a time saver to warrant plugging in yet another device every night,"" Blair said.Health and fitness apps could fuel sales of the Apple Watch, but the early functionality is not convincing, Nomura analyst Stuart Jeffrey said in a note Tuesday.""A strong health monitoring capability and contextually predictive information display capability could drive strong smartwatch adoption,"" Jeffrey said. ""Based on yesterday's Apple Watch presentation, however, these capabilities do not seem well developed.""Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri predicts Apple will come out with a second-generation Apple Watch in the fall that will address the shortcomings of the initial model.Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian White was more bullish on the prospects for the Apple Watch. He said it will make wearing watches cool again.""We believe consumers are going to fall in love with Apple Watch,"" he said in a note Tuesday.IBISWorld Technology Analyst Sarah Kahn said the Apple Watch is cool, but is only a nice-to-own product, not a must have.""Although the watch's features are exceptional, almost all activities can be done with an iPhone, rendering the watch a completely discretionary gadget, highly dependable on disposable income, price and recent expenditures,"" Kahn said in a report Monday. ""Many Apple consumers have recently purchased an expensive new iPhone or may be tempted to buy the new MacBook, holding off on purchasing the new discretionary device.""

2813,TAP,"Semantics: If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck ... well, you get the idea. But not this White House, which called the Fort Hood massacre by a self-proclaimed jihadi yelling ""Allahu Akhbar"" ""workplace violence.""Despite Army denials, desertion charges appear likely and imminent in the case of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who walked away from his combat post in Afghanistan.The White House line that we traded five Taliban generals for him because ""we leave no man behind"" is wearing thin. We do and should leave deserters behind, and if we ever get our hands on them, their fate is usually not a happy one. Neither should Bergdahl's be.The administration believes that its trade for the five Taliban leaders — who are eligible to return to the battlefield in three months, and one of whom has already phoned his old terrorist pals — could still possibly be explained away as a well-intentioned mistake.At the time, Bergdahl was said to be in bad health, and he hadn't been officially charged with anything. And besides, the Taliban is not a terrorist group.That's now the official line by an administration that let Marine Andrew Tahmooressi rot in a Mexican jail because he took the wrong exit but that sees nothing wrong in rescuing a deserter in time of war while strengthening an enemy that has cost America much in lives and treasure.We can't be trading terrorists for a turncoat if the Taliban is not a terrorist organization. They're an ""armed insurgency,"" as White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz explained.IS is a terrorist group but the Taliban is not, making it lawful to deal with them.Never mind that this administration does not consider the Islamic State either Islamic or a state.By their fruits ye shall know them, except in the Obama administration. To explain this distinction without a difference, press secretary Josh Earnest said, ""(The Taliban) do carry out tactics that are akin to terrorism, they do pursue terror attacks in an effort to try to advance their agenda.""But they are not a terrorist group, Earnest insists, because the Taliban, unlike al-Qaida, ""have been principally focused on Afghanistan.""So you can commit terrorist acts but not be a terrorist group as long as your terror tactics are employed within the same ZIP code.Never mind that it was the Taliban that let al-Qaida use Afghanistan as a sanctuary and base camp to plan and launch the 9/11 terrorist attacks on America.Pressed on the issue of a terrorist designation, Earnest acknowledged that while the Taliban is not on the State Department list of terrorist groups, they are on a Treasury Department list of ""specially designated global terrorists"" dating back to a 2002 executive order.That doesn't count, Earnest claims, because it was done just to put financial sanctions on Taliban leaders.We suspect that the White House is tap-dancing because it knows there's a statute on the books saying that giving material aid and comfort to a terrorist organization is a federal crime.Giving aid and comfort includes providing the terrorist group human assets in the form of five of its top commanders. These aren't mere foot soldiers in the terrorists' war on the West: They are hardened leaders who, someday, with their enhanced knowledge of the U.S., may do something horrible to innocent Americans.That they were swapped for a deserter only makes it worse: It would be an impeachable offense. We don't expect impeachment to happen, but we do expect the word games to stop and the truth to be told.

2816,TAP,"The stock of Epam Systems (EPAM) climbed back sharply above the 50-day moving average Friday, a positive step as it shapes a new base.The stock is forming a flat base with a potential buy point at 52.99. The new base is part of a base-on-base formation that's been taking shape for nearly a year.Much of the latest base has formed below the 50-day moving average, which is a drawback.Epam is based in Newtown, Pa., but for all intents and purposes is a foreign company. Epam provides outsourcing services for the information technology industry with an army of more than 11,000 IT professionals and operations in North America, Europe, China and Australia.That includes the Commonwealth of Independent States and, yes, Ukraine, the center of an armed struggle between the pro-Western government and pro-Russian rebels.Analysts aren't necessarily worried.In December, Jefferies lauded the company's potential to tap Western European businesses, which are embracing more IT services offshoring. Jefferies also said Epam is well positioned to capitalize on favorable trends in the financial, health care and retail sectors.In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Epam said sanctions against Russia have restricted some business activities. But it added, ""We believe these sanctions do not prevent us from providing our services to our customers.""Epam is a leader in IBD's technology services industry group. For the most recently reported quarter, it had the highest sales growth among the 44 companies in the group. Sales growth accelerated in the most recent quarters, too.Epam's EPS increase of 40% for the third quarter was fifth highest of the group, including some thinly traded stocks that did better. The growth rate for earnings also has been in an improving trend for about two years.

2826,TAP,"Cavium has gone from a specialty niche designer of network security processors 14 years ago to a mainstream player challenging the likes of Intel, Broadcom and Freescale Semiconductor.The San Jose, Calif.-based chipmaker now provides system-on-a-chip microprocessors that are used in a variety of markets and applications, including networking, communications, consumer and broadband. Analysts say its increasingly diverse product offerings are driving growth.On Wednesday, Cavium (CAVM) for the first time surpassed the $100 million mark in revenue for one quarter, posting a 25% year-over-year gain of $101 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. It reported a 32% year-over-year jump in earnings per share, ex items, of 42 cents. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast EPS minus items of 41 cents on $100 million in revenue.Cavium CEO Syed Ali said in a conference call with analysts late Wednesday that 2015 is expected to be a ""signature year"" for the company, after rolling out ""bold"" strategies in 2012 and 2013 for new lines of products.""This will be the single biggest year of new product introductions in our history,"" Ali said in the call.In the most recent quarter, 91% of the company's sales came from the enterprise and service provider market, with 9% derived from the broadband segment, Cavium Chief Financial Officer Arthur Chadwick said on the call.Pushing Into New MarketsAlthough the enterprise network and data center segment has historically been Cavium's largest for revenue, its efforts to diversify should begin to show results, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said in a research report Thursday.""We believe a rapid diversification in the enterprise segment into an increasing number of customers, coupled with a more recent entry into new markets, should provide Cavium with growth opportunities in excess of its peers,"" Vinh said in the report.FBR Capital Markets analyst Christopher Rolland said in a research note Thursday that Cavium's ""innovative design team, solid pipeline of new products and ability to increasingly tap into a fast-growing hyperscale customer base should provide a solid backdrop of growth for the next few years.""Rolland, who hiked his target price to $68 from $65 a day after Cavium reported Q4 earnings, expects a huge, long-term market opportunity as it increasingly expands beyond network processors to challenge Intel (INTC) for the microprocessors that control switches and routers. Combined, the potential opportunities could result in an ultimate addressable market 50 times its current market, Rolland said.Analysts expect Cavium to generate $449 million in revenue this year, up 20% from 2014. Earnings per share minus items are expected to jump 26% to $1.85.Cavium's core portfolio of embedded and security processor products for wireless, security and data center markets is expected to drive 20% revenue growth rates this year and into 2016, Canaccord Genuity analyst Matthew Ramsey told IBD.Stock Market GainerAnalysts' forecast for double-digit-percentage revenue growth, coupled with Cavium's track record of nine straight quarters of double-digit revenue and earnings growth, have helped push the stock up 64% over the past 12 months. It jumped nearly 5% on Thursday.Cavium has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99 and a Relative Strength Rating of 96. The Composite Rating factors in a variety of metrics, such as earnings growth and stock-price gains. The Relative Strength Rating of 96 puts Cavium stock among the top 4% of all stocks in performance over the past 12 months.Mobile And Social PullCavium expects to close a $90 million acquisition of Silicon Valley-based Xpliant during the current quarter, adding to its network switching capabilities.Several analysts, including Ramsey and William Blair's Anil Doradla, say the network switching market has the potential to be Cavium's next $100 million product category.Cavium management says Xpliant's expertise in Ethernet switch chips, combined with its own infrastructure technology, enables it to tap the market by addressing the need for increased capacity for both networking infrastructure and data centers. The need is driven by steep growth of mobile applications and social networking.Global mobile data traffic is expected to see a compound annual growth rate of 61% between 2013 and 2018, while cloud data center IP traffic will grow at a 30% rate, according to Cisco's Visual Networking Index and Global Cloud Index.Ali said in Wednesday's conference call that Xpliant's chips offer fully programmable architecture designed to keep up with the rapid pace of today's networks.""So switchers can adapt to network requirements in weeks, not years, as with previous chips,"" Ali said. ""It allows switch equipment providers to create multiple products from one hardware platform and to update products on the fly to provide new capabilities.""Cavium faces rivals such as Broadcom (BRCM), Intel and Freescale Semiconductor (FSL) .Among new products on tap is Cavium's ThunderX line of processor chips. They are based on ARM Holdings (ARMH) architecture and aimed at data center server and cloud markets, which will compete with Intel's Xeon product line, analysts say.Ramsey says Cray's (CRAY) plans to work with Cavium to use ThunderX processors in its computing systems for the high-performance, supercomputer market illustrate a ""solid early endorsement.""Ali said the increasing number of high visibility security breaches is accelerating the need to secure all networked infrastructure.""These trends are driving continued strong momentum in the securities segment for our products,"" Ali said.Cavium is also rolling out its Octeon III chips for broadband applications and LiquidIO II server adapters for the data center and cloud, among other new products.Ali says Cavium delivered 23% year-over-year top-line revenue growth for all of 2014, and 42% year-over-year non-GAAP earnings growth, gaining market share in both existing networking, communication and security markets, as well as some new markets.Cavium guided Q1 revenue to $101.5 million at the midpoint and EPS ex items of 38-40 cents. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see $101.6 million, up 22% year over year, and EPS of 39 cents, up 30%.The company expects ""traditional seasonal softness"" in the service provider market in Q1, Ali said, especially in wireless infrastructure, with the soft 4G environment partially offset by continued strength in 3G markets.""On the flip side, we expect another quarter of sequential growth in our enterprise and data center market,"" Ali said.

2830,TAP,"Data disclosed last week indicated the housing recovery is on track. That may lift homebuilders such as D.R. Horton (DHI), which leads off a busy week in which five homebuilders are slated to report quarterly performance.Homebuilders are trying to rebound after earnings and revenue growth weakened in the back half of 2014 amid market uncertainty.D.R. Horton, which bills itself as ""America's Builder"" and is the largest in the group by annual revenue, will release first-quarter financial results Monday before the market opens.The consensus of analysts is for a 2-cent drop in earnings per share to 34 cents. Investors hope Horton can reverse that to a beat after missing analysts' EPS estimates the prior two quarters.Revenue is projected to rise 27.2% to $2.075 billion.D.R. Horton stock is bouncing back from a failed breakout with a 26.04 buy point. It's trading below its 50-day but finding support at its 200-day line. Horton closed down 2.5% Friday to 23.10.PulteGroup (PHM) is set to announce Q4 earnings Thursday before the market opens.Wall Street expects the builder of single-family homes, condos, townhouses and duplexes to report a 17-cent drop in EPS to 40 cents. Investors will be looking for a repeat of the prior quarter's results when Pulte reported better than expected EPS.Revenue is projected to grow 6.5% to $1.76 billion.Pulte shares moved sideways for most of 2014, trading in a narrow range. Like Horton, it tried to break out early this year but retreated and was trading back in the range Friday. It closed Friday off 1% to 20.69.Smaller peers MDC Holdings (MDC), Ryland (RYL) and Beazer Homes (BZH) will also report results, opening a window onto housing prospects this year.MDC is scheduled to release Q4 earnings Wednesday. Ryland will announce Q4 Thursday, and Beazer is on tap to release fiscal Q1 earnings Friday.Bullish signs are popping up for homebuilders. The Census Bureau said last week that December housing starts beat estimates, rising 4.4% to an annualized 1.098 million units and lifting 2014 to the strongest overall year since 2007.Single-family home permits rose 4.5% in December to an annual rate of 667,000, the strongest monthly gain of 2014.In another sign the housing recovery is on track, the share of homeowners whose loans are underwater fell to the lowest point since the number peaked in the second quarter 2012, according to housing market tracker RealtyTrac.However, Lennar (LEN), which builds single-family homes in 17 states, on Jan. 15 reported higher earnings per share, but revenue growth fell short of estimates. And Lennar said it expects lower profit margins this year amid rising costs.KB Home (KBH) also reported a revenue gain on Jan. 13, but EPS fell 9.7% and was half what Wall Street expected.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

2879,TAP,"The deal is set to close by the end of the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approval. Atlanta-based Newell Rubbermaid — whose brands include Rubbermaid, Paper Mate and baby-products manufacturers Graco and Aprica — said it expects the deal to begin boosting its normalized earnings per share in the first year.
"
2880,TAP,"Shares dipped 0.6% on the stock market today. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 88 and is a member of IBD's Household-Appliances Wares group, ranked 41 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks.
"
2881,TAP,"""Baby Jogger has a great track record of growth and innovation, and their City Mini, City Select and other sub-brands in the premium stroller category are perfect complements to our Graco stroller business,"" Newell Rubbermaid CEO Michael Polk said in a press release.
"
2882,TAP,"""Baby Jogger sells its products in more than 70 countries around the world and will help us transform Newell Rubbermaid into a larger, faster growing, more global and more profitable company.""

"
2884,TAP,"Baby Jogger was founded in 1984, debuting a stroller that parents could push more easily while they jogged. The company now makes a variety of strollers designed to fold up quickly and handle smooth and rougher terrains.
"
2885,TAP,"The deal follows Graco Children's Products' recall last month of 4.9 million strollers in North America, affecting 11 Graco and Century models made over the past 14 years, due to children's injuries reportedly caused by a folding hinge.
"
2886,TAP,"Graco said that it has received six reports of finger amputations, four reports of partial-fingertip laceration and one report of a finger laceration due to the hinge.
"
2887,TAP,"The November recall comes after Graco in July agreed to recall 1.9 million infant car seats due to reports of difficulties opening the harness buckles, which can stick if food or other debris accumulates in them.
"
2888,TAP,"That recall followed a months-long dispute between Graco and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which urged Graco to recall the infant seats. It also followed a recall earlier this year of 4.2 million toddler seats due to similar problems in the buckles.

2899,TAP,"Personal Finance Action Plan For 2015
"
2900,TAP,"To position yourself for success as a financial adviser in 2015, you're determined to deliver exceptional service to your clients. That's a good start.
"
2901,TAP,"Aaron Hasler, a consultant who helps financial advisers boost their business and think strategically, says the following ideas should be among the top 10 financial tips for advisers in 2015.
"
2902,TAP,"Reaching out to clients' heirs will open even more doors for financial advisers in the new year, says Hasler, a managing partner at Finetooth Consulting in Minneapolis.
"
2903,TAP,"Most of his clients have annual production of $750,000 to $2 million. By strengthening relationships with your clients' families, you can propel your firm to new heights.
"
2904,TAP,"IBD: What's the most important advice you're giving advisers on how to grow in 2015?
"
2905,TAP,"Hasler: When I ask advisers, ""Who's your target market?"" they usually say, ""Retirees"" or ""Pre-retirees."" Then I ask, ""Have you communicated with the children of your clients?"" Most say, ""Oh, I send them my newsletter."" You should be doing more.
"
2906,TAP,"IBD: Like what?
"
2907,TAP,"Hasler: Roll out simpler services at lower cost that target the inheritors of your client's wealth. Say your clients are a couple in their 60s with a son in his 30s who's married and having his first kid. Offer the son a subscription planning service in which you deliver a written financial plan, provide one 90-minute meeting a year and a defined set of services to answer his financial questions. You might charge $75 to $200 a month to provide such a service.
"
2908,TAP,"IBD: Are advisers taking your advice to expand outreach to their clients' heirs?
"
2909,TAP,"Hasler: When I tell a 60-year-old adviser, ""Your business is worth $750,000 less than you think it is,"" I sometimes get a blank stare. They may find excuses not to work with inheritors of their clients' wealth.
"
2910,TAP,"They might say, ""I don't have time to invest in the business"" or ""I'm not as comfortable working with younger clients"" or ""My clients' children will automatically join me later on.""
"
2911,TAP,"IBD: What kind of investment in the business do you propose?
"
2912,TAP,"Hasler: You may want to hire a junior partner or planner who can work with clients' heirs and review their financial goals. Say you're an adviser in your 50s and you have $750,000 in revenue. Hiring a 30-year-old associate partner at a $50,000 salary plus incentives can help you increase revenue by targeting second-generation clients while you focus on the top end of your practice.
"
2913,TAP,"IBD: Why is 2015 an opportune time to make this investment?
"
2914,TAP,"Hasler: Now is the time to invest in your business before we see a market correction. Your business might be at a peak right now. It makes sense to grow your non-market dependent, fee-based revenue so you're better positioned for a correction. It's also good succession planning: The right junior partner can potentially be the buyer of your practice. You want to protect your clients and assure them that if something happens to you, someone on your team can take over. Plus, younger partners can add new ideas and tap their network and bring new clients into your practice.
"
2915,TAP,"IBD: When advisers assure you their clients' kids will come on board later, how do you respond?
"
2916,TAP,"Hasler: Given the increasing presence of robo advisers, you want to create relationships with younger people now, before they go to one of those services. You want to capture them before robo advisers capture them.
"
2917,TAP,"IBD: How about growth by acquiring other practices? Is that a viable strategy for 2015?
"
2918,TAP,"Hasler: I get calls every week from advisers who say: ""I want to grow. Any practices for sale?"" The general statistic is there are 40 buyers for every one seller of a practice.
"
2919,TAP,"IBD: Looking ahead, what pitfalls lurk for advisers?
"
2920,TAP,"Hasler: One thing to watch for in 2015 is we've heard rumblings for years about a uniform fiduciary standard for advisers and brokers — a standard that the SEC has tried to create. We may see regulators try again to find a strategy that will hold advisers and brokers under the same standard. If successful, this could cause confusion among clients and have a negative impact on our industry.
"
2921,TAP,"IBD: Any other issues you're tracking?
"
2922,TAP,"Hasler: A revisit of the conversation around disclosure on advisers' transition packages. Versions of this FINRA proposal have been discussed in which advisers would need to disclose to clients how much they received as part of a transition package to move from one investment firm to another. Stay tuned to your local advocacy group so that you're aware of this issue. You may want to make your voice heard.
"
2923,TAP,"IBD: You mentioned robo services. How can advisers gird for increasing competition from these low-cost offerings?
"
2924,TAP,"Hasler: Be prepared to answer a question that more clients will be asking: Why wouldn't I go with a robo adviser to save so much in fees? Fee compression is becoming more of an issue because advisers have to provide a certain amount of service, and it's expensive to do that. In 2015, you want to think about identifying the services you'll provide and balancing profitability versus service.
"
2925,TAP,"IBD: Any tips on how to cut costs without sacrificing service?
"
2926,TAP,"Hasler: Sit down and review the technology you're using today. Identify one or two pieces of software you don't utilize to its fullest and commit to better utilization. On average, we underutilize the technology that we currently subscribe to.
"
2927,TAP,"Increase your efficiency by challenging yourself and your team to better use technology. If it's outdated, replace it with better tools.Personal Finance Action Plan For 2015To position yourself for success as a financial adviser in 2015, you're determined to deliver exceptional service to your clients.

2941,TAP,"While the dollar has rallied by more than 20% from its lows,1 valuations appear anything but stretched in our view. In the long run, exchange rates reach equilibrium due to slower-moving macroeconomic factors that cycle between relative advantages. However, currencies are also prone to overshooting these norms. As one currency rises in value compared to another, the attractive elements of the economy slow down, resulting in an adjustment of the exchange rate. For this reason, currencies tend to cycle over time. We believe that previous drivers of dollar appreciation may also be driving dollar strength in the current period. 
"
2942,TAP,"As we show in the chart below, over the last 30 years, we have identified two distinct periods of secular appreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar. From June 1980 through March 1985, the dollar appreciated by more than 52% before policy makers negotiated its retracement.2 From July 1995 through February 2002, the dollar rose by nearly 33%.3 Today, the dollar is trading just above its 20-year average.4 Secular Bull and Bear Markets in the U.S. Dollar J.P. Morgan Real Broad Effective Exchange Rate U.S. Dollar, 12/31/79-11/30/14  
"
2943,TAP,"1980s Under Federal Reserve (Fed) chairman Paul Volcker, the dollar surged in the early 1980s as the U.S. aggressively hikedinterest rates to bring inflation under control. In two years, inflation had fallen by more than 10% to more normalized levels.5 With the precipitous fall in prices, the U.S. offered investors some of the highest real interest rates in the world. As a result, international capital continued to flow into the U.S., driving up the value of the dollar. However, this capital flow continued even after the Fed reversed course and began to cut rates. After a nearly 50% rise in value against other major currencies by 1985, U.S. exports began to come under considerable pressure. After modest current account surpluses to start the decade, the current account plunged to a deficit of 3.5% of GDP, an unheard of level at that time.6 In one of the most significant forms of international financial coordination in the modern era, the period of dollar strength ended with the signing of the Plaza Accord, which set up the dollar's precipitous revaluation. 
"
2944,TAP,"1990s—2000s In the second dollar bull market that we identified, the dollar appreciated against European currencies and the yen by approximately 5% per year from '95—'02.7 The primary driver during this period, however, was an increase in U.S. labor productivity compared to the rest of the world. During one of the most prolonged periods of real economic growth in the U.S. since World War II, monetary policy remained accommodative while U.S. manufacturing and the booming technology sector drove growth. With the economy strong, inflation subdued and borrowing costs low, the U.S. government was able to run a primary budget surplus. Ultimately, this move culminated with the bursting of the tech bubble and a decline in U.S. manufacturing. The U.S. economy eventually slipped into a recession following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. 
"
2945,TAP,"Present Looking at the period since spring 2011, we believe that the next period of secular appreciation in the U.S. dollar may be upon us. At the start of this rally, the viability of the eurozone was being called into question. Previously, many viewed the euro as a strong competitor to the U.S. dollar as a new reserve currency of the world. However, questions arose about whether the eurozone could continue to function as a monetary union without becoming a full-fledged Fiscal union as well. With technorats riding to the euro's rescue, the dollar dipped from its trend of appreciation. In August 2011, Standard & Poor's downgraded the credit rating of the U.S. for the first time in history. In a perverse response, the dollar strengthened, and U.S. Treasury yields declined. Going forward, we believe continued dollar strength may be driven primarily by a combination of the factors that drove dollar strength in the mid-'80s and '90s: higher real interest rates and stronger economic growth. In recent years, the dollar has appreciated as global investors sought to tap into U.S. growth via stock and bonds. 
"
2946,TAP,"With volatility in markets increasing through the end of 2014, we believe many investors will continue to look at different ways to manage risk in their portfolios. In our view, a long-dollar strategy could be one way to reduce risk during uncertain markets. Should our thesis prove correct, we believe the value of the U.S. dollar could appreciate against a basket of foreign currencies in the coming year.

As we show in the chart below, over the last 30 years, we have identified two distinct periods of secular appreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar. From June 1980 through March 1985, the dollar appreciated by more than 52% before policy makers negotiated its retracement.2 From July 1995 through February 2002, the dollar rose by nearly 33%.3 Today, the dollar is trading just above its 20-year average.4 Secular Bull and Bear Markets in the U.S. Dollar J.P. Morgan Real Broad Effective Exchange Rate U.S. Dollar, 12/31/79-11/30/14  1980s Under Federal Reserve (Fed) chairman Paul Volcker, the dollar surged in the early 1980s as the U.S. aggressively hikedinterest rates to bring inflation under control. In two years, inflation had fallen by more than 10% to more normalized levels.5 With the precipitous fall in prices, the U.S. offered investors some of the highest real interest rates in the world. As a result, international capital continued to flow into the U.S., driving up the value of the dollar. However, this capital flow continued even after the Fed reversed course and began to cut rates. After a nearly 50% rise in value against other major currencies by 1985, U.S. exports began to come under considerable pressure. After modest current account surpluses to start the decade, the current account plunged to a deficit of 3.5% of GDP, an unheard of level at that time.6 In one of the most significant forms of international financial coordination in the modern era, the period of dollar strength ended with the signing of the Plaza Accord, which set up the dollar's precipitous revaluation. 1990s—2000s In the second dollar bull market that we identified, the dollar appreciated against European currencies and the yen by approximately 5% per year from '95—'02.7 The primary driver during this period, however, was an increase in U.S. labor productivity compared to the rest of the world. During one of the most prolonged periods of real economic growth in the U.S. since World War II, monetary policy remained accommodative while U.S. manufacturing and the booming technology sector drove growth. With the economy strong, inflation subdued and borrowing costs low, the U.S. government was able to run a primary budget surplus. Ultimately, this move culminated with the bursting of the tech bubble and a decline in U.S. manufacturing. The U.S. economy eventually slipped into a recession following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Present Looking at the period since spring 2011, we believe that the next period of secular appreciation in the U.S. dollar may be upon us. At the start of this rally, the viability of the eurozone was being called into question. Previously, many viewed the euro as a strong competitor to the U.S. dollar as a new reserve currency of the world. However, questions arose about whether the eurozone could continue to function as a monetary union without becoming a full-fledged Fiscal union as well. With technorats riding to the euro's rescue, the dollar dipped from its trend of appreciation. In August 2011, Standard & Poor's downgraded the credit rating of the U.S. for the first time in history. In a perverse response, the dollar strengthened, and U.S. Treasury yields declined. Going forward, we believe continued dollar strength may be driven primarily by a combination of the factors that drove dollar strength in the mid-'80s and '90s: higher real interest rates and stronger economic growth. In recent years, the dollar has appreciated as global investors sought to tap into U.S. growth via stock and bonds. With volatility in markets increasing through the end of 2014, we believe many investors will continue to look at different ways to manage risk in their portfolios. In our view, a long-dollar strategy could be one way to reduce risk during uncertain markets. Should our thesis prove correct, we believe the value of the U.S. dollar could appreciate against a basket of foreign currencies in the coming year. 1 Sources: J.P. Morgan, Bloomberg.

2970,TAP,"Psychological Vs. Fundamental
"
2971,TAP,"Solar and oil are sometimes correlated in periods of market distress, but Baribeau sees no fundamental correlation. Natural gas and coal would be ""more relevant metrics"" because those fuels account for considerably more electricity generation worldwide, he said.
"
2972,TAP,"""We have never liked the psychological correlation between solar stocks and oil, but it exists to some degree,"" Baribeau said.
"
2973,TAP,"Rive said natural gas and coal may have more of an effect on the cost of electricity than oil, but in the end the cost has less to do with the actual fuel source and more with the infrastructure required. Natural gas prices have dropped, for instance, but electricity prices haven't declined in unison, Rive said.
"
2974,TAP,"""It's mainly in transmission and distribution — the aging infrastructure that has been around for 100 years that needs to be upgraded,"" Rive said. ""Those upgrades far exceed any of the benefits that you're gaining from the low cost of natural gas.""
"
2975,TAP,"To illustrate the point that virtually no oil is used to create electricity, Rive said if oil dives to $50, it would still have almost zero effect on the cost of electricity.
"
2976,TAP,"""But the opposite is true, too,"" Rive said. ""If oil went up to $150, it would also have almost zero effect on the cost of electricity. What moves the cost of electricity is transmission and distribution infrastructure. It's definitely not oil.""

"
2978,TAP,"The dropoff in oil prices also could slow the shift to natural gas vehicle fleets, from cars and buses to garbage trucks. That means more natural gas for electricity-fired plants, which already have benefited from a rise in natural gas production.
"
2979,TAP,"Analysts and solar executives see another reason for the drop in solar stocks in line with oil stocks. Some mutual funds and exchange traded funds hold both solar and oil company shares.

2997,TAP,"After it spins off from eBay in 2015, PayPal will face a brace of challenges, three of which go by the names Apple, Alibaba and Google.Apple (AAPL) has entered mobile transactions with Apple Pay, a payment app that piggybacks on existing credit card and bank networks.China e-commerce leader Alibaba Group's (BABA) affiliated payments business Alipay plans to expand outside China and increasingly threatens PayPal in world markets.Google Wallet, Google's (GOOGL) payment service, looms as another competitor.Other rivals, including WePay and 2Checkout, also are nipping at PayPal's heels against a backdrop of fast-changing payments technologies.""Not only is PayPal going head-to-head with other mobile wallet providers such as ApplePay, Google Wallet, CurrentC and SoftCard, but the banks and their co-branded partners (retailers, airlines, hotels) are coming out with their own mobile apps that incorporate and create an advantage for their co-branded Visa (V) or MasterCard (MA) card,"" Phil Philliou, a former MasterCard executive and CEO of TruBeacon, told IBD.""The good news is that we are all chasing a multitrillion-transaction pool, and any percentage of it is meaningful,"" Philliou said. TruBeacon is developing mobile apps that incorporate Visa or MasterCard credit and debit cards directly into the app.Apple Pay uses a tap-to-pay technology in which iPhone owners touch or wave their devices at specially equipped store registers to transmit a secure digital ""token"" that represents — but doesn't carry — the customer's credit card account data. More than 20,000 U.S. stores already accept Apple Pay.Analysts say that Apple Pay's convenience, security and reach can undermine PayPal's efforts in mobile. PayPal's mobile tap-to-pay offerings are seen as limited compared with Apple Pay. And the eBay (EBAY) unit's plans to branch into offline point-of-sale transactions have fallen short, according to some analysts.Alipay boasts more than 300 million users in China and serves as the main payments platform for Alibaba's e-commerce websites Taobao and Tmall. Analysts estimate that Alibaba, which launched a U.S. website this year, has 75% to 80% of China's e-commerce market. PayPal, in comparison, has 157 million active users worldwide.So Alipay has more users, but PayPal has a far wider global footprint. It has ties with 15,000 financial institutions worldwide, is offered in 203 geographic markets and accepts payments for PayPal accounts in 26 currencies.PayPal's Q3 revenue jumped 20% year-over-year in Q3, powering eBay's 12% overall increase.Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt said in a December research report that PayPal would continue to grab market share after its spinoff from eBay.Alibaba founder Jack Ma spun off Alipay from Alibaba in 2011 but controls Alipay through a stake in Alipay's holding company, Ant Financial Services Group.Ma said in a Nov. 11 interview with China's state TV network that Ant Financial ""will definitely go public,"" possibly in China.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Cheng Cheng said in a recent report that Alipay could expand beyond online payments into financial services such as wealth management and payroll services. Cheng values Ant Financial, whose main business is Alipay, at about $70 billion.Analysts say that Alipay can make inroads in global markets where PayPal's presence is still limited, such as Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and Africa.It's also possible that Alibaba will opt to cooperate rather than compete with PayPal in some markets. Alibaba Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai reportedly said last month that Alibaba would consider working with PayPal to expand its payment options for Chinese consumers. He said they would be interested in doing the same with Apple Pay.""If you look at (Alipay's) footprint of being the largest online payment company in China, and Pay Pal's position of having a very good international position not just in the U.S. but also in some other countries, these are some complementary footprints,"" Tsai told Bloomberg.

3020,TAP,"Constellation Brands' (STZ) Q2 earnings growth is expected to moderate as the boost from its Grupo Modelo acquisition last year fades.Wall Street forecasts earnings per share of $1.15, up 20% from a year earlier, when the beer and liquor company reports Thursday. The 20% rise would be smaller than the EPS growth of 182%, 72% and 75% in prior three quarters.Revenue is projected to rise 12.5% to $1.64 billion, in large part on strong beer sales.Constellation, which bought Grupo Modelo's U.S. operations from Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) in June 2013, has beaten the analyst consensus on earnings for four quarters in a row and on revenue for three quarters.But Constellation carries a heavy debt load, amounting to $7.2 billion at the end of May, from a series of acquisitions amid a consolidation wave in the beer industry.If Constellation doesn't get its debt under control, the debt could impact the firm's earnings and its ability to continue growing via acquisitions. And the buyout environment is heating up on recent reports that Anheuser-Busch is eyeing SABMiller, whose bid to buy Heineken was rejected.Among Constellation's top brands are Corona and Modelo Especial beers, Robert Mondavi and Clos du Bois wines, Svedka vodka and Black Velvet Canadian Whiskey.The company's wine and spirits sales fell 1% last quarter, while beer sales jumped 14%.That jump easily beat the import beer category and overall U.S. beer market. It led Constellation to revise its EPS guidance upward for fiscal 2015, which ends next February. The company sees full-year EPS of $4.10-$4.25 vs. its prior view for $3.95-$4.15.""Our beer business is on fire,"" Constellation CEO Rob Sands said on a July earnings call with analysts.Shares of Constellation, whose stock is on the IBD 50 list of top-rated stocks, rose less than 1% in Tuesday afternoon trading on the stock market today.Anheuser-Busch was up fractionally Tuesday afternoon, as was Molson Coors Brewing (TAP), maker of Coors beer.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

3051,TAP,"LifeLock, a provider of identity theft protection services, is poised for continued growth on the heels of recently released pricing packages and a new online application that could help it reach a younger audience.Concerns about cybersecurity are intensifying in the wake of data breaches at Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and elsewhere, and are likely to keep motivating more people and companies to pursue the kinds of protections that LifeLock (LOCK) sells, says Mike Matousek, a trader at U.S. Global Investors.""A good motivator sometimes for people to invest is fear, and (LifeLock) has good solutions to quell people's fear,"" Matousek told IBD. ""People are worried; they don't know what's lurking .. . so more people looking for protection is a probably going to be a driver"" of continued sales growth for LifeLock.The Tempe, Ariz.-based company recently reported third-quarter net income of $5.7 million. Excluding special costs, it produced earnings per share of 16 cents on revenue of $123 million, up from 12 cents per share on sales of $96 million a year earlier.For the fourth quarter, company executives projected EPS of 26 cents to 27 cents on revenue ranging from $127 million to $129 million. In the final quarter of 2013, LifeLock produced EPS of 22 cents on sales of $102 million.Improved Security At A PriceLifeLock in July starting selling new premium levels of security packages to its then 3.4 million customers. LifeLock did not respond to an interview request, but CEO Todd Davis said on the company's earnings conference call in October that initial reaction to the new offerings was ""solid.""He said that the company's consumer segment powered revenue growth, with such sales in the third quarter up 31% from a year earlier. The segment accounted for 94% of LifeLock's business and the enterprise segment the rest.The company, Davis said, added roughly 264,000 new customers in the quarter. More than 40% signed up for one of the premium offerings, helping to bolster revenue.""We are still optimizing the messaging and rolling the new offerings through the channel. But we're quite pleased with the performance so far,"" Davis said.The newer offerings include personalized activity alerts on credit card, checking and savings account transactions.LifeLock Advantage alerts customers about unusual transactions by text or email for $19.99 a month. LifeLock Ultimate Plus, at $29.99 per month, provides financial alerts and messages customers on their brokerage and retirement accounts. These protections are triggered when withdrawals, purchases or balance transfers exceed pre-set personalized limits.With each level up in protection packages, customers also get greater levels of insurance on stolen wallets and cash. The Ultimate Plus package provides coverage up to $1,000 and $300 for lost cash.A more basic package, LifeLock Standard, continues to sell for $9.99 per month. It warns consumers of signs that a criminal may be trying to open a new financial account with the customer's name and Social Security Number. The higher levels also provide this service.""(We) are seeing about 1 million transactions a week coming through these consumer offerings,"" Davis said.He added that LifeLock is beta-testing a new privacy-monitoring service that the company hopes will connect it to more potential customers. LifeLock Privacy Monitor helps consumers find their personal information on people-search websites and in Internet-based advertising companies' databases. Clients can then opt out of or remove their information from those databases, he said.""The amount of data collected today is exploding as consumers increasingly live their lives online, and consumers are looking for a solution to help them take back control of their personal information and protect their identity,"" Davis said on the earnings call. ""This beta offering is currently free for consumers and will be used as a tool to drive traffic and engagement with LifeLock as we look to enhance and extend our leadership in the identity theft protection marketplace.""Going MobileAdditionally, this fall, LifeLock relaunched its mobile wallet application for major mobile app stores,Apple's (AAPL) App Store and Google's (GOOGL) Android app store Google Play, as another way to reach prospective and potentially younger customers. It provides free services such as digital copies of payment and identification cards for access on smartphones, and the ability to reach LifeLock's paid services.""The technology piece is important, but you have to think of this more as a channel to new subscribers,"" Sterne Agee analyst Robert Breza said in an interview.He says that the typical LifeLock customer has been over 50 years of age with a substantial amount of wealth to protect. But the world is changing quickly thanks to mobile technology, giving LifeLock opportunities to tap into a younger and broader realm of customers.""So it is about trying to appeal to that person who is 30 or maybe 35 years old, who is more technically savvy and who is putting everything into his or her phone"" and wants protection on that front, he said.The relaunch of the wallet app also confirmed to Wall Street that LifeLock could swiftly correct a substantial mistake that dogged it earlier this year. In May, a few months after the company paid nearly $43 million to acquire mobile wallet specialist Lemon — the initial source of the app — LifeLock removed the app from online stores after learning that it did not fully comply with payment card industry security standards.""They obviously had a tough lesson to learn,"" Breza said.LifeLock's management proved that it could learn quickly, he says, by updating the product for full compliance and re-launching the app in October, ahead of the year-end relaunch that some analysts had anticipated.""The management team is very sound,"" he added.Breza said that LifeLock is not trying to own the ""digital wallet"" space — which is populated by tech and finance giants — but can carve out a niche and ride the important mobile wave by partnering with the likes of Visa (V) or Apple and its Apple Pay.""It's about where the world is going,"" Breza said.LifeLock stock, recently trading around $17 per share, is up only about 8% so far this year. But it has risen about 25% over the past three months and is riding momentum that many on Wall Street think it could sustain into 2015.LifeLock gets a Composite Rating of 98 out of a possible 99 from IBD, taking into account factors such as earnings and stock-price growth.It has the second-highest Composite Rating in its industry group after Envestnet (ENV), a provider of investment technology for financial advisers, which gets a 99. The Financial Services-Specialty industry group, where both reside, is ranked No. 37 in performance among 197 that IBD tracks.Of eight analysts who cover LifeLock, Thomson Reuters reports three have a buy rating, two a strong buy and one a hold. The consensus average price target is 21.Given the company's growth trajectory, ""the stock is absolutely cheap,"" Breza said.

3062,TAP,"One clear winner on election night was energy. While the economy may have been voters' primary concern and the president's health care law second, energy issues played a key role, especially in those states that gave Republicans control of the Senate.It's a message that those newly elected senators, all of whom stressed their support for expanding energy development, aren't likely to forget. And it's one that Senate Majority Leader-elect Mitch McConnell, who repeatedly stressed his support for the Kentucky coal industry in his campaign, will push to the forefront.First should come the easy stuff. There is bipartisan support for approving the Keystone XL oil pipeline. President Obama has delayed this privately financed infrastructure project for several years, even though his own State Department determined that there would be no environmental damage. And Canada has been sending oil from Alberta to refineries in Illinois for four years through the first phases of the Keystone pipeline system.All the Keystone XL does is run a second pipeline from Alberta through Montana, connecting to the existing Keystone pipeline in Nebraska, and picking up 100,000 barrels a day in Montana while it's at it.Obama clearly does not want to approve the Keystone, or else he would have done it. But would he veto legislation approving it? Maybe, but there might be enough bipartisan support to override his veto. Many elected Democrats, seeing their colleagues booted out over failure to take a stand for energy, could be willing to buck the president on this issue.The second easy step is to allow crude oil and natural gas exports. In the mid-1970s, when U.S. oil and gas production was declining and gas lines were forming, Congress passed legislation prohibiting most crude oil and natural gas exports. Today, we have become the world's largest producer of natural gas and the top oil producer in a year or two. Indeed, our current problem is surpluses, not shortages.Ironically, the export ban covers crude oil, which you can't safely put in your gas tank, but there is no export ban on gasoline, which you can.There is bipartisan support for ending the export ban — Obama's secretary of energy even suggested it — and it would put the U.S. back in control of world energy policy, along with its foreign policy implications, for the first time in half a century.Third, the Obama administration should be pushed to approve more applications for drilling on federal land and offshore. Most of the drilling that has spurred several state economies has been on private or state-controlled land, where Washington has no say.But there are countless energy sources to tap on federal land and offshore that the administration has denied, stalled or slow-walked. Congress could help by passing legislation stipulating that drilling permits will be deemed approved unless the controlling agencies object within a specific amount of time.While those options would increase federal revenues and spur state economies and job growth, Congress should take a separate action that would save tax dollars: cut most or all of Obama's subsidies for renewable energy projects. Obama's clean-energy handouts have been an unmitigated disaster, so that words like ""Solyndra"" — a defunct solar energy company that cost taxpayers half a billion dollars — have become synonymous with waste and government incompetence.Where to start? The first step is to not reauthorize the Production Tax Credit (PTC) that provides billions of taxpayer dollars for wind turbines. The PTC died last year after 20 years of taxpayer life support, but there is a bipartisan effort to bring it back in the lame duck Congress.The Senate Finance Committee has already approved an $85.3 billion tax-extender bill that Congress is likely to take up in December.The bill provides $19.6 billion almost entirely for renewable energy projects, including $13.3 billion for the PTC. Congress should approve most of the extenders — with a promise of comprehensive tax reform soon — but drop the crony environmentalism.The U.S. has become the world's energy powerhouse; it's time to act like the global leader that we are. We have the technology to expand energy production, which would have the additional benefit of providing jobs, growing the economy and enhancing national security.Thanks to the election, we also have the elected representatives to get the job done. Matthews is a resident scholar with the Institute for Policy Innovation in Dallas.

3081,TAP,"ChipmakerSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) is poised to significantly expand its global presence as well as its profit margins over the next two years, according to an analyst report released late Monday.As Chinese telecom carriers transition from 2G phones to 3G smartphones and 4G LTE wireless broadband services for customers, Skyworks is likely to have a strong presence in what will be a big market.""We anticipate a growing global mix of LTE smartphones and Skyworks' share gains with leading Chinese OEMs should drive 15% plus sales growth into the smartphone market over the next two years,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley in a research report. ""The potential dollar content available for Skyworks increases from roughly 30 cents to 50 cents in a 2G phone to $2 to $3 in a lower-end 3G smartphone to $4 to $6 for a midtier LTE smartphone and to $10-plus for high-end global LTE smartphones,"" he said.Walkley increased his target price on Skyworks stock to 62 from 55, and reiterated a buy rating.Skyworks stock was flat, near 52, in midday trading in the stock market today, but shares are up more than 80% this year for a company that has been in the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks for weeks, as well as an IBD Leaderboard stock.""Given Skyworks' broad RFIC (radio frequency integrated circuit) portfolio and customer base, we believe Skyworks' diverse analog portfolio is enabling content share gains in its smartphone customer base,"" Walkley said. ""Further, we anticipate strong ongoing sales to Wi-Fi 802.11ac, wireless infrastructure, and the IoT (Internet of Things) markets should contribute to strong sales and improving margins.""The report was released after meetings with Don Palette, Skyworks' chief financial officer, at a Canaccord investor conference last week.The Woburn, Mass.-based company has a diverse portfolio of analog chips used in cars, broadband gear, cellular infrastructure, energy management, GPS devices, smartphones and tablets.Skyworks chips are used in the Apple (AAPL) iPhone and Samsung Galaxy F4 and F5, but recently its chip growth is being driven in part by fitness wearables, such as Philips ' (PHG) wearable technologies and wellness applications, and by home automation, JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna told IBD.""They're in a lot of new automobile applications,"" Gauna said. ""The automobile is so sensor-intensive now, with a lot of RF (radio frequency) and analog content that Skyworks can provide.""New product launches and an aggressive push into new markets have helped drive recent revenue growth. For its fiscal Q3 ended June 30, Skyworks posted year-over-year revenue growth of 35%, its biggest growth in more than three years.""While we understand investor concerns regarding slowing smartphone/handset unit sales growth, we believe investors do not fully appreciate Skyworks' diverse content opportunities, increasing mix of higher-margin integrated mobile solutions vs. stand-alone power amplifiers, and improving competitive position,"" Walkley said.Skyworks products, for instance, will help enable navigation-assist capabilities in some of next year's Volkswagen (VLKAY) models and will go into Ericsson's (ERIC) 4G LTE mobile broadband base stations. Skyworks chips are going into enhanced video-streaming applications for TV set-top boxes, Blu-ray/ DVD players and LED/4K television.Skyworks also sees promising opportunities in medical devices, gaming platforms and industrial markets.RELATED:Worldwide smartphone market grows in Q2.

"
3093,TAP,"It is no secret that President Obama has an image problem — at home and abroad. More importantly, we have serious security issues that in most cases are not being addressed.In the past several months, conflicts in Syria, Ukraine, Libya, Iraq and the Ebola epidemic have shifted public opinion sharply against the president, and polls show a majority of voters now disapprove of his handling of foreign affairs.But the damage is not limited to U.S. public opinion. It has clearly hurt Obama's image around the world.In order to reverse this trend, Obama must take substantial steps that demonstrate serious global leadership and commitment to sound policies that promote America's interests and global stability.Moreover, and more importantly, we will be a safer nation. One way to do that is by opening U.S. energy resources to development and achieving U.S. energy self-sufficiency.Does anyone believe that we would still be up to our eyeballs in Middle East sand if it were not for our dependence on the oil produced there? By fully committing the U.S. to being the global leader in energy production, we can help stem the source of terrorist funding and disrupt regimes that are hostile to our interests.Surging non-OPEC oil production (mostly from the U.S. and Canada) has sent oil prices falling. Due to a confluence of higher supply and projected lower demand, global oil prices are at their lowest in years. Economists predict that oil prices will remain well below $100 a barrel throughout the rest of this year.The news has sent oil-dependent oligarchs into panic mode. Repressive regimes in Russia, Venezuela and much of the Middle East depend on high oil prices to fund their government and import the goods that these petro-states can't produce themselves.Bloomberg estimated that Russia will require Brent oil prices to average $117.80 this year to balance its budget.Iran has one of the highest break-even prices, at $140 a barrel.Without oil as a club, Iran, Venezuela and other oil states are forced to cooperate with the international community — or risk losing power.In the 1980s, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia collaborated to significantly boost oil production, lowering oil prices and strangling the Soviet Union's economy. The oil-exporting Soviets suffered severe economic losses that soon toppled the communist regime.By putting in place policies that encourage energy development, Obama can limit the leverage of OPEC and Russia by weakening their influence on global energy markets and their global power. This win-win strategy requires no massive troop deployments or trillion-dollar budgets, all while boosting revenue and employment at home.Recent increases in U.S. oil production have mostly been driven by tight oil and shale energy development on private and state lands, outside the purview of federal policy.While it's unclear how long this shale revolution will last, we do know that we have additional massive energy resources that remain untapped.For example. Alaskan oil played a central role in boosting oil production in the 1980s strategy that helped undo the Soviet Union. The state has pumped more than 17 billion barrels of oil and still has significant resources available.The federal government estimates that offshore Alaska holds 27 billion barrels of oil and 132 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, nearly all of this in federally managed waters.Onshore, the Alaskan Arctic, including the federal National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, holds about 16 billion barrels of oil and 98 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.Russia, Norway and Canada are moving forward with aggressive programs to tap these prolific Arctic resources. Vladimir Putin has initiated a large-scale militarization of the Arctic with a goal of dominating it geopolitically and in terms of energy development.The U.S., meanwhile, has slow-rolled offshore Arctic exploration programs and our development of important regional infrastructure.Offshore, producers have been mired in a maze of regulatory and legal challenges that the Obama administration has been unwilling to resolve. Onshore, slow — or non-existent — leasing programs have put resources off-limits to development.The U.S. has the ability to reverse the Alaska shutout. The administration can easily resolve legal and regulatory challenges by streamlining permitting and putting forth flexible regulations that promote responsible energy development.By doing so, we will send a signal to Russia, OPEC and others that America's energy resurgence isn't a passing phase. We will lower our dependence on these oil suppliers and their ability to threaten us and Europe with higher prices.By opening Alaska and other resource-rich federal lands, Obama can demonstrate that the U.S. has a long-term plan to keep oil production high and oil imports low. These actions can be taken without committing troops to battle over oil.The U.S. has the resources and the wherewithal to lay the framework now for energy independence that will last well into the future. Obama can — and should — define his legacy as the president that secured America's energy security and by extension our security. Hunt is a Fox News military analyst with more than 29 years of military experience.

3095,TAP,"Anniversaries are often celebrated with toasts over raised drinks.
"
3096,TAP,"If any drink were in order when Constellation Brands (STZ) recently marked its anniversary of a game-changing acquisition, it would be beer — and a Mexican brand in particular.
"
3097,TAP,"A year ago this past weekend, Constellation Brands became full owner of Grupo Modelo's U.S. beer business in a $5.3 billion deal with Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD).
"
3098,TAP,"Victor, N.Y.-based Constellation essentially got the remaining 50% stake in Crown Imports that it didn't already own.
"
3099,TAP,"The deal included full U.S. rights to import, market and sell Mexican beers under the Modelo umbrella, including Corona Extra, Corona Light, Modelo Especial, Negra Modelo and Pacifico.
"
3100,TAP,"The transaction, which included a brewery, doubled the size of Constellation, which also operates wine and spirits segments.
"
3101,TAP,"It strengthened Constellation's position as the largest importer of beer in the U.S. and the country's third largest beer brewer and seller after Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors, a division of Molson Coors Brewing (TAP).
"
3102,TAP,"Constellation ""was a wine company before it imported beer, but they didn't own beer,"" said analyst Lauren Torres of HSBC Global Research. It ""now owns a brand (Grupo Modelo) with great equity in beer.""
"
3103,TAP,"Tops In Hops
"
3104,TAP,"Cheers go especially to Modelo Especial, Constellation's fastest-growing beer. Last year, U.S. shipments jumped 18%, reported Beer Marketer's Insights, making it the fastest-growing of the many beers that the beer-information provider tracks. Crown Imports' overall shipments were up nearly 6%.
"
3105,TAP,"That growth arrived despite declining sales of many other beers, including Bud Light, Budweiser, Coors Light, Miller Lite, Miller High Life and Busch. Overall U.S. beer shipments, excluding exports, slid 1.3% in 2013, said Beer Marketer's Insights, continuing a multiyear trend of declining volumes.
"
3106,TAP,"The economic downturn ""hit mainstream beer drinkers harder than wine or spirits markets,"" said Eric Shepard, editor of Beer Marketer's Insights' newsletter.
"
3107,TAP,"But Modelo and Corona aren't expected to slow down anytime soon, Shepard says. Modelo spiked fairly quickly over the last 18 months, he says, largely because it's a hit with Latinos, a large and fast-growing demographic in the U.S.
"
3108,TAP,"But, he says, Constellation's beer portfolio is reaching plenty of non-Latinos, including Millennials (the generation born from the early 1980s to the early 2000s).
"
3109,TAP,"This year through April 20, volume sales of Modelo Especial surged 25%, Constellation said, citing data from Information Resources (IRI). Pacifico logged an 11% gain. Corona Extra and Corona Light were up 9% and 5%, respectively, and Negra Modelo 7%.
"
3110,TAP,"For Pacifico, a new national web and social-media marketing campaign — the largest to date, called ""Yellow Caps,"" a play on the beer's bright yellow bottle caps — will roll out this summer. It will be supplemented by three TV ads on digital video, print ads in Southern California and spot TV ads in San Diego.
"
3111,TAP,"Corona is one of the biggest imported beers in the U.S. But the mature brand had lost some share to newer, lower-priced imports in the recession, Torres says.
"
3112,TAP,"But it has ""incredible brand equity"" and is back on the rise ""a bit,"" she said, no doubt due in part to the success of the ""Vacation in a Bottle"" ad campaign.
"
3113,TAP,"""The Crown (beer) business is growing faster than their wine business,"" said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg. ""We're happy to see (Constellation) becoming less reliant on the wine business.""
"
3114,TAP,"Beer generates better cash flow and margins than wine, which is ""a more capital-intensive business than beer,"" he said.
"
3115,TAP,"""Wine is a business that requires a lot more inventory and land than beer,"" Swartzberg said. It's also not as reliant on brand names, he says.
"
3116,TAP,"Torres says that a good portion of Constellation's wine business is being hurt by ""competitive pricing"" in the industry.
"
3117,TAP,"For the beer business, the company's outlook for fiscal 2015 calls for mid to high single-digit net sales growth and operating income growth in the low- to mid-20% range.
"
3118,TAP,"But for wine and spirits, it forecasts low- to mid-single-digit growth for both net sales and operating income.
"
3119,TAP,"Analysts expect full-year earnings to grow 26% to $4.09 a share.
"
3120,TAP,"A Year In Beer
"
3121,TAP,"Net sales in the company's fiscal year ending Feb. 28 jumped 74% to $4.9 billion, driven by $2 billion of incremental net sales related to the Crown beer business. Beer sales for the year rose 10%, while wine and spirits sales grew only 2%.
"
3122,TAP,"Profit for the year rose 48% to an adjusted $3.25 a share. Fourth-quarter earnings were up 72%, a third straight quarter of double-digit gains.
"
3123,TAP,"""I'm excited about the organic growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2015,"" said Constellation Brands CEO Robert Sands in the post-earnings conference call on April 9. He said that the firm expects sales and depletion trends to exceed U.S. beer industry and import levels once again.
"
3124,TAP,"Sands called last year's beer deal ""our most transformational acquisition in the history of our company."" (Management was unavailable to comment for this article, citing the ""quiet period"" ahead of the first-quarter earnings release on July 2.)
"
3125,TAP,"The acquisition also gave Constellation full ownership of a brewery in Nava, Mexico, which it's doubling in size. But management said in the last earnings report that the work would cost twice the original estimate, $900 million to $1.1 billion vs. $500 million to $600 million previously. The project is expected to be completed in 2016.
"
3126,TAP,"Swartzberg says that the added cost isn't as big an issue as it might seem. He figures that Constellation will benefit from at least $135 million in cost savings from brewery operations through mid-2016.
"
3127,TAP,"Roots In Wine Business
"
3128,TAP,"Founded in 1945, Constellation began to focus on branded wines in the early 1950s. Sands joined his family's upstate New York wine business in 1979, helping to expand it organically and via acquisitions.
"
3129,TAP,"The company shifted its focus to premium wines over the last decade. In 2004, for example, it acquired Robert Mondavi. A few years later, it sold off value brands Almaden and Inglenook.
"
3130,TAP,"But some other wine buys weren't as successful as Robert Mondavi. In fiscal 2008, Constellation wrote off $822 million in impaired assets from its Australia and U.K. wine businesses.
"
3131,TAP,"""They paid too much for their wine M&A's (mergers and acquisitions),"" Swartzberg said.

3132,TAP,"Besides Robert Mondavi, Constellation's wine lineup comprises Clos du Bois, Kim Crawford, Rex Goliath, Mark West, Franciscan Estate, Ruffino and Jackson-Triggs. Liquor brands include Svedka Vodka and Black Velvet Canadian Whisky.Anniversaries are often celebrated with toasts over raised drinks.If any drink were in order when Constellation Brands (STZ) recently marked its anniversary of a game-changing acquisition, it would be beer — and a Mexican brand in particular.A year ago this past weekend, Constellation Brands became full owner of Grupo Modelo's U.S. beer business in a $5.3 billion deal with Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD).Victor, N.Y.-based Constellation essentially got the remaining 50% stake in Crown Imports that it didn't already own.The deal included full U.S. rights to import, market and sell Mexican beers under the Modelo umbrella, including Corona Extra, Corona Light, Modelo Especial, Negra Modelo and Pacifico.The transaction, which included a brewery, doubled the size of Constellation, which also operates wine and spirits segments.It strengthened Constellation's position as the largest importer of beer in the U.S. and the country's third largest beer brewer and seller after Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors, a division of Molson Coors Brewing (TAP).Constellation ""was a wine company before it imported beer, but they didn't own beer,"" said analyst Lauren Torres of HSBC Global Research. It ""now owns a brand (Grupo Modelo) with great equity in beer.""Tops In HopsCheers go especially to Modelo Especial, Constellation's fastest-growing beer. Last year, U.S. shipments jumped 18%, reported Beer Marketer's Insights, making it the fastest-growing of the many beers that the beer-information provider tracks. Crown Imports' overall shipments were up nearly 6%.That growth arrived despite declining sales of many other beers, including Bud Light, Budweiser, Coors Light, Miller Lite, Miller High Life and Busch. Overall U.S. beer shipments, excluding exports, slid 1.3% in 2013, said Beer Marketer's Insights, continuing a multiyear trend of declining volumes.The economic downturn ""hit mainstream beer drinkers harder than wine or spirits markets,"" said Eric Shepard, editor of Beer Marketer's Insights' newsletter.But Modelo and Corona aren't expected to slow down anytime soon, Shepard says. Modelo spiked fairly quickly over the last 18 months, he says, largely because it's a hit with Latinos, a large and fast-growing demographic in the U.S.But, he says, Constellation's beer portfolio is reaching plenty of non-Latinos, including Millennials (the generation born from the early 1980s to the early 2000s).This year through April 20, volume sales of Modelo Especial surged 25%, Constellation said, citing data from Information Resources (IRI). Pacifico logged an 11% gain. Corona Extra and Corona Light were up 9% and 5%, respectively, and Negra Modelo 7%.For Pacifico, a new national web and social-media marketing campaign — the largest to date, called ""Yellow Caps,"" a play on the beer's bright yellow bottle caps — will roll out this summer. It will be supplemented by three TV ads on digital video, print ads in Southern California and spot TV ads in San Diego.Corona is one of the biggest imported beers in the U.S. But the mature brand had lost some share to newer, lower-priced imports in the recession, Torres says.But it has ""incredible brand equity"" and is back on the rise ""a bit,"" she said, no doubt due in part to the success of the ""Vacation in a Bottle"" ad campaign.""The Crown (beer) business is growing faster than their wine business,"" said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg. ""We're happy to see (Constellation) becoming less reliant on the wine business.""Beer generates better cash flow and margins than wine, which is ""a more capital-intensive business than beer,"" he said.""Wine is a business that requires a lot more inventory and land than beer,"" Swartzberg said. It's also not as reliant on brand names, he says.Torres says that a good portion of Constellation's wine business is being hurt by ""competitive pricing"" in the industry.For the beer business, the company's outlook for fiscal 2015 calls for mid to high single-digit net sales growth and operating income growth in the low- to mid-20% range.But for wine and spirits, it forecasts low- to mid-single-digit growth for both net sales and operating income.Analysts expect full-year earnings to grow 26% to $4.09 a share.A Year In BeerNet sales in the company's fiscal year ending Feb. 28 jumped 74% to $4.9 billion, driven by $2 billion of incremental net sales related to the Crown beer business. Beer sales for the year rose 10%, while wine and spirits sales grew only 2%.Profit for the year rose 48% to an adjusted $3.25 a share. Fourth-quarter earnings were up 72%, a third straight quarter of double-digit gains.""I'm excited about the organic growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2015,"" said Constellation Brands CEO Robert Sands in the post-earnings conference call on April 9. He said that the firm expects sales and depletion trends to exceed U.S. beer industry and import levels once again.Sands called last year's beer deal ""our most transformational acquisition in the history of our company."" (Management was unavailable to comment for this article, citing the ""quiet period"" ahead of the first-quarter earnings release on July 2.)The acquisition also gave Constellation full ownership of a brewery in Nava, Mexico, which it's doubling in size. But management said in the last earnings report that the work would cost twice the original estimate, $900 million to $1.1 billion vs. $500 million to $600 million previously. The project is expected to be completed in 2016.Swartzberg says that the added cost isn't as big an issue as it might seem. He figures that Constellation will benefit from at least $135 million in cost savings from brewery operations through mid-2016.Roots In Wine BusinessFounded in 1945, Constellation began to focus on branded wines in the early 1950s. Sands joined his family's upstate New York wine business in 1979, helping to expand it organically and via acquisitions.The company shifted its focus to premium wines over the last decade. In 2004, for example, it acquired Robert Mondavi. A few years later, it sold off value brands Almaden and Inglenook.But some other wine buys weren't as successful as Robert Mondavi. In fiscal 2008, Constellation wrote off $822 million in impaired assets from its Australia and U.K. wine businesses.""They paid too much for their wine M&A's (mergers and acquisitions),"" Swartzberg said.Besides Robert Mondavi, Constellation's wine lineup comprises Clos du Bois, Kim Crawford, Rex Goliath, Mark West, Franciscan Estate, Ruffino and Jackson-Triggs. Liquor brands include Svedka Vodka and Black Velvet Canadian Whisky.

3193,TAP,"Beer maker Arthur Guinness wasn't backing down.Not when a small posse, including Dublin's sheriff, showed up to shut off his water tap in 1775.The Irish brewer had signed an astoundingly long lease for his operation at St. James Gate in Dublin. The fine print granted access to the city's water supply for 9,000 years.It flowed freely, into Guinness beer, until local businessmen and city officials took exception.The brewer was having none of it. Grabbing a pickax from one of his confronters, Arthur shot back with — in his words — ""very much improper language that they should not proceed.""Guinness (1725-1803) prevailed.Over two centuries later, his distinctive dark stout — affectionately called the black stuff — remains the world's biggest selling stout beer.More than 10 million glasses of Guinness are tipped each day in 150 countries. It's still supplied by St. James Gate, the world's biggest stout brewery, plus operations in nearly 50 countries.They're owned by Diageo (DEO), the company formed when the Guinness firm merged with spirits firm Grand Metropolitan in 1997. Diageo had more than $17 billion in fiscal 2014 sales.Still Drawing CrowdsGuinness' legendary lease, with the founder's curlicued signature, is the first stop for 1 million yearly visitors to the Guinness Storehouse, the firm's museum/brewery.""It is the foundation of the company and the brand,"" Eibhlin Roche, executive ambassador of the Guinness Storehouse, told IBD. ""It really is a testament to his vision.""An uncommon ambition bubbled up from Arthur Guinness' low position in life.Born in Celbridge, Ireland, to Richard and Elizabeth Guinness, ""the infant Arthur would have inhaled the bracing smell of malt before he could walk.""So wrote Patrick Guinness, a descendant and the author of ""Arthur's Round.""The tot grew up around the stuff.First off, home-brewed ale — then safer to drink than the often-contaminated water — was common.But Arthur had closer ties. His grandfather was an ale maker, and his father managed a brewery as part of his job as land steward for Arthur Price, the Church of Ireland's archbishop of Cashel.Besides ensuring that the archbishop's beer was top notch, Richard oversaw the estate's livestock, crops and buildings, and acted as an accountant and purchasing agent. It was a heady position for a commoner.Seeing his father with a hand in everything gave the son insight into how a large operation was run.""As a result, Arthur knew what an integrated system looked like,"" said Stephen Mansfield, author of ""The Search for God and Guinness.""That depth of knowledge would pay off when Guinness built his brewery into Ireland's largest employer.But first came the groundwork.The six Guinness kids were called on to help while observing the comings and goings of the more privileged gentry who frequented the estate.By his late teens, Arthur was working as a registrar for Price, copying documents and witnessing leases. The boy had been prepared for the job by his dad, who emphasized reading and writing as skills that would elevate Arthur's prospects.When the archbishop died in 1752, he left Arthur, his godson, 100 pounds, worth $20,000 today.About that time, Arthur's father — widowed 10 years earlier — married Elizabeth Clare, owner of the nearby White Hart Inn.Arthur poured himself into mastering beer making at the inn.Creating ale was more art than science, and the trick was getting it right every time. Guinness kept meticulous records of his measurements and processes to achieve a consistently good product.By 1755, he was ready to open his own brewery, a small operation in nearby Leixlip.As sales increased, so did Guinness' stature.Soon he was urged on by a brother who'd established a top goldsmith firm in Dublin. Guinness looked to Ireland's capital for big-time expansion.In 1759 he found St. James Gate. It was a defunct brewery in ill repair, but it was on the main line to the Grand Canal, a waterway connecting east and west Ireland.Guinness would tap that route for exporting his brew.His reason for setting the lease terms for exactly 9,000 years has been lost to history. But Guinness' thinking was likely rooted in a longstanding distaste for English plantation owners who'd taken over Irish territories.In response, countrymen ""would sign these very, very long leases in order to keep the land in the hands of the Irish,"" Roche said.Brew And BlissWhile getting his beer flowing in Dublin, Arthur married Olivia Whitmore in 1761. Hailing from gentry, she brought a substantial dowry — 1,000 pounds, $150,000 in today's money — and connections to Dublin's leading families.Guinness was earning respect in his own right. He was named master of a national brewers association in 1767, and his brewery became the official supplier of beer to Dublin Castle in 1779.""He was really important as a brewer,"" Roche said.Meanwhile, his labor practices earned the devotion of Dublin's working class.Guinness paid 20% higher wages than other employers, built housing to ease Dublin's overcrowding and instituted paid holiday pay.""Guinness' position was that a healthy workforce made a good workforce,"" Roche said.Mansfield cites Guinness' faith, influenced by evangelical theologian John Wesley, as the driving force behind his guiding principle:""You really do do better for your company when you do better for your employees,"" Mansfield said. ""He gets very close to the needs of the people who work for him. It brands the company.""GoodnessThe Guinness name became synonymous with benevolence.A Protestant, Arthur supported Catholics' rights, helped fund the restoration of Dublin's St. Patrick's Cathedral, opened the city's first Sunday schools and served on the board of a charity hospital.Such altruistic efforts topped off Guinness' primary focus: making first-rate ale.Porter, the dark beer popularized in England, didn't become a Guinness drink until 1799.That's when Arthur shifted production completely away from ale and into the black stuff.He'd been tinkering with the recipe, getting it just right.""What he did was very much make it his own,"" Roche said.The dark beer with the creamy white head became the firm's, and the country's, signature drink. Nearly one of every two pints consumed in Ireland today is a Guinness.With his eye on the world, Arthur developed another dark beer specifically for export. His West Indies Porter added extra hops and a higher alcohol content to help the drink withstand long transport.That beer, first sold in 1801 and now called Guinness Foreign Extra Stout, accounts for 48% of Guinness sales worldwide.Arthur backed up his lofty aspirations — his estate was worth $2 million in today's money — with a resolve to do good. His family, with 10 surviving children of 21 born, carried on the tradition.Besides beer, Guinness family members distinguished themselves in the realms of banking, politics and religious ministry.Seven generations of Guinness descendants were directly involved in running the brewery Arthur founded.The key ingredient to Guinness' success, per Roche: ""He had a huge self-belief in his beer.""

3199,TAP,"CEO Tim Cook spotlighted Apple's first foray into payments — a mobile app called Apple Pay — during the company's Sept. 9 iPhone 6 rollout.The tap-to-pay technology lets iPhone and Apple Watch users make purchases by tapping the devices at check-out registers in more than 20,000 participating stores. They include retail chains such as McDonald's (MCD), Macy's (M) and Staples (SPLS).Apple (AAPL) also got major credit-card companies Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and American Express (AXP) to join its mobile payments network, though terms aren't known.Apple Pay is a sophisticated digital wallet that links consumers and merchants directly with credit-card companies and their supporting banks.Mercator Advisory Group described how Apple Pay works in the report ""A Sleeping Giant Awakes: How Apple Pay Works and What It Means for Payments.""Users of the Apple iPhone and Watch can use the credit cards that they have on file in their iTunes accounts and add them to the Passbook app on their devices to activate Apple Pay.Apple Pay can then be used at any participating store.No special acquiring network like PayPal is required, since the payment option runs over the existing payments network that includes credit-card companies and banks, as long as the merchant accepts payments through wireless near-field communication (NFC) technology set up at the merchant's checkout stands.Every iTunes user has given Apple a primary account number (PAN) for each iTunes purchase. Apple has these PANs on file.When users ask Apple to activate Apple Pay, Apple communicates the request to the bank that owns the users' credit cards.If the bank approves the request, the user's PAN is sent to the appropriate network (AmEx, MasterCard or Visa), and the network generates a digital ""token"" to represent the PAN.The network then works with Apple to insert the token into the ""Secure Element"" of the NFC chip on the user's iPhone or iWatch.The iPhone or Watch is then primed to make purchases at any merchant location that has a point-of-sale (POS) terminal that accepts NFC-enabled devices.Users bring their Apple device to the store and take their items to the checkout aisle.They tap or wave the device at the store's POS register using Apple's Touch ID technology feature.The token is transmitted wirelessly to the register. The register forwards the token and other purchase data from the merchant to the appropriate network run by the credit-card/payment provider and its issuing bank.The network receives the data, which includes the token; looks up the PAN with which the token is associated; and inserts the PAN into the authorization request, which is sent to the credit-card issuer.The issuer receives the authorization request and approves or denies the transaction.When an Apple customer walks into a store to make a purchase, the only information that his or her iPhone communicates to the merchant is the traditional card payment information, such as the customer's name. There is only the token where the card account number and other sensitive information used to be.While Apple might be notified that the customer's device has been activated to make a purchase, Apple doesn't see the retailer's name, the transaction amount or any other sales detail directly.But Mercator says that it is possible that some information could be derived from other iPhone sensors that track such data as location, date or time.

3202,TAP,"People in charge must discover a better version of themselves. So says retired Army Brig. Gen. Becky Halstead, the first female commanding general in U.S. history to lead at the strategic level in combat operations. She's also the author of ""24/7: The First Person You Must Lead Is YOU.""""The day we stop learning is the day we stop leading and living,"" she told IBD. ""Every person has value and star potential. We should never stop looking for that in ourselves and in others.""Tips on upping your game:• Take the mirror test. Authentic leadership is ""who you are and how you respond when no one else is watching,"" Halstead said. ""You choose the attitude, (the) responses and the discipline required to maintain your integrity and lead with character and competence. When you remind yourself of your values each day and remain confident in those convictions, even a toxic boss or one with lower standards cannot move you from them.""• Set an example. Inspire others to demand more of themselves by first demonstrating your own commitment. ""We cannot always be first, but we can always be our best,"" Halstead said. ""A better me results in a better we — and results in a powerful cumulative effect on your team."" The general suggests communicating a vision for your outfit while establishing goals.• Circulate and appreciate. Halstead said: ""When a leader looks into the eyes of those who accomplish the work, genuinely listens to them and truly cares about their environment, then they will connect."" And connecting creates empowered leaders.• Conduct evaluations.  Observe yourself, says Mindy Hall, author of ""Leading With Intention.""Ask: ""How would I experience my actions if I were on the receiving end?"" The question, she said, ""creates awareness that allows you to pivot, shift and adjust.""• Be consistent. People listen more to what you do than what you say, Hall points out. She offers two examples of dropping the ball:1. A leader at a meeting of a global team emphasized the importance of getting together. Then 90 minutes into the meeting, she started answering email on her laptop. That gave license for attendees to do the same.2. A company designated a project as priority No. 1. Then meetings got postponed and sponsors missed the ones that did start.""When credibility gets undermined, people stop believing and the success of the effort gets compromised,"" Hall said. ""You get to choose every day how you engage with the world around you. Don't waste that opportunity.""• Shape the environment.  Culture will develop by design or default, Hall says. She adds that employees who feel connected to the philosophy of their organization are more engaged and productive.""Culture is built through everyday actions and messaging,"" she said. ""The number one way it's shaped is by what leaders model.""• Reap the benefits. Hall shares research revealing that up to 75% of employees could contribute more at work. ""If leaders could tap into that discretionary effort, imagine the effects not only on the bottom line but on customer relationships, on product quality, on recruitment and retention rates,"" she said. ""If you could improve engagement simply by being more aware of your impact and more deliberate in your actions, why wouldn't you make that investment?""• Fuse character and competence. Halstead likes this line: ""Mission first, people always.""The general noted: ""The impact of leading with purpose is that we will make a difference.""

That was true this week, as we mobilized the world to confront some of our most urgent challenges. America is leading the world in the fight to degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL. On Monday, our brave men and women in uniform began air strikes against ISIL targets in Syria. And they weren’t alone. I made it clear that America would act as part of a broad coalition, and we were joined in this action by friends and partners, including Arab nations.At the United Nations in New York, I worked to build more support for this coalition; to cut off terrorist financing; and to stop the flow of foreign fighters into and out of that region. And in my address to the UN, I challenged the world — especially Muslim communities — to reject the ideology of violent extremism, and to do more to tap the extraordinary potential of their young people.America is leading the effort to rally the world against Russian aggression in Ukraine. Along with our allies, we will support the people of Ukraine as they develop their democracy and economy. And this week, I called upon even more nations to join us on the right side of history.America is leading the fight to contain and combat the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We’re deploying our doctors and scientists — supported by our military — to help corral the outbreak and pursue new treatments. From the United Kingdom and Germany to France and Senegal, other nations are stepping up their efforts, too, sending money, supplies, and personnel. And we will continue to rally other countries to join us in making concrete commitments to fight this disease, and enhance global health security for the long-term.America is engaging more partners and allies than ever to confront the growing threat of climate change before it’s too late. We’re doing our part, and helping developing nations do theirs. At home, we’ve invested in clean energy, cut carbon pollution, and created new jobs in the process. Abroad, our climate assistance now reaches more than 120 nations. And on Tuesday, I called on every nation — developed and developing alike — to join us in this effort for the sake of future generations.The people of the world look to us to lead. And we welcome that responsibility. We are heirs to a proud legacy of freedom. And as we showed the world this week, we are prepared to do what is necessary to secure that legacy for generations to come. Thanks, and have a great weekend. ####Previous Weekly Remarks by both parties are available by clicking here.RELATED:Obama's slovenly salute more revealing than he knowsObama has a strategy to punish companies protecting profits'The surest path to danger is always weakness, indecision'--RomneyLOL Flashback: Biden warns that Romney doesn't Trust Putin, might bomb Syria

That single exercise became a strong habit the next few months, and the number increased.Soon, he was going to the gym daily and tackling a full regimen.If you're trying to change your life, he says, tap into the power of easy-does-it routines. ""Habits are so energy friendly,"" he told IBD.The key to leveraging habits? Plan. Do that smartly, and regular habits pack a big punch. Tips:• Imagine. Where can habits give you a boost? Look at the big picture to find out. ""Start with your life values,"" Guise said. ""If your health is very valuable to you, that could become a goal of being able to run five miles in a certain amount of time or wanting to eat healthy food.""• Solidify. As soon as possible, distill the big vision into achievable targets. ""An abstract goal is 'I want to be rich,'"" Guise said. ""A concrete goal is 'I want to make $15 by selling lemonade at 3 p.m. today.' ""Habits help you jump from vague to hop-to-it.• Train your brain. Why habits work: ""If you take a shower immediately after waking up every day, you'll have a neural pathway associated with that behavior,"" Guise explained. ""You'll wake up, the shower neurons will fire, and you'll walk to the shower like a zombie — no thinking required.""The same phenomenon happens with any repeated activity.• Choose. Habit can help you write a book, improve your stock portfolio, become more efficient and reach many other ambitions if you break them down into daily rituals.• Be patient. There is no set rule for how many days it takes for a repeated act to become a habit.""The range is from 18 to 254 days,"" Guise said.• Slice and dice. Chasing after a concrete objective isn't as hard if you keep the to-dos tiny.""Setting minigoals is the best way to drop the perceived difficulty in any project,"" Guise stressed.• Inch up. If you're struggling to get an easy task done, it's not easy enough, Guise reminds. Keep scaling down until it's a no-brainer.• Leap routinely. String several small actions together, and you have another sharp tool for making big life changes: the routine.S.J. Scott, owner of the blog Develop Good Habits, advises followers to focus on short chunks of time that they can inject with chains of small, but useful, habits.""Create a checklist and follow it every single day,"" he said.• Start big. Try this: To be more productive all day, jump-start the first 20 minutes at the office in the morning.Scott, in his book ""Habit Stacking,"" suggests this routine:Schedule your day and prioritize tasks.Set a deadline or commit to a colleague to finish the job.Clear your desktop.Tackle the toughest to-do first.• Keep it simple. Adding too many routines to more than one area of your life at once can get confusing, Guise and Scott stress.• Map it out. Consistency is vital for turning any useful activity into a habit.Use calendars and checklists to help you remember to complete your goal-oriented activity each day.""Writing down your minihabits initially and checking them off as you go are extremely important for your success,"" Guise said.Scott agreed: ""Repetition of the routine builds muscle memory to the point where you follow the routine, each day, without fail.""

The safe-haven gold remains down for the week. Oil prices also continue to slide on a weakening outlook for demand, but raising no red flags in terms of supply disruptions.The Nasdaq heads into Friday's session with an 1.8% loss so far this week. The S&P 500 is down 2.4%. The Russell 2000 split the difference and is down 2.2%, but below support in what would be its fourth straight weekly loss. For both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, the week so far is the worst since the week ended April 11 — the week before both indexes bottomed and began rebounding.The hotly anticipated jobs report showed payrolls added 209,000 workers in July, according to the Labor Department. That was far below June's upwardly revised 298,000 additions, and weaker than the 233,000 new jobs expected by economists.

3310,TAP,"Move over IPA and that slew of microbrews. A new ""it"" drink is on the rise around the U.S.: hard cider.
"
3311,TAP,"Though it's still a small niche — less than 1% of the big beer business — U.S. retail sales of cider have nearly doubled in a year, the highest growth niche in percentage terms.
"
3312,TAP,"Sales of craft beer and flavored beers are hopping too, though traditional mass-produced beer has fallen flat the last few years. Brewers embraced cider to capture a new market and appeal to changing consumer tastes in alcoholic beverages.
"
3313,TAP,"Those tastes now include fermented apples, sometimes pears.
"
3314,TAP,"""Today's consumers tend to look for quality and authenticity and a connection to nature,"" said Dan Rowell, the CEO and President of Vermont Hard Cider Co., which has been making Woodchuck cider for more than 20 years.
"
3315,TAP,"Rising interest in natural food and drink, and even in things like gluten-free diets, has boosted cider consumption, Rowell says. But those aren't the only spurs.

"
3321,TAP,"""Trying a different type of craft beer or cider, you don't need to go out and get a mortgage for that,"" he said, adding that 20-somethings are more apt than their parents to explore new tastes.
"
3322,TAP,"Cider's roots in the U.S. aren't new. The alcoholic drink goes back to the days of the first settlers in New England. Cider topped beer as America's drink of choice until the 1900s, when German settlers to the Midwest grew large amounts of barley for beer.
"
3323,TAP,"Prohibition in the 1920s sealed cider's fate, as the Volstead Act limited the production of cider and prohibitionists burned apple orchards. So the orchard owners planted trees yielding sweeter, noncider apples instead.
"
3324,TAP,"Cider production resurged this century, in 2009 consisting of 6.9 million domestic gallons and 2.5 million imported for a total of 9.5 million gallons, according to the Beer Institute. In 2013, domestic production soared over 360% to 32 million gallons. Imports doubled to 4.8 million gallons for total cider volume of 36.9 million gallons.

"
3328,TAP,"Angry Orchard uses wine yeast for its cider and its Crisp Apple flavor has a similar flavor profile to Pinot Grigio or Pinot Blanc wine.
"
3329,TAP,"Boston Beer said that in the first quarter this year, its depletions (distributor sales to retail) growth rose 34% over a year earlier thanks to a boost from its Angry Orchard, Samuel Adams and Twisted Tea brands. Core shipment volume rose 32% to 835,000 barrels.
"
3330,TAP,"Boston Beer still gets the majority of its revenue from beer, but according to a 2013 report from Goldman Sachs, Angry Orchard is expected to make up 20% of Boston Beer's total volume by the end of 2015.

3351,TAP,"Attention shoppers: Apple on Tuesday unveiled tap-to-pay technology for using iPhones to buy things.
"
3352,TAP,"The company said ""Apple Pay"" will be available in October as a free update to its iOS 8 software.
"
3353,TAP,"Apple's (AAPL) push into mobile payments isn't expected to power earnings growth, analyst say. But Apple's digital wallet will likely re-energize the iOS ecosystem's cool factor, amid rising smartphone competition. That, of course, depends on how many iPhone users tap-to-pay, instead of pulling out cash or swiping credit cards in retail stores.
"
3354,TAP,"Apple didn't disclose terms with credit-card companies that will support the payment system. JPMorgan speculates Apple may collect a small transaction fee, perhaps pennies, each time iPhone users wave their device to pay at check-out terminals.
"
3355,TAP,"Apple is taking on Google (GOOGL), eBay's (EBAY) PayPal, retail consortium MCX, phone companies and others in mobile payments.
"
3356,TAP,"U.S. consumers have been slow to embrace digital wallets, partly over security concerns. Worries over credit-card security have been heightened by data thefts at Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and others. Apple, stung by last week's celebrity-photo hacking scandal involving iCloud data storage, aims to win over shoppers, retailers and credit-card firms with its approach to protecting consumer financial data and limiting fraud.
"
3357,TAP,"""Security is at the core of (Apple) Pay, but so is privacy,"" Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet software and services, said at Apple's product unveiling event Tuesday, taking a shot at Google. ""Apple doesn't know what you bought, where you bought it or any other details about the transaction. And the cashier doesn't even see your name.""
"
3358,TAP,"Apple's security measures include ""TouchID"" fingerprint authentication technology to log in and verify users. IPhones will generate single-use, random digital code during transactions, instead of transmitting 16-digit credit-card numbers to store check-out systems. A ""secure element"" chip stores encrypted data.
"
3359,TAP,"NFC Rollout Will Get Boost
"
3360,TAP,"Apple Pay uses near-field communications, a short-range wireless technology, to send data to payment readers. Analysts say just 15% to 20% of U.S. retail locations have NFC-equipped sales terminals, but Apple's push into mobile payments could speed NFC adoption.
"
3361,TAP,"Aside from its ability to build easy-to-use devices, one of Apple's strengths in the payments field is the more than 800 million credit cards on file in iTunes app store accounts. IPhone users will be able to load eligible credit cards into the Passport app.
"
3362,TAP,"IPhone users are prime candidates for ushering in the mobile wallet age, says Jordan McKee, an analyst at 451 Research.
"
3363,TAP,"""Not only do iPhone owners earn more than their Android counterparts, they also spend more,"" McKee told IBD. ""IPhone owners are the most advanced users of mobile transaction services across a wealth of categories. An iWallet would simply be a natural extension of how iPhone owners already use their devices.
"
3364,TAP,"""The number of iTunes accounts has ballooned from 575 million to 800 million in a year, with many of those accounts having a credit or debit card associated with them. While most vendors are clutching at straws for new ways to increase cards on file, Apple trumps them from day one by a significant factor.""
"
3365,TAP,"Apple, which acquired Beats Electronics' music streaming service in May for $ 3.2 billion, aims to diversify from hardware into services.
"
3366,TAP,"At around a penny per transaction, Apple's payment revenue would amount to a few hundred million dollars annually, analysts estimate. A JPMorgan report says the ""impact to Apple's earnings would be immaterial.""
"
3367,TAP,"McDonald's, Macy's On Board
"
3368,TAP,"Apple's biggest benefit would be ""significant platform lock-in"" amid fierce competition from Google-Android based smartphones and other rivals, JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall said. Mobile payments, said Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider in a report, will ""increase the stickiness of the iOS platform over time.""
"
3369,TAP,"Apple says its payment system will work with Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and American Express (AXP), as well as credit cards from six banks.
"
3370,TAP,"Apple Pay can be used at McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Macy's (M), Bloomingdale's, Walgreen (WAG), Walt Disney (DIS), Staples (SPLS), Duane Reade and Subway. Some 22,000 retailers are equipped to accept the payment system, Apple said.
"
3371,TAP,"Some speculate that Apple may launch a rewards program with partners to encourage use of the payment system. Analysts say it's unclear if Apple will be able to garner revenue from advertising or special product offers.
"
3372,TAP,"Retailers have been testing Apple's iBeacon wireless technology, which provides customer location data in stores. Analysts say retailers hope to whisk coupons or other discounts to shoppers via iBeacon.
"
3373,TAP,"Analysts say Apple made a good move in teaming with credit card companies. Visa, MasterCard and American Express have a strong presence in the mobile market. Almost all mobile wallets today rely on credit-card networks to authorize and clear payments, says Goldman Sachs. PayPal, which uses a clearinghouse system set up by banks, has more than half of transactions linked to traditional credit cards.
"
3374,TAP,"Apple has taken years to cobble together a digital payments strategy. It bought security firm AuthenTec in 2012 and began testing iBeacon last year. But mobile wallets are off to a slow start.
"
3375,TAP,"PayPal has tried to expand its online payment processing business into retail stores. Consumers with PayPal accounts use a plastic card or mobile phone number and PIN combination to make purchases at checkout.
"
3376,TAP,"Yet, fewer than 5% of PayPal's nearly 120 million online users are forecast to use its retail payment system by 2015.
"
3377,TAP,"MCX, a consortium backed by Wal-Mart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY) and 60 other retailers, might not be ready to launch its smartphone-based digital wallet until 2015, analysts say. MCX members hope long term to reduce the credit-card transaction fees they now pay, analysts say.
"
3378,TAP,"A mobile payments joint venture formed by AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and T-Mobile US (TMUS), rebranded as Softcard last week, has struggled to gain traction.

JPMorgan speculates Apple may collect a small transaction fee, perhaps pennies, each time iPhone users wave their device to pay at check-out terminals.Apple is taking on Google (GOOGL), eBay's (EBAY) PayPal, retail consortium MCX, phone companies and others in mobile payments.U.S. consumers have been slow to embrace digital wallets, partly over security concerns. Worries over credit-card security have been heightened by data thefts at Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and others. Apple, stung by last week's celebrity-photo hacking scandal involving iCloud data storage, aims to win over shoppers, retailers and credit-card firms with its approach to protecting consumer financial data and limiting fraud.""Security is at the core of (Apple) Pay, but so is privacy,"" Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet software and services, said at Apple's product unveiling event Tuesday, taking a shot at Google. ""Apple doesn't know what you bought, where you bought it or any other details about the transaction. And the cashier doesn't even see your name.""Apple's security measures include ""TouchID"" fingerprint authentication technology to log in and verify users. IPhones will generate single-use, random digital code during transactions, instead of transmitting 16-digit credit-card numbers to store check-out systems. A ""secure element"" chip stores encrypted data.NFC Rollout Will Get BoostApple Pay uses near-field communications, a short-range wireless technology, to send data to payment readers. Analysts say just 15% to 20% of U.S. retail locations have NFC-equipped sales terminals, but Apple's push into mobile payments could speed NFC adoption.Aside from its ability to build easy-to-use devices, one of Apple's strengths in the payments field is the more than 800 million credit cards on file in iTunes app store accounts. IPhone users will be able to load eligible credit cards into the Passport app.IPhone users are prime candidates for ushering in the mobile wallet age, says Jordan McKee, an analyst at 451 Research.""Not only do iPhone owners earn more than their Android counterparts, they also spend more,"" McKee told IBD. ""IPhone owners are the most advanced users of mobile transaction services across a wealth of categories. An iWallet would simply be a natural extension of how iPhone owners already use their devices.""The number of iTunes accounts has ballooned from 575 million to 800 million in a year, with many of those accounts having a credit or debit card associated with them. While most vendors are clutching at straws for new ways to increase cards on file, Apple trumps them from day one by a significant factor.""Apple, which acquired Beats Electronics' music streaming service in May for $ 3.2 billion, aims to diversify from hardware into services.At around a penny per transaction, Apple's payment revenue would amount to a few hundred million dollars annually, analysts estimate. A JPMorgan report says the ""impact to Apple's earnings would be immaterial.""McDonald's, Macy's On BoardApple's biggest benefit would be ""significant platform lock-in"" amid fierce competition from Google-Android based smartphones and other rivals, JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall said. Mobile payments, said Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider in a report, will ""increase the stickiness of the iOS platform over time.""Apple says its payment system will work with Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and American Express (AXP), as well as credit cards from six banks.Apple Pay can be used at McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Macy's (M), Bloomingdale's, Walgreen (WAG), Walt Disney (DIS), Staples (SPLS), Duane Reade and Subway. Some 22,000 retailers are equipped to accept the payment system, Apple said.Some speculate that Apple may launch a rewards program with partners to encourage use of the payment system. Analysts say it's unclear if Apple will be able to garner revenue from advertising or special product offers.Retailers have been testing Apple's iBeacon wireless technology, which provides customer location data in stores. Analysts say retailers hope to whisk coupons or other discounts to shoppers via iBeacon.Analysts say Apple made a good move in teaming with credit card companies. Visa, MasterCard and American Express have a strong presence in the mobile market. Almost all mobile wallets today rely on credit-card networks to authorize and clear payments, says Goldman Sachs. PayPal, which uses a clearinghouse system set up by banks, has more than half of transactions linked to traditional credit cards.Apple has taken years to cobble together a digital payments strategy. It bought security firm AuthenTec in 2012 and began testing iBeacon last year. But mobile wallets are off to a slow start.PayPal has tried to expand its online payment processing business into retail stores. Consumers with PayPal accounts use a plastic card or mobile phone number and PIN combination to make purchases at checkout.Yet, fewer than 5% of PayPal's nearly 120 million online users are forecast to use its retail payment system by 2015.MCX, a consortium backed by Wal-Mart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY) and 60 other retailers, might not be ready to launch its smartphone-based digital wallet until 2015, analysts say. MCX members hope long term to reduce the credit-card transaction fees they now pay, analysts say.A mobile payments joint venture formed by AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and T-Mobile US (TMUS), rebranded as Softcard last week, has struggled to gain traction.The three firms formed the joint venture in 2011, but early partners Barclays and Capital One (COF) have backed out of the venture.

3411,TAP,"After getting a nice boost from the ongoing recovery in homebuilding demand, Eagle Materials is primed to tap into America's oil and natural gas exploration boom.
"
3412,TAP,"Eagle (EXP) provides basic building products used in residential, industrial, commercial and infrastructure construction. Its lineup includes gypsum wallboard and recycled paperboard, which sell mainly to the housing market. It also makes aggregates, concrete and cement, including specialty cement used in oil and natural gas wells.
"
3413,TAP,"Another offering that Eagle has recently added to the mix — an important one — is frac sand. It's a crush-resistant sand that drilling companies use in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to get oil or natural gas out of the ground.
"
3414,TAP,"The Dallas company has delivered a long winning streak, buoyed by the housing market recovery that has led to strong demand for products such as wallboard and cement, and price increases along the way. Earnings have climbed by at least double-digit percentages in all but one of the past 11 quarters.
"
3415,TAP,"Foray Into Fracking Sand
"
3416,TAP,"Newly added to its lineup, frac sand may spur more growth.
"
3417,TAP,"Frac sand is a so-called proppant used in the hydraulic fracturing process to help get oil and natural gas from rocky areas such as shale. In fracking, liquids are injected into the ground to make space for underlying oil or natural gas to flow through. Proppants are solids used to prop the space open during or after fracking.
"
3418,TAP,"Last year, Eagle completed a facility in Corpus Christi, Texas, to produce frac sand, and in fiscal 2015's first quarter, which ended June 30, it received the final permit needed to start operating its frac-sand mine in Utica, Ill. During the quarter, Eagle continued to process and sell purchased sand in Corpus Christi awaiting the opening of the mine in Illinois.
"
3419,TAP,"With the receipt of the final permit necessary to start up its mine, Eagle expects to be able to sell its sand through its Corpus Christi facility no later than the fiscal third quarter, primarily into Eagle Ford shale-drilling applications. The Eagle Ford shale formation is in South Texas.
"
3420,TAP,"D.A. Davidson analyst Brent Thielman is upbeat about Eagle's prospects in oil and gas proppants, which Eagle started to report as a separate operating segment beginning in fiscal 2015.
"
3421,TAP,"""They've talked about this business being as large as their cement or wallboard business,"" he said. ""It will take a few years to get there, but over time, it will be a third leg to the stool. That's the key message. They truly believe it will be a meaningful platform for them. The growth opportunity is pretty significant.""
"
3422,TAP,"On the first-quarter conference call, Eagle CEO Steven Rowley said that the new Oil and Gas Proppants segment ""will be increasing in importance in coming years.""
"
3423,TAP,"He also noted that he expects the frac-sand business to ""become a material contributor to Eagle's cash flow by the end of this fiscal year.""
"
3424,TAP,"Adds Thielman: ""For the immediate (second) quarter, I don't expect tremendous momentum for the proppants business. In the second half, it will become a more meaningful contributor.""
"
3425,TAP,"Drillers Spur Demand
"
3426,TAP,"The nation's shale boom has caused a surge in demand for frac sand. In addition to Eagle, other frac sand producers include U.S. Silica (SLCA) and Hi-Crush Partners (HCLP).
"
3427,TAP,"Thielman says the demand for frac sand is strong and the growth profiles of the companies that produce it are ""pretty significant.""
"
3428,TAP,"Meanwhile, Eagle continues to enjoy a nice lift from an uptick in homebuilding demand.

"
3434,TAP,"Eagle's wallboard business has done well year-to-date with good volume growth, he adds. He says that business is benefiting from being concentrated in some relatively strong housing markets, citing Texas and Colorado in particular.
"
3435,TAP,"""The primary drivers"" of the first-quarter earnings gain were increased wallboard and paperboard sales volumes, the company said.
"
3436,TAP,"The wallboard and paperboard segment's operating earnings climbed 27% from a year earlier to $45 million in the first quarter. Revenue rose 18% to $136.1 million, helped by an 11% rise in gypsum wallboard prices.
"
3437,TAP,"Operating earnings from Eagle's cement business were up 8% to $20.5 million. Average sales prices rose 5% from a year earlier, though they were partially offset by $5.2 million in costs related to a shift to the first quarter of the annual maintenance outages at its Kansas City, Mo. and Tulsa, Okla., facilities.

So is lying about it to Congress and the courts as part of a cover-up of that activity.On July 11, U.S. District Court Judge Reggie Walton, at a hearing examining a lawsuit against the IRS by the targeted conservative group True the Vote, told Obama administration lawyers he wanted to see an affidavit explaining what happened with Lerner's hard drive.He wanted something on the record and under oath that went beyond the tap dancing of recent congressional testimony. Walton also wanted to know the serial number of the hard drive and, if that number was known, ""why the computer hard drive cannot be identified and preserved.""In response, the IRS said under oath that the hard drive from Lerner's computer was destroyed and recycled, echoing earlier testimony from Commissioner John Koskinen.The reason given for Lerner's hard drive — possibly containing incriminating emails from and to the former head of the IRS Tax Exempt division — being destroyed and recycled, according to the IRS in the affidavit, was that a team of its technical experts had determined the drive was irreparably damaged and had to be recycled.Except that was not true.On Tuesday, House Ways and Means Committee investigators said that they had a chance to talk to the technical experts inside the IRS who actually examined Lerner's computer, and that the experts said the hard drive in question was merely ""scratched"" and most of the data on it was indeed recoverable.According to a committee release, ""in-house professionals at the IRS recommended the agency seek outside assistance in recovering the data.""Yet no attempt to get outside help was made.A justifiably outraged Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) said in a statement: ""The committee was told no data was recoverable and the physical drive was recycled and potentially shredded.""To now learn that the hard drive was only scratched, yet the IRS refused to utilize outside experts to recover the data, raises more questions about potential criminal wrong doing at the IRS.""As Byron York reports in the Washington Examiner, ""committee aides say they have consulted with 'former federal law enforcement and Department of Defense forensic experts' about the matter, and their conclusion is that the majority of information on the drive could have been saved.""As we and others have noted, the desire to use the IRS to punish political enemies was one of the articles of impeachment against President Nixon.That President Obama's IRS may have actually been doing it, we believe, is sufficient motive to go along with the opportunity the IRS had to destroy the incriminating evidence that was possibly one of the reasons Lerner pleaded the Fifth Amendment in testimony before Congress.As if this wasn't enough, Koskinen, testifying before a House oversight subcommittee for the fourth time on Wednesday, said the backup tapes possibly containing the emails in question, supposedly recycled and lost forever, have been found.Koskinen stressed that he does not know ""how they found them"" or ""whether there's anything on them or not."" Of course he doesn't. The ""being there"" commissioner has either pleaded ignorance or tap-danced around his prior contradictory statements with all the aplomb of a husband caught sneaking in at 3 a.m.But now the IRS, arguably caught lying many times, has been caught lying to a federal judge. We have two words for this: "" special prosecutor.""

3454,TAP,"Rep. Fred Upton gives the Republican Party's Weekly RemarksSo, let’s talk about energy — how it affects our daily lives, and how Republicans are working to make it more affordable, reliable, and beneficial.Not too long ago, we thought America’s energy needs could only be met through increasing foreign dependence. It’s a scary thought, particularly as we watch the chaos unfold overseas and gasoline prices closing in on four bucks a gallon here at home. I hear constantly from working families struggling with the cost of filling the tank just to drive to and from work.Energy is at the core of American life. It supports jobs and our economy, and it affects everything from the price at the pump and the monthly electric bill to the cost of groceries — all of the things that Americans need to make ends meet. Schools, churches, hospitals, and manufacturing plants in my home state of Michigan and around the country … they all depend on affordable energy.That’s why, this coming week, the House is going to vote on bills designed to make the most of America’s abundant energy supplies by building pipelines and transmission lines to connect our energy abundance to consumers, and by using our energy strength to fight back against hostile nations who use their resources to hold the rest of the world hostage.We have already taken steps to modernize permitting, approve major energy projects, cut red tape for hydro-power plants, and keep American coal in our energy mix.But we're not going to stop there. We are offering more predictable regulations that encourage investment, lower prices, and create jobs here at home. We're making targeted energy efficiency reforms, which will also help reduce costs and eliminate waste. And we're focusing on the safety and reliability of the electrical grid to protect against everything from security threats to brownouts and blackouts. We're working to keep nuclear power safe and sustainable for the long-term.That's what we mean by an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy. Fossil and renewable fuels, expanded production and conservation … together, these steps could help save money for American families, create the new jobs and industries that we want, and strengthen our position across the globe.It’s very different than President Obama’s vision. His recently announced EPA rules for power plants is going to make it harder to use all of our American resources, and could well force states to ration energy, which certainly is going to make it more expensive to power our homes and factories.His record of energy development on federal lands remains dismal. And we all may rue the day that his president decided he could not say yes to the job-creating Keystone XL pipeline, which is going to displace energy from hostile parts of the world like Venezuela and the Middle East and replace it with supplies from our ally, our friend, Canada; instead, the project is in regulatory purgatory, and America waits and waits.We can do better, yes, we can. The U.S. has entered an era of energy abundance, and now we need the architecture — the infrastructure and policies — to support it. That’s exactly what Republicans are working to deliver. Thanks for listening, have a great weekend. ####Previous weekly remarks are available by clicking here.RELATED:Americans' confidence in Obama cratersObama's decided Iraq's Maliki must go, but be very wary of historyAmerica's newest hero: A Marine who dived on a grenade to save a buddyHe's got presidential perqs down, now it's time Obama masters the work part

3455,TAP,"You know the basic steps along the financial road of life. Start a retirement fund. Prepare your will. Avoid debt like it's a deadly virus.But what other steps should you take?The question is not academic. A recent Federal Reserve study showed that 64% of people age 45 to 59 don't have an emergency fund in case they lose their job.""Planning sounds easy, but it's shocking how many people put it off,"" said Tim McGrath, managing director of Chicago's Riverpoint Wealth Management.You've probably already started a retirement account and thought about a will. What about less obvious steps?Here are nine key ones for the decades before retirement: Social Security. Unless you'll need the added income right away in retirement, plan on delaying the start of benefits, because your benefit increases about 8% a year for every year that you wait until full retirement age, Williams says. Roth retirement accounts. The younger you are and the more likely it is that your tax bracket will rise or stay the same in retirement, the better off you'll be with a Roth-style IRA or 401(k). ""The way to think about it is in after-tax, spendable income in retirement,"" said Judith Ward, a senior financial planner for T. Rowe Price. ""If a Roth will be better for you, the sooner you switch or start using it, the better."" Life insurance. OK, maybe you need it. But how much? Use online calculators to get a rough idea.""Start to figure out if it's worth the cost by pricing a benefit that's 10 times your salary,"" Ward said.You may need more if your spouse can't support the family by herself or himself if you die, Ward says. Beneficiaries. Check the designation on everything from retirement accounts to bank accounts, especially after a divorce. The money goes to the named beneficiary, regardless of heirs named in your will, Ward says. Liability insurance. ""High-net-worth people should weigh the cost of coverage that matches your net worth,"" said McGrath. Charity. Giving gifts of highly appreciated stock achieves a good deed. It also lets you avoid capital gains tax on the profitable sale of the securities, McGrath says. Buy/sell agreements. If you own a business with partners, create a written contingency plan in case one of you dies.Partners rarely want to do business with a dead partner's spouse, says Aaron Thiel, a planner with PNC Wealth Management in Sarasota, Fla.A buy/sell agreement lets a deceased partner's spouse turn in stock shares or business interests owned by the deceased partner in exchange for a predetermined amount of cash or a combination of cash and loans.Often, the firm buys the assets from the decedent's spouse with proceeds from a company-owned life or disability insurance policy. Health savings account. Contributions are not part of your taxable income. Qualified withdrawals are also tax free. ""Start young and build it up for health expenses in retirement,"" McGrath said.Remember, you can use an HSA only in tandem with a high-deductible health insurance plan. That kind of plan is generally better suited for young, healthy workers. Home equity line of credit. This is a financial lifeboat if a financial emergency arises. ""Get it while you've got a job,"" said Steve Williams, head of U.S. financial planning for BMO Private Bank in Chicago. ""If you lose your job, it'll be harder to get.""A $500,000 line may cost you about $100 a year, Williams says. You'd pay prevailing interest rates only if you actually tap into it.

3457,TAP,"Comcast, the nation's largest cable operator and Internet service provider, is sticking to its core businesses at a time when the media world is absorbing the seismic jolt of 21st Century Fox's gargantuan $80 billion offer for Time Warner.The cable giant's strategy is working. Comcast reported robust second-quarter earnings on July 22, fueled by a strong boost in its home Internet segment.Many industry players are trying to expand revenue streams in adventurous ways, such as Netflix (NFLX) deciding to create content, rather than simply deliver it through streaming and snail-mail. Apple (AAPL) stunned media and tech observers by acquiring the Dr. Dre-led headphones company, Beats, for $3 billion several weeks ago. Google (GOOGL) is moving aggressively into the potentially lucrative territory of ""wearables"" by marketing its invention Google Glass.Meanwhile, Comcast (CMCSA) has made a bet that size and scale matter and are efficient ways to reduce expenses. The approach has long been a hallmark of this financially savvy broadcasting and cable giant. Comcast made big headlines earlier this year when it offered $45.2 billion to acquire rival Time Warner Cable (TWC), the latest piece of its strategy to achieve growth by acquisitions. Regulators are reviewing the deal.""What's remarkable about Comcast is that it once started out as a regional cable company — and now it has its name on Rockefeller Center,"" said Robert Thompson, a Syracuse University media professor who specializes in gauging the TV industry's impact on popular culture.By offering to buy Time Warner Cable, itself a huge player in the cable industry, the Philadelphia-based giant made a statement: We are quite content to build on its traditional strengths.Comcast is comfortable doing big deals to achieve growth. In 2011, it acquired NBCUniversal from General Electric and joined the heavyweights of network and cable TV broadcasting.There is no specific overlapping point in the U.S. where Comcast and Time Warner Cable compete with one another for customers. By the conclusion of 2013, Comcast and Time Warner Cable had roughly 21 million and 11 million Internet customers, respectively. As a combined entity, the pair would then command about two-thirds of the broadband cable market.Like every other large company in the media ecosystem, Comcast is trying to remain ahead of the curve today and, in the big picture, tomorrow and beyond.With so many entrepreneurs shaking the industry's foundation on a regular basis — remember both Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) are only a decade or so old — it's essential that players like Comcast plan for the next wave of change. For instance, look at how much social media has transformed the communications industry.""Social media has definitely redefined the industry,"" said Anton Beyer, CEO of Up Capital Management Inc., a wealth management and financial planning firm in Granite Bay, Calif. ""Comcast has to be paying close attention on how to adapt to these kinds of changes. The whole media world is up for grabs, and consolidation will be a big part of that story.""Comcast's long-term strategy is evident. ""Comcast is looking for synergies that will cut costs, rather than (exclusively) boost revenue, and cost synergies are much more reliable,"" said Paul Carroll, a principal in the Devil's Advocate Group, a technology-centric consulting firm.""Comcast is also sticking to its core business, rather than trying something new so the additional size would likely lead to efficiencies, not complexity and inefficiency,"" Carroll said.Doing What It Does BestFor a company with Comcast's pedigree and clout, it makes sense to concentrate on what you can do well. ""If I were running Comcast, I wouldn't be trying to figure out how to adapt my product to the new world or even figuring out what the new new world will be,"" said Sam Hill, co-author of ""Radical Marketing: From Harvard to Harley, Lessons from Ten That Broke the Rules and Made It Big.""Yes, the watchword in today's media industry is to branch out and tap new kinds of revenue streams. At the same time, Comcast has determined that the strategy of focusing on producing solid financial results is wise because it enables the company to have the resources to remain competitive for a long time.""Today, media companies have to choose between being either hip, or profitable,"" said Charles Haddad, a professor at the Stony Brook University School of Journalism. ""Few media companies are both. You don't get any hipper — or more relevant — than Twitter and its many copycats, but it has never earned a dime. Nor are its executives close to figuring that out. Ditto with Amazon.""Despite its financial strength, this is a challenging time for Comcast. Its takeover attempt still requires the approval of the U.S. government. Comcast's lobbyists in Washington, D.C. must have an answer for the outcry by consumer groups who question whether such a monopoly might eventually harm customers since so much power would rest in the hands of one company, Comcast.Fighting Image ProblemPlus, Comcast must resolve its image problems with consumers. It hasn't always boasted a stellar reputation for service. To be fair, perhaps this is bound to be an occupational hazard for a cable company because the public loves to complain about it. To be sure, Comcast gets its share of negative publicity.For instance, Comcast recently had to live down what a MarketWatch headline proclaimed as ""the Comcast call from hell."" The fracas occurred when a Comcast customer tried by phone to terminate his account, only to encounter a rather overzealous customer-service representative. The Comcast employee basically wouldn't hear of it and kept the customer on the phone for a much longer than was necessary. http://blogs.marketwatch.com/themargin/2014/07/15/have-you-ever-had-a-cancellation-asad-as-this-comcast-experience/Much of Comcast's future rests on whether the government will approve its takeover of Time Warner Cable. This proposed deal enables Comcast to continue to grow by taking advantage of its core businesses and providing for the long term.""Comcast is aiming at a sweet spot that should stay sweet for at least a decade,"" Carroll pointed out. ""That sweet spot is the connection to the Internet, that everyone these days treats as being as basic as having electricity and water. Cable is easily the fastest way to connect to the Internet — much faster than DSL and wireless — so those who own cable have a big advantage.""

3458,TAP,"Big-cap biotech Biogen Idec (BIIB) soundly beat analysts' Q2 expectations and substantially raised its guidance early Wednesday, sending shares up more than 11% in midday trading in the stock market today to near 338, a four-month high.Biogen's Q2 earnings rose 52% over the year-earlier quarter to $3.49 a share, topping analysts' consensus by 66 cents. Sales increased 40% to $2.4 billion vs. the Street's $2.16 billion.The company increased its full-year guidance for revenue growth to 38%-41%, up from its earlier guide of 26%-28% and analysts' average of 28.5%. Its EPS guidance is now $12.90-$13.10, more than $1.50 above its previous guidance. Analysts were expecting $11.53.The upside came largely from Tecfidera, the oral multiple-sclerosis drug approved in the U.S. last year and in Europe in early February. Management and analysts had expected the European launch to be slow because Novartis (NVS) had gotten into the market first with its MS pill Gilenya. However, on the conference call to discuss results, executives said the uptake in the European countries where it has gained reimbursement (mainly Germany at this point) is proceeding at a similar pace to the U.S.Total sales of Tecfidera outside the U.S. in the quarter were $115 million vs. consensus of $75 million. Domestic sales also outperformed, with a take of $585 million topping estimates by $100 million.Q2 also benefited from a one-time event. During the quarter, Biogen came to an agreement with the Italian National Medicines Agency that eliminated that country's reimbursement limit on Tysabri, an older MS drug, retroactive to February 2013. The recognition of this revenue added 15 cents to Q2 EPS.Amid all the good news, two items disappointed analysts. One was that sales, general and administrative spending was guided higher than expected, at 22%-23% of revenue. On the call, CFO Paul Clancy said this was necessary because of the unprecedented amount of drug launching underway. Not only is Tecfidera still rolling out, but also in Q2 Biogen launched its long-acting hemophilia drug Alprolix (which also beat expectations, with $10 million in sales vs. analysts' $4 million estimate) and just last week launched its hemophilia A counterpart Eloctate. The company is also preparing to launch a new interferon-based MS drug, Plegridy. On the call, Biogen CEO George Scangos said he'd just gotten word that Plegridy has been approved in the EU.The other disappointment was a delay in reporting results from a key clinical trial. For months, the Street has been buzzing about a Biogen pipeline product called anti-LINGO, which could be the first disease-altering treatment for MS. Analysts had expected 12-month results from a phase two trial to be out next year, but management said it will wait until 2016 to report 18-month results.Nonetheless, ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum was generally impressed, pointing out that this was the largest beat that Biogen had reported in 10 years.""Overall a really good call with no new disclosures that diluted the quality of the EPS/sales beat on the quarter,"" he wrote in an email to clients after the conference call.Biogen kicks off earnings for several top-rated biotechs. After Tuesday's market close, Gilead Sciences (GILD) is expected to report a 258% earnings per share on sales of its blockbuster Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Celgene (CELG) are on tap for Thursday.In other biotech news, Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) shot up 287% to 228.10 after the company reported surprisingly strong Phase 3 trial results for its breast cancer drug.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.RELATED:Biogen Shares Rebound As Street Has A Change Of Heart.

3506,TAP,"The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 16. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this consumer food and beverage marketer and manufacturer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Notably, Smucker has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 1.2% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store this time.J.M. Smucker Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  J.M. Smucker Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | J.M. Smucker Company (The) Quote Hurdles in Smucker’s PathSmucker has been witnessing year-over-year decline in bottom line for three straight quarters now, with results being impacted by higher freight costs. For the remainder of fiscal 2018, management expects a rise in freight costs, stemming from industry-wide headwinds. In fact, higher freight costs are anticipated to continue to play a spoilsport in the next fiscal as well. Also, volatile input prices has been a concern for the coffee segment.Coffee prices are highly volatile and are affected by weather, pest infestation, political decisions in coffee-producing countries, worldwide supply and demand, the relative strength of the dollar and speculative trading. Green coffee prices have been rising steadily for some time now, affecting the coffee segments profitability. During second-quarter 2018, profits from the U.S. Retail Coffee segment declined 18.2% due to higher costs of green coffee and unfavorable volume/mix impacts. The same also negatively impacted gross margin for said period. For the quarter under review, the consensus mark for sales and profit for the U.S. Retail Coffee stands at $541 million and $176 million, up from $538 million and $172 million reported in the same period last year, respectively.Apart from this, Smucker remains susceptible to fluctuation in the prices of input commodities such as oil, corn, wheat and soybean amongst others.Focus on Cost Savings & Strategic Partnerships to Fuel ResultsWhile these factors pose concerns for Smucker’s upcoming results, we remain encouraged by the company’s cost-saving efforts from its pet food synergy program. Notably, the company generated savings of roughly $200 million from this program in the last quarter, helping it witness higher profit at its U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment. For the third quarter, the consensus estimate for sales and profit for this segment is pegged at $557 million and $125 million, compared with $551 million and $126 million, respectively.Apart from this, the company plans to achieve $100 million of its $250 million cost-management program by the end of fiscal 2018. Moreover, we remain hopeful about solid prospects from the company’s impressive brands portfolio. Evidently, favorable net pricing for peanut butter and Smucker’s brand largely drove the top line in the second quarter. Other than this, strong performance of several key brands fueled sales in all segments except U.S. Retail Consumer Foods. For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales at this segment is pegged at $510 million, depicting a 1.4% dip from the year-ago figure. However, the consensus mark for profit at this segment is $123 million, representing a 3.4% upside from the year-ago profit.Final Thoughts & Q3 ExpectationsThough higher freight costs, industry headwinds and commodity cost inflation pose threats, Smucker’s focus on cost savings and efficient pricing across core segments should drive its performance in the third quarter. Also, Smucker’s concentration on innovations and alliances with companies such as Dunkin' Brands Group among many others should also yield results.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $2.16, which shows an upside of 8% from $2.00 recorded in the year-ago period. This estimate has trended upward by a notch in last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,888 million, up marginally by 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsTo top it, our proven model shows that Smuckeris likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Encouragingly, Smucker carries a Zacks Rank #3, and possesses an Earnings ESP of +0.84%, which makes us reasonably confident of yet another positive surprise.Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are other some companies that possess the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Ollie's Bargain (OLLI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.32% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

3507,TAP,"Treehouse Foods, Inc. (THS  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this packaged foods and beverages manufacturer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Treehouse Foods has a mixed record of earnings surprises, and has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2.1% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store this time.Treehouse Foods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Treehouse Foods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Treehouse Foods, Inc. Quote Factors Weighing on Treehouse FoodsTreeHouse Foods has been witnessing year-over-year declines in both the top and bottom line for two successive quarters now. In the last quarter, the company put a dismal show, with results not only down year over year, but the bottom line also lagging the consensus mark and management’s guidance. Earnings were marred by drab sales and gross margin, while sales bore the brunt of the divestiture of the SIF (Canned Soup and Infant Feeding) business that lowered revenues by approximately 2.9%.Also, the company has been battling industry hurdles like consumers changing preferences that has led to heightened competition and waning store traffic for many food companies. These factors, combined with increased promotional activities create considerable pricing pressure, which remains a threat to TreeHouse Foods’ volumes and profit margins. Evidently, third-quarter results were hurt by challenges related to pricing in certain segments (Baked Goods, Beverages and Meals). Also, sales at the Snacks segment declined owing to adverse volume/mix arising out of weak consumer trends and exit of low margin co-pack business.Additionally, higher freight and commodity costs weighed upon the company’s EBITDA (particularly the Beverages and Snacks segments). Owing to the aforementioned hurdles, direct operating income (“DOI”) margin in these segments contracted 610 and 480 bps, respectively in the quarter. Also, management expects the division DOI to have a considerable drag on the bottom line in 2017. Moreover, commodity and freight costs are likely to remain high in 2018 as well.Can TreeHouse 2020 Initiative Provide Respite?TreeHouse Foods announced TreeHouse 2020 strategic plan in second-quarter 2017. The plan has been designed to restructure and realign the business as a whole. Along with cost savings, the initiative is expected to improve management of the company’s category and customer portfolio, as well as optimize its supply chain.  The plan will be carried out through a series of phases in the next few years. Notably, this initiative is expected to improve the company’s operating margin by 300 bps by the end of 2020.Final Thoughts & Q4 ExpectationsWhile the company remains on track with its TreeHouse 2020 plan, management believes that it needs to take additional steps to enhance its position. Also, management expects the aforementioned headwinds to linger, which compelled it to curtail its earnings outlook for 2017, which also makes us apprehensive about fourth-quarter results. Adjusted earnings for the year are expected in the band of $2.70 to $2.80 per share. Additionally, management projected adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter in a range of 91 cents to $1.01 per share.Further, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 93 cents, which shows an 18.4% decline from $1.14 recorded in the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable in the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,686 million, down 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsTo top it, our proven model shows doesn’t conclude that TreeHouse Foods is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

3508,TAP,"Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 14.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading brewing company will be able to pull off a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s bottom line has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 27.8%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.For the fourth quarter, the consensus estimate of 56 cents moved down by a penny in the last 30 days. However, the estimate shows a year-over-year growth of 21.7% from 46 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter. Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Molson Coors Brewing Company QuoteFactors Likely to Impact 4Q17Molson Coors has been focusing on strengthening its brand portfolio, besides being one of the largest brewers in the world. Armed with a robust portfolio of well-established brands, it has been steadily progressing with growth of its above-premium segment. Impressively, the company has also been gaining share in the premium light segment in the United States through Coors Light and Miller Lite brands. We believe the company’s shift of focus on expanding the above premium category along with solid innovation program is likely to positively impact the upcoming quarter.Additionally, Molson Coors has undertaken restructuring initiatives to reduce overhead costs and boost profitability. Further, management has been focusing on initiatives to improve its supply chain network and build on efficiencies across the business to generate additional resources for investing in brand building and innovation. In 2017, the company plans to deliver more than $175 million in cost savings.Meanwhile, Molson Coors is expanding its global footprint and accelerating its international business through acquisitions and agreements. All these afore-mentioned initiatives are likely to drive the company’s top line. Analysts polled by Zacks expect sales of $2,597 million, up 13.2% from the year-ago period.Though the acquisition of the Miller global brands and improvements in some of the company’s key brands boosted sales in Europe and international regions, volumes continued to decline in Canada and in the United States in the previous quarter. Also, the company has been posting negative beer volumes in the United States and Canada for quite some time owing to tough industry conditions. Notably, aging population and strong competition from other alcohol beverages have been the main contributors to the declining state of the beer industry, which remains a concern for the quarter to be reported too.These headwinds have largely weighed upon the company’s share price movement. The stock has declined 22.9% against the industry’s growth of 11.2% in a year.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Nonetheless, our proven model shows that Molson Coors is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to be confident of an earnings surprise call.

3510,TAP,"Fossil Group, Inc. (FOSL  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 13. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this designer and manufacturer of accessories will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Fossil has outperformed bottom-line estimates in three out of the past four quarters, with an average beat of 23.04%. Let’s see what’s in store this time. Fossil Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Fossil Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Fossil Group, Inc. Quote Factors Weighing on FossilFossil has been witnessing soft sales in traditional watches for a long time now due to increased competition and rising demand for tech-savvy watches. Further, sales of leathers and jewelry have persistently been weak since past few quarters on account of soft demand. Well, these trends were clearly witnessed in the company’s third-quarter 2017 results, wherein jewelry and leather business sales fell 23% and 20% (on constant-currency basis) respectively, with declines across all three regions. Also, the company’s watch sales dropped 4% mainly due to sluggishness in the traditional category. Well, these concerns have been leading to dismal results for Fossil for more than two years now, with both the top and bottom line falling year-over-year.Efforts to Resonate With Evolving Demand Bodes WellFossil has been taking significant efforts to keep pace with the rising demand for tech savvy watches, Notably, Wearables represented more than 10% of the company’s sales in the third quarter, which nearly doubled from the year-ago quarter and also marked a sequential improvement. As the wearable business is expected to grow by $36 billion by 2020, Fossil Group remains poised to enrich its wearables portfolio by adding new brands to its smartwatch line up in 2018. Powered by Android Wear, these new brands will strengthen Fossil’s current portfolio with premium brands like Diesel, Emporio Armani, Fossil, Michael Kors and Misfit. Given the favorable consumer response and impressive performance from some key brands, management believes that wearables can play a key role in turning Fossil Group’s performance around. Thus, it also plans to undertake incremental marketing spending for this category.Final Thoughts & Q4 ExpectationsWhile the company has considerably expanded the Connected business, efforts to clear excess inventory continues to pressurize margins. Evidently, Fossil has been witnessing lower gross margin for a year now, primarily due to soft retail margins stemming from increased promotions to drive sales (in stores and e-commerce) as well as higher mix of connected products. Management expects obstacles related to increased promotions and unfavorable mix to dent gross margin in the fourth quarter. Also, Fossil Group continues to expect a challenging retail environment for its traditional watch category, which along with margin pressure compelled it to lower its 2017 forecasts.Expectations in NumbersFor 2017, Fossil Group now expects net sales to decline in the range of 8.5-10.5% and envisions the bottom line to lie in a range of a loss of 45 cents to earnings of 10 cents. For fourth-quarter 2017, the company expects net sales to decrease in the range of 3.5-11% and expects adjusted earnings in the range of 10-65 cents per share.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 39 cents, which shows a considerable decline from $1.36 recorded in the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable in last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $890 million, down 7.2% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsNevertheless, our proven model shows that Fossil Group is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

3511,TAP,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Molson Coors has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.7, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 22.7. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Molson Coors’ current PE ratio fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 35.1. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Molson Coors has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 16.8, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Molson Coors has a P/S ratio of about 1.7. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.6 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Molson Coors currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Molson Coors a solid choice for value investors.For example, the PEG ratio for Molson Coors is 2.2, a level that is lower than the industry average of 2.9. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 15.8, which is far better than the industry average of 22.7. Clearly, TAP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Molson Coors might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of B. This gives TAP a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been showing a bullish trend. First quarter 2018 has seen one estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the full year 2018 estimate has also seen three up and one down in the same time period.This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate, as the first quarter consensus estimate has risen by 7.7% in the past two months, while the 2018 estimate has inched up by 4.6%.Despite this bullish trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineMolson Coors is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 22% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock.

Notably, this marked the 13th consecutive quarter of earnings beat for the company.

Further, beer sales benefited from market share gains in United States during the Labor Day and Thanksgiving holidays.

This growth was backed by operating income improvement at the beer segment, offset by operating income decline at the wine and spirits business.

For the wine and spirits business, it now anticipates results to be at the lower end of the sales and operating income guidance ranges.The company now envisions adjusted earnings guidance in a range of $8.40-$8.50 per share, compared with previous guidance range of $8.25-$8.40.

3513,TAP,"Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 2. This global brewer has a mixed record of earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store for Molson Coors this time around. Molson Coors Brewing Company Price and EPS Surprise   Molson Coors Brewing Company Price and EPS Surprise | Molson Coors Brewing Company Quote Factors Likely to Impact the QuarterWe expect Molson Coors to continue gaining from its solid focus on cost savings, which have been driving year-over-year growth at its bottom line for nearly a year now. Notably, the company has been undertaking several restructuring initiatives to reduce overhead costs and boost profitability. These initiatives include closure of underperforming breweries, improving efficiencies in finance, administration and human resources and reducing labor and general overhead costs. Also, the company has been focusing on improving supply chain network and building on efficiencies across the business to generate additional resources to invest in brand building and innovation. These endeavors helped Molson Coors generate cost savings of more than $255 million in 2017 that surpassed its target by more than $80 million. Encouraged by this, management raised its three-year savings goal (up to 2019) to $600 million, which is likely to help the company expand its EBITDA margins. These dedicated efforts give out positive signals for the quarter to be reported as well.However, input cost inflation remains a concern, as management expects input cost inflation in 2018 to be nearly $50 million greater than 2017, on account of aluminum and diesel fuel among other inputs. Incidentally, for 2018, the company expects cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase in low-single-digits across all segments, except International. These factors may act as hurdles in the company’s upcoming release.Can Molson Coors Cheer Investors? Molson Coors’ top line has been gaining from focus on strengthening brand portfolio. Armed with a robust portfolio of well-established brands, the company has been steadily progressing with growth of its above-premium segment. Impressively, the company has also been gaining share in the premium light segment in the United States through Coors Light and Miller Lite brands. We believe the company’s shift of focus on expanding the above premium category along with solid innovation program is likely to positively impact the upcoming quarter.However, we remain cautious about the company’s U.S. volumes, which remained soft and ended up hurting Molson Coors’ overall worldwide brand volume as well as its financial volumes in the last reported quarter. In fact, Molson Coors has been posting weak beer volumes in the United States for quite some time owing to tough industry conditions. Consumers’ changing preferences, aging population and strong competition from other alcohol beverages have been the main contributors to the decline.A Look Back & Expectations for Q1Molson Coors ended 2017 on a superb note as in the fourth quarter, both the top and bottom line improved year over year and the latter also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were backed by sales growth in most regions (except United States), favorable global pricing, net pension benefits, greater royalty volumes, cost-saving benefits, MG&A efficiencies and cycling of indirect tax provision. However, the U.S. region continued with its dull volumes, as it witnessed a decline in both sales-to-retailers (STRs) volume and sales-to-wholesalers’ volume, which fell 3% and 1.5%, respectively. These factors pose concerns over the company’s top line for the quarter to be reported.For the quarter under review, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales in Central Europe to dip 1.8% year over year to $375 million. The consensus marks for net sales in Canada and International is pegged at $288 million and $66 million, compared to $291 million and $62 million reported in the year-ago period respectively. Also, the consensus estimate for U.S. sales stands at $1,734 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for overall revenues is $2,436 million, down from $2,449 million recorded in the year-ago period.Nevertheless, management remained impressed with its performance amid the tough market conditions. Given these factors, along with expected gains from tax reforms and focus on First Choice, we remain optimistic about Molson Coors prospects. Well, underlying tax rate for the year is likely to range 18-22%, which is considerably low and also makes us hopeful about first-quarter earnings. The Zacks analysts expect earnings for the quarter to grow 5.3% year over year to 80 cents. However, the estimate has gone down by 4 cents over the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t show that Molson Coors is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Molson Coors Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of -0.21% makes us less confident about earnings beat. In fact, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Church & Dwight (CHD  -  Free Report) a Zacks #3 Ranked stock, has an Earnings ESP of +0.52%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Colgate (CL  -  Free Report), a #3 Ranked company, has an Earnings ESP of +0.69%.Estee Lauder (EL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.50% and a Zacks Rank of 3.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                  It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3514,TAP,"Alcohol is hardly ever in bad taste, especially American whiskey’s popularity among the spirit enthusiasts continues unabated. This is evident from the U.S. Alcohol market’s expansion spree owing to rising demand and improving consumer spending. Among the host of diverse spirts, craft beer seems to be hogging the limelight at the moment, courtesy of its popular fan base and convenient size production. Per BMI Research, global spirits sales are expected to increase by 4.3% in 2018.In view of these above-mentioned tailwinds, the Beverages-Alcohol industry ranks among the top 45% (116 of 256) of all Zacks industries.The first-quarter 2018 earnings season has seen releases from nearly 87 S&P 500 members as of Apr 20. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the scenario looks quite compelling, with 82.8% of the members delivering positive earnings surprises and 67.8% trumping top-line expectations. In fact, the proportion of companies pulling off earnings and revenue beats is a stellar 62.1%.The momentum is likely to continue as total earnings for the S&P 500 index are still anticipated to increase 18.3% from the year-ago period on 7.7% growth in revenues. As the earnings season gets into groove, we expect the scenario to become much more transparent.Why the Consumer Staples Sector?Alcohol stocks form part of Consumer Staples sector. We believe the sector is well poised to grow on a buoyant U.S. economy driven by rising consumer confidence, improving consumer spending and an accelerating labor market. In fact, Consumer Staples sector carries a Zacks Rank #8, placing it at the top 50% among 16 Zacks sectors.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total first-quarter earnings for the sector are likely to grow 6.2% year over year with revenues expected to increase 2.8%. In fact, margins are also estimated to edge up 0.4% year over year.Notably, Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report), the world’s leading wine company has already released its earnings numbers on Mar 29. The company delivered better-than-expected quarterly results, witnessing margin expansions, significant market share gains, strong free cash flow and solid execution. As a result, it issued an upbeat outlook for fiscal 2019.Furthermore, our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock is combined with a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.All said, let’s take a look at the performance of a few alcohol stocks ahead of their earnings releases.The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) is slated to report its first-quarter 2018 results tomorrow. Although the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 10.6% last quarter, it pulled off a positive surprise in each of the trailing three quarters. Per the Zacks model, Boston Beer is unlikely to deliver earnings beat this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of +35.65 and a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), which makes our surprise prediction difficult.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Though the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents for the quarter remained stable in the last 30 days, it portrays a decline of more than 15% year over year. Also, it has been witnessing lower shipment volumes and depletions due to challenges in Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands along with soft hard cider category. However, management remains confident about its growth plan focused on cost-saving initiatives, long-term innovation and the revival of Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands. Moreover, Boston Beer’s brand-building efforts and initiatives to add new products bode well for the company’s top-line growth.Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 2. Though the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.7% last quarter, it recorded an average miss of 13.2% in the trailing four quarters. Per the Zacks model, the trend is likely to continue as Molson Coors’ Earnings ESP of -0.21% and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicate that it is unlikely to beat earnings. Also, the consensus estimate of 80 cents moved south by a penny in the last seven days but depicts year-over-year growth of 5.3%. Notably, the company has been gaining from its focus on above-premium brands, which form nearly 20% of its total annual brand volumes. Also, management is making efforts to gain share in the U.S. premium light segment through Coors Light and Miller Lite brands.Craft Brew Alliance, Inc. (BREW  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2. The company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history with a beat in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average of 275.9%. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of earnings beat, an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents for the quarter remained stable in the last 30 days and reflects a substantial improvement from a loss of 9 cents incurred in the year-ago quarter. Additionally, management remains optimistic on continuing growth momentum, strategic local brands and partnerships as well as bolstering revenue management and operational improvements. In fact, Kona’s potential of delivering robust growth in 2017 is also impressive.Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), alias AB InBev, is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 9. Although the company came up with a positive earnings surprise of 6.1% last quarter, it lagged earnings estimates in the preceding seven quarters. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of EPS. However, an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. Also, the consensus mark shows an improvement of 6.8% from the year-ago quarter despite the downtrend in the estimate in the last seven days. While AB InBev's fourth-quarter 2017 results marked a return to the positive earnings trajectory, it envisions a soft first quarter due to difficult comparisons, and phasing of marketing and sales initiatives. Nevertheless, robust brand portfolio and solid geographical reach remain major strengths. It also anticipates delivering strong top-line growth in 2018 backed by impressive brands performance and robust commercial plans.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

3515,TAP,"The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25. The company has been reeling under soft depletion trends due to persistent decline in the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands. However, we remain confident about Boston Beer’s three-point growth plan focused on cost-saving initiatives, long-term innovation, and the revival of Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands.A glimpse of the company’s earnings performance in the trailing four quarters shows that it has outpaced the estimates by an average positive surprise of 48.9%. Nevertheless, Boston Beer delivered a negative earnings surprise of 10.6% last quarter.The Boston Beer Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Boston Beer Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Boston Beer Company, Inc. QuoteAlthough the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents for the impending quarter remained stable in the last 30 days, the same reflects a year-over-year decline of 15.6%.So, let’s find out what’s in store for Boston Beer in the upcoming first-quarter earnings release.Things You Should KnowBoston Beer has been grappling with lower depletions and shipment volumes since last few quarters. In fact, volumes declined in all four quarters of 2017. Apparently, depletions fell 10% in the fourth quarter and 7% in 2017. Softness in depletion volumes mainly stems from the weakness in Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands as well as soft hard cider category.Depletions for the year-to-date period through the six-week period ended Feb 10, 2018, are estimated to have grown nearly 6% from the comparable year-ago period. Despite a bullish shipments and depletions outlook for 2018, the company expects volumes to be sensitive to innovations that might hurt top and bottom lines. Evidently, lower shipment volumes along with decline in depletion volumes marred sales in the previous quarter. As a result, top line declined 6% year over year.  Also, industry-wide challenges related to general softening of the craft beer and hard cider categories as well as increased entry of start-up brewers might hurt the company’s performance.Nevertheless, Boston Beer’s growth plan that includes the revival of the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands via its packaging, innovation, promotion and brand communication initiatives is encouraging. Also, it recently launched new-media campaigns for the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands and remains optimistic about other new innovative product such as Sam '76, Samuel Adams New England IPA. Further, management expects to sustain momentum for its Twisted Tea brand and gain leadership for Truly Spiked & Sparkling brand in the hard sparkling water category. Also, its cost-saving initiatives that led to margin expansion bode well.Notably, analysts surveyed by Zacks expect first-quarter revenues to be $172.1 million, up 6.5% year over year. Moreover, the estimate for shipment volume is likely to increase 5% from the year-ago period.In the past three months, Boston Beer has gained 19.1% against the industry’s decline of 2.7%. Robust initiatives led to the stock's impressive performance.Given these mixed aspects, let’s wait and see whether the company’s initiatives sail it through soft depletions and shipment volumes or these concerns will continue to persist.Zacks ModelOur proven model shows that Boston Beer is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Boston Beer’s Earnings ESP of +35.65% and Zacks Rank #3 make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Other Stocks Likely to Deliver Earnings BeatHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Hostess Brands, Inc.

3516,TAP,"Fears of an imminent U.S.-China trade war have shaken up a number of sectors. The beer industry too hasn’t been spared. President Donald Trump’s imposition of a 10% tariff on imported aluminum from China is likely to have a devastating effect on the U.S. beer industry. Given that most of the beer produced in the United States today is packaged in cans, aluminum tariffs will only make things difficult for the country’s beer industry.The tariffs certainly aren’t a good sign at a time when the U.S. beer industry is already witnessing a decline in domestic beer sales due to the changing preferences of consumers. Amid all these developments, the only good news is that U.S. craft beer exports rose in 2017.And, yes, most of the exports were to Canada, the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan), the U.K. and Western Europe. That said, the beer industry stands a critical juncture, where higher exports are being cheered but lower domestic sales and aluminum tariffs are denting the confidence of brewers. Let’s look at each of the good, the bad and the ugly sides of the U.S. beer industry in this tumultuous time.The Good: Craft Beer Export Rise  International distribution of craft beer continued to increase in 2017, with U.S. export volumes rising 3.6% to $125.4 million, according to The Brewers Association (BA). Canada remains the biggest market for craft beer export, accounting for 51.3% of total exports. The Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan) also witnessed robust growth of 7.4%.The U.K., Sweden, Korea, Australia are the second, third, fourth and fifth biggest markets, accounting for 10.5%, 6.7%, 4.6% and 3.8% exports, respectively. The U.K. market grew 7.1%, accounting for 10.5% of beer exports compared with 10.1% in 2016. The Western Europe market grew 1.3%. However, despite 2017 setting a record, export growth slowed for the third consecutive year. U.S. craft beer exports increased 37%, 16% and 4.4% in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.Now, coming to the country that is breathing fire, China accounts for a meager 2.5% of U.S. craft beer export. Given this scenario, U.S. craft beer exporters might not really worry if China concocts any tariff on beer. Canada, U.K. Sweden, France and Australia are still the biggest consumers of  Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report), Craft Brew Alliance, Inc. (BREW  -  Free Report) and Constellation Brands Inc (STZ  -  Free Report) and Diageo plc (DEO  -  Free Report), who export their beer in bulk.Moreover, the Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan) is being seen as lucrative market with its taste for craft beer developing over the last few years. Naturally, beer exporters will be looking to capture this market. Shares of Craft Brew Alliance, Constellation Brands, Diageo and Anheuser-Busch have increased 52.7%, 33.9%, 22.5% and 1%, respectively, in the last year.The Bad: Domestic Beer Sales DeclineWhile craft beer export is soaring, beer sales are struggling at home. Per Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau statistics published in a report by the Beer Institute (BI), the U.S. beer industry shipped 3.8 million fewer barrels in 2017 than 2016, reflecting a decline of 2.2%. According to Michael Uhrich, BI chief economist, this is “the largest percentage decrease in annual domestic beer shipment volume since 1954.” The question is, are Americans consuming less beer? Well, beer sales volume fell 1% in the United States in 2017.One of the primary reasons cited by analysts for this is that there is an increasing shift toward distilled spirits and wines, a category headwind. According to Vivien Azer, managing director and senior research analyst, Cowen and Co., consumers aged 21-34 were eight percentage points less likely to prefer beer than their 35-to-44-year-old counterparts. However, amid this decline in domestic sales, preference for craft beer to draught beer has increased. This is perhaps because consumers are going for authenticity with a good brand story and increased flavor selection. The only good sign is that 2018 started on a good note for the beer industry, with a 3% sales increase through the first four weeks, according to retail data provider IRI Worldwide. The Ugly: Aluminum Tariffs to Hurt Beer IndustryAmericans prefer their beer in cans. More than 50% of the beer produced in the United States is packaged in cans. And with Trump imposing 10% tariff on imported aluminum from China, the situation certainly looks grim. According to the BI, 10% aluminum tariff would amount to $347,700,000 on beverages sold in cans. Additionally, this might also result in a loss of 20,000 jobs.At the end of 2016, there were more than 53,000 breweries across the United States selling around 190 million barrels of beer. Of these, almost 60% of the beer is sold in aluminum packaging. United States currently imports around 52% of the aluminum used for manufacturing.Given this scenario, large breweries like Molson Coors, Anheuser-Busch, Craft Brew Alliance, Constellation Brands will have to spend more on producing aluminum beer cans. Moreover, foreign brands like Heineken NV (HEINY  -  Free Report) and Carlsberg AS (CABGY  -  Free Report) that have manufacturing units in the United States will have to bear the brunt of the 10% aluminum tariff. Heineken has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In ConclusionUndoubtedly, the U.S. beer industry is walking on a tight rope. Declining domestic beer sales coupled with the imposition of a 10% duty on imported aluminum has heightened their worries. High production cost of beer will result in either the companies losing revenues or the price burden being passed on to consumers. The second certainly doesn’t look a wise option given the dwindling domestic beer sales figure.The only bright spot is that Americans are very good at recycling and beer cans produced in the country today contain approximately 70% recycled aluminum. Moreover, a rise in craft beer exports certainly will give a boost to the confidence of brewers, which will try to focus on more lucrative markets. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

3517,TAP,"Global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 results, wherein both top and bottom lines fell year over year and the former also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, earnings came in line with the consensus mark, faring better than its three-quarter long trend of posting negative surprise.Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Molson Coors Brewing Company QuoteWhile the stock hasn’t moved much in the pre-market trading hours, Molson Coors’ shares have plunged 15.9% so far this year, as against the industry’s growth of 25.1%.Molson Coors’ adjusted earnings of $1.34 per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, though it dropped 3.6% from the prior-year figure of $1.39. The decline stemmed from lower financial volumes, increased amortization costs, elevated general and administrative and greater tax rate. This was partly compensated by improved net pricing and mix, reduced interest expense and cost savings.Delving DeeperNet sales (on pro-forma basis) dipped 2.1% to $2,883.2 million, which came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,000 million. The sales decline was accountable to lower financial volumes, partly offset by better global pricing; favorable mix; royalty volume and currency translations. On a constant currency basis, sales dropped 3%. While sales declined in United States, it witnessed improvements in all other regions. Notably net sales per hectoliter improved 2.9%, backed by better pricing and mix.Molson Coors’ worldwide brand volume inched up 0.6% to 25.5 million hectoliters in the quarter driven by robust growth in European and International regions. This in turn was backed by the addition of Miller global brands business as well as improvements in some of the company’s key brands. Financial volumes dipped 4.8% to 26.3 million hectoliters, whereas global priority brand volumes jumped 2.4%. Financial volumes were impacted by curtailments in wholesale inventories, brand volumes and contract brewing — which largely weighed upon U.S. and Canadian volumes.Underlying EBITDA was $679.7 million in the quarter, a slip of 0.4% from the year-ago period. Further, underlying EBITDA on a constant-currency basis went down by 1.2.Segment DetailsThe company operates through the following geographical segments.Canada: Molson Coors Canada net sales climbed 1% to $406.4 million in the quarter. Net sales per hectoliter grew 2% in local currency, driven by better pricing and brand mix. However, Canada brand volume declined 1.7% owing to soft domestic volumes, partly compensated by impacts of Miller brands. Financial volumes (which includes contract brewing volumes) fell 4.7% on account of lower wholesale inventories and soft contract brewing volume. The segment’s underlying EBITDA dipped 0.5% to $112.1 million.United States (MillerCoors): Molson Coors now has complete ownership rights to all the brands in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. market. Segment net sales (on pro-forma basis) decreased 5.5% to $1,892 million in the quarter. Domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned-distributor sales, improved 1.2%. This stemmed from favorable pricing, partly countered by negative mix. However, both U.S. domestic sales-to-retailers volume (STRs) and domestic sales-to-wholesalers volume (STWs) declined 2.9% and 7.2%, respectively. The former was accountable to soft volumes in Premium Light and Below Premium units. The segment’s underlying EBITDA grew 0.8% to $475.6 million thanks to higher net pricing, lower M&A costs and cost savings. This was partly offset by lower shipment volumes.Europe: The segment reported net sales growth of 9.5% to $561.2 million in the third quarter of 2017. Europe net sales per hectoliter grew 4.1% in local currency driven by positive mix and net pricing. While Europe brand volume increased 9.6% in the quarter, financial volume (including contract brewing and factored brands, excluding royalty volume) went up by 2.7%. Volumes were aided by contributions from Miller brands and strength in the company’s main and above-premium brands. Europe underlying EBITDA surged 13.6% to $140.3 million, backed by greater volume, favorable pricing and mix, higher net pension benefit and positive impacts from currency translations.International: Segment net sales almost doubled to $65.7 million in the quarter. Net sales per hectoliter fell 11.6%, owing to unfavorable sales mix, somewhat cushioned by improved pricing. Total International brand volume soared 64.7% in the quarter, on the back of Puerto Rico’s business transfer from MillerCoors, the inclusion of the Miller global brands, and growth of Coors Light, mainly in Latin America. International underlying EBITDA suffered a loss of $1 million in the quarter, narrower than the loss of $1.8 million a year ago. The improvement came on the back of higher volume and better pricing, though it was partly countered by increased M&A costs along with loss of the Japanese Modelo deal.Other Financial UpdatesThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $971.3 million and total debt of $12,319 million.Net cash from operating activities in the first three quarters of 2017 was $1,145.4 million, while underlying free cash flow was $836.4 million.OutlookManagement remains impressed with its year-to-date results, which is marked by global brand volume growth and higher net sales per hectoliter. Notably, the company’s focus on portfolio premiumization has helped it achieve better pricing and mix. Also, in the year so far, Molson Coors’ above-premium brands have jumped more than 20%, thus representing about 20% of the company’s global volume. Moreover, the company is witnessing enhanced EBITDA margins, thanks to its cost-saving efforts.Even amid tough North American conditions, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company remains on track to achieve its financial goals for 2017, alongside exceeding its cost savings and cash flow targets for the year. The company still envisions underlying EBITDA margin to rise by 30-60 bps (on an average annual basis) in the next 3 to 4 years. In fact, management expects EBITDA margin to grow in this range this year too.Further, Molson Coors anticipates generating cost savings of more than $175 million in 2017. Further, it expects to deliver underlying free cash flow of around $1.2 billion in 2017, (plus or minus 10%). Capital spending is now expected to be roughly $650 million, compared with the prior projection of $750 million. Effective tax rate for the year is likely to range from 26-28%, as compared with 24-28% guided earlier.Don’t Miss These Alcohol StocksThe Boston Beer Company, Inc.

3518,TAP,"Craft beer, which till some time back was a favorite with Americans, seems to be losing its appeal. According to market research firm IRI Worldwide, craft beer growth slowed in the first half of 2018 and the rest of the year doesn’t look good either. Moreover beer shipments from U.S. breweries too are down so far this year. An increasing number of Americans is opting for non-alcoholic beverages that have resulted in demand for energy drinks to shoot over the last few years.Understandably, this has made soft beverage manufacturing companies focus more on healthier drinks, especially non carbonated, low sugary and energy drinks. So much so, that even alcoholic drink manufacturers are focusing on non-alcoholic beverages.Craft Beer Losing AppealTill a few years back, craft beer was a favorite with Americans. However, with changing tastes and preferences of the new generation, the appeal for craft beer is fading. And the change seems to be more evident this year. According to the Beer Institute, beer shipments from U.S. breweries are already down 3.5% this year.Per IRI, worldwide sales of craft beer across large-scale retail stores grew only 1.7% in the first half of 2018. Interestingly, in 2002, beer comprised 54% of overall alcohol sales but in 2017 beer contributed only 46% of total alcohol sales. This is certainly taking a toll on prominent beer manufacturers like Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), which are struggling to cope with declining demand for beer.The reason for this sudden beer-apathy is the growing preference for healthier drinks. An increasing number of Americans is becoming health conscious, which has seen a decline in demand for carbonated beverages. The carbonated soft drink market has shrunk for 13 consecutive years now. Carbonated soft drinks volume fell 1.6% in 2017 and is projected to decline between 0.8% and 1.3% this year.Industry Swings Toward Non-Alcoholic and Energy DrinksThe global non-alcoholic beverage market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 5.5% between 2018 and 2023, according to Market Research Future. Analysts believe that growing consumer awareness and increasing interest in a healthier lifestyle is making people shun alcoholic and carbonated drinks.This has resulted in the energy drink market to grow at a rapid pace over the last few years. Energy drinks continue to outperform the overall soft drink market in terms of value. The global value of energy drinks reached more than $51 billion in 2017.Understandably, millennials are opting for healthier and non-alcoholic drinks, which has made not only soft beverages companies shift focus toward healthier drinks, but also beer manufacturers reorient their product line with low-alcohol content.Beer manufacturers like Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report), The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) and Craft Brew Alliance, Inc. (BREW  -  Free Report) are trying to come up with innovative products and adding new flavors that have less alcohol content. The Boston Beer Company recently launched Fuzzy Traveler Peach Shandy that is low on alcohol content. Craft Brew Alliance has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.On the other hand, almost all beverage companies like The Coca Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report), Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. , Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V (FMX  -  Free Report) and Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) are redesigning their portfolio along these lines.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3520,TAP,"Trump’s announcement that the United States will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports has become the latest cause of concern for the U.S. economy and Wall Street. The tariffs are likely to result in an increase in raw material cost for manufacturers that use these metals.Against this backdrop, with the help of an article published on npr.org, we highlight some sectors that could be impacted the most from the tariffs (read: Watch These ETFs as Trade War Risks Rise).AutoBoth steel and aluminum are vital to the production of cars and trucks sold in America and would push up the sale prices of those vehicles considerably. The American Automotive Policy Council believes that the change would put the U.S. auto industry at a ""competitive disadvantage.""However, the price hike won’t be the same for all. CNBC reported that General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) sees only a modest impact because it buys 90% of “steel for U.S. production from U.S. suppliers."" On the other hand, Honda Motor Co (HMC  -  Free Report) said that “imprudent tariffs imposed on imported steel and aluminum would raise prices on both domestic and imported products, thus causing an unnecessary financial burden on customers.”In this situation, First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund CARZ should be monitored closely. However, since the fund invests only 19.67% in the United States, severe threat to the product is unexpected (read: ETFs in Focus Post Automobile Earnings).Alternative EnergySolar projects, wind turbines and energy storage units are also likely to be pricier. The tariff could result in a hike in the cost of offshore platforms and pipelines. In any case, the Trump administration's 30% tariff on imported solar cells and modules was put into effect this year (read: Trump's Import Tariffs: ETF & Stocks in Focus).Now with extra price increases on steel and aluminum, “which are used in ground-mount and rooftop solar racking systems,” the sector could be hit hard. Alternative ETFs including Guggenheim Solar ETF (TAN  -  Free Report) and First Trust ISE Global Wind Energy Index Fund (FAN  -  Free Report) should thus be followed with extra caution (read: Alternative Energy ETFs to Gain From First Solar Q4 Results).AerospaceU.S. aerospace industry thrives on steel and aluminum imports to construct aircraft. About 80% of an aircraft is made of aluminum. Companies like Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) may come under pressure. Aerospace and defense ETFs like iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF XAR may also feel the pinch.CandyAluminum foils are used to wrap chocolates. So, the tariff could lead to high costs for Hershey Company HSY and Mondelez International Inc. MDLZ. ""Such a broad and sweeping order could have a negative impact on the entire U.S. economy, potentially costing U.S. jobs and ultimately, hurting American consumers through higher prices for everyday products,"" according to the Hershey spokesman, as quoted on npr.org.BeerLast but not the least, how can investors forget the beer industry? Imported aluminum is used to make beer cans. Companies like Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report), Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA (BUD  -  Free Report), Constellation Brands Inc (STZ  -  Free Report) and Diageo Plc (DEO  -  Free Report) may face the rising cost issue. At the same time, the announcement puts Spirited Funds/ETFMG Whiskey & Spirits ETF WSKY in focus.ConsumerAlong with most market watchers, we too believe that companies will try to pass on some cost escalation to consumers. As a result, consumer ETFs like iShares U.S. Consumer Services ETF IYC may get slightly hurt.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

3523,TAP,"Molson Coors Brewing Co (TAP  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Nov 1.Of late, the company has been focusing on strengthening its portfolio, especially in the beer category. The company has also been trying to expand its global footprint through acquisitions and agreements. These efforts are expected to positively impact the company’s top- and bottom-line performance in the upcoming quarterly results.We note that the company’s earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average negative surprise of 27.27%.What to Expect? Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter is currently pegged at $1.35 and has remained stable in the last seven days. Estimated earnings depict year-on-year growth of 31%. The bottom line is expected to benefit from the company’s ongoing cost-saving initiatives and synergies from the acquisition of its remaining stakes in MillerCoors.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect sales of $3,000 million, significantly higher than $948 million reported in the prior-year quarter. In the quarter under review, sales are expected to be driven by improved volumes across key market regions and in MillerCoors portfolio.Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Molson Coors Brewing Company QuoteFactors at Play In the United States, Molson Coors is expected to benefit from growth in its above-premium brands. Favorable pricing conditions are expected to positively impact the performance of the company in this region. Moreover, Molson Coors has been focusing on gaining share in the premium light segment in the United States through Coors Light and Miller Lite brands. In Europe, the company is expected to benefit from cost-saving initiatives. The Coors Light brand is also depicting strength in the region. Also, Molson Coors has been striving to strengthen its craft brewery in the European region.Although the acquisition of the Miller global brands has boosted sales in Europe and international regions, volumes in Canada have been dismal in the past. Nevertheless, the company expects improved performance in this region by focusing on Coors Light and Molson Canadian brands.In addition to improving its existing brands and minimizing costs, Molson Coors has also been venturing in newer product categories such as ready-to-drink beverages (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic).  These initiatives are expected to drive the company’s top-line performance and profits.Nevertheless, we note that Molson Coors’ performance is expected to be affected by currency headwinds, as a major portion of its revenues come from outside the United States. Moreover, aging population across key markets and stiff competition has also been limiting performance. As a result, shares of the company have been underperforming the industry in the past six months. Molson Coors’ shares have declined 14.1% as against the industry’s rally of 12.6%.What does the Zacks Model Unveil? Our proven model does not conclusively show that Molson Coors is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although Molson Coors carries a Zacks Rank #3, it has an Earnings ESP of -2.59%.

3524,TAP,"Just recently, Canada became the second nation to legalize the use of recreational marijuana after the Senate passed a bill with a vote of 52-29. Shortly after, Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, tweeted and praised the bill, saying ""It's been too easy for our kids to get marijuana and for criminals to reap the profits, today we change that.""With Canada now on the radar for legal marijuana, companies are looking to expand and use that to their advantage. According to Huffington Post, the brewing company Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) has reportedly been in talks with several cannabis companies in Canada. This is because Molson Coors plans to create marijuana infused beers in order to turn around the company’s declining beer sales.Since the legalization of marijuana use in states, many people have started substituting cannabis for beer. According to Forbes, the beer industry could lose more than $2 billion in retail sales due to legal marijuana. Now that it is legal in Canada, companies are finding ways to prevent marijuana from outshining beer sales and looking to find ways to equal them out.Constellation Brands Inc. v Molson Coors Last year, a similar deal was made between the Corona beer seller, Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report), where it took a 9.9% stake in the Canadian medical marijuana company, Canopy Growth (CGC  -  Free Report). The stake was worth $191 million. Rob Sands, the CEO of Constellation Brands, said that their company’s success is the result of identifying early consumer trends. However, according to Fortune, Constellation may plan to sell their drink product in Canada as well. This could mean future competition between the two companies, seeing as they will be releasing similar products in the same market. However, not only does  Molson have the Canadian market under its belt, but it also has the potential to have major exposure in the North American market, seeing as it is the number two beer seller in both Canada and the United States. Although there are risks of combining cannabis and beer industries, Chris Burggraeve, the former chief marketing officer at AB Inbev (BUD  -  Free Report), said that companies who don’t include stoners in their marketing are going to be left in the dust.Looking at the stock movement of Molson Coors and Constellation Brands, it’s clear that STZ has been doing quite better than TAP. Over the past year, shares of STZ have gained around 25% while shares of TAP of have lost over 20% in the same time period. STZ has also performed better than the S&P 500 as well, which has gained about 11.6% in the last year.Currently, Molson Coors is a #5 (Strong Sell) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of ‘D,’ while Constellation Brands is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of ‘B.’What Does this Mean for Molson Coors? Since Molson Coors’ main market is Canada, there could be some competition if Constellation Brands decides to distribute its cannabis infused beer in the same market. Even though a similar product has already been established by another brewing company, if Molson Coors can pull it off right, it will be the first company in Canada to release a cannabis infused beer product.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3525,TAP,"Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom line improved year over year and the latter also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Further, the company exceeded its cost-savings target for the year, encouraging management to raise its three-year target for 2019.The solid results helped this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock gain 2.7% in the pre-market trading hours. Let’s see if this can bring a turn around to the stock’s otherwise drab performance. Well, Molson Coors’ shares have plunged 22.5% in a year, as against the industry’s growth of 14%. Molson Coors’ adjusted earnings of 62 cents per share surged 31.9% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents. The upside is attributable to favorable global pricing, net pension benefits, MG&A efficiencies and indirect tax provision cycling. However, this was partly countered by reduced volumes, inflation, greater underlying tax rate and investments in global business capacities. Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Molson Coors Brewing Company Quote Delving DeeperNet sales (excluding excise taxes) advanced 4.5% to $2,579.6 million but was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,597 million. The sales growth was backed by better global pricing, royalty volume, cycling of indirect tax provision and currency translations, somewhat negated by soft financial volumes. On a constant currency basis, net sales climbed 2.4%. While sales declined in the United States, it witnessed improvements in all other regions. Notably net sales per hectoliter improved 5.8% (up 3.7% on a constant-currency basis), on the back of the same factors that drove net sales.Molson Coors’ worldwide brand volume inched lower by 1.1% to 22.4 million hectoliters owing to soft U.S. and International volumes, partly compensated by strength in European and Canadian regions. Global priority volumes dipped 1.9%, while financial volumes slipped 1.2% to 23.1 million hectoliters. Financial volumes were hurt by softness in United States.Underlying EBITDA was $480.3 million in the quarter, marking a 17% jump from the year-ago period. Further, underlying EBITDA ascended 14.3% on a constant currency basis.Segment DetailsThe company operates through the following geographical segments.Canada: Molson Coors Canada net sales rose 7.1% to $352.9 million in the quarter. Net sales per hectoliter grew 1% in local currency, driven by better pricing, partly countered by unfavorable sales mix. Further, Canada brand volume climbed 0.8%, thanks to increased sales of craft and import brands. Financial volumes (which includes contract brewing volumes) inched up 1%. Underlying EBITDA fell 4.2% to $79 million due to higher COGS, partly made up by better pricing; favorable currency and reduced MG&A costs.United States (MillerCoors): Molson Coors now has complete ownership rights to all the brands in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. market. Segment net sales (on pro-forma basis) decreased 0.6% to $1,724.7 million. Domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned-distributor sales, improved 1.4%. This stemmed from favorable pricing, partly countered by negative mix. However, U.S. domestic sales-to-retailers volume (STRs) and domestic sales-to-wholesalers volume (STWs) declined 3% and 1.5%, respectively. The former was accountable to soft Premium Light volumes. The segment’s underlying EBITDA grew 4.9% to $346 million thanks to higher net pricing, lower M&A costs and cost savings. This was partly offset by reduced STW volumes and COGS inflation.Europe: The segment reported net sales growth of 29% to $473.2 million in the quarter. Europe net sales per hectoliter jumped 16.3% in local currency driven by positive mix, inclusion of export brand and royalty revenues and cycling of indirect tax provision. Additionally, Europe brand volume improved 10.4% in the quarter, whereas financial volume (including contract brewing and factored brands, excluding royalty volume) went up by 2.7%. Brand volumes were aided by strength in above-premium brands, transfer of royalty and export brand volumes into this segment from the International segment. Underlying EBITDA surged considerably year over year, from $28.1 million to $102.7 million.International: Segment net sales surged 19% $71.4 million. Net sales per hectoliter grew 6.1%, courtesy of changes in sales mix and better pricing. However, International brand volume plunged 15.1% in the quarter, marred by transfer of export and royalty volumes to European segment and Modelo contract loss in Japan. This was partly cushioned by inclusion of Puerto Rico’s business from MillerCoors and growth in various markets of Latin America. Segment underlying EBITDA came in at $0.4 million in the quarter, much lower than $1.4 million the year-ago period. This was accountable to increased MG&A costs associated with Miller International’s addition, loss of the Modelo deal and transfer of export and royalty volumes to Europe.Other Financial UpdatesThe company’s net cash from operating activities in 2017 came in at $1.866 billion, while underlying free cash flow was $1.449 billion. Underlying free cash flow jumped 67.8% year over year.The company ended 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $418.6 million and net debt of $10.895 billion. Notably, the company’s net debt declined substantially from the beginning of 2017. The company also made contributions to its defined-benefit pension plans during the year thus moving ahead with its deleveraging targets.Notably, the company generated cost savings of more than $255 million in 2017, that surpassed its target by more than $80 million. Encouraged by this, the company raised its three-year savings goal to $600 million, which is expected to be generated by 2019.OutlookManagement remains impressed with its 2017 results, which was marked by enhanced top line, global brand volume growth and higher net sales per hectoliter, even amid tough market conditions. Notably, the company’s focus on portfolio premiumization and revenue management have been paying off. Also, the company enhanced its financial position by paying down debt and increased market share in Canada and Europe, while it also exceeded its cost-savings and free cash flow target. Moreover, Molson Coors optimized commercial expenditure, which helped it deliver solid net income and underlying EBITDA growth in 2017.Further, the company remains committed toward First Choice, and remains focused on strengthening its brand portfolio. Given these factors, along with focus on achieving cost savings and solidifying balance sheet, we remain optimistic about Molson Coors ongoing prospects.For 2018, Molson Coors anticipates generating cost savings of roughly $210 million. Further, it expects to deliver underlying free cash flow of around $1.5 billion in 2018, (plus or minus 10%). Capital spending is expected to be roughly $670 million (plus or minus 10%). Underlying tax rate for the year is likely to range from 18-22%, thanks to the latest tax reforms.Molson Coors expects 2018 to also be impacted by new revenue recognition standard (which became effective in 2018 beginning) and the updated pension guidance.Don’t Miss These Consumer Staples StocksBoston Beer (SAM  -  Free Report) with a solid earnings surprise history, sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

3526,TAP,"Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) has been in troubled waters for quite some time now as evident from its dismal earnings and sales surprise history. Lower volumes and significant currency headwinds amid difficult economy and competitive pressure have been the other major dampeners.If we analyze the share price performance of the company over the last six months, we note that the stock has underperformed both the industry and the broader Consumer Staples sector in the said time frame. The stock has declined 6.3% against the industry’s gain of 10.4%. Meanwhile, the sector, of which they are part of, has improved 7.3%. Let’s now take a closer look at the challenges that the company is grappling with rendering it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Weak Earnings and Sales TrendMolson Coors does not have a good track record of earnings. The company has reported negative earnings surprises in five of the trailing seven quarters. Sales have also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 10 out the last 14 quarters.Downward Estimate RevisionThe company has also seen significant downward estimate revision following the lower-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is going down 21.8% to $4.35 in 2017 and down 20.2% to $4.77 in 2018 in the past seven days.Continued Decline in VolumesMolson Coors has been struggling with weak sales volume trends in U.S., Canada and Europe for the last few years. Though the acquisition of the Miller global brands has boosted sales in Europe and international regions, volume continued to decline in Canada.Among the core brands, while Miller Lite and Staropramen brands witnessed volume growth, Carling volume in Europe decreased by 2.6% during second-quarter 2017 and Coors Light global brand volume decreased 2.2% due to lower brand volume in the U.S. and Canada, slightly offset by strong growth in Europe and International. The declines in Canada are attributed to the overall weak industry performance along with the ongoing competitive pressure in Quebec and Ontario and a continued shift in consumer preference to value brands in the West. Molson Canadian volume in Canada also decreased 5.5% in the quarter due to overall weak industry conditions and competitive pressures in the West and Ontario.Since 2001, the premium beer segment in Canada has been gradually losing volume to the above premium and value segments. Aging population, a stalled economy and strong competition from other alcohol beverages led to the decline. The termination of the Modelo brands agreement in Canada in Feb 2014 also resulted in volume decline. In the U.S., the company suffered declines due to reduced labor participation rates and lower consumer confidence.Though economic conditions improved slightly, competition from outside the beer category persisted. In Europe, the company witnessed volume declines since 2013, as volumes continued to shift from the higher margin on-premise channel to the lower margin off-premise channel. The loss of the Modelo brands in the U.K. in 2015 is also contributing to lower volume.Weak EBITDA MarginsCNBC had pointed weak EBITDA guidance during investors meeting in June. Per reports, the company now expects underlying EBITDA margins to grow 30–60 bps per year for the next three to four years. This is weaker than the company’s previous expectation of 50–60 bps per year for the next three years, as announced during earnings conference.Foreign Currency HeadwindsWith a major portion of its revenues coming from outside the U.S., the company’s profits are being affected by currency headwinds due to the recent weakening of many foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Unfavorable foreign currency translations impacted sales by more than $180 million in 2016 and will continue to negatively impact the company’s profits in the near term.Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Molson Coors Brewing Company QuoteBottom LineMolson Coors’ management is leaving no stone unturned to bring the stock back on growth trajectory. The company is focusing on increasing its marketing for beers and targeting above-premium brands to help grow its market share.Further, the company’s recent agreements with Heineken and Hornell Brewing are in line with Molson Coors’ current business expansion initiatives and are expected to enhance its portfolio. However, whether these ongoing initiatives will be able to spark a turnaround in the company’s performance is a wait-and-watch story.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the same space may consider some better-ranked stocks like Inter Parfums, Inc. (IPAR  -  Free Report), Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NUS  -  Free Report) and Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report), all are carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Inter Parfums has an average positive earnings surprise of 15.6% over the last four quarters. It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.3%.Nu Skin has an average positive earnings surprise of 10.8% over the last four quarters. It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%.Constellation Brands has an average positive earnings surprise of 11.7% over the last four quarters. It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 18.2%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

3527,TAP,"Trade war fears between the United States and its trading partners have been rife since March. Trump’s announcement in early March that the United States will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports first spooked the market.The situation eased a little when Trump administration granted a temporary relief from tariffs to some of its key allies like European Union, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Australia, Brazil and South Korea. However, China was not part of that exemption and a tussle over trade with China has been going on since March (read: ETFs to be Impacted by Trump's Tariff Exemptions).Trump Flip-Flops on Trade United States and China announced a $50-billion import tariff on each other, only to put the war “on hold” for a while. Then again, at May-end, Washington announced a 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of goods from China and imposed new limits on Chinese investments in the United States (read: Trump, Tariff & Geopolitics Lead May: 10 Top ETF Stories).Plus, tariffs on metal imports from the EU, Canada and Mexico will be put into effect from Jun 1, as exemption offered earlier in the year lapsed. Needless to say, the United States now needs to be prepared for a chain of tit-for-tat tariffs on a range of products.Retaliations in Cue Mexico has already retaliated by levying measures on U.S. farm and industrial products, targeting pork legs, apples, grapes and cheeses. Investors should note that about 22% of U.S. pork is exported out of which Mexico buys the maximum.Canada plans to slam retaliatory tariffs on $12.8 billion worth of U.S. exports and contest the steel and aluminum tariffs under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO), per Reuters. The EU is also planning a legal challenge via the WTO.Against this backdrop, we highlight some industries that could be impacted the most by the tariffs.Food and Meat Producers The S&P 500 Packaged Foods and Meats index shed about 2% on the retaliation news, per Reuters. A professor of agricultural economics at Purdue expects this tariff along with supply glut in the meat market to cause average losses for U.S. hog farmers of about $9 per animal in 2018 and $13 in 2019. No wonder, Tyson Foods Inc. TSN, processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork, lost about 4.3% on May 31 on Mexico’s tit-for-tat tariff announcement.  Food and beverage companies like Kraft Heinz Company KHC (down 2.3% on May 31) and Hormel Foods Corporation HRL (down 3.4% on May 31) also featured in the losers’ list.Consumer Staples ETFs like First Trust Nasdaq Food & Beverage ETF FTXG, First Trust Consumer Staples AlphaDEX Fund (FXG  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Agribusiness ETF MOO and PowerShares Dynamic Food and Beverage (PBJ  -  Free Report) and S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples Portfolio (RHS  -  Free Report) have exposure to the afore-mentioned companies and could thus be hit hard.Semiconductor U.S. chipmakers have the largest sales exposure to China. So, renewed tariff tensions with China could bring back pain in the semiconductor space. iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) was down about 0.7% on May 31 (read: 4 Best Performing Sector ETFs of May).AerospaceU.S. aerospace industry thrives on steel and aluminum imports to construct aircraft. About 80% of an aircraft is made of aluminum. Companies like Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) (down 1.7%) and Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) (down 1.9%) may come under pressure.Also, China is a key market for Boeing where it serves as the largest exporter of America. So, any tension with China doesn’t bode well for Boeing. Aerospace and defense ETFs like iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR  -  Free Report) may also feel the pinch.CandyAluminum foils are used to wrap chocolates. So, the tariff could lead to higher input costs for Hershey Company HSY (down 1.7%) and Mondelez International Inc. MDLZ (down 0.9%).BeerImported aluminum is used to make beer cans. Companies like Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) (down 1.1%) and Constellation Brands Inc. STZ) (down 0.8%) may face the rising cost issue. At the same time, the announcement puts Spirited Funds/ETFMG Whiskey & Spirits ETF  in focus.Auto Both steel and aluminum are vital to the production of cars and trucks sold in America and would drive the sale prices of those vehicles considerably. Also, the Trump administration has initiated a national security investigation into auto imports. All these put First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund (CARZ  -  Free Report) in an edgy spot (read: U.S. Auto Tariff Risk Put These ETFs and Stocks in Focus).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

3528,TAP,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2.8% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is TAP due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Molson Coors Q1 Earnings Lags Estimates, Slumps Y/YMolson Coors reported dismal results for first-quarter 2018. Molson Coors’ earnings of 48 cents per share crashed about 40% year over year and came way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents. The slump is accountable to indirect tax provision benefit cycling, soft financial volumes, unfavorable global mix and input cost inflation. This was partly compensated by cost savings, improved pricing and reduced interest costs.Net sales fell 4.8% to $2,331.5 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,436 million. The sales decline stemmed from soft financial and royalty volumes, unfavorable global mix, impact of indirect tax provision cycling in Europe and adoption of a new revenue recognition accounting standard. This was somewhat cushioned by positive currency translations and better pricing. On a constant currency basis, net sales tumbled 7.2%.Notably net sales per hectoliter inched up 0.1% on a reported financial-volume basis, while it dipped 2.6% on a constant-currency brand-volume basis, owing to the same factors that hurt net sales.Molson Coors’ worldwide brand volumes inched lower by 3.1% to 19.1 million hectoliters, owing to soft U.S., International and Canada volumes. Global priority brand volumes dipped 5.6%, while financial volumes declined 4.9% to 20.8 million hectoliters. Financial volumes were hurt by lower brand volumes, wholesale inventories and contract brewing.Underlying EBITDA was $426 million in the quarter, marking an 18.5% drop from the year-ago period. Further, underlying EBITDA slumped 19.7% on a constant currency basis due to the factors that weighed on underlying earnings per share.Segment DetailsThe company operates through the following geographical segments.Canada: Molson Coors Canada net sales dipped 2.5% to $283.8 million in the quarter. Net sales per hectoliter slipped 2.9% in local currency due to adoption of new revenue accounting standard. Further, Canada brand volumes fell 3.3% on account of soft industry performance as well as elevated inventories at Quebec. Financial volumes (which include contract brewing volumes) descended 4.8% as both brand volumes and contract brewing volumes decreased. Underlying EBITDA jumped 2.5% to $44.7 million, thanks to favorable currency and sales mix, partly negated by soft brand volumes and lower pricing.United States: Molson Coors now has complete ownership rights to all the brands in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. market. Segment net sales dropped 5.8% to $1,647.8 million. Domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned-distributor sales, improved 1.1% on a brand-volume basis despite being hit by change in revenue accounting standard. The upside stemmed from favorable pricing, partly countered by negative mix. However, U.S. brand volumes decreased 3.8% accountable to soft Premium Light volumes. In fact, sales-to-wholesalers volumes (STWs), excluding contract brewing volumes, declined 6.7%, mainly as a result of U.S. industry headwinds and unfavorable timing of wholesale inventories. The segment’s underlying EBITDA plunged 12.2% to $388.9 million thanks to reduced STW volumes, COGS inflation, unfavorable mix sales and reduced volumes. Better pricing, lower MG&A costs and cost savings provided some respite.Europe: The segment reported net sales decline of 1.9% to $374.3 million in the quarter. Europe net sales per hectoliter went down 18.3% in local currency due to cycling the gain from indirect tax provision, along with the impact of updated excise-tax rules in the European market. This was partly offset by improved sales mix. Europe brand volumes showed slight improvement, courtesy of growth across some above-premium brands. This also led to increased market share. Financial volumes (including contract brewing and factored brands, excluding royalty volumes) went up by 1%. Underlying EBITDA plunged 65.2% year over year to $24.5 million.International: Segment net sales tumbled 7% to $57.5 million. Net sales per hectoliter, on a brand-volume basis, dipped 0.5% on a currency-neutral basis. Improved pricing couldn’t offset losses from lower sales mix. Further, International brand volumes shrank 7.1% in the quarter, marred by loss of Modelo contract loss in Japan and soft volumes in Mexico. This was partly cushioned by organic growth in various important markets. Segment underlying EBITDA came in at $7.1 million in the quarter, higher than $5 million in the year-ago period. This was backed by decreased MG&A costs and improved pricing.Other Financial UpdatesMolson Coors ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $197.9 million, whereas net debt stood at $10.920 billion.The company’s net cash from operating activities in the quarter came in at $315.2 million, which marks a significant improvement from the year-ago period. The company used underlying free cash flow of $195.1 million.OutlookMolson Coors remains committed toward achieving margin growth, bottom-line improvement and solid free cash flow. Also, the company aims to augment top line through its First Choice commercial excellence plans. The company also remains focused on disciplined capital allocation, driven by its Profit after Capital Charge, or PACC approach. With its regional plans in line with these strategic priorities, management remains optimistic about its 2018 goals.Management retained its previously issued forecasts for 2018. Molson Coors continues to anticipate generating cost savings of roughly $210 million in 2018, while it expects cost savings to reach $600 million by 2019. Further, it expects to deliver underlying free cash flow of around $1.5 billion in 2018, (plus or minus 10%). Capital spending is expected to be roughly $670 million (plus or minus 10%). Underlying tax rate for the year is likely to range from 18 to 22%, thanks to the latest tax reforms.Molson Coors expects 2018 to remain impacted by new revenue recognition standard (which became effective in 2018 beginning) and the updated pension guidance.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to three lower.Molson Coors Brewing Company Price and Consensus Molson Coors Brewing Company Price and Consensus | Molson Coors Brewing Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, TAP has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a D.

If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for value and growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

3531,TAP,"Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) reported dismal results for first-quarter 2018 – which usually generates lowest profits for the company in comparison to other quarters. During the first quarter of 2018, both top and bottom lines dropped year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  Results were hampered by impacts from cycling of indirect tax provision benefit in Europe, which lowered net sales and pre-tax income by about $50 million. However, this was a quarter-specific hurdle. Results also bore the brunt of overall softness in the U.S. beer space, as well as lower U.S. sales to wholesalers (STWs) volumes.The dismal show weighed on investors’ sentiment, as Molson Coors’ shares are down 5.2% in the pre-market trading hours. Also, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has plunged 19.5% in a year, as against the industry’s growth of 10.4%. Molson Coors’ earnings of 48 cents per share crashed about 40% year over year and came way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents.

Financial volume (including contract brewing and factored brands, excluding royalty volume) went up by 1%. Underlying EBITDA plunged 65.2% year over year to $24.5 million.International: Segment net sales tumbled 7% $57.5 million. Net sales per hectoliter, on a brand-volume basis, dipped 0.5% on a currency-neutral basis. Improved pricing couldn’t offset losses from lower sales mix. Further, International brand volume shrank 7.1% in the quarter, marred by loss of Modelo contract loss in Japan and soft volumes in Mexico. This was partly cushioned by organic growth in various important markets. Segment underlying EBITDA came in at $7.1 million in the quarter, higher than $5 million in the year-ago period. This was backed by decreased MG&A costs and improved pricing.Other Financial UpdatesMolson Coors ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $197.9 million, whereas net debt stood at $10.920 billion.The company’s net cash from operating activities in the quarter came in at $315.2 million, which marks a significant improvement from the year-ago period. The company used underlying free cash flow of $195.1 million.OutlookMolson Coors remains committed toward achieving margin growth, bottom-line improvement and solid free cash flow. Also, the company aims to augment top line through its First Choice commercial excellence plans. The company also remains focused on disciplined capital allocation, driven by its Profit after Capital Charge, or PACC approach. With its regional plans in line with these strategic priorities, management remains optimistic about its 2018 goals.Management retained its previously issued forecasts for 2018. Molson Coors continues to anticipate generating cost savings of roughly $210 million in 2018, while it expects cost savings to reach $600 million by 2019. Further, in 2018, it expects to deliver underlying free cash flow of around $1.5 billion in 2018, (plus or minus 10%). Capital spending is expected to be roughly $670 million (plus or minus 10%).

3532,TAP,"Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) has emerged as a strong contender in the beverages – alcohol space, thanks to its spectacular earnings history, sound fundamentals and long-term EPS growth rate of 18.2%. So, let’s take a closer look at the factors that have been driving this New York-based company.  Superb Earnings History & Outlook Indicate Solid ProspectsConstellation Brands’ bottom line has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 11.7% in the trailing four quarters. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company marked its 11th consecutive positive earnings surprise and 16th straight quarter of year-over-year improvement. Results benefited from Constellation Brands’ efforts to drive demand for its impressive brands. Also, results were backed by contributions from acquisitions along with continued strength in the company’s beer business in particular. Moreover, lower cost of goods sold, improved pricing and volumes boosted margins in the quarter. Notably, the company has delivered gross and operating margin growth in the trailing four quarters.These factors, along with confidence in its beer business encouraged management to raise its earnings view for fiscal 2018, clearly underscoring its solid prospects. The company now envisions adjusted earnings guidance in a range of $7.90–$8.10 per share, compared with its previous guidance range of $7.70–$8.00.Strong Beer Business Remains a Growth DriverAs mentioned above, Constellation Brands has been gaining immensely from its beer business. Notably, the company was the highest growth contributor in the U.S. beer category for the fourth straight year, in fiscal 2017. In the last reported quarter, sales at this segment improved 8%, thanks to higher volumes and favorable pricing. Further, beer sales were backed by the company’s solid brands which witnessed depletions of nearly 12%.  Apart from this, Constellation Brands is focused on expanding in the craft beer space, which has become a solid growth avenue in the beer space. In this regard, management expects solid results from its Ballast Point craft beer brand, which is currently placed among the top 20 craft brands nationwide. Apart from Constellation Brands, other industry players like Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), The Boston Beer Company Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) and Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) have also made attempts to grow in the craft beer space.Coming back to Constellation Brands, the company raised its fiscal 2018 operating income target for its beer segment, now anticipating it to grow 13–15%, compared with the prior guidance of 11–13%.Robust Brands & Focus on Buyouts Bodes WellConstellation Brands has a formidable portfolio of well-known brands and is the largest wine company in the world. The company remains focused on expanding operations directed toward achieving business growth. Incidentally, last week, the company announced the acquisition of Funky Buddha Brewery, a leading craft brewery in Florida. This move is aimed at strengthening its position in the high-end beer segment in the U.S. The company’s buyout of Obregon Brewery to bolster its high-end Mexican beer portfolio, is another evidence of its focus on achieving growth via acquisitions. Moving to its spirits and wines business, Constellation Brands acquired America’s highest rated Schrader Cellars in June 2017 to enhance this portfolio. Moreover, in fiscal 2017, the company acquired and integrated High West Distillery, Charles Smith Wines and The Prisoner Wine Company brands, which marked its entry in the premium craft whiskey space.Well, we believe that these factors, along with healthy cash flows and shareholder-friendly moves are likely to help Constellation Brands maintain its spot in investors’ portfolio.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

3533,TAP,"Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) has been off investors’ radar for quite some time now, owing to persistent softness in U.S. beer volumes and escalated input costs. Given these factors, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has lost 20.5% in the past three months, wider than the industry’s 8.7% decline.These hurdles also weighed on Molson Coors’ first-quarter 2018 results, following which the company has seen its shares tumble 13.5%. So, let’s delve deep into these obstacles and see if they are likely to persist.Will Molson Coors Remain Troubled?Molson Coors has been posting weak beer volumes in the United States for quite some time, owing to tough industry conditions. Consumers’ changing preferences, aging population and strong competition from other alcohol beverages have been the main contributors to the decline. During the first quarter of 2018, Molson Coors continued to witness softness in the U.S. beer industry hurting overall top and bottom line of the company.During the quarter, the U.S. region reported net sales decline of 5.8% to $1,647.8 million, with U.S. brand volumes down 3.8% accountable to soft Premium Light volumes. Also, sales-to-wholesalers volume (STWs) remained soft, which declined 6.7% mainly as a result of overall U.S. industry headwinds and unfavorable timing of wholesale inventories. The segment’s underlying EBITDA also plunged 12.2% to $388.9 million, thanks to reduced STW volumes, COGS inflation, unfavorable mix sales and reduced volumes.Apart from this, the company has been battling input cost inflation for a while now, especially due to aluminum and fuel costs. Management expects these hurdles to linger in 2018. The company reiterated its previously issued COGS per hectare outlook for the United States and Canada.For 2018, the company expects cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase in low-single-digits across these segments. In fact, it anticipates increased cost pressure in Europe now, owing to rising costs of key inputs like aluminum and higher freight and fuel expenses. Clearly, these hurdles remain a concern for Molson Coors’ bottom line.The aforementioned challenges dented Molson Coors in the first quarter, wherein both top and bottom lines dropped year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Other than these hindrances, unfavorable global mix, impact of indirect tax provision cycling in Europe and adoption of a new revenue recognition accounting standard hurt the company’s performance. Management retained its outlook and expects 2018 to remain impacted by new revenue recognition standard.Although Molson Coors’ focus on premiumization and cost savings initiatives bode well, the U.S. beer industry softness and tough input cost environment seems to have marred analysts’ confidence. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter and 2018 has gone down from $1.98 to $1.93 and from $5.16 to $4.89, respectively over the past 60 days.Still Looking for Consumer Staples Stocks?

3534,TAP,"Even though the picture appears rosy for the U.S. economy, this favorable economic landscape can divert investors’ focus from the defensive consumer staples zone to other seemingly attractive spaces.This is likely one of the explanations for the sector’s recent underperformance, a trend that can remain in place for quite some time. Stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are down -4% over the last 12 months, lagging the S&P 500 index’s +14.2% gain over the same time period.Continued Fed tightening and higher interest rates also remain an issue for these stocks. This is so for two reasons. First, Consumer Staples stocks, like Utility stocks, are typically dividend payers which tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. Second, Consumer Staples companies have global operations and remain vulnerable to strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar. The dollar has started gaining ground lately on account of the Fed and interest rate backdrop.Also, possibility of a trade war with China continues to raise fears for companies whose business operations are likely to be hit by tariffs.Other than this, the consumer staples space is grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition, with the latter stemming from consumers’ changing preferences and Amazon’s AMZN ever-growing dominance. This, in turn has created significant pricing pressure, alongside compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities. These factors pose major threats to margins, which have been plateaued for quite some time now.That said, we believe that investors must take stock of the possible obstacles in the consumer staples sector before making any investment decision within it.Input Cost Volatility, Escalated Freight CostsInput costs play a major role in determining the performance of a company. An increase in input cost directly hits the company’s margins and profits. Moreover, any price increase to offset the same may drive consumers away. We note that many Consumer Staples companies are bearing the brunt of high input costs, which remains a concern for the future. Also, the food industry in general is battling a tough transportation landscape due to lower driver availability.This, in turn, has raised freight costs for many players like Smucker’s (SJM  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report), United Natural UNPI and Sysco SYS, among others. In fact, most of these companies expect higher freight costs to remain a threat to their margins.Moving to higher commodity costs, consumer goods behemoth Colgate has been bearing the brunt of increased commodity and packaging costs, which have been hurting its gross margin. Input cost inflation also remains a cause of concern for players like Campbell Soup CPB, Dean Foods DF, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods, Church & Dwight CHD and Kimberly-Clark KMB. In fact, Kimberly expects commodity costs to shoot up mainly due to higher prices for several raw materials, including pulp. As for Church & Dwight, it expects both higher commodity and transportation expenses to weigh on gross margin in 2018. Sysco and Pinnacle Foods are other examples that remain troubled by both these headwinds.Intense CompetitionConsumer staples companies face stiff competition with respect to innovation, pricing, brand strength, promotions and responsiveness to evolving consumer trends. This results in lower pricing power and a decline in market share, which in turn compresses margins and earnings. For example, Kimberly-Clark’s diaper segment faces significant competitive activity, which puts the company’s market share at risk.Dean Foods also battles stiff competition, not only with various dairy processors for shelf space, but also with various beverages and nutritional products. Further, the beauty and beauty-related products industry is highly competitive, which remains a challenge for players like Avon Products AVP and Coty COTY. Results of alcohol giants like Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) and Brown-Forman BF.B may also be somewhat stifled in a cut-throat competitive environment.Strained Margins Many companies in the consumer staples sector have been plagued by strained margins, stemming from various factors. These include tough grocery market conditions, rising input costs, costs associated with meeting consumers’ changing demands and stiff competition that leads to aggressive promotions and price wars. From grocery chains like SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), food companies like Campbell Soup, cosmetic biggies like Estee Lauder to consumer products companies like Church & Dwight, Colgate CL, Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Kimberly-Clark, all remain troubled by squeezed margins.The grocery industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotions, which became more pronounced after Amazon’s takeover of Whole Foods Market. Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals, which are strengthening their franchises and offering alternative outlets for food and other staples. Also, customers are more inclined toward private label products, which are low-cost alternatives to national brands. This, in turn, is hurting food companies.Higher Operating Expenses to Limit ProfitsAs demand for staples is usually consistent, companies strive to increase sales and market share through innovations, promotions and efficient marketing and advertising. Thus, consumer staple companies tend to spend heavily on marketing and advertising. Though advertising strengthens brand appeal and helps to counter competition, it severely hits the profit margins of these companies. Also, efforts to keep up with consumers’ changing needs entail significant costs. In this regard, costs related to e-commerce development and marketing are likely to impact profitability.Companies like Kimberly-Clark, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) have significantly stepped up their investments in marketing, innovation, R&D, supply chain and capacity additions, which may hinder profits. Pinnacle Foods has also been witnessing escalated marketing costs, and expects these barriers to linger.Emerging Market VolatilityThe majority of the global population is clustered in emerging economies. Thus, food/beverage companies are increasingly investing in developing and emerging markets like India, China and Brazil which boast significant growth potential due to relatively low per-capita consumption. Another reason is the burgeoning middle-class population with rising income levels, which in turn is increasing the demand for convenience food and beverages. Though emerging markets offer strong growth prospects, they are generally volatile due to fluctuating currencies and other structural and political issues. Moreover, any unprecedented event that may impact economic conditions in countries like China, Brazil and Russia remains a threat.Soft VolumesMany consumer staples companies are struggling with declining volumes or soft volume growth, which is hurting their top line. Mondelez’s (MDLZ  -  Free Report) volumes have been weak since 2014 due to volume erosion from higher pricing and category weakness because of lower demand. Another company that has long been battling soft volumes is dairy products player, Dean Foods.Apart from this, growing health and wellness consciousness has resulted in volume declines of carbonated drinks of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr. Pepper DPS, while it has also been hurting cigarette volumes of bigwigs like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report). Molson Coors has also been posting soft beer volumes in the United States for quite some time now, on account of difficult industry conditions.Government RestrictionsTobacco companies like Altria Group, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are facing constant government regulations to make consumers aware of the health hazards associated with tobacco products. Well, government authorities have been brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer. Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets.Additionally, these companies have been directed to put self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers, particularly emphasizing the addictive nature of cigarettes. To add to the woes, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed due to ongoing research. If enacted, low nicotine levels will prove to be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies.Moreover, increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of tobacco consumption, motivating them to quit smoking. These restrictions have lowered cigarette consumption and significantly dented volumes.While this was for tobacco companies, alcohol stocks also remain vulnerable to government regulations. Distilled spirits are subject to excise tax in various countries. Thus, rising fiscal pressure in the United States, European and emerging markets may lead to increasing risk of a potential excise tax on spirits by governments of the respective countries.Bottom LineThough the consumer staples industry is faced with a number of problems, does the sector have anything to offer to short-term investors?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective and the trend in this important sector of the economy.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

The raised earnings view reflects the timing of acquisitions and divestitures, and currency impacts. Normalized earnings per share for 2017 are anticipated in the range of $3.00–$3.20, compared with $2.95−$3.15 guided earlier.In first-quarter 2017, Newell made significant progress strengthening portfolio by completing six transactions in and just after the end of the quarter. The company completed two acquisitions including the Sistema food storage business and the WoodWick fragranced candles business, while divesting four businesses, namely tools, consumer storage totes, fire building and fire starting, as well as the rope and chain business.However, the company’s significant global presence exposes it to currency woes. Moreover, intense competition and volatile consumer behavior remain the major threats, given its consumer-focused nature.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Newell Brands is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Newell Brands has an Earnings ESP of +0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 86 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. The company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Newell Brands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Newell Brands Inc.

3538,TAP,"According to a recent Gallup poll, beer continues to be the most favored alcoholic beverage in the U.S. The poll conducted early this month reveals that 40% of alcohol consumers prefer beer, compared to 30% who prefer wine and 26% who have voted for liquor. These findings come at a time when it is widely being held that millennials prefer to consumer wine over beer.The Gallup poll findings clearly show that if this is indeed the case, beer is not going to give up its dominance of the alcoholic beverages space in a hurry. This is a consumer staples category for which demand remains steady regardless of the current economic situation. In this context, earnings of beer companies scheduled for release over this week and the next, including Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report) and Diageo plc (DEO  -  Free Report), assume greater significance.With The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) scheduled  to report on Jul 27 and the Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) reporting on Aug 2, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. While Molson Coors has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Boston Beer carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price PerformanceBoth Boston Beer and Molson Coors have performed poorly over the last three months, a period during which the Zacks categorized Alcoholic Beverages industry has gained 3.6%. However, while Molson Coors has lost 7.5% over this time period, Boston Beer has only declined by 4.5%, making it the better choice on this count.ValuationThe price to sales ratio is particularly relevant in a consumer focused industry whose fortunes are dictated by the ebb and flow of sales. This ratio indicates that market value of each of the company’s sales dollars.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, both are undervalued compared to the wider industry, which has an exorbitant P/S ratio of 21.14. However, Boston Beer is the pricier of the two, since it has a P/S ratio of 1.99, higher than Molson Coor’s reading of 1.69.    Net MarginProfitability ratios acquire greater importance in an industry characterized by low margins. Net margin is a good metric to compare the profitability of companies within the same industry, since they are bound by the same business constraints.With a net margin value of 9.8%, Boston Beer is well behind the industry average of 20.5%. However, is better placed on this count compared to Molson Coors, whose value for the metric stands at 8.5%Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company and is a good proxy for its debt servicing capacity. In the context of the beer industry, it is an indicator of the company’s long-term sustainability. Since Boston Beer utilizes a negligible amount of debt, or no bet to fund its operations, it has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0. In contrast, Molson Coor’s debt-to-equity ratio of 104.03 is alarmingly high, which means Boston Beer easily wins this round.Asset Turnover RatioSince the beer industry is essentially characterized by low margins and high volumes, activity ratios are extremely important when determining the health of a company. All activity ratios are geared toward gauging a company’s ability to convert various heads under its balance sheet into sales or cash. The asset turnover ratio examines the level of efficiency with which a company utilizes its assets to conduct sales.With an asset turnover ratio of 1.45, Boston Beer is comfortably placed with respect to the broader industry, whose value for this metric stands at 0.52. In this context, Molson Coors has an asset turnover ratio of 0.28, which places it at a disadvantage to both the industry and Boston BeerQuick Ratio Considered to be a conservative measure of liquidity, the quick ratio gauges as to how liquid the current position of a company is. In other words, it measures the extent to which liquid current assets can service current liabilities. The measure is conservative since it does not take into account current assets which are relatively less liquid such as inventory.With a quick ratio of 1.21, Boston Beer is better placed compared to the broader industry, whose value for this metric stands at 0.65. Molson Coors is poorly placed on this count since its quick ratio stands at 0.43.Earnings History and ESPWhen considering Earnings ESP, there is nothing to choose from between the two stocks with both having readings of 0. However, taking into account a more comprehensive earnings history, Molson Coors has delivered a positive surprise in only one of the four preceding quarters and has an average earnings surprise of -22.6%. Boston Beer is better on this count, since it has delivered positive earnings surprises in three out of the four prior quarters. Further, it has an average earnings surprise of 30.6%.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Molson Coors holds an edge over Boston Beer when considering price-to-sales ratio. But on all other counts Boston Beer has a clear edge. Not only does it have a relatively better price performance and superior earnings history, it is better placed when considering net margin, debt-to-equity, asset turnover and quick ratios. With a better Zacks Rank #2, Boston Beer is clearly placed better than Molson Coors ahead of earnings.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

3539,TAP,"Benchmarks finished at record highs on Friday as tech stocks gained. Tech has come a long way, evolving from the dot-com catastrophe to becoming a safety trade and are now favored by active managers. Investors are pouring money into Internet and tech companies, which are less vulnerable to tax cuts and changes in interest rates and are expected to benefit from lower corporate taxes, mainly on cash held overseas.Earnings season, meanwhile, kicked off. JP Morgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo all posted better-than-expected earnings results, but, their shares fell after reporting decline in trading sales. Investors also digested a couple of poor economic data on retail sales and inflation, which made market participants believe that the Federal Reserve may turn dovish.The Dow closed at a record high for the third time in a row, while the 30-stock index registered its 25th record close for this year. The Dow advanced 0.4% to close at 21,637.74. The S&P 500 also notched a record high, its first since June 19. The benchmark index rose 0.5% to finish at 2,459.27. The Nasdaq, however, finished slightly below its closing record of 6,321.76 set on June 8. The tech-heavy index gained 0.6% to close at 6,312.47.For the week, all the major indexes posted solid gains. The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increased 1%, 1.4% and 2.6%, respectively. The indexes have overcome series of bottlenecks from tech overvaluation fears to Russia’s involvement in the U.S. election to climb back into record territory.Big Bank Earnings In a NutshellBanking-behemoths JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) handily beat earnings and revenue estimates, while Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) beat earnings expectations but modestly missed revenue estimates. A big reason for the market’s lukewarm reaction to the seemingly positive bank earnings is the soft guidance for the current period, particularly from JPMorgan. Also, signs of a slowdown in trading weighed on bank stocks (read more: Bank Earnings Are Good, But Fail to Impress).Soft economic data on retail sales and particularly the Consumer Price Index, furthermore, reduced the chances of additional rate hikes this year. This has dragged down Treasury yields, which has lowered the chances of increase in profits from one of the major profit centers for banks – interest income.Retail Sales Fizzle Out, Inflation was FlatSales at retailers fell 0.2% in June, marking the second straight drop and the biggest decline of the year. Most of the retail segments including gas stations, grocers, restaurants, book stores, sporting-goods stores and department stores saw a decline in sales figures. Such disappointing numbers indicated that the U.S. economy hasn’t rebounded strongly in the spring, which may give the Fed a reason to reassess how quickly it withdraws stimulus from the economy.The consumer-price-index, meanwhile, was unchanged last month. The index showed that the prices Americans pay for goods and services aren’t rising very much. In fact, the rate of inflation over the past 12 months has slowed down to 1.6% in June from 1.9% in the prior month.

3541,TAP,"The picture so far this earnings reporting cycle has been quite rosy. Per the latest Earnings Preview, 267 S&P 500 members have reported quarterly results. So far, 76.8% of these companies have delivered positive earnings surprises, while 73.8% beat top-line expectations. Earnings of these companies have increased 25.1% from the year-ago quarter, while revenues have risen 10%.Further, earnings and revenues are well on track to mark the highest growth in seven years. As a whole, earnings for the S&P 500 companies are anticipated to improve 22.6% year over year on revenue growth of 8.4%. In fourth-quarter 2017, earnings and revenues rose 13.4% and 8.6%, respectively.A Look at Consumer StaplesThe performance of the index is determined by all 16 Zacks sectors, out of which 15 are expected to witness year-over-year earnings growth this season. The Consumer Staples sector being one of them is expected to record earnings growth of 6.8% and revenue increase of 3.1%.The Consumer Staples sector is currently placed at the bottom 6% (15 of 16) of all Zacks sectors, thanks to several bottlenecks. The sector has long been grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition. This, in turn, has created significant pricing pressure, compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities. Owing to such deterrents, the sector has lost 5.9% in a year, while the S&P 500 market gained 11.7%.Amid such challenges, companies operating in the segment have been trying to keep afloat through innovation, strategic buyouts and restructuring efforts in sync with a changing consumer landscape. Additionally, the recent tax cuts are expected to favor Consumer Staples companies.Considering the diverse factors, let’s see what’s in store for the following stocks when they release their quarterly results on May 2.Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterHow Are TAP, KHC, CLX and EL PlacedMolson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) is expected to witness year-over decline in revenues in first-quarter 2018, owing to soft sales volumes in the United States. For the quarter under review, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $2,436 million, down from $2,449 million in the year-ago quarter. Also, input cost inflation is a concern as management expects input cost inflation in 2018 to be nearly $50 million greater than 2017, on account of aluminum and diesel fuel among other inputs. To top it, Molson Coors has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of -0.21%, which dim the possibility of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Nevertheless, the company is focused on strengthening its above premium category along with expanding its portfolio through innovation. It has also been undertaking several restructuring initiatives to reduce costs and boost profits. Given these factors, along with expected gains from tax reforms, Zacks analysts expect earnings in the quarter to grow 5.3% year over year to 80 cents. However, the estimate has gone down by 4 cents over the past 30 days. (Read More: Will Soft U.S. Volumes Dent Molson Coors Q1 Earnings?)The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) has been experiencing top-line weaknesses for a while, thanks to unfavorable demand conditions in the United States and Canada. Further, the company’s performance in first-quarter 2018 is expected to be dented by increased retail competition in developed markets, Ore-Ida supply deficits as well as the impact of some pricing actions. (Read More: Will Weak Sales Hurt Kraft Heinz's Earnings in Q1?)Owing to such factors, analysts polled by Zacks expect only nominal growth in Kraft Heinz’s first-quarter sales. Further, the consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 82 cents, reflecting a 2.4% year-over-year fall.This Zacks Rank #3 company has been striving to boost its performance through savings initiatives, innovations and strategic investments to enhance brand performance. However, such efforts are less likely to reflect in the results this season. Further, owing to its Earnings ESP of -0.20%, a bottom-line beat seems unlikely this time around.The Clorox Company’s (CLX  -  Free Report) third-quarter fiscal 2018 performance is likely to benefit from dedicated brand management, cost savings and productivity initiatives. Also, it undertakes strategic partnerships to expand capabilities across its online and brick-and-mortar platforms. Recently, management agreed to buy Nutranext, the Florida-based dietary supplements leader, for $700 million. Additionally, it is progressing with the smooth execution of its 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at boosting growth for the improvement of categories and overall market share. In the light of such factors, analysts polled by Zacks expect quarterly revenues of $1,511 billion, up 2.3% from the year-ago quarter.However, Clorox witnessed significant pressure on gross margin in the fiscal second quarter, which is likely to continue. Margin was strained by escalated input costs for commodities and tightening of the transportation market. Also, results were hurt by strategic investments in growth and cost-saving initiatives, which might continue to drive expenses and hurt profits. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30 for the quarter under review moved south by a penny over the last 30 days and reflects a decline of 0.8% year over year. Further, Clorox’s Earnings ESP of -0.33% and a Zacks Rank #4 indicate there are little chances of an earnings beat this earnings season. (Read More: Will Clorox Retain Positive Earnings Trend in Q3?)The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.’s (EL  -  Free Report) third-quarter fiscal 2018 results are expected to reflect well-chalked buyouts, innovation, saving efforts, extensive market reach as well as robust online and travel retail network. This cosmetics stalwart has made several strategic acquisitions, such as BECCA and Too Faced, to enhance its portfolio. It also boasts a strong online business and expects it to be a major growth catalyst in the years to come. Estee Lauder continues to focus on enhancing travel retail business, which has lately emerged as a major sales driver. Management stated that growth in this category is majorly fueled by continued investments in emerging markets, particularly Asia, along with double-digit increase in five of its biggest brands in the travel retail network.Buoyed by such factors, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.02-$1.04 for the third quarter, which marks a considerable increase from the prior projection of 91 cents. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings are expected to improve 7-9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.07. Moreover, the company’s Earnings ESP of +0.67% combined with a Zacks Rank #3 makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this season.  Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,234 million, up 13.2% from the prior year. Also, management forecasts sales growth of 12-13% in the third quarter.However, management anticipates lower sales from North America due to a decline in retail traffic in the U.S. brick-and-mortar stores. Also, the company has been grappling with gross margin declines for over four quarters now.

3542,TAP,"Demand for everyday-use products created by operators in the Consumer Staples space doesn’t tend to fluctuate a lot, but it is nevertheless exposed to macroeconomic forces at the margins. As such, the outlook for this space perks up as the outlook for the U.S. and global economy improves.The outlook for the U.S. economy has been favorable for the last several years, with the recent tax legislation expected to add to the longevity of the current U.S. expansion cycle. In addition to the indirect benefits to Consumer Staples companies from the tax cuts, these companies also stand to benefit directly from the legislation, as reflected in the improving earnings outlook for many companies. That said, Consumer Staples operators tend to be global in their operations and as such don’t benefit to the same extent from U.S. tax law changes as the more domestic companies. With growth hard to come by for companies in this mature space, Consumer Staples players have to remain focused on squeezing more out of their operations and coming out with revenue-boosting initiatives, which mainly include efforts to keep pace with the changing consumer patterns.On that note, let’s delve deeper in some of the major growth-driving strategies of the space.Strengthening Product Portfolio via Strategic Alliances, Buyouts Consumer staples companies are regularly undertaking both domestic and international acquisitions to expand their product lines and gain access to new markets. Some of these are also forming partnerships, mostly with larger and better-known companies, to strengthen their distribution networks, diversify portfolios, expand their reach and enhance market positioning. Notably, leveraging each other’s efficiencies creates significant synergies for companies that go for M&A activities.Mergers of Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) with packaged meat producer The Hillshire Brands (in August 2014); tobacco giants Reynolds American and Lorillard (in June 2015); food giants Kraft Foods Group, Inc. KHC and H.J. Heinz Company (in July 2015) and consumer goods companies Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Jarden (in 2016) were the most talked about deals. Belgium-based brewer Anheuser Busch InBev’s BUD buyout of SABMiller in October 2016 also created a buzz in the beverage industry. Apart from this, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) acquired SABMiller plc’s 58% stake in MillerCoors, which made the former the third-largest brewer in the world, after Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken.Cost Cutting and Restructuring InitiativesMost consumer staples companies are implementing cost-reduction initiatives to boost profits. In the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, with the objectives of enhancing operating efficiency, reducing overheads and fuelling bottom-line performance. Colgate CL has also been benefiting from its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share worldwide.Additionally, Sysco’s (SYY  -  Free Report) core strategies for 2020 include plans to optimize business and achieving operational efficacy. We also commend Kimberly Clark’s KMB 2018 Global Restructuring & Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) programs, which are expected to generate cost savings of more than $2 billion over the next four years. Companies like McCormick MKC, Coca-Cola KO, Molson Coors, Mondelez International MDLZ, Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report), Kellogg K and many others have also been benefiting from significant cost savings and restructuring initiatives to boost earnings.Focus on InnovationInnovation remains the guiding principle of consumer staples companies as it enables them to enhance brand appeal through product differentiation and capture market share across all regions and categories. Thus, companies put a lot of thrust on innovation to upgrade their brands and create differentiated value propositions. Notably, constant innovations supported by efficient marketing are essential for consumer staples companies to stay ahead of competition.As evidence, novelty has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive, and cosmetic majors like Estee Lauder EL. These companies constantly come up with new products that suit changing consumer trends, to tap demand and boost revenues. Also, major food companies like Smucker and Campbell Soup CPB, alcohol stocks like Brown-Forman BF.B and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report), and even tobacco players like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) have been adding new products to gain competitive edge and augment market share.Exiting Underperforming Units to Enhance OperationsApart from growing their businesses through buyouts, companies also remain focused on improving their product portfolios through divestitures. Offloading underperforming operations enables the companies to concentrate on the core and profitable areas.For example, as part of its strategic business review following its merger with Jarden, Newell Brands announced plans to sell nearly 10% of its current portfolio, including a major chunk of its Tools segment. This highlights the company’s focus on simplifying its operating structure, alongside highlighting its commitment toward making prudent investments in areas with higher growth potential. Similarly, Unilever (UL  -  Free Report) announced plans to sell its shrinking Spreads business to KKR (in December 2017) to shift concentration on fast-growing products.Adopting E-Commerce Mantra: The Need of the HourWith technology having advanced by leaps and bounds, online shopping has become the order of the day. Thanks to various mobile apps and dot.com business lines, shopping for anything is literally on consumers’ finger-tips. Consumers’ rapid shift to e-marketplace has compelled companies to adopt the e-commerce mantra. Companies like United Naturals (UNFI  -  Free Report), SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup and Estee Lauder among others, are striving to enhance e-commerce space, through investments in technology and infrastructure.Driven by these efforts, United Natural Foods’ e-commerce sales jumped almost 28.9% in the second quarter. As for SUPERVALU, the company’s contract with Instacart, along with endeavors to upgrade website and mobile applications underscore its knack to enhance consumer shopping experiences.Transition to Health and Wellness ProductsAs consumer preference is the life blood of Consumer Staples, companies have to adapt to evolving trends to stay strong in the industry. A key trend over the last few years has been the desire for natural and organic products, prompting many players in the space to come out with health and wellness offerings. This is the case with almost all industries in the sector.Apart from this, tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds American are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). To cater to changing consumer preference, Philip Morris launched the much talked about IQOS, a smokeless cigarette in November 2014, aiming to lead the tobacco industry’s push into reduced-risk products. IQOS is anticipated to boost market share and offset declining volumes in traditional cigarette business over the long term.Additionally, rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impact of toxic chemicals has been driving the market share for organic personal care products too. Consequently, players like Unilever are making solid progress in the natural and organic products category. This is evident from its deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals that specializes in personal care products such as deodorants, toothpaste and bar soaps. Clearly, these robust efforts are expected to boost the companies’ top line in the future.Clearly, the consumer staples space offers plenty of reasons to be optimistic about it over the long term.

3543,TAP,"Cabela's Incorporated , a specialty retailer and direct marketer of hunting, fishing, camping, and related outdoor merchandise, is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3. In the preceding quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.1%. Notably, the company’s earnings have lagged the estimate by 10% in three of the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Cabela's will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 57 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of over 3%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed have been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $912 million, down 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.We noted that the stock has outperformed the industry in the past six months. The company’s shares have gained 5%, while the industry has witnessed a decline of 9.2%.Factors at PlayCabela’s multi-channel model, next-generation stores and cost-saving initiatives bode well. Moreover, the next-generation stores are outperforming Cabela’s legacy stores in terms of both sales and profit per square foot. We remain optimistic about these store formats as they require less capital investment, while enhancing store productivity and sales per square foot.We believe that the company’s Financial Services Business segment plays an integral role in supporting the merchandising business by encouraging customer loyalty rewards program that provides a boost to revenues, profitability and customer retention at Retail as well as Direct businesses. In the previous quarter, Financial services revenues increased 6.5% to approximately $150 million, reflecting advancement in interest and fee income, primarily offset by an increase in the provisional losses for loans and interest expenses.However, soft economic recovery, deceleration in the sale of sporting goods, along with stiff competition from both brick-and-mortar and eCommerce has made things difficult for Cabela’s, which accepted the buyout offer of Bass Pro Shops. Moreover, dismal top-line performance for the third consecutive quarter is a major concern for the investors.Unlikely to Beat EstimatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cabela's is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Cabela's has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 57 cents.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for TAP in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.14 per share for TAP, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.04 cents per share.

3545,TAP,"Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Aug 2. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this beverage company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. It should be noted that the company has posted three negative earnings surprises in the last four quarters, resulting in an average negative surprise of 22.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Molson Coors is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +4.90%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $2.14, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $2.04. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Molson Coors currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks ( Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Molson Coors’ Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +4.90% makes us very optimistic about a possible earnings beat.Which Way Are Estimates Trending?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter and 2017 has been declining over the last seven days. However, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.04 per share and $6.45 for the second quarter and full-year 2017 reflect year-over-year growth of 83.8% and 103.4%, respectively.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3.08 billion for the said quarter, up 212.7% from the year-ago period. For 2017, Zacks consensus revenue is pegged at $11.1 billion, reflecting a 127.6% year-over-year increase.Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Molson Coors Brewing Company QuoteFactors to Consider Molson Coors has been struggling with weak sales volume trend of late. While the acquisition of the Miller global brands helped improving sales in the International regions, sales volume continued to decline in Canada and Europe. A difficult economy, unfavorable currency and competitive pressure remained the major deterrents. The company’s dismal performance is reflected in its share price. Molson Coors’ shares have fallen 12.3% in the last one year, in comparison to the industry’s growth of 2.4%. In order to revive its performance, Molson Coors has been focusing on expanding its foothold through strategic agreements and targeting above-premium brands to help grow its market share.The recent agreement with Hornell Brewing Co., Inc., an affiliate of AriZona Beverages, is in line with Molson Coors’ current business expansion initiatives. The deal will give Molson Coors the license to market and distribute a new Flavored Malt Beverage (FMB) brand, Arnold Palmer Spiked Half & Half, through its U.S. division MillerCoors. This would aid Molson Coors to capture the momentum of ready-to-drink teas (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) in the U.S.In regard to its cost savings target, the company exceeded its 2016 goal by achieving more than $165 million of in-year cost reductions. The acquisition of the remaining 58% stake in MillerCoors will also drive substantial cost synergies in the next three years and continues to expect this transaction to be significantly accretive to underlying earnings in the first full year of operations. This will also help the company to drive top-line growth, profit, cash generation, debt pay-down and total shareholder returns in the years ahead. The company expects cost savings of $550 million over the next three years till 2019.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.64% and a Zacks Rank #2.Church & Dwight Company, Inc.

"
3547,TAP,"The companies under the Consumer Staples sector sell relatively low-priced products that consumers use frequently in their daily lives, including food, beverages and products for personal hygiene or household cleaning. The purchase of these necessities is generally stable over time, irrespective of the spending patterns or whether the economy is expanding or contracting.
"
3548,TAP,"This is a defensive sector, as the outlook for its companies would not change much with the economic cycle. We have seen that lately, as these companies have been playing their role despite concerns about the prolonged weak U.S. economy, the debt crisis in Europe and the slowdown in China.
"
3549,TAP,"Consumer staples stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 as a whole in the year-to-date and trailing 52-week periods, up +9% and +18.4% in the YTD and trailing 52-week periods, compared to gains of +6.4% and +10.8% for the S&P 500, respectively.
"
3550,TAP,"Many consumer companies are expanding focus to emerging markets, while many are resorting to cost saving initiatives to survive input cost pressures. The companies are also expanding their portfolios through product innovations and acquisitions.Expansion in Emerging Markets
"
3551,TAP,"With market saturation, low disposable income of consumers and increased competitive activity in developed markets, many companies are diverting their resources to explore emerging markets. Though companies like Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) are witnessing improving volume trends in North America, driven by increased marketing and advertising spending, we believe that the markets of North America are relatively mature compared to their untapped developing counterparts such as Brazil, India, China, Mexico, Russia and Southeast Asia, which exhibit positive consumer spending growth.
"
3552,TAP,"Moreover, we have seen that product demand has remained stable for companies that are more exposed to fast-growing emerging markets in comparison to the slow-growing and saturated developed markets. Demand for convenient and branded packaged food is growing in the developing countries, as middle-class consumers shift to urban living. Thus, the rising pool of middle class consumers in emerging markets represents a huge opportunity for branded consumer companies.
"
3553,TAP,"However, growth in the emerging markets has been largely hurt by currency headwinds for many consumer staples companies due to a stronger dollar, which reduces the value of outside-U.S. sales. But with improving standard of living in developing countries, the companies are now focusing on increasing pricing to derive profits, which was earlier difficult.
"
3554,TAP,"Beverage companies such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have invested heavily in the emerging markets of India, Russia and China, encouraged by the high-growth nature of these countries. However, the slowdown in Chinese economy has hurt the return on investments for companies.
"
3555,TAP,"Coca-Cola has already invested over $2 billion in India in the last 18 years and has been witnessing double-digit business growth in India aided by its top brands like Thumbs Up, Sprite and Maaza. Over the next eight years, Coca-Cola, along with its bottling partners, will make a further investment of $3 billion to build consumer marketing, infrastructure and brands in India.
"
3556,TAP,"Coca-Cola also has plans to invest $4 billion in China over three years starting 2012, invest $3 billion in Russia between 2012 and 2016, $8 billion in Brazil through 2016 and $300 million in Vietnam between 2012 and 2015.
"
3557,TAP,"PepsiCo has invested $700 million in India since 2008. It also plans another $500 million investment over the next three years. Further, with the acquisition of Wimm-Bill-Dann in Sep 2011, PepsiCo took control of the largest food-and-beverage business in Russia, bringing the company closer to its strategic goal of building a $30 billion nutrition business by 2020.
"
3558,TAP,"PepsiCo’s strategic alliance with leading Chinese food and beverage maker Tingyi Holding Corp. has created the number one liquid refreshment beverage (LRB) manufacturing network in China, and is expected to help PepsiCo to revamp its Chinese business.H.J. Heinz Company (HNZ) has a significant presence in India, China and Indonesia. Heinz products, especially ketchup, sauces and infant nutrition goods, are showing healthy growth in all of these markets due to brisk demand. Management expects its businesses in China, Indonesia, Brazil and Eastern Europe to each generate around $1 billion in sales over the next 3-5 years, with emerging markets as a whole to double its sales to around $5 billion.
"
3559,TAP,"Recently, Heinz agreed to be acquired by an investment group led by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) and private Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital for $28 billion, including debt.
"
3560,TAP,"Coffee giant Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) is also gaining popularity with consumers across China and the Asia-Pacific region, which has grown 33% (in terms of revenue) since 2010 and is expected to achieve meaningful business growth over the next five years.
"
3561,TAP,"Starbucks has already entered the lucrative Indian market with its first three store openings in Mumbai in Oct 2012 and a fourth store in Delhi early this month. The company has also entered the Vietnam market with its first store in Ho Chi Minh City on Feb 1.Cost Reduction Initiatives
"
3562,TAP,"Most consumer staples companies are also undertaking several strategic initiatives like the divestiture of low-margin brands, improvement of the supply chain and implementation of cost-reduction initiatives, in an effort to reduce the effects of inflating commodity costs. Though cost inflation has subdued, rising commodity and other input costs remain a drag on margins of most of the companies in this sector, despite top-line growth.
"
3563,TAP,"Coca-Cola is undertaking various productivity initiatives to streamline its cost structure and boost profitability. With the launch of a four-year productivity and reinvestment program in Feb 2012, the company plans to optimize its global supply chain, improve effectiveness of global marketing and innovation, achieve operating expense leverage, standardize information systems and integrate North American bottling and distribution operations acquired from Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE). The program is expected to generate incremental annualized savings of $550 to $600 million over the four-year period ending in 2015.
"
3564,TAP,"PepsiCo also announced a restructuring program in Feb 2012, which is expected to result in $3 billion productivity savings by 2015. The program will include leveraging new technologies and processes across operations, consolidating facilities, simplifying organization structures, lowering layers of management, workforce reduction of 3% and many more efforts.
"
3565,TAP,"Tobacco company Altria Group's (MO  -  Free Report) cost reduction program of $1 billion is expected to deliver $400 million in annualized cost savings by the end of 2013. The company also reduced its workforce by 700 employees in Feb 2012 as a part of its restructuring program to reduce cost.
"
3566,TAP,"Another tobacco seller, Reynolds American (RAI), also remains focused to reduce cost. The company is expected to save about $70 million annually by 2015 associated with workforce restructuring done in the year 2012.Philip Morris International (PM  -  Free Report) has also announced a one-year gross productivity and cost savings target for 2013 of approximately $300 million. Last year, the company managed to exceed its one-year gross productivity and cost savings target of $300 million primarily through the rationalization of tobacco blends and product specifications and other manufacturing and procurement initiatives.
"
3567,TAP,"Consumer products giant, Kimberly-Clark (KMB  -  Free Report) is undertaking a cost savings program, FORCE (Focused on Reducing Costs Everywhere), which is benefiting the company through the continued rollout of lean manufacturing and supply chain practices and the formation of a global procurement organization. These initiatives generated cost savings of about $240 million in 2009, about $370 million in 2010, about $265 million in 2011 and $295 million in 2012. Kimberly-Clark expects $250–$300 million of cost savings in 2013.
"
3568,TAP,"Kimberly-Clark’s pulp and tissue restructuring program focuses on improving underlying profitability and return on invested capital of its consumer tissue and K-C Professional businesses, which have been facing declining profits for many years. Through this program, Kimberly-Clark anticipates operating profit to increase by at least $75 million in 2013 and at least $100 million in 2014.Innovations
"
3569,TAP,"Consumer product companies need to innovate and upgrade their brands to create differentiated value propositions for their customers in order to remain successful.
"
3570,TAP,"PepsiCo’s low calorie cola -- Pepsi Next, launched in July 2012 -- was successful. The company also utilizes new packaging to shift consumers to more profitable purchases. Its 24-ounce can for regular and diet Dew is generating good customer response. The company’s recent innovations at the premium end include Quaker Real Medleys hot cereals, Stacy's Gingerbread and Stacy's Cocoa and Lay's Stax potato chips. The new innovations are expected to boost revenue growth and also enable increased price realization in the long run.
"
3571,TAP,"Starbucks has also introduced new products to excite customers. With the launch of its premium single cup domestic coffee machine Verismo in Sept 2012, the company expects to significantly expand Starbucks’ presence in the fast growing premium single cup coffee segment. Apart from coffee, the company opened four Evolution Fresh juice stores across the U.S., in order to meet the needs of the increasingly health conscious Americans. In March 2012, the company launched a new energy drink, Starbucks Refreshers, thus marking its entry into the $8 billion energy drink market.
"
3572,TAP,"Starbucks is also diversifying with the La Boulange bakery acquisition to popularize the French bakery experience in the U.S. markets. In addition, with the acquisition of Teavana in late Dec 2012, the company aims to capture further share of the $40 billion tea category. The company has also enhanced its core food offering, which has jumped double digits in each of the last two fiscal years.
"
3573,TAP,"The tobacco sector has also been active in innovation with the development of new products which reduce the harm caused by tobacco. Reynolds American’s Zonnic nicotine replacement therapy gum and the Vuse e-cigarette offer potential for long-term commercial success. Zonnic gum saves smokers from the harmful effects of tobacco, while Vuse e-cigarette delivers vapor and taste and has potential for long-term growth.OPPORTUNITIES
"
3574,TAP,"Despite macroeconomic headwinds, some of these companies have been able to deliver impressive results and have the potential to grow in the upcoming quarters. The improved business backdrop is showing up in positive earnings momentum for consumer staples stocks, resulting in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR), Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) and Smithfield Foods (SFD).
"
3575,TAP,"Some attractive Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks worth considering are Smucker's (SJM  -  Free Report), Kellogg's (K), Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) and Hershey's (HSY).
"
3576,TAP,"Coffee maker Green Mountain’s performance turned around in the fourth quarter of 2012 (ending September) from past few weak quarterly results, driven by the success of Keurig Single Cup Brewers, single serve packs (K-cups), and Keurig-related products. The company’s margins are improving with favorable green coffee costs.
"
3577,TAP,"The company is focusing on its products through innovations and upgrading its Keurig brewing system to attract more customers. Green Mountain has raised its earnings guidance twice for fiscal 2013 in the last two quarters. Green Mountain appears to be well positioned for growth in the future quarters.
"
3578,TAP,"Stabilizing coffee costs also improved the margins at Smucker's. The company has witnessed year-over-year earnings growth in all the three quarters of fiscal 2013 (ending April), driven by company’s strong portfolio of brands, focus on innovations and promotional offerings. Moreover, strategic acquisitions have broadened Smucker’s presence across emerging markets and added popular brands to its portfolio. The company has increased its fiscal 2013 earnings guidance in the last two quarters, reflecting the company’s potential to drive profits in the coming quarters.
"
3579,TAP,"Like Green Mountain, the consumer products giant P&G also had a tough fiscal 2012 (ending June). However, the company has implemented some meaningful changes to re-accelerate its top and bottom-line growth to keep pace with its peers, which is reflected in its two back-to-back solid quarterly results in fiscal 2013. In addition, the company’s cost savings and productivity improvement initiatives have improved margins.
"
3580,TAP,"The world’s largest cereal maker, Kellogg, has delivered solid growth in earnings in all the four quarters of 2012, driven by robust organic sales growth performance. Despite its sluggish cereal business, challenges in Europe and rising input costs, we are optimistic about Kellogg’s solid brand positioning, its geographic diversity and cost-saving efforts, especially its supply-chain initiatives. Moreover, we are encouraged by the growth potential of the Pringles snack business, which was acquired in June last year from P&G.
"
3581,TAP,"Meat products processor Tyson has been witnessing strong momentum in the last several quarters backed by its bright prospect in beef and chicken business and consistent innovation towards low fat meat production. Rising demand for chicken coupled with positive pricing is helping the company reap wider margins. In addition, Tyson is working on growing its prepared foods, international poultry and value-added poultry businesses by producing high quality foods by using innovative and cost-effective processes.
"
3582,TAP,"Tyson’s close peer Smithfield also has bright prospects ahead as the company expects hog prices and the impact of grain costs to ease in the upcoming quarters. Smithfield’s results have been suffering since last two or three years as a result of higher grain costs and oversupply of hogs. However the company recovered nicely in fiscal 2011 (ending April) and posted record revenues in fiscal 2012, backed by the company’s brand building investments and innovation, restructuring initiatives, improved packaging and production of healthier choices for consumers using lean protein and natural ingredients.
"
3583,TAP,"Smithfield is also increasing its focus on consumer convenience by introducing more ready-to-eat foods. Increased export volume of fresh pork is also encouraging and we expect strong demand of fresh pork in the upcoming quarters.
"
3584,TAP,"Hershey has solid growth potential driven by strong brand positioning, strategic marketing investments in core brands, disciplined innovation, lower cost inflation, improved pricing and volumes and strong productivity. In fact, Hershey has outperformed and delivered positive surprises in three out of the four quarters of 2012 and has raised its guidance thrice in 2012, highlighting its attractive earnings potential. The outlook for 2013 is also encouraging, especially the expectation of no cost inflation this year.WEAKNESSES
"
3585,TAP,"The macro-economic environment in the U.S. has remained challenging and uncertain for quite some time now. The European economy has also remained unfavorable. The pace of economic recovery is relatively slow in U.S., whereas the consumer environment in U.S. is recovering at a mild pace. In Europe, the economic conditions are uncertain and China is also seeing some slowdown. These global economic pressures are expected to continue in 2013 and severely impact the companies in the coming quarters.
"
3586,TAP,"For the global brewer Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report), the acquisition of StarBev in Jun 2012 opened opportunities in the attractive beer market in Central Europe. However, unfavorable economic conditions in Europe will offset the gains from the acquisition. Moreover, the company has been facing continued decline in volumes in three major markets of U.S., U.K. and Canada in the last three years.
"
3587,TAP,"Molson Coors has also spent on marketing and advertising for its Miller Lite and the Molson Brands but this has not led to consistent growth in volumes. The increasing raw material costs of the company and the currency headwinds hurting the top line also remains a concern.
"
3588,TAP,"We believe that tough global macroeconomic conditions and declining volume trends will continue to drag the company’s performance in the upcoming quarters. Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Mondelez International (MDLZ  -  Free Report), which focuses on the global food and snacks business of the old Kraft Foods, missed on both the top and bottom lines in fourth quarter 2012 mainly due to currency headwinds. In addition, the gum and candy business has been suffering for the last few quarters. Management does not expect the gum business to stabilize in the coming quarters. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
"
3589,TAP,"Beverage company Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS) has had a dismal 2012, posting a negative surprise in two of the four quarters of 2012. The company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimates for both revenue and earnings while just managing to meet company expectations for the year.
"
3590,TAP,"Moreover, the company’s weak volume growth, higher cost pressure and lack of exposure outside the U.S. is concerning. The company has been facing persistent weakness in the overall carbonated soft drinks’ (CSD) volumes in North America since the past few months, which also remains a significant overhang.
"
3591,TAP,"Changing consumer preferences, increasing health consciousness and growing regulatory pressures are affecting beverage sales. We therefore prefer to avoid the stock for the next few quarters. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).
"
3592,TAP,"Stable Demand for Consumer Staples
"
3593,TAP,"The stock market has discounted the high probability of a global recession. Prior declines of similar magnitude proceeded the recession in the mid-1970s and the depression in the 1930s. The stock markets decline should be not only a function of magnitude, but also time.
"
3594,TAP,"Stock selection will be more important than usual. Avoid stocks with high debt levels. For now, concentrate on high quality companies with stable and consistent cash flow. Also, focus on stocks with high dividend yields. 
"
3595,TAP,"OPPORTUNITIES
"
3596,TAP,"Stocks in the Consumer Staples sector have traditionally performed better than the stock market, and especially cyclical companies, during market declines. The fundamental explanation is that food, beverage, household products and cosmetics companies manufacture and market brand name consumable products, most of which are considered essential to daily life -- food, drink, toothpaste, deodorants, toilet paper, etc.
"
3597,TAP,"Since product demand is relatively stable, the companies should report earnings in line with expectations and, hence, the stocks have outperformed. Generally speaking, food companies generate earnings growth at a mid-to-high single-digit rate. Beverage companies, however, are structurally able to grow faster at the high single-digit to low double-digit rate. But cosmetics companies can grow earnings a percentage point or two above beverage companies. Currently, we rate Estee Lauder (EL  -  Free Report) a Buy.
"
3598,TAP,"With the end of 2008, Consumer Staples will have outperformed the market on a total return basis for three consecutive years. Historically, the outperformance of Consumer Staples has lasted only three consecutive years, so the positive performance disparity is long-in-the-tooth. In addition, the relative performance has seasonal attributes, with almost all the relative gain coming in the fourth quarter as investors flee more cyclical investments, which tend to disappoint near the end of the year.
"
3599,TAP,"In 2009, it is highly probable that Consumer Staples will underperform once stocks begin to discount the recovery out of the current economic abyss. Therefore, we favor stocks completing restructurings, like Sara Lee (SLE), and companies that are assisted by special situations, like Dean Foods (DF  -  Free Report) benefiting from lower dairy costs.
"
3600,TAP,"WEAKNESSES
"
3601,TAP,"For two years, I was a table-pounding buyer of Anheuser-Busch under $50. With a friendly offer of $70 per share from InBev (ABHIF) in mid-2008, I finally downgraded the rating to a Sell.
"
3602,TAP,"However, more is brewing in the beer industry: a structural change is about to occur. The excess costs will be wrung out of Anheuser-Busch by InBev. In addition, a joint venture between Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) and SABMiller should produce a more competitive brewer with greater scale, resources and distribution synergies from the optimization of production and distribution networks.
"
3603,TAP,"Therefore, the cost rationalization at Anheuser-Busch (instigated by the merger with InBev) and the joint venture between Molson Coors and SABMiller are expected to spark more intense competition, resulting in the loss of the positive pricing trends enjoyed by the industry for the last two years. In other words, a ""beer war."" Most likely, both companies will pursue higher levels of promotional initiatives and marketing spending. As a result, overall profitability for the industry is expected to suffer.
"
3604,TAP,"The stock market has erased most of the early summer losses and is now within striking distance of the spring high. While the gains earlier on were concentrated largely in defensive and counter cyclical stocks, the momentum seems to have broadened a bit following the Friday jobs report. But the gains lack in conviction, as the small caps have lagged the large-caps -- likely a reflection that the market remains ambivalent about the economic and Fed policy outlook.
"
3605,TAP,"We will not get any clarity on those fronts given the dearth of economic reports this week. But the clamor for more Fed support does not seem to have died down following the July jobs report as indicated by the Boston Fed President’s interview with the Wall Street Journal, where he advocates for an open-ended new round of bond purchases by the central bank.
"
3606,TAP,"Eric Rosengren, the Boston Fed chief, does not have a vote on the FOMC, but his policy stance is a reflection of others like New York President Bill Dudley and Fed vice chairwoman Janet Yellen, who do have votes.
"
3607,TAP,"We will get more clarity over this debate within the FOMC later this month at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole huddle. Bernanke had used the Jackson Hole platform in 2010 to telegraph his QE2 plans in 2011. We will have another monthly jobs report and a host of other economic indicators before the Fed’s next scheduled meeting on September 12 and 13th.

"
3692,TAP,"With short-term interest rates near zero for the foreseeable future and rumors of the 30-year bond rally coming to an end, many yield-hungry investors are turning once again to dividend stocks.
"
3693,TAP,"But beware the siren call of high-yielding stocks.
"
3694,TAP,"A high single-digit or low double-digit yield may look attractive at first glance, but yields that fat are rarely sustainable. Consider what a dividend yield is - the current annual dividend divided by the current stock price. A quarterly dividend check will provide little comfort if you invest in a stock that ends up plummeting.
"
3695,TAP,"Moreover, that dividend check is no guarantee. Companies are not required to make dividend payments like they are debt payments. If times get tough and money gets tight, checks to the bank and to bondholders will get sent out before your dividend check.
"
3696,TAP,"It's not uncommon for high-yielding stocks to slash or suspend dividends indefinitely. One only needs to look at investors who picked up shares of General Motors or any of the ""stable"" bank stocks in 2008 because of their alluring yields to realize that juicy dividends often don't last.
"
3697,TAP,"Think Long-Term
"
3698,TAP,"For yield-conscious investors looking to hold a stock for the long haul, there are a number of metrics to look at besides the current dividend yield.
"
3699,TAP,"One such metric is the company's payout ratio. The payout ratio is simply the percentage of net income a company pays out to shareholders in dividends. Typically the higher the payout ratio the less room a company has to raise its dividend. If the company becomes distressed, a high payout ratio can signal a significant cut is on the way.
"
3700,TAP,"Another lesser-known item to consider, particularly for long-term investors, is yield on cost. Yield on cost is the current annual dividend divided by your original cost per share. For investors holding for several years or even decades, this can be dramatic.
"
3701,TAP,"Consider the world's most successful investor - Warren Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha picked up shares of Coca Cola (KO) in the late 1980s through his company Berkshire Hathaway for an average cost of $6.49 per share. While the share price has soared, Berkshire also receives an annual dividend of $1.76 per share. That means its yield on cost is an incredible 27.1%! Not too shabby.
"
3702,TAP,"It's not uncommon for solid businesses to distribute more and more of their earnings to shareholders through higher dividends as they mature. Bigger companies have less growth opportunities and compete in crowded markets, so they plow back less of their earnings into the company and more into your wallet. This could mean a decent dividend yield today becomes a huge yield in the future. For instance, a company that raises its dividend at an average of 19% per year will essentially double it every 4 years. That means your yield on cost will double too.
"
3703,TAP,"Below is a list of 6 companies currently yielding more than 1.5% who have a history of raising their dividends but still have relatively low payout ratios. They also have total debt less than 50% of total capital and are trading with a PEG ratio of less than 1.5. The stock must also be either a Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) Rank.

"
3747,TAP,"In this era of ultra-low interest rates, it's understandable that dividends are finally making a comeback. Just remember to be leery of those tantalizing yields. If you have a long time horizon and plan to hold for years or even decades, look beyond the current dividend yield and consider yield on cost.

3749,TAP,"Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP  -  Free Report) is operating in an industry that has historically been less susceptible to weakness in the overall economy. This dynamic was evident when the company reported solid fourth quarter results on Feb 12 that included a significant jump in earnings. The company's stock price has been holding up really well under greater economic pressure, and looks well positioned to continue advancing.  
"
3750,TAP,"Full Analysis
"
3751,TAP,"Molson Coors Brewing Co. produces and sells beer and other beverages. It offers its products under a number of names including both Coors and Molson. The company was founded in 1873. It was formerly known as Adolph Coors Company and changed its name to Molson Coors Brewing Company in 2005. Molson Coors is based in Denver, Colorado. 
"
3752,TAP,"Over the last 60 years there has been but a handful of industries that have been able to sustain growth characteristics during challenging economic times, and the alcoholic beverage industry is one occupying this unique space. 
"
3753,TAP,"This dynamic was on display when Molson Coors reported very respectable fourth quarter results on Feb 12. Revenue grew 5% to $1.6 billion, ahead of analyst expectations of $1.55 billion. 
"
3754,TAP,"Net income totaled $173.2 million. After excluding one-time items, earnings totaled 73 cents, easily outpacing analyst expectations of 65 cents. Earnings from the same period last year totaled 57 cents.
"
3755,TAP,"Sales to retail stores climbed 5.5% in the United States and 0.7% in Canada while falling 6% in Europe, where the company believes the market was affected by a slowing economy and smoking bans in England.
"
3756,TAP,"Sales per barrel rose 8.5% to $153. Sales volume fell 4% to 10.5 million barrels, which Molson Coors attributed to an additional week in the year-ago quarter.
"
3757,TAP,"For fiscal 2007, the company reported cost-savings of $55 million from the 2005 merger between Molson Inc. and Adolph Coors Co.
"
3758,TAP,"Molson Coors is currently working very closely with the Department of Justice in its review of a proposed partnership with Milwaukee-based Miller Brewing. The two companies are interested in creating a joint venture for their US operations. The terms of the deal require Molson Coors to supply $50 to $60 million in initial funding, giving it a 42% stake and Miller a 58% stake. The partnership is projected to produce $500 million in savings over a three-year period, mostly in shipping costs.  
"
3759,TAP,"Miller is estimated to have 25% domestic market share while Molson carries 13%. 
"
3760,TAP,"Estimates are on the rise for Molson, with the consensus estimate tacking on eight cents in the last thirty days and moving ahead to its current projection of $3.41 per share. Eight cents might not seem particularly significant, but in light of what has been happening to many other companies estimates, it definitely stands out. 
"
3761,TAP,"The company's share price has responded accordingly, with a gap open higher after the solid fourth quarter results hit the street. Since then, shares have continued to move higher, recently moving back to their short-term highs just above $54.
"
3762,TAP,"Beyond the level of short-term resistance at $54 is the 52-week and all-time high at $58. Look for the trend to stay strong and propel shares into higher territory. 
"
3763,TAP,"Market Madness
"
3764,TAP,"With all of the hoopla (ha, ha, ha) surrounding the NCAA mens basketball tournament, I thought it would be very timely (and hopefully profitable) to discuss a few companies that are linked to the games in one way or another. 
"
3765,TAP,"The first match-up kicked off yesterday afternoon and teams will battle for over 3 weeks at sites across the U.S., concluding with the championship game on Apr 2 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia. 
"
3766,TAP,"The terms madness or mayhem are often associated with what is quite possibly the most exciting tournament in all of sports. Such terms can also easily be applied to the volatile nature of the stock market of late. All three major indices (Dow Jones Industrial Average, Standard & Poors 500 and the Nasdaq composite) plummeted in late February, held somewhat steady for a few weeks but were hit hard yet again just the other day. The term recession has found its way into countless stories in various financial publications. Just as the verdict is still out as to who will be wearing the crown once the tournament comes to an end, so too is whether or not we will actually enter into a recession. I am keeping my fingers crossed when it comes to both my bracket picks and that a recession never comes to fruition.

3768,TAP,"With a number of schools playing their first-round games during the day, TiVo, Inc. provides the technology and services to meet subscribers recording needs. I could never comprehend when people would claim that once you get a digital video recorder (DVR) in your house you will wonder how you lived without it. Well, I finally caved in and I will be the first to admit they were right. With all of the TV timeouts and resulting commercials, being able to skip right past them is just a thing of beauty. 
"
3769,TAP,"TiVos DVR technology has been extremely popular with strong subscriber growth. The TiVo brand name is well recognized and has become synonymous with the digital video recording of television programs. The company has a strong history of exceeding analysts earnings expectations. TIVO beat the Streets estimate in 14 out of the past 16 quarters. Furthermore, when the company surprises to the upside, it usually does so by a large margin. TIVO has posted 13 double-digit percentage surprises and one triple-digit over the aforementioned 14 quarters. On Mar 7, TIVO announced that it will partner with Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) to offer Amazon Unbox on TiVo. This unique service offers TiVo subscribers the best way to find their favorite movies and television shows from the thousands that are available on Amazon Unbox, download and watch them right on their TV. Subscribers must have a high-speed connection to the Internet. The service should help differentiate TIVO from generic digital video recorders offered by various cable and satellite providers. TIVO is a Zacks #2 Rank stock (buy).

"
3782,TAP,"Drinking a cold one is about to get more expensive. Hops, a key ingredient in beer, are in short supply. The Brewer's Association (an organization that represents microbrewers in the U.S.) estimates that hop production is 10-15% below current demand.
"
3783,TAP,"Mother Nature and farmers are to blame for the shortage. Weather conditions in Europe and Australia have hurt crops this year. Previous overproduction led farmers to curtail the amount of acreage devoted to growing hops. At the same time, higher demand for biofuels such as ethanol have made other crops (e.g. corn) more profitable for farmers. (The Brewer's Association estimates that worldwide hop acreage has decreased by 50% over the last 10 years.)
"
3784,TAP,"Boston Beer (SAM  -  Free Report) partially blamed the higher cost of hops for hurting profit margins. The brewer missed third-quarter expectations by three cents per share and lowered its guidance for full-year earnings. SAM expects 2007 per share profits to be in a range of $1.40 to $1.65; it had previously guided for profits between $1.42 and $1.70 per share. The company also warned rising ingredient costs would adversely affect margins in 2008.
"
3785,TAP,"The hops shortage is expected to primarily impact microbrewers. It should have a lesser impact on the major brewers, who may be able to exert greater pricing power.
"
3786,TAP,"Anheuser-Busch (BUD) experienced a drop in gross margins during its third-quarter, but intends to ""implement price increases on the majority of its U.S. beer volume in early 2008, with increases in several states in the fourth quarter 2007"".
"
3787,TAP,"Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) has also been pushing through higher prices, but also relied on cost-cutting measures to offset higher ingredient costs.
"
3788,TAP,"The impact of brewer size is apparent in how brokerage analysts are adjusting their forecasts for 2008. Last week, two of the three covering analysts cut their profit projections on SAM (the other analyst did not change his estimates). At the same time, four of the 12 of the covering analysts raised their forecasts on TAP last week. During the past 30 days, two analysts raised their projections on BUD and four lowered their forecasts.
"
3789,TAP,"It is likely that the lower-cost beers have more price elasticity than the higher cost, specialty beers. Ironically, higher beer prices could potentially help BUD and TAP as some consumers opt for lower price brands (e.g. Michelob, Coors) over premium ""microbrew"" brands (e.g. Abita, Shiner Bock).
"
3790,TAP,"BUD, SAM and TAP are all Zacks #3 Rank (""hold"") stocks and are classified in Beverages-Alcoholic.
"
3791,TAP,"One group that has lower exposure to rising commodity prices is Medical-Drugs.
"
3792,TAP,"In recent weeks, brokerage analysts have boosted their profit projections on several drugmakers in response to good third-quarter earnings. The Zacks Revision Ratio (total positive revisions divided by total negative revisions) stands at 1.25 for this group versus 1.13 for the entire Zacks Rank universe.
"
3793,TAP,"Normally, such bullishness reflects industry trends. In the case of drugmakers, however, company-specific developments are more likely to drive earnings estimates higher. Shire PLC (SHPGY) and UTD Therapeutic (UTHR  -  Free Report) provide evidence of this.
"
3794,TAP,"SHGPY recently raised its target for full-year revenue growth to at least 30% from 25%. The company is gaining share among ADHD patients with its recently launched VYVANSE. Hunter syndrome treatment ELAPRASE and ulcer drug LIALDA are also capturing market share.
"
3795,TAP,"The revised guidance led the majority of covering brokerage analysts to up their forecasts for both 2007 and 2008. The consensus earnings estimate for this year now stands at $2.26 per share, up 16 cents from a month ago. The consensus earnings estimate for next year now stands at $2.98 per share, up 10 cents from a month ago.
"
3796,TAP,"Strong sales of blood pressure medication Remodulin allowed UTHR to generate third-quarter revenue growth of 46%. The strong growth also translated into higher profits. The company earned 66 cents per share, besting expectations for 33 cents.
"
3797,TAP,"The majority of covering brokerage analysts raised their profit forecasts for both 2007 (up 25 cents to $1.32 per share) and 2008 (up 33 cents to $2.28 per share).
"
3798,TAP,"UTHR is a Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy""). Medical-Drugs contains three other Zacks #1 stocks: Altana (AAGY), Chattem (CHTT) and Pharmanet (PDGI)
