4,TXT,"ARLINGTON, Va. —  Light attack aircraft that are less expensive to buy and operate than Lockheed Martin's (LMT) cutting-edge F-35 or older fighters like Boeing's (BA) F-15 could help the U.S. attract new allies, a top Air Force officer said Monday.XThe Air Force is weighing whether light attack aircraft should become part of the U.S. fleet as well, and just began a second phase of experiments to compare Textron's (TXT) AT-6 Wolverine against the Sierra Nevada/Embraer (ERJ) A-29 Super Tucano.The A-29, which at $10 million each costs about a tenth of Lockheed's F-35, is already being used by the fledgling Afghan Air Force and is in service in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and six other countries. The prospect of sharing an aircraft with the U.S. could be an incentive for countries to increase U.S. ties more broadly.""Lower that cost so we gain new allies with that light attack approach,"" said Lt. Gen. Jerry Harris, the Air Force's deputy chief of staff for strategic plans, programs and requirements, at a Mitchell Institute event. ""Not every country can afford an F-35 or even an F-15 or F-16. Partner with other countries that haven't been able to do so at this point.""Textron shares closed up 1.4% at 63.88 on the stock market today, still in buy range after breaking out last month. Embraer's U.S.-listed shares dipped 0.9%, Lockheed rallied 2%, and Boeing rose 1.8%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Air Force hasn't decided yet if the experiment will become an official acquisition program, but Congress is open to the purchase of up to 300 light-attack aircraft by 2022. Harris also sounded eager to speed up the process.""We are doing our best to minimize new development and just take existing things on the shelf so we can speed the acquisition to get this in the fight sooner,"" he said.In a series of experiments that started today at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, the Air Force will perform logistics, maintenance, weapons and interoperability tests. The experiments could also include intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance tests, Harris said.In the first phase of light attack experiments, which took place in August 2017, the Air Force looked at Textron's Scorpion and the AT-802L Longsword from L3 Technologies (LLL) in addition to the AT-6 and A-29. The four planes flew in both day and night tests, with and without weapons.The idea behind light attack aircraft is to save money by using them for more routine missions in low-risk environments, and deploy top-of-the-line, fifth-generation aircraft like Lockheed's F-35 and F-22 stealth fighters for missions in more dangerous environments.Operating a propeller plane like the Super Tucano, for example, would only cost a few thousand dollars per hour vs. $19,000 per hour for Lockheed's F-16 and $44,000 for the F-35A variant, according to Air Force data cited by the Washington Post.""The price-per-kill today using precision weapons aboard fifth-gen fighters is exorbitant, "" Harris said. ""And we've been paying that price for decades.""Editor's note: this story has been updated to corrected the location of the second-phase experiments.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsF-35 Prepares For Combat Tests That May Unleash Lockheed Growth

That way, the Pentagon can reduce wear and tear on more advanced fighters and cut operating expenses by sparing them from more routine missions.The Air Force hasn't decided if the experiment will become an official acquisition program, but Congress is open to the purchase of to 300 light-attack aircraft by 2022.The decision to narrow down to two aircraft came after the Air Force conducted an experiment with the AT-6, A-29, Textron's Scorpion and the AT-802L Longsword from L3 Technologies (LLL) last summer.In the next experiment, scheduled to run from May to July this summer, the Air Force will perform logistics, maintenance, weapons and future interoperability tests on the AT-6 and A-29.

21,TXT,"Textron's (TXT) AT-6 Wolverine and Sierra Nevada-Embraer's (ERJ) A-29 Super Tucano could get a chance to show off their abilities against the Islamic State or al-Qaida in a combat test next year, as the Air Force looks at possibly buying up to 300 relatively cheap, light-attack aircraft by 2022.XThe Air Force hasn't decided if light-attack planes will be an official acquisition program, but it experimented with the planes over the summer at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico.The idea is save operating costs by flying the aircraft in uncontested environments and use sophisticated fighters like Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 and Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet for more dangerous missions.A final decision on the test, dubbed Combat Dragon III, hasn't been made yet, but Air Force Reserve Col. Mike Pietrucha, light attack adviser to Air Combat Command, told Aviation Week that he is preparing to send two AT-6s and two A-29s.The test would take place in areas under U.S. Central Command's area of responsibility, but the precise location decision would be determined by Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Harrigian, commander of U.S. Air Force Central Command.At the Air Force Association Conference last week, Harrigian said ""air superiority is job one,"" but once air superiority is assured, then a light-attack aircraft can be used.""I think the light attack would be able to provide me a lot of options, particularly if you're able to move closer to the forward line of the troops, provide the persistence that this type of platform will provide.""Textron shares rose 1.5% to 53.93, edging above buy range, and U.S.-listed shares of Brazil-based Embraer rallied 1.1% on the stock market today.  Boeing gained 0.6% and Lockheed added 0.2%, with both still in buy range.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The price tag for the Super Tucano would be more than $10 million, or about a tenth the current unit cost of Lockheed's F-35. Operating a propeller plane like the Super Tucano would only cost a few thousand dollars per hour vs. $19,000 per hour for Lockheed's F-16 and $44,000 for the F-35A variant, according to Air Force data cited by the Washington Post.The F-35 and Super Hornet would still form the backbone of the U.S. fighter fleet and would be needed in so-called contested environments against high-end rival planes from China and Russia.But will a light attack aircraft be enough force against terror groups in the Middle East?The AT-6 can carry conventional and laser-guided bombs and be used for precision attack as well as surveillance missions.The Super Tucano can carry rockets, air-to-air missiles and laser-guided bombs and is already in use by the fledgling Afghan Air Force.

24,TXT,"The Japanese and South Korean governments have unveiled military budget increases geared toward defending against the growing threat from North Korea.XOn Thursday, Japan's Defense Ministry released a request for a 2.5% increase in defense spending $47.78 billion for the fiscal year starting in April 2018. Earlier this week, South Korea said it will boost its military budget next year by 6.9% to $38.4 billion, the biggest hike in eight years.The ministry has earmarked $160 million for missile development programs, including $90 million for studying hypersonic weapons, which fly at five times the speed of sound and could more easily evade enemy defenses, according to Reuters.Japan's defense budget also includes money for Raytheon's (RTN) ship-to-air SM-3 Block IIA missiles that have double the range of Japan's current ship-based missiles, and Lockheed Martin's (LMT) surface-to-air PAC-3 missile for use in the Patriot system.Lockheed's Aegis Ashore missile-defense system or Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system are under consideration too, but a decision between the two isn't expected until later this year.Other defense expenditures include six Lockheed F-35 fighters, four V-22 Ospreys made by Boeing (BA) and Textron's (TXT) Bell unit, a submarine and two compact warships.In South Korea, the government plans to spend more money on spy satellites, surveillance drones, missile defense systems, and long-range air-to-surface missiles, among other things.President Moon Jae-in also approved recently the full deployment of South Korea's THAAD antimissile battery, which was highly controversial earlier this year. The first two antimissile launchers were deployed in April.Raytheon shares were down 0.1% in midday trading on the stock market today, but have soared nearly 30% this year. Lockheed eased 0.2%, and Boeing lost 0.5%. But like Raytheon, defense stocks in general have been strong performers this year, with many well above buying range.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.North Korea has become more aggressive with its missile tests in recent months. On Tuesday, it launched an intermediate-range ballistic Hwasong-12 that can fly up to 3,000 miles over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the launch an ""unprecedented serious and grave threat"" that ""significantly undermines the peace and security of the region"" and called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council.The missile test came during joint U.S.-South Korea war games that Pyongyang is against.

25,TXT,"There's plenty to like about the fundamentals of the aerospace and defense sector.XThe U.S. plans to increase combat operations in Afghanistan, while the battle against ISIS in Iraq and Syria continues. North Korea's nuclear program has placed greater urgency on missile defense technology. Passenger jet manufacturers and their suppliers enjoy a long backlog of orders for new-generation planes.Against that backdrop, it's little surprise that iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA) ETF is trading near record highs. The exchange traded fund has been in a long-term advance since a low in February 2016, and shares are finding support in a pullback to the 10-week moving average.The ETF owns 40 U.S. stocks, with the greatest portfolio weight in industry giants such as Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and General Dynamics (GD). Two other major fund holdings are walking to the altar after Rockwell Collins (COL) agreed to a $23 billion buyout from United Technologies (UTX) early this month.IBD'S TAKE: ETFs' prospects for future gains depend on the health of their holdings. You can check how holdings stack up at IBD's Stock Checkup.Boeing has been a winning stock this year, and shares surged 10% July 26 after a strong earnings report. The stock is now forming a new base. Textron (TXT) broke out of a base Monday to the highest price since June 2008. The company's businesses include Bell Helicopter, Cessna aircraft and combat vehicles.Defense spending rarely drops, which is one reason iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense has been a good long-term performer. The ETF's only down year in the last 10 was 2008, while the financial crisis unfolded. The fund's five-year total return is more than 20% and the 10-year return is about 11%, according to the iShares website.Shorter term, there are hurdles. President Trump is seeking to boost military spending, although Congress made a much smaller proposal and both plans are well beyond current spending caps.Commercial aviation has been a growth industry of its own, largely because many airlines have been busy ordering new jets with higher fuel efficiency and other operating advantages.Although risks in that segment appear to be minimal, a Canaccord Genuity analyst saw greater potential in defense stocks.""We believe there is more upside in the defense sector in the next two years than in the commercial aerospace sector ..., which we believe will be a tailwind for defense stocks into 2018,"" analyst Ken Herbert wrote in a report last month. ""Note that defense investment outlays, as of June, were up (about) 4% on a rolling-12-month basis.

The AT-6 can carry conventional and laser-guided bombs and be used for precision attack and ISR missions.The turbo prop costs $10 million to $14 million depending on the configuration, with a per-flight-hour cost of around $500.  The Super Tucano is already being used by the fledgling Afghan Air Force for counterterroism missions and is in service in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and six other countries. The plane can carry munitions from rockets to air-to-air missiles to laser-guided bombs.The plane failed to meet the experiment's requirements to have a pressurized cockpit and ejection seat but was still invited to attend.So far the planes have performed in both day and night tests and have flown with and without weapons.""That data is intended to inform strategic decisions,"" Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said to visiting reporters last week, according to Defense News. ""It will also tell us whether we take this to the next step.""A next step might mean a mission in a real combat zone, such as Iraq, to test the planes' attack and ISR capabilities and ability to land on primitive forward runways  in a permissive environment.RELATED: As North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense WorksWhy This Cold War-Era Spy Legend Could Last More Than 100 Years

29,TXT,"The Pentagon is drafting its budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 — the first that will fully show the Trump administration's vision for military spending — and events in Afghanistan, the Korean Peninsula and the U.S. Navy may weigh on the White House's priorities for defense dollars.""The 2017 and 2018 budgets were mostly about just trying to recover some readiness, they didn't look at sustainment and new investment and capabilities,"" said Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at CSIS.President Trump is reportedly going to announce the deployment of 4,000 more troops as part of his long-awaited plan for Afghanistan when he address the nation tonight at 9 p.m. ET.Hunter said that isn't a major increase, so defense contractors in Afghanistan are unlikely to see a big spike in business. But the troop buildup also means Trump won't withdraw U.S. troops and produce a huge negative for companies.""If Trump had decided to scale back U.S. commitment and withdrawal, those engaged with Afghan security forces couldn't stay there,"" Hunter told IBD.Makers of ground vehicles, like General Dynamics (GD), could get a boost — as well as the companies that help maintain vehicles for the Afghan military.Sales of the low-cost A-29 Super Tucano aircraft, used by the fledgling Afghan Air Force for counterterrorism missions, could also get a boost, Hunter added.The plane's performance in Afghanistan could have implications for the U.S. arsenal too. The Air Force is looking at possibly buying up to 300 low-cost attack aircraft by 2022, to reduce wear and tear on more advanced fighters and cut operating expenses as missions continue in the Middle East.The Super Tucano, made jointly by privately held Sierra Nevada and Brazil's Embraer (ERJ), is participating in a U.S. Air Force experiment with light-attack aircraft, along with the Textron (TXT) Scorpion and AT-6 Wolverine and the AT-802L Longsword by L3 Technologies (LLL).U.S. and South Korea forces will conduct previously scheduled joint military exercises this week despite pressure from North Korea and China to cancel the event.The war games could prompt North Korea to ratchet up pressure again, after pulling back from its threats to launch missiles toward Guam.Hunter said missile defense spending would have to increase to meet the short-term demands of more intercepts in addition to longer-term R&D, noting that the Office of Management and Budget put out a memo last week that put missile defense at the top of its R&D priorities list.Raytheon (RTN) makes the Patriot system while Lockheed Martin (LMT) builds the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, which is currently deployed outside Seoul, and Boeing (BA) is the prime on the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system used to protect the U.S.RELATED: As North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense Works Late Sunday, the USS John S.

30,TXT,"XGeneral Electric (GE) scored more than $31 billion in orders at the 2017 Paris Air Show, but some of its other interesting moves this week were in 3D printing.The industrial conglomerate inked 3D printing collaborations Wednesday with Swiss industrial heavyweight Oerlikon and French aeronautical company Lauak.GE said Tuesday it is working on a massive 3D printer for jet engine parts, describing it as the world's largest ""laser-powder additive machine,"" capable of producing parts that are one meter in diameter.""The machine will also be applicable for manufacturers in the automotive, power, and oil and gas industries,"" said Mohammad Ehteshami, vice president of GE Additive, in a statement.The announcements follow GE's acquisitions last year of leading European metal 3D printer manufacturers Concept Laser, Arcam and SLM Solutions as well as its creation of a stand-alone GE Additive unit, sharpening its challenge to 3D printer makers 3D Systems (DDD), Stratasys (SSYS) and HP Inc. (HPQ).GE has a self-described ""aggressive"" target of $1 billion in annual revenues by 2020 for its burgeoning Additive division; customers include Cessna-maker Textron (TXT).GE's 3D printer business has both near- and long-term implications for the company, said Jeff Sprague, an analyst with Vertical Research Partners, an independent equity research firm.""We see GE's additive strategy bearing fruit foremost in speed of prototyping and cost reductions on certain complex components,"" Sprague said in an email to IBD Friday. ""This, in turn, could accelerate GE's speed to market with new products or innovative solutions for its installed base, which should augment growth and profitability.""Using 3D printers can streamline designs, while enabling lighter and stronger systems than traditionally cast and forged parts. For example, GE has slashed the number of parts in its LEAP 3D-printed fuel nozzle to just one from 18.A more aggressive push in 3D printing could lift GE's top line at a key moment, as the company undergoes a leadership change after struggles to grow sales and profits have weighed on the stock, which is trading at roughly the same level it did three years ago.Meanwhile, companies like 3D Systems and Stratasys have grown more upbeat on demand for 3D printers in the industrial sector, as the technology moves beyond prototyping to more factory floors.GE shares rose 2 cents to 27.57 on the stock market today, but still fell 4.9% for the week.Despite the latest 3D printing announcements, shares of GE are poised for a weekly loss of nearly 5%.

31,TXT,"ARLINGTON, Va. — The Air Force will formally seek proposals Friday for aircraft that would fly in a low-cost attack plane experiment, with Texton (TXT,) Northrop Grumman (NOC), Boeing (BA) and Embraer (ERJ) seen as potential participants.Responses from industry are expected within a month, with the selected aircraft flying in tests this summer at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, said Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, at an Air Force Association breakfast Thursday.The Pentagon has debated the idea for a light-attack aircraft for some time and even deployed Vietnam-era propeller-driven planes to Iraq in 2015 to see how they performed against the Islamic State, which lack sophisticated air defenses.The idea is to reduce wear and tear on more advanced fighters and cut operating expenses. Aircraft like Lockheed's F-35 and Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet would still form the backbone of the U.S. fighter fleet for missions in so-called contested environments and against sophisticated planes from China and Russia.""We want to look at a concept to see if we can have a lower operating cost, a lower unit cost and for something that would be able to operate in a permissive or more permissive environment than what I would require a fourth- or fifth-gen aircraft to operate in,"" Bunch said.Textron could submit its AirLand Scorpion, after dropping the plane out of the running for the Air Force's T-X trainer plane contest, or its Beechcraft AT-6 aircraft. After also dropping out of the T-X program, Northrop could propose the plane once envisioned for that contract, according to Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS.Meanwhile, Boeing and Saab could submit their joint T-X proposal, and Brazil's Embraer could submit its A-29 Super Tucano.""No one who has developed a trainer in the last 40 years has done it solely for the trainer market,"" Bobbi said, noting the Pilatus of Switzerland as one exception.Northrop shares fell 1.5% to 240.28 on the stock market today. Boeing dipped 0.3% to 178.19. Embraer's U.S.-listed shares climbed 1.4% to 243.96. Textron fell 0.4% to 47.65.In announcing plans for the experiment, acting Air Force Secretary Lisa Disbrow said earlier this month the Air Force needs to ""explore off-the-shelf technologies"" to curb costs as the service faces budget and workforce constraints.The price tag for buying the Super Tucano, for example, would be more than $10 million, or about a tenth the current cost of Lockheed's F-35. Operating the Super Tucano would only cost a few thousand dollars per hour vs. $19,000 per hour for Lockheed's F-16 and $44,000 for the F-35A variant, according to Air Force data cited by the Washington Post.Bunch stressed Thursday that what is now designated as the OA-X experiment is not an official acquisition program and could be scrapped if submissions aren't as mature as the Air Force wants.And even if the Pentagon did decide to buy new, low-cost attack planes, they wouldn't come at the expense of modernization efforts for fifth-generation fighters.""Moving in this direction would be additive for what the Air force has for dollars and manpower for today,"" Bunch said.Potentially tripping up the Air Force's efforts is the Army's program to replace its helicopters, including Boeing Apaches, which could be sped up to fly in the mid to late-2020s from the current plan for 2030, said IHS analyst Bobbi.""If the Army accelerates (the Future Vertical Lift program), the whole argument for the fixed-wing light strike goes away,"" he told IBD. ""That's the wild card in the game.""

36,TXT,"Boeing (BA) emphasized the importance of trade with China for aerospace industry jobs in the U.S. as President Donald Trump pushes for more protectionist policies.CEO Dennis Muilenburg said on a conference call Wednesday that a ""healthy trade relationship between the U.S. and China is still important.""China is emerging as a key aerospace market as the country's rising middle class boosts demand for travel. In September, Boeing estimated China would need 6,810 airplanes, valued at $1 trillion, over the next 20 years.To stay competitive Muilenburg said the planned 737 completion plant in Zhoushan is ""an important part of the partnership equation.""""That finishing center is a location where we can add value in China, but every airplane that goes there is built in the U.S.,"" he said. ""It's a great example of how growth in China creates growth in U.S. manufacturing jobs.""Muilenburg was bullish on Trump's focus on the American workforce and tax reforms and regulations for the aerospace sector, but Citron Research warned earlier this month that Trump is a big threat to the industry as he looks to lower military aircraft costs.But strong Q4 results sent Boeing shares up 4.2% to 167.36, hitting record highs on the stock market today, continuing to break out after just clearing a 160.17 buy point on Monday. European rival Airbus (EADSY) fell 0.8%.Adjusted Q4 earnings jumped 54% to $2.47 a share, marking its fastest growth in more than three years, as revenue dipped 1% to $23.29 billion, better than forecasts for $23.19 billion.Commercial aircraft revenue rose 1% to $16.24 billion, as Q4 deliveries edged up 1.6% to 185.

Operating cash flow is seen increasing to $10.75 billion next year from $10.5 billion in 2016, as the 787 program has finally turned cash-flow positive, boosting prospects for more stock buybacks and dividend hikes.Boeing's commercial division has been pressured by Airbus in recent years and its hot-selling A321neo.

But Muilenburg met with Trump and said the company could build a new Air Force One for under $4 billion.But Trump also tweeted last month that he asked Boeing to price out a F/A-18 Super Hornet ""comparable"" to the F-35.

38,TXT,"Ever since the U.S. presidential election, Ed Dahlberg has pretty much had a smile on his face.Dahlberg brokers the sale of private jets, and already he's seeing interest pick up and used-aircraft prices starting to firm up. The sale of a single-engine turboprop aircraft that he recently handled went for about 5% more than anticipated.""My phone is ringing off the hook"" from people interested in buying used jets, said Dahlberg, president of Emerald Aviation Inc. in Manassas, Va. ""Just the business climate feels like it's getting better.""The era of Donald Trump, a man long associated with conspicuous consumption, figures to be good to a whole range of luxury-goods industries. But perhaps nowhere is that excitement greater than in the private-aircraft business.Not only is Trump, whose personal Boeing 757 became an iconic campaign image, seen as someone who'll be an advocate for the industry but he replaces a president who so often criticized private-air travel that he turned it into a taboo symbol of inequality and helped prolong a sales slump of almost a decade.""You'll see more people not being gun shy or embarrassed or apologetic for operating a corporate jet,"" said Steve Varsano, founder of broker The Jet Business.Demand for private jets is far from the heady days of more than 1,000 deliveries in 2007 and 2008, before the recession hit. In 2016, manufacturers were set to ship 655 jets, according to a JPMorgan Chase estimate, lower than 689 in both 2014 and 2015 after an oil boom that had boosted sales among drillers went bust. Used jet prices have tumbled 12% since November 2015, the bank said.It's far too early to see any sales pickup, of course, and the industry buzz of a comeback is just that at the moment. But investors are encouraged. Shares of private jet manufacturers have soared on Trump's victory. Since Nov. 9, Textron (TXT) gained 19%, General Dynamics (GD) rose 12% and Bombardier Inc. jumped 22%. Aircraft sales amount to about 30% of their revenue.""The Trump win looks positive for (business) jet demand given the postelection stock surge, economic stimulus from an expected lower tax rate and less regulation, and shift away from Obama's anti-(business) jet rhetoric,"" Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., wrote in a report earlier this month.Alain Bellemare, chief executive officer of Canadian plane maker Bombardier, said in an interview that in Trump he sees ""somebody understanding the value of business aircraft and what it creates.""""Anybody who is pro-business, pro-growth, who will foster investment in infrastructure — it's all good for our business,"" he said. ""So I hear the tone now and I'm optimistic.""Most of the manufacturing jobs to produce corporate jets are in North America, Bellemare said. That fits in with Trump's theme of keeping factory workers in the U.S. Both Bombardier and Textron's Cessna unit make aircraft in Wichita, Kan. Gulfstream, the corporate jet unit of General Dynamics, has its factories in Savannah, Ga. Even Brazilian jet producer Embraer (ERJ) manufactures planes in Melbourne, Fla.Trade groups have long argued that private aircraft are business tools that help executives save time and make multicity visits they otherwise couldn't with commercial flights. For security, some companies mandate their top officers fly on the corporate plane.That message was lost when auto executives flew to Washington in their private planes to request bailout money in November 2008, sparking a backlash as the economy careened into recession. A call from a Treasury Department official in 2009 persuaded Citigroup (C), which was getting U.S. government rescue funds, to drop plans to take delivery of a $50 million Falcon 7X aircraft manufactured by Dassault Aviation (DASTY).In a 2011 press conference, Obama called out private jet owners six times to bash a tax break that allows corporate planes to be depreciated over five years instead of seven years for commercial airliners. The National Business Aviation Association sent the president a letter expressing ""disappointment with the way you mischaracterized and disparaged business aviation.""But that was then, as broker Dahlberg sees it.""I've noticed that while there's still a huge amount of inventory, people just don't keep dropping the price every week,"" he said. ""You can really feel the floor in the market right now.""

It now sees core organic sales down 1%-2% vs. the prior target for a 1% decline.Slumps in emerging markets and the oil industry have crimped demand for business aircraft and helicopters, CEO Dave Cote said on a Friday morning conference call. Aerospace sales fell 6% to $3.6 billion in Q3, with Honeywell expecting weakness continuing into 2017.Demand for hand-held scanners from logistics firms also hasn't been strong, Honeywell said.Honeywell plunged 7.5% to close at 106.94 Friday, crashing below its 200-day moving average and hitting a seven-month low of 105.25 intraday.IBD'S TAKE: There's aerospace and then there's space.

41,TXT,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 wowed crowds at the Farnborough Airshow in the U.K. last month, streaking across the sky, hovering in midair and even flying backward. Weeks later, the Air Force declared its version of the F-35 combat ready. Despite ongoing concerns about its development, the stealth fighter continues to reach key milestones, and production will hit full speed in a few years.Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major subcontractor on the F-35, has locked down the other key piece of the Pentagon's combat aircraft upgrade cycle, winning the B-21 contract last year to build replacements for Cold War-era Boeing (BA) B-52s.With the $400 billion F-35 and $80 billion B-21 contracts in hand, Lockheed and Northrop would appear to have established air superiority. But there are hundreds of billions of Pentagon aerospace dollars still up for grabs, and demand overseas for high-tech missiles is on the rise, meaning Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing can make more money and boost their shares as the new weapons stay in service for decades.""The general view at the moment is that investors prefer the longer horizon of a defense portfolio,"" said Howard Rubel, Jefferies managing director in equity research. ""If you look at the viability of Northrop or Raytheon today, there is enough turmoil that defense will continue to grow at a faster rate than the overall economy.""And Lockheed's expected organic growth of 4% through 2018 tops the 2.8% pace for the overall defense sector, Goldman Sachs said Wednesday, citing the F-35 program's size. Growth at Northrop, Raytheon and Flir Systems (FLIR), however, could outpace Lockheed's, Goldman added.Lockheed shares fell 1.65% Friday and are up 12.6% so far this year. Northrop dipped 0.7% but has seen a 12% climb in 2016. Raytheon has run 13% higher, while Boeing has lost 8.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed shares have eased below buy range, Northrop is 5.5% below an entry point, while Raytheon is above buying territory. While Boeing has been a drag on the Aerospace/Defense group, the pure-play defense stocks have helped lift the industry group to No. 66 out of the 197 IBD tracks, and they also have been boosting their dividends.Boeing, however, is entering a transition period in its defense unit, which lost the B-21 bid with partner Lockheed. As production of its F-15 Eagle and F/A-18 Super Hornet eventually winds down, Boeing -- whose 100-year history includes icons like the B-17 Flying Fortress and the P-51 Mustang -- faces the prospect of no longer making fighters or bombers.In July, Boeing's top defense executive said that the aerospace giant would shift its focus from new fighter jets to maintenance services on existing aircraft, new helicopters, satellites, space programs, and selling more military versions of its passenger jets. But Boeing said that decision wasn't based on one contract loss.""No one competition is going to drive that. It's a matter of managing the investment portfolio that we have with the opportunity and campaigns that we want to go after and win,"" Steve Nordlund, Boeing's vice president for strategy for defense, space and security, said in an interview.Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon and other defense contractors are turning their sights to U.S. nuclear missile contracts that could be worth more than $90 billion.Late last month, the Air Force released requests for proposals for a Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) intercontinental ballistic missile to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman system, and a Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) nuclear cruise missile to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles.The GBSD's estimated cost is $62 billion over 30 years (though an independent Pentagon cost assessment found that estimate is too low). The LRSO's cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion. Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop and Lockheed are expected to bid on the two contracts, and initial contracts are expected to be awarded next year.Boeing officials were bullish in a recent interview with IBD that they would win the award for the GBSD, based on past work in the field.""We are confident the Air Force can rely on us, given our proven commitment,"" said Rich Choppa, director of global sales and marketing at Boeing's defense unit. ""We are just as committed to developing a new system as we were back in 1958 when we developed the Minuteman system that stood the test of time.""Other potential prime contractors for the Minuteman upgrade include Lockheed and Northrop. Some 37 other contractors are bidding on subcontractor work.The issue of ""helicopter money"" isn't limited to central banks. But unlike the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan, the Pentagon isn't contemplating a massive dump of cash from hovering helicopters. Instead, the Pentagon is preparing a massive dump of cash onto makers of helicopters.While less sexy than fighter jets and supersonic missiles, the U.S. military's fleet of helicopters is also due for an upgrade. The Army is looking to replace its Black Hawk helicopters as heavy use in Afghanistan and Iraq have worn them out faster than expected. Textron's (TXT) Bell division is competing against a Boeing-Sikorsky team.The Army is also looking at replacements for its Boeing AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook as well as its Bell OH-58 Kiowa. Providing helicopters to take the places of all four aircraft will be worth an estimated $100 billion. The Pentagon is expected to seek official proposals in 2019, followed by a contract award in 2020.""We feel very strong about our military helicopter position in the market place and the capabilities we would provide customers,"" Boeing's Nordlund said.Lockheed has spent heavily in helicopters, acquiring Sikorsky from United Technologies (UTX) last year for $9 billion and is looking to recoup its investment.Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon and Northrop are all competing for another major Pentagon contract: the Air Force's $8 billion-$10 billion T-X trainer jet, which will be used to train F-22 and F-35 pilots and has potential for massive overseas sales to international customers like the U.K., Italy and others who are buying the F-35.Raytheon is on an industry team that includes Finmeccanica and CAE. Lockheed has partnered with Korea Aerospace Industries. Boeing and Saab are bidding together, and Northrop is leading a coalition that includes BAE Systems and L-3 Communications (LLL). The competition is expected to be fierce, and a contract award is expected late next year.On Lockheed's Q2 conference call, CEO Marillyn Hewson called its upgraded T-50A, which completed its first test flight in South Korea in June, ""a very good offering. It's an excellent solution. It's low risk.""Boeing has kept its design under wraps, only releasing concept art of the nose of a jet, though more details are expected next month. Pictures of a Northrop prototype in Mojave, Calif., leaked out earlier this week and appeared to share some similarities with the Air Force's current trainer jet, the T-38, which is also made by Northrop.Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop and privately held General Atomics are the likely bidders for the Navy's aerial-refueling drone, the MQ-25A Stingray.The program has been scaled back from its original inception, which envisioned a drone that would perform strike and surveillance missions.The Navy is still working on the requirements for the tanker drone, but stealth won't be on that list, Vice Adm. Mike Shoemaker told reporters earlier this month. The service plans to issue a formal request for proposals in the second half of next year and award a contract in 2018.Derrick Maple, unmanned systems analyst at IHS Markit, estimates that development, production and support costs could reach $6 billion.As missiles become more advanced, foreign governments are increasingly looking to them to boost defenses amid deepening global tensions.Last year, Raytheon booked a $2 billion order from Saudi Arabia for its Patriot missile and air defense system. South Korea and Japan are also paying Raytheon to upgrade their Patriot systems as the missile threat from North Korea looms. And by year's end, the Polish government is expected to finalize a Patriot deal that is estimated at $5.5 billion amid rising friction with Russia.Raytheon is also working with Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems on revamping the Iron Dome defense system for its bid for the U.S. Army's Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 as protection against missiles and drones, among other threats.Raytheon isn't alone in the missile-defense market. Lockheed's THAAD system will be stationed in South Korea by late 2017. Lockheed and partner MBDA, a European defense giant, are bidding on a $4.5 billion German missile-defense deal that could be wrapped up later this year.And while U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan has greatly diminished over the last decade, the war against ISIS is boosting demand for munitions. Berenberg analysts said earlier this year that they expect sales of Lockheed's Hellfire missiles and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles to climb 7%-8% this year on ""restocking activities in the U.S. and export demand.""Geopolitical strains should continue spurring more spending. In addition to the Islamic State in the Middle East, Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Russia flexing its muscles in Eastern Europe, disputes with China in the East China Sea are leading Japan to develop a land-to-sea missile system of its own. Top U.S. defense contractors may get involved.""The thing with these top-tier contractors, they have a lot of capabilities they can apply to various product areas that they want to invest in,"" Jefferies analyst Rubel said.RELATED:Lockheed F-35 'On A Path Toward Failing To Deliver' Full CapabilityNavy To Modernize Boeing Super Hornets To Fly With Lockheed F-35Boeing May Extend F/A-18 Work On Kuwait, Navy OrdersAir Force Touts Combat-Ready F-35 As 'Deterrent To Adversaries'

Meanwhile Japan's SoftBank (SFTBY) announced it will buy U.K. chip designer ARM Holdings (ARMH), while the Justice Department blocked two big health insurance merger deals.The S&P 500 and Dow hit fresh highs while the Nasdaq set new 2016 bests as all three rose modestly for a fourth straight weekly gain. Facebook (FB), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU) were among a slew of stocks hitting buy points, though Facebook's low-volume breakout struggled. Several other highly rated big names are close to entry points. Oil prices retreated to below $45 a barrel.Internet television network Netflix attracted just 1.68 million new customers in the second quarter vs. its target for 2.5 million. For Q3, Netflix expects to add 2.3 million new subscribers, vs. analyst estimates for 3.7 million. Netflix blamed the slowing subscriber growth on increased churn related to price increases for longtime subscribers. It also said the Summer Olympics will put the brakes on new subscriber gains in August. Netflix topped profit views, but shares sank nearly 13% for the week.Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk unveiled his ambitious, long-term plans for the electric car company in combination with SolarCity (SCTY), which Tesla aims to acquire in a $2.8 billion offer. Plans include a new kind of pickup and minibus, as well as a compact SUV and a commercial truck. All of this as Tesla struggles to meet its production goals. The expansive report gave no indication about when Tesla will be consistently profitable. Tesla stock fell more than 3% on Thursday after the ""masterplan"" was released, but rose close to 1% for the week, holding above the 200-day line.Tesla will hold a ""grand opening"" event July 29 for its Gigafactory, though the Reno, Nev., battery plant is far from finished.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla stock is still trying to recover and the company has report several quarters of losses.

For the just-started fiscal year, it vowed to improve the profitability of its cloud businesses including Office 365 and Azure. Microsoft shares rose 5.3% to 56.57 this week, close to a buy point of 56.87.Japan's SoftBank will pay $32 billion to acquire ARM Holdings, which designs chips for the Apple (AAPL) iPhone, as well as for most other smartphones and the booming Internet of Things market. The deal occurred after the Brexit vote caused the British pound to tumble vs. the yen. SoftBank plans to expand ARM's overseas headcount over the next five years. But some analysts wonder: Can SoftBank maintain ARM's vendor-neutral approach?ARM shares have soared 40% so far this week. SoftBank fell nearly 11%. Sprint (S), majority-owned by SoftBank, slid 7.6%.Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) Q2 EPS sank 80% to 87 cents, while revenue fell 17% to $998.4 million. Both missed views. Still, Chipotle shares rose 9.3% this week, retaking the 50-day line. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) beat views, with EPS up 21% to 98 cents on 12% revenue growth to $547.3 million. Domino's stock broke out to a new high, leaping 9.6%. Papa John's (PZZA) popped 6% as KeyBanc said pizza deliveries are faring well amid civil unrest.Starbucks (SBUX) disappointed with a Q3 revenue miss and in-line EPS, as adjusted profit grew 17% to 49 cents on 7% sales growth to $5.24 billion. But weaker-than-expected Americas comps were an ""anomaly,"" said CEO Howard Schultz. Starbucks rallied Friday to hit three-month highs. Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) turned in mixed results. Shares fell Thursday but rose 2.3% for the week.EBay (EBAY) gapped out of a base, spiking 16% for the week to a record high after reporting Q2 EPS growth of 2% to 43 cents, beating views by a penny. Revenue rose 6% to $2.2 billion, also topping. Top- and bottom-line guidance for Q3 was light, but eBay's full-year projections were strong. Yahoo (YHOO) Q2 EPS missed by a penny but revenue and Q3 revenue guidance easily beat forecasts. Reports say Verizon (VZ) may announce a Yahoo buyout deal within a few days.Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) reported mixed earnings. Intel's $13.5 billion and 59 cents earnings per share ex items for Q2 edged and topped the consensus, respectively. But Intel shares fell from an 18-month high on weaker-than-expected data center sales, though they closed the week down just 1.2%. Qualcomm reported $6 billion in sales and $1.16 EPS ex items for fiscal Q3, beating Wall Street expectations for a respective $5.58 billion and 97 cents. Qualcomm shares rose nearly 12% to a nine-month high. For fiscal Q3, Skyworks reported $751.7 million in sales and $1.24 EPS minus items, both down 7% vs. the year-earlier quarter but narrowly beating consensus expectations. Skyworks slid 8.6% on Friday and 3.8% for the week.After a long review, the Justice Department filed to block the Aetna (AET)-Humana (HUM) and Anthem (ANTM)-Cigna (CI) mergers, saying they would hurt competition and consumers. Shares rose on the news though, as investors had priced in skepticism that the deals would win approval. Meanwhile, Humana raised its EPS guidance and said it will exit many ObamaCare exchange markets next year. UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest managed care firm, topped EPS views and said 2017 profit will improve from exiting nearly all exchanges.United Airlines (UAL) beat Q2 estimates and cut full-year carrying capacity growth, as international uncertainties weighed. The carrier also said it would reduce winter flights to the U.K. Delta Air Lines (DAL) said in the prior week that it would do the same following the nation's Brexit vote. Southwest (LUV) forecast a Q3 unit revenue decline, which would be its first this year. The carrier also missed Q2 estimates, and, like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), indicated that heavy lower-fare competition persists -- good for customers, but bad for airlines' financial results. American Airlines (AAL) reported a Q2 profit drop that wasn't as bad as expected. American also said the Brexit may help, not hurt, global carriers.The Q2 season kicked off with three solid reports from big-cap drugmakers. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) beat estimates and raised guidance, driven by the strength of its pharma division. Novartis (NVS) also beat Q2 estimates, but its stock fell as it warned of rising expenses related to new drug launches, and also said the FDA had rejected its biosimilar version of Amgen (AMGN) drug Neulasta. Biogen (BIIB) rose after its beat and raised, but its CEO George Scangos said he was quitting after six years.J&J stock rose modestly to a fresh high. Novartis advanced slightly, and Biogen jumped nearly 11% as biotech stocks tried to recover.General Motors (GM) reported strong Q2 profit growth, topping estimates.

Ford (F) reports next week. Volkswagen (VLKAY) is mulling building an electric vehicles plant either at its Chattanooga, Tenn., site or in Mexico.General Electric (GE) reported a 65% EPS gain for Q2, much better than expected, but industrial orders fell 16%, and core organic revenue fell too. Honeywell (HON), another diversified industrial giant, topped EPS views but missed on sales. Honeywell cut its full-year organic revenue forecast to a small drop. GE and Honeywell shares fell Friday after hitting long-term highs earlier in the week.Lockheed Martin (LMT) raised its full-year outlook after reporting Q2 results above analyst estimates, but management warned it can't sustain its current level of F-35 spending unless the defense giant gets another production contract from the Pentagon soon. The attempted coup in Turkey isn't expected to weigh on the fighter's sales or production. Textron (TXT), maker of Cessna planes and Bell helicopters, reported a 10% jump in EPS, beating analyst expectations and revenue that climbed 8.1%, also above Wall Street views. It sees full-year EPS of $2.60 to $2.80. The midpoint is under analyst estimates for $2.72.Lockheed stock hit a record high during the week, closing the week up 0.1%. Textron rose 2.8%.

64,TXT,"Manufacturers of business jets should see improved operating conditions in coming months, according to a new report from RBC Capital Markets, as the industry benefits from strong jet deliveries and the expectation that inventories and prices will improve in 2015.
"
65,TXT,"In a note released Monday morning, RBC analysts Derek Spronck, Robert Stallard and Steven Cahall commented on some of the key takeaways from last week's National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) convention in Orlando, Fla.
"
66,TXT,"One takeaway was that the industry has seen ""a strong first half of business jet deliveries and buying intentions,"" the report said. The biggest surprise, however, was ""cautious optimism"" around the light cabin segment.
"
67,TXT,"""Honeywell (HON) noted that this was the first year in the past five where it has seen a positive shift in buyers' intentions in light cabins (albeit from very low levels),"" the RBC analysts wrote.
"
68,TXT,"""The key here is that despite the market conditions in any one segment, the innovation in these new products are substantial enough such that they will be a catalyst for new orders,"" they added.
"
69,TXT,"Because light cabin aircraft don't require a lot of lead time to produce, any rise in demand for these jets would have an immediate impact on the operating results of original equipment manufacturers in the sector, the report said.

120,TXT,"Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) yesterday announced that it has successfully completed $810-million buyout of Tools and Test Equipment business of Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report). The buyout, originally announced on Apr 18, will fortify Emerson’s position in the global professional tools market.Rockford, IL-based Tools & Test primarily engages in manufacturing instruments related to test and measurement and diagnostics. It also produces utility and electrical tools. Prime tool brands offered by Tools & Test include Klauke and Greenlee. Tools & Test operates 11 manufacturing facilities globally and has a workforce of 2,300 people. It generated roughly $470 million in revenues in 2017. Details of BuyoutAs noted, the acquired assets of Tools & Test will be integrated with Ridge Tool business of Emerson. Ridge Tool is part of the company’s Tools & Home Products business — one of the two businesses comprising the company’s Commercial & Residential Solutions segment.The combined business of Tools & Test, and Ridge Tool — anticipated to be worth more than $1 billion — will strengthen Emerson’s existing product offerings to electrical, plumbing and mechanical contractors. Moreover, it will fortify the company’s presence in European markets.Furthermore, Emerson anticipates this buyout to boost cash flow immediately while predicts earnings accretion in fiscal 2019 (ending September 2019). Snapshot of Emerson’s Inorganic InitiativesWe believe that the above-mentioned transaction is consistent with Emerson’s policy of acquiring meaningful businesses to gain access to new customers, regions and product lines.Prior to this buyout, in May 2018, Emerson signed an agreement to acquire Aventics — a Germany-based leader in pneumatics technologies. The buyout will cost the company €527 million and will be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 (ending September 2018). In January 2018, the company completed the buyout of ProSys Inc., thereby adding new technologies to its Operational Certainty initiative while the buyout of Cooper-Atkins has been strengthening its portfolio of cold chain technology.It’s worth mentioning here that acquisitions/divestitures have a positive impact of 8% on sales growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended March 2018). Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksWith a market capitalization of nearly $43.8 billion, Emerson currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We believe that the company’s inorganic initiatives will add more vigor to its product offerings and help in keeping market sentiments positive for the stock.Emerson’s share price gained 0.4% yesterday, closing the trading session at $69.44, while it has rallied roughly 2% in the past three months. The three-month gain comfortably surpassed 1.6% decline of the industry.Also, the company’s earnings estimates have been revised upward in the past 60 days.

121,TXT,"Bell-Boeing, a joint venture (JV) between The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Bell Helicopter — a unit of Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report) — recently secured a modification contract in relation to V-22 aircraft. Per the terms, the JV will convert the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft advance acquisition contract to a multiyear contract.Details of the DealValued at $4.2 billion, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. Per the agreement, the JV will involve in the manufacture and delivery of 39 CMV-22B aircraft for the U.S. Navy; 34 MV-22B aircraft for U.S. Marine Corps; 1 CV-22B for the U. S. Air Force; and 4 MV-22B aircraft for the government of Japan.The majority of the work will be executed in Fort Worth and Amarillo, TX; and Ridley Park, PA; while the rest will be carried out in various locations within continental and outside continental United States.  The JV will utilize fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement (Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps); and fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Navy) fund to complete the task by November 2024. This modification includes 67.9% of the work for the U.S. Navy; 24.8% for U.S. Marine Corps, 1.8% for the U.S. Air Force; and 5.5% for the government of Japan under the Foreign Military Sales program. A Brief Note on V-22 JetsBell-Boeing’s primary product, V-22 Osprey, is a multi-mission, tiltrotor military aircraft with both vertical as well as short takeoff and landing capabilities. It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft. This military aircraft has the capacity to carry 24 combat troops or up to 20,000 pounds of internal cargo or 15,000 pounds of external cargo. The CMV-22B, MV-22B and CV-2B are different variants of the V-22 Osprey.The V-22 tiltrotor has been deployed in numerous missions around the world, including casualty evacuation, tactical recovery of aircraft and personnel, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, resupply, VIP transport and theater security cooperation.Our ViewA rapid increase in terror attacks along with the widespread rise of ISIS has compelled nations to strengthen arsenal and bump up defense budget. The present U.S. administration is also in favor of raising defense spending in contrast to the budget sequestration enacted by the prior government.The recently approved fiscal 2019 defense budget worth $716 billion further supports this fact. Thus, it is obvious that defense majors like Boeing and Textron will receive an increased flow of contracts from the Pentagon for their high-end defense equipment. In fact, the latest contract win by Bell-Boeing mirrors the same. Such contract inflows, in turn, should further drive these two defense contractors’ performance, thereby boosting their respective profit margins.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Boeing’s shares have soared about 68.9%, outperforming the broader industry’s rally of 29.2%. This impressive performance was driven by the company’s record backlog supporting revenue growth, increased orders for commercial airplanes and expanded presence in domestic as well as international markets.Meanwhile, Textron’s shares have gained around 38.1% in a year, ahead of the industry’s rally. This upside can be attributed to the company’s strong order growth along with its systematic inorganic growth strategy.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider     Both Boeing and Textron currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other top-ranked stocks in the same space include Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report). While Northrop Grumman sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Wesco Aircraft Holdings carries a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Northrop Grumman delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 13.87% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings moved 4.3% north to $16.62 in the last 60 days.Wesco Aircraft Holdings’ long-term growth rate is projected at 12%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings moved up 5.5% to 77 cents in the last 60 days.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

122,TXT,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.’s (HII  -  Free Report) business segment, Newport News, recently secured a modification contract to purchase additional long lead time material for supporting the USS Enterprise (CVN 80). Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by February 2027.Valued at $200.4 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C. The company will utilize fiscal 2018 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) fund to finance the task, which will be executed in Newport News, VA.A Brief Note on USS EnterpriseThe USS Enterprise (CVN 80), Gerald R. Ford class’ third aircraft carrier, bears the name of the Navy’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, USS Enterprise (CVN 65).Once CVN 80 enters service, it will replace the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69) — a Nimitz-class ship. Currently, advanced fabrication of CVN 80 is underway, for which the company expects to witness contracting activity by 2020 end.The air wing of this new USS Enterprise will be capable of supporting more than 75 aircraft of varied kinds, including fixed-wing and rotary-wing systems. Moreover, an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) will be incorporated in the ship to replace the steam catapults of the older versions.Our ViewHuntington Ingalls is one of the largest military shipbuilders in the country. Over 70% of the active Navy fleet consists of its ships. Notably, this military shipbuilder’s Newport News division is the nation’s sole designer, builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. It also offers one of only two shipyards capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines.Moreover, it is imperative to mention that Huntington Ingalls’ shipbuilding business outlook remains upbeat, considering the fiscal 2019 budget that has been approved recently by the U.S. Senate. Per the latest financial plan, major war fighting investments includes spending plans of $18.3 billion on Shipbuilding. Also, incremental funding for nuclear aircraft carriers — CVN-79 and CVN-80 — is a part of the fiscal 2019 budget.No doubt, one of the prime beneficiaries of this new spending proposal will be Huntington Ingalls. For more than 100 years, this company has been building ships, aircraft carriers and submarines for the U.S. Navy at the shipyards in Virginia and Mississippi.  Considering such optimistic budget allocation, we may expect Huntington Ingalls to win more such contracts involving its combat-proven military warships in days ahead.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Huntington Ingalls’ shares have gained about 16.5% compared with the industry’s 30.2% rally. The underperformance may have been caused by huge debt levels that the company bears, with the current market situation in the United States being in favor of increasing interest rates. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider    Huntington Ingalls currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Textron (TXT  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).

123,TXT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business unit recently won an $86.8 million five-year contact to support the Iraqi Air Force’s fleet of C-130J aircraft. The contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management, Robins Air Force Base, GA.Details of the DealPer the terms of the deal, Lockheed Martin will provide support services to the Iraqi Air Force that includes contractor logistics support, technical assistance, aircraft and aerospace ground equipment, spares, repairs, and familiarization training on their existing six C-130J aircraft.Work related to the deal will be performed at Martyr Mohammed Ala Air Base, Iraq and is expected to get completed by Jun 30, 2022. Lockheed Martin will utilize foreign military sales funds for completing the tasks. The deal comes with a ceiling value of $100 million.Benefits of the C-130J Hercules AircraftThe C–130J Hercules is a medium-sized tactical transport airlift aircraft that is capable of performing a variety of combat delivery (tactical airlift) operations across a broad range of mission environments. These include the deployment and redeployment of troops, supplies within command areas in a theater of operation, aero-medical evacuation, air logistics support and augmentation of strategic airlift forces. The C-130J aircraft, with its extended fuselage, provides additional cargo carrying capacity for the Air Force combat delivery mission compared to the legacy C-130E/H and the C-130J (short) aircraft.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin's Aeronautics division remains focused on upgrading and providing enhanced support services for its legacy C-130 Hercules fleet, worldwide. In 2017, Lockheed Martin delivered 26 C-130J aircraft, of which seven were international deliveries. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had 64 of these tactical aircraft in its backlog, a number we believe will increase in the coming days, courtesy of the latest contract clinched by the company.The Aeronautics division successfully delivered the 400th C-130J Super Hercules aircraft in the first quarter of 2018. Further, the overall performance of the C-130J program has been continuing to draw global demand with operators in 18 countries. Inevitably, we can expect the Aeronautics division to secure more similar contracts involving its C-130J jets in the days ahead.Furthermore, the recently approved fiscal 2019 defense budget includes a spending plan of $21.7 billion on aircraft. The budget proposal hints at a prospective increase in Lockheed Martin’s C-130J transport aircraft program that has been allotted $1.57 billion.Moreover, the 2018 Appropriations Act supported increased funding for 17 additional C-130J aircraft. These developments reflect solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s C-130J program going ahead, which, in turn, are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about 5.3% in the last year compared with the industry’s growth of 27.4%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

124,TXT,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently secured a contract for the production and delivery of 22 F/A-18E and six F/A-18F Super Hornets to support the government of Kuwait. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by January 2021.Valued at $1.5 billion, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Majority of the order will be carried out in El Segundo, CA and Hazelwood, MO.The company will utilize foreign military sales fund to finance the task.Growing Demand for F/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet is a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet. Notably, it comes in two versions — the single-seat E model and the twin-seat F model.The company is continuously upgrading the Super Hornet program to outpace future threats. Also, Super Hornet’s radar, mission computers and sensors continue to evolve in order to meet extensive mission profiles. Due to the ever-rising worldwide demand of military aircraft, Boeing has developed the Advanced Block III Super Hornet. This fighter jet will complement existing and future air-wing capabilities, which include battle-space situational awareness, counter stealth targeting, increased acceleration and improved survivability.As a result, Boeing is witnessing strong demand for its fighter aircraft and major aerospace programs, including the F-18 aircraft. This is evident from the contract that it secured from Kuwait in the first quarter for delivering 28 F-18 Super Hornets.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing’s key forte lies in manufacturing combat-proven aircraft. It has inevitably secured large number of contracts from the Pentagon for long, courtesy of the company’s proven expertise in aerospace programs. Subsequently, revenues of its Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment witnessed a 13% rise year over year to $5.76 billion in first-quarter 2018.We expect the latest contract along with a handful of other notable deals to help Boeing’s BDS segment deliver such solid performance in upcoming quarters as well.In this context it is imperative to mention that FMS contracts play a key role in driving Boeing’s operational performance. Evidently, the company’s backlog at BDS stood at $50 billion, 36% of which comprised orders from international clients.Interestingly, in terms of international sales for its F-18 fleet, the company enjoys a strong alliance with Kuwait. In fact, in June, Boeing won a $179 million contract for procuring system configuration set H12K to support Kuwait’s fleet of F/A-18E/F jets. Such contract wins along with the latest one should further strengthen Boeing’s relationship with Kuwait’s Air Force, thereby bolstering its position in the expanding military market overseas.  Meanwhile, the recently announced fiscal 2019 defense budget provisioned major war fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircraft. It also included an investment plan of $2 billion for procuring 24 F/A-18Jets. Such proposed inclusions reflect solid growth prospects for the BDS segment, which in turn are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Boeing has rallied about 65.3% compared with the industry’s increase of 27.4%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and military jets.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider     Boeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other top-ranked stocks in the same space include Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Textron (TXT  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).

125,TXT,"Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) business segment, Aerospace Systems, recently clinched a modification contract related to the Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) program. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by June 2020.Details of the DealValued at $15.3 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, District of Columbia. Per the terms of the agreement, the company will provide fabrication, integration, testing, system production and delivery of peculiar support equipment for the ALMDS program.Majority work for the contract will be executed in Melbourne, FL. Northrop Grumman will utilize fiscal 2018 other procurement (Navy) and fiscal 2017 other procurement (Navy) fund to finance the task.What’s ALMDS?The purpose of ALMDS is to detect, classify and localize near-surface, moored sea mines. Notably, it is integrated with Lockheed Martin’s MH-60S helicopter to offer rapid, wide-area reconnaissance and assessment of mine threats in littoral zones, confined straits, choke points and amphibious objective areas. ALMDS is also capable of day or night operations without stopping to stream out or recover equipment.In addition, it provides accurate target geo-location to support follow on neutralization of the detected mines.Our ViewInexpensive and easily deployable mines have been disrupting port and maritime operations as well as preventing naval forces from achieving sea control and power projection ashore. In this context, Northrop Grumman’s ALDMS plays an instrumental role by addressing the U.S. Navy’s immediate need to protect its sea-based assets from the ever-increasing threat of mines.In fact, we believe that Northrop Grumman possesses significant upside potential based on the U.S. government’s increased focus on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) programs.In first-quarter 2018, revenues from the company’s Aerospace Systems unit totaled $3.28 billion, which increased 9.9% year over year. We believe the latest contract along with the other notable ones that the company has secured in recent times should allow its Aerospace Systems unit to reflect similar solid results in upcoming quarters as well.Moreover, the recently approved fiscal 2019 defense budget provisions for an investment plan of $13.7 billion for science and technology, including the ISR Programs. Considering such favorable budgetary revisions, we expect the company to win more such contracts, like the latest one, in the days ahead.Price Movement    In a year’s time, Northrop Grumman has gained about 21.8% compared with the industry’s rally of 29.5%. The underperformance may have been caused by higher operating expenses that the company has been incurring lately.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderNorthrop Grumman currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  Some other top-ranked stocks in the same space include Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Textron (TXT  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).

126,TXT,"Per major media releases, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) has recently entered into an agreement with the second largest Indian airline, Jet Airways, for delivering 75 of its 737 MAX narrow body jet aircraft. The agreement is in line with Jet Airways’ latest rush to expand their carriers to meet the expanding domestic passenger demand in the country.The deal, valued more than $9 billion at current list prices, led to the third consecutive agreement between Boeing and Jet Airways over the last ten months, taking the total purchased tally to 225 aircraft. However, it’s yet to be revealed whether the agreement was a formal order or a non-binding memorandum of understanding.Boeing’s Prospects in IndiaDue to the rising level of airborne passenger and cargo traffic, major airlines from all over the world, including India-based airlines are increasing their fleet size to meet rigorous customer demands. According to the International Air Transport Association, the domestic Indian passenger traffic witnessed a 27.9% rise in March 2018 from the previous year. Naturally, this must have prompted Indian airlines, in particular, to aggressively expand their fleet size and the latest deal between Boeing and Jet Airways is a glowing example of that.In fact, lately, Boeing has inked a number of significant deals with its Indian customers to support the growing aviation market in the nation. In this line, Boeing has recently entered into a $3.3 billion agreement, at list prices, with Vistara for delivering six of its 787 dreamliners to the company. SpiceJet also placed a firm order for 40 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in June, a deal valued at a list price of $4.74 billion, the first of which is likely to be delivered later this year. Such impressive orders for its commercial airplanes in India will pave a solid foundation for the company to capture a sizeable market share in the country.In light of these developments, it is imperative to mention that India has emerged as another promising market for Boeing, with the Asia’s third largest economy, which is expected to become the world’s fastest growing aviation market. According to the company, the country will need 2,100 new planes worth $290 billion in the next 20 years, up 13.5% from the year-ago estimate of 1,850 planes. Therefore, we may expect to witness more such deals in coming days between Indian airlines and Boeing, which is the largest jet maker in the world.Price MovementBoeing’s stock rallied about 66.6% in a year compared with the industry’s growth of 29.5%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and military jets.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

127,TXT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division recently won a $175.3-million modification contract to support the F-35 Lightning depot implementation plan for the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy and non-Department of Defense (DoD) participants. The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealPer the terms, Lockheed Martin will provide development, testing and activation services for thirteen different F-35 component repair capabilities in support of the implementation plan. The modification includes 46.9% of the work for the U.S. Air Force, 23.5% for the U.S. Navy, 23.5% for the U.S. Marine Corps and 6.1% for the non-DoD participants.Work related to the deal will be performed in Nashua, NH; Torrance, CA; Fort Worth, TX and other various locations across the United States. The tasks are expected to get completed by November 2021. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps) and non-DoD funds for completing the task.Benefits of F-35 Joint Strike Fighter ProgramThe F-35 Lightning is a supersonic, multi-role fighter jet, which represents a quantum leap in air-dominance capability, offering enhanced lethality and survivability in hostile, anti-access airspace environments. Its advanced stealth allows pilots to penetrate into areas without being detected by enemy radars. It is being used by the defense forces of the United States and 11 other nations, worldwide, largely due to its advanced stealth, integrated avionics, sensor fusion, superior logistics support and powerful integrated sensors capabilities.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?The F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 24% of its total consolidated net sales in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, higher sales at Aeronautics, primarily attributable to higher sales registered for the F-35 program and increased volume on F-35 sustainment activities during the same time frame, enabled its Aeronautics segment’s revenue to grow 7% year over year to $4.4 billion. As of May 14, 2018, the company successfully delivered more than 290 F-35 jets to the United States and its allies.Lockheed Martin, being one of the Pentagon’s prime contractors, enjoys a steady flow of contracts each year and the second quarter of 2018 has not been any exception either. In June itself, the company secured a deal worth $736 million to support the F-35 Lightning II program and a contract worth $503 million for providing air vehicle initial spare parts in support of the F-35 program. Considering the frequent order inflows, we expect its Aeronautics unit to reflect similar solid performance in the coming quarterly results as well.Moreover, production of F-35 is expected to rise in the years ahead, given the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy along with commitments from the company’s eight international partners, overseas customers and rising demand on a global scale.Furthermore, the recently approved fiscal 2019 defense budget provisions for a spending plan of $21.7 billion on Aircraft. The budget proposal hints at a prospective increase in Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program that has been allotted $10.7 billion along with additional funding for the procurement of 97 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Evidently, these developments reflect solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 program going ahead, which, in turn, are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about 7.7% in the last year compared with the industry’s growth of 29.5%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

128,TXT,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently signed an agreement with the Vietnamese startup airline, Bamboo Airways, for delivering 20 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft to the latter. The deal, on finalization, is estimated to be worth around $5.6 billion, at current list prices.Per the terms, Bamboo Airways already completed the deposit requirement this month for reserving 20 airplanes, which are tentatively scheduled for delivery, from April 2020 through 2021.    Boeing’s Prospects in the Southeast Asian MarketIn 2017, Boeing identified Southeast Asia as one of the fastest growing markets worldwide for new airplanes. In this context, the company forecasts that the region will need 4,210 new airplanes, valued approximately at $645 billion, in next 20 years. The company also estimates annual air traffic growth of 6.2% over the next 20 years in this region, outpacing the world’s average growth rate by 1.5%.Naturally, to capitalize on the growing opportunities in Southeast Asia, Boeing aims at inking deals for its commercial jet fleet. The latest deal is a glowing example of that.   What’s Ahead for Boeing?Per Boeing’s current market outlook, the world would require 41,030 new planes between 2017 and 2036, worth $6.1 trillion.The company expects widebody jets to be a strong driver, comprising 20% of the total projection. This translates into worldwide demand for 8,210 widebody jets, worth $2.9 trillion, over the next 20 years. As the company continues to witness frequent contract wins for its commercial airplanes, such demand growth should continue to fuel its overall revenue expansion.Moreover, in the first quarter of 2018, the company’s Commercial Airplane Segment, which includes the 787 dreamliner jets, saw an 8% rise in revenues to $13.65 billion. Further, it delivered 184 commercial planes during the quarter, which was up 9% year over year, alongside securing orders for 24 787 dreamliners. Looking ahead, Boeing remains focused on improving cash generation and profitability, driven by favorable delivery mix, supplier step down pricing, and efforts to drive internal productivity and supply-chain management.Such efforts should bolster Boeing’s position in the commercial aerospace market, as prospects for twin-aisle jet planes seem impressive, with more airlines shifting to small and medium-sized wide-body airplanes like Boeing’s 787 fleet. The company’s latest commitment to Bamboo Airways is one such example. Thus, we may expect Boeing to reflect similar strong results and acquire more commercial contracts in days ahead, which, in turn, are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price MovementBoeing’s stock rallied about 65.6% in a year compared with the industry’s growth of 28.9%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and military jets.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

129,TXT,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Electric Boat, recently secured a modification contract for economic ordering quantity material associated with the fiscal 2019-2023 Virginia class submarines. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by January 2019.Details of the DealValued at $225 million, the contract was awarded by Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Electric Boat will utilize fiscal 2018 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funds to finance the task.Work for the modification will be carried out in Spring Grove, IL; Bethlehem, PA; and several different locations across the United States.A Brief Note on Virginia-Class SubmarineThe Virginia-class submarine program is a class of nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines (SSNs) serving the U.S. Navy. These submarines are designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions, jointly constructed by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries.Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare are also carried out by these fast-attack submarines. Notably, these vessels are one of the three classes of attack submarines used by the U.S. Navy. The other two are the Los Angeles class and the Seawolf class. Valued around $2.7 billion each, these three submarines will be operational until 2070.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?General Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. This is because it is one of the only two contractors in the world that are equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines.In December 2015, the Navy updated its force-level goal from its prior target to achieve and maintain a 308-ship fleet, which included 48 SSNs to 355-ship fleet, comprising 66 SSNs. Thereby, reflecting the immense priority that the U.S. Navy bestows upon this class of nuclear submarines.However, the number of SSNs is expected to decline by more than 20% over the next decade due to a smaller number of procurements done in the 90’s. This means, to reach the force-level goal, the U.S. Navy should accelerate their procurement rate in the coming days. For the Virginia-Class submarines, an increased number of procurement contracts can be expected from the Pentagon, which in turn should boost General Dynamics’ profit margin effectively.Furthermore, the U.S. Navy has acknowledged the Virginia-class program as its top priority and allotted an upmarket budget for the same. This also bodes well for General Dynamics as it is the prime contractor for this program.Price Movement    In a year’s time, shares of General Dynamics have lost 4.2% against the industry’s rally of 34%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that General Dynamics faces in the aerospace-defense space. Zacks Rank & Key Picks                                   General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

131,TXT,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently won a contract for procuring system configuration set H12K to support Kuwait government’s fleet of F/A-18E/F Aircraft. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by September 2022.Details of the DealValued at $179 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will procure H12K for software development, modification, integration and testing of the Kuwait Air Force configured F/A-18E/F Aircraft.Work under the agreement will be executed in St. Louis, MO. The company will utilize foreign military sales (FMS) fund to complete the task.A Brief Note on F/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet is a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet. Notably, it serves as the U.S. Navy’s tactical and air superiority aircraft, being capable of performing virtually every mission including air superiority, day/night strike with precision-guided weapons, fighter escort, close air support, suppression of enemy air defenses, maritime strike, reconnaissance, forward air control and tanker missions. The Super Hornet comes in two versions — the single-seat E model and the twin-seat F model.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business and stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. In first-quarter 2018, revenues at its defense segment — Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS) — increased 13% year over year to $5.76 billion. This reflects solid volumes for international fighter jets and weapons. Moreover, the company’s backlog at BDS stood at $50 billion, 36% of which comprised orders from international clients.Surely, the FMS contracts play a key role in driving Boeing’s operational performance. In fact, the company has been receiving increased number of contracts from Kuwait for its combat proven jets. Of late, Boeing’s secured a $1.2 billion contract for delivering 28 F-18 Super Hornets to Kuwait at the end of the first quarter. We believe such contracts including the latest one should further strengthen Boeing’s position in the expanding military market overseas.  Meanwhile, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for major war fighting investments worth $21.7 billion for aircraft. Boeing, being the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, will surely be a significant beneficiary from this proposed budget. The financial plan further includes an investment plan of $2 billion for procuring 24 F/A-18 aircrafts. Such proposed inclusions reflect solid growth prospects for the BDS segment, which in turn are likely to boost the company’s profit margin. Price MovementIn a year’s time, Boeing has rallied about 79.8% compared with the industry’s increase of 34.6%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and military jets.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider     Boeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The aircraft has 11 weapon stations for carrying electronic mission systems and weapons, which can be used to carry out conventional strike missions and suppress enemy air defenses.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing’s key forte lies in the manufacturing of combat-proven aircraft. This has allowed the company to secure a large number of contracts from the Pentagon for long, courtesy of its proven expertise in aerospace programs. Subsequently, revenues of its Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment witnessed a 13% rise year over year to $5.76 billion in first-quarter 2018.Further, last month Boeing entered into an agreement to acquire KLX Inc., a major independent provider of aviation parts and services in the aerospace industry. The acquisition, once completed, should allow Boeing to enhance its global parts distribution and supply chain services, and expand the company’s footprint in the $2.6-trillion services market.Meanwhile, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget in February 2018 that provisioned major war-fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircraft.

133,TXT,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Electric Boat, has clinched a modification contract to procure onboard repair parts for Virginia Class Submarines Pre-Commissioning Unit (PCU) New Jersey (SSN 796) and PCU Iowa (SSN 797). Work related to SSN 796 is scheduled to be over by February 2021, while that for SSN 797 is expected to be completed by August 2021.Details of the DealValued at $36.5 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. The deal includes option for Block IV mechanical and electronic repair parts, which will be stored on the ship while at sea.  Electric boat will utilize fiscal 2016 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) fund to finance the task, which will be carried out in Groton, CT.A Brief Note on Virginia-Class SubmarineThe Virginia-class submarine program is a class of nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines (SSNs) serving the U.S. Navy. These submarines are designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions, jointly constructed by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare are also carried out by these fast-attack submarines. Notably, these vessels are one of the three classes of attack submarines used by the U.S. Navy. The other two are the Los Angeles class and the Seawolf class. Valued around $2.7 billion each, these three submarines will be operational until 2070.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?General Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. This is because it is one of the only two contractors in the world, which are equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines,In December 2015, the Navy updated its force-level goal from its prior target to achieve and maintain a 308-ship fleet that comprised 48 SSNs to 355-ship fleet, including 66 SSNs. This, in turn, clearly reflects the immense priority that the U.S. Navy bestows upon this class of nuclear submarines. However, the number of SSNs is projected to decline by more than 20% over the next decade due to a smaller number of procurements done in the 90’s. This means, to reach the force-level goal, the U.S. Navy should accelerate their procurement rate in the coming days.Therefore, an increased number of procurement contracts can be expected from the Pentagon for the Virginia-Class submarines, which in turn should boost General Dynamics’ profit margin effectively.Furthermore, the U.S. Navy has acknowledged the Virginia-class program as its top priority and allotted an upmarket budget for the same. This also bodes well for General Dynamics as it is the prime contractor for this program.Price Movement    In a year’s time, shares of General Dynamics have lost 1.1% compared with the industry’s rally of 33.8%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that General Dynamics faces in the aerospace-defense space. Zacks Rank & Key Picks                                   General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

134,TXT,"Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., recently secured a $61.8 million contract to support the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance-Demonstrator (BAMS-D) program. The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealPer the terms, the subsidiary will provide operator, maintenance, logistic support and sustainment engineering services for the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance-Demonstrator program. These efforts will ensure the aircraft’s capability for performing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions.  Majority of the work will be performed in Patuxent River, MD, while the remaining work will be executed in Rancho Bernardo, CA and various forward operating locations outside the United States. Work related to the deal is expected to get completed in June 2019. Northrop Grumman will utilize fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds for completing the task.Benefits of the BAMS ProgramThe Broad Area Maritime Surveillance-Demonstrator (BAMS-D), a precursor to the MQ-4C Triton program, is an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) produced for the Navy. Based on the Global Hawk unmanned air system designed for land surveillance, the BAMS-D systems are modified to work in a maritime environment that can support mission flights for more than 24 hours at high altitudes. Its sensors can cover vast areas, imaging huge swaths of territory, open oceans and littorals, providing improved surveillance pictures to fleet commanders.Our ViewWe believe that Northrop Grumman possesses significant upside potential based on the U.S. government’s increased focus on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) programs.Northrop Grumman’s Aerospace Systems unit, which develops unmanned aircraft systems, reported first-quarter 2018 revenues of $3.28 billion that increased 9.9% year over year. We believe the latest contract along with the other notable ones that the company has secured in recent times will allow its Aerospace Systems unit to reflect similar solid results in upcoming quarters as well.Moreover, in February 2018, President Trump revealed the fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal, which included an investment plan of $13.7 billion for science and technology, which included ISR Programs. Considering such favorable budgetary revisions, we may expect the company to win more such contracts, like the latest one, in the days ahead.Price PerformanceShares of Northrop Grumman have rallied about 27.8% in a year compared with the broader industry’s growth of 40.9%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in both domestic and international markets.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Northrop Grumman currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Also, the deal provisions for post-shakedown availability support; reliability and maintainability; system safety program support; material and fleet turnover support; shipyard engineering team; turnkey; crew indoctrination, design tool/design standardization, detail design development as well as other technical and engineering analyses.Such efforts are likely to support construction as well as test and trials of the DDG 51 Class ship. Furthermore, DDG 51 Class LYS has provisions for offering design, engineering, procurement and manufacturing/production services to support design feasibility studies and analyses. These additional supports will modify DDG 51 Class destroyers for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programs sponsored by the Department of the Navy and the Department of Defense.Majority of the work related to this latest deal will be performed in Bath, ME. General Dynamics will use fiscal 2014, 2016 and 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) fund for completing the task.A Brief Note on DDG-51 The DDG 51 Arleigh Burke-class is a multi-mission warship. It features an advanced anti-submarine warfare system, the AEGIS combat system, the Vertical Launching System, two embarked SH-60 helicopters along with advanced anti-aircraft missiles and land-attack missiles. Impressively, the warship offers defense against a wide range of threats, including ballistic missiles.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?General Dynamics’ Marine Systems business segment has an extensive experience in the construction of nuclear submarines, surface combatants and auxiliary ships. BIW, a unit of this segment, provides lifecycle support services for Navy surface ships. Interestingly, as of February 2018, the company secured construction contracts for six DDG-51s, scheduled for delivery through 2024. This reflects the solid demand that this class of ships boast, indicating at the possibility of increased revenue recognition from this program in the coming days.In first-quarter 2018, Marine System’s revenues totaled $2,034 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of more than 5%. We may expect the latest contract win along with the aforementioned delivery contracts to add more impetus to this segment’s growth in the near future.Furthermore, President Trump’s proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget includes an investment plan of $179.1 billion for the U.S Navy. Notably, this financial plan was up 4% compared with the fiscal 2018 budget request. Considering such favorable budgetary revisions, General Dynamics, a prominent shipbuilder in the United States, is expected to win similar contracts from the U.S. Navy moving ahead.Price Movement    In a year’s time, shares of General Dynamics have gained 1.7% compared with the industry’s rally of 43.3%.

136,TXT,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Ordnance and Tactical Systems, Inc., recently secured a $149.2 million modification deal for Hydra rockets, motors and associated components. The contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL, under the foreign military sales (FMS) program.Details of the DealPer the terms of the deal, General Dynamics will deliver various quantities of M151, M274, M257, M278, M156, M264, M278, and WTU-1/B warheads for Hydra-70 rockets, motors and associated components to Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Kenya, Jordan, Nigeria and Qatar.Work related to the deal will be performed in Williston, VT and Hampton, AZ, and is expected to get completed by Feb 28, 2021. General Dynamics will utilize fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018 other procurement (Army) funds for completing the task.Advantages of the Hydra-70 RocketsGeneral Dynamics' Hydra-70 rockets include unitary and cargo warheads for use against point and area targets, providing the user a lethal and lightweight weapon system with multi-mission capability. The Hydra-70 rockets are universally compatible with the Advanced Precision Kill System (APKWS).Fitted to the MK66 MOD 4 motor, these warheads provide low-cost munitions capable of area suppression and defeating threats at extended ranges, as well as providing battlefield obscuration, illumination and marking.These rockets provide military personnel with affordable firepower, matched to the mission for effective engagements and area suppression of a long list of lower-value targets on the battlefield. These advanced rockets can also be mounted on most of the rotary and fixed-wing aircraft, which include the Apache, Cobra and F-16.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?As widespread geo-political tensions loom across the globe, many nations are strengthening their arsenals and taking significant initiatives to upgrade rocket systems. This, in turn, should boost General Dynamics’ overall growth in the rocket and missile market.Notably, General Dynamics' Combat Systems segment that manufactures and supplies Hydra-70 rockets, registered $1.44 billion of sales in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting 11.9% year-over-year growth. We may expect General Dynamics to witness similar strong results in this segment in upcoming quarters as well, buoyed by strong demand for its combat-proven rocket systems, eventually leading to contract wins like the latest one. This, in turn, should expand the company’s profit margin.Moreover, the fiscal 2019 defense budget, recently approved by the U.S. Senate, provisions for a spending plan of $1.2 billion on the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System. Such robust budgetary allotments should aid General Dynamics in acquiring major contracts from the Pentagon, related to its various rocket systems.Furthermore, the rocket and missile market is projected to grow from $55.5 billion in 2017 to $70 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 4.74%, during the forecast period (as per Markets and Markets research firm). This, in turn, should enable General Dynamics to enhance its market share in the aerospace and defense industry.Price Movement    General Dynamics’s stock has lost 5.4% in the last year compared with its industry’s growth of 30.4%.

137,TXT,"General Dynamics Corporation’s (GD  -  Free Report) business unit, Land Systems, recently secured a $258.6 million modification contract to upgrade Stryker flat-bottom vehicles to the patented double V-hull design. The contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Warren, MI.Work related to the deal will be performed in Sterling Heights, MI, and is expected to get completed in Mar 31, 2020. General Dynamics will utilize fiscal 2018 procurement of weapons and tracked combat vehicles’ funds for completing the task.A Brief Note on Stryker Land VehicleThe eight-wheeled, armored combat vehicle is powered by a 350 horsepower Caterpillar JP-8 diesel engine that provides the U.S. Army with an effective mix of capabilities, including infantry transport offensive firepower and reconnaissance. The Stryker's other capabilities include the anti-tank guided missiles, mobile C4ISR, engineering and fire support, mobile gun system, and medical evacuation.The vehicle is employed in Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, light and mobile units based on the brigade combat team doctrine that relies on vehicles connected by military C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence) networks.The vehicle was outfitted with a new double-V hull, to survive in IED-prone zones of Afghanistan. Such improvements in the design led to staggering improvements in soldier survivability, providing protection in open terrain areas.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?With widespread geo-political tension around the globe, many nations are strengthening their arsenals and taking initiatives to upgrade land-combat military vehicles. This in turn should boost General Dynamics’ growth, with the company being one of the major players in the wheeled military vehicle market.Notably, General Dynamics' Combat Systems segment that manufactures wheeled combat vehicles registered $1.44 billion of sales in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting 11.9% year-over-year growth. We may expect General Dynamics to witness similar strong results in this segment in upcoming quarters as well, buoyed by strong demand for its combat-proven war vehicles that eventually led to the latest contract win. This, in turn, should expand the company’s profit margin.Furthermore, the fiscal 2019 defense budget, recently approved by the U.S. Senate, provisions for a spending plan of $5.8 billion on Ground Systems. Such robust budgetary allotments should aid General Dynamics in acquiring major contracts from the Pentagon, related to its wheeled combat and tactical vehicles.Price Movement    General Dynamics’ stock has lost 6.4% in the past year against its industry’s growth of 30%.

138,TXT,"On Monday, Jun 18, President Donald Trump expressed his desire and eagerness to take America to the top spot in the space race once again. He noted that the country’s commercial space industry has been enterprising, when it comes to breaking new ground in space exploration.Further, NASA also published a report on Jun 20 about how it plans to defend the earth from asteroid attacks. The report also states that the space agency could use the government’s help in such pursuits. Major space and defense stocks have rallied since such developments. Investors could seize such an opportunity to rake in some gains by investing in defense and space stocks.Trump Vows to Dominate SpaceThe space race seems to have fizzled out in the sense that human expeditions are few and far to come by. This stems from the fact that governments have been reluctant in sending humans to the space because of the risks involved and the huge amount of money associated to such expeditions.Speaking at the White House on Monday, Trump spoke extensively about how he planned to make America the top power in space. He also vowed to “reclaim” for his country, with the help of his team, the United States’ “heritage as the world's greatest space-faring nation.”He further stated that he wants the United States to lead explorations on Moon and Mars, essentially leaving Russia and China behind. He aspires to create a sixth branch of American military, which he termed as the “space force.”There have been decades of contemplation regarding the creation of the U.S. Space Corps, with the most recent effort being in 2017. The U.S. House Armed Services Committee even drafted a bill for the corps under the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act.NASA’s Report to the U.S. Government On Wednesday, NASA along with a few federal officials published a report on the approach that the United States should take in the coming years to protect our plant from a spate of asteroid attacks. The 18-page report, has been termed ""The National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan."" The agenda seeks contribution from different departments within the federal government.Officials from the White House have gone on record to say that Trump’s “space force” might be used extensively in such pursuits. Trump’s space ambitions can possibly be used to fund deep space explorations in the future. Investments channeled properly for such ambitious expeditions can be used in the future.Such developments actually led to a surge in space and defense stocks. The Space Index (^SPACE) which tracks companies engaged in space and related activities has rallied approximately 1.2% since Trump’s speech. The index constitutes some of the major players from the sector, the likes of which include Boeing, Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman, Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (AJRD  -  Free Report) and Viasat  to name a few.4 Best ChoicesSince his election, Trump has vowed to get Americans back to space in a bid to reclaim the top spot in space race. Further, NASA’s commitment to safeguard the earth from celestial rocks has provided the necessary impetus for further investments in such projects.In this context, we have selected four stocks that are expected to gain from these factors.

140,TXT,"Per major media sources, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently secured a $6.6 billion contract for delivering 24 cargo aircraft to FedEx Express, which is a subsidiary of Tennessee-based FedEx courier delivery services company. Per the terms, FedEx has ordered 12 of Boeing’s 767 freighter aircraft and 12 of the twin aisle large-sized 777 cargo aircraft.With the latest deal inked, Boeing has further strengthened its relationship with FedEx, one of its major cargo customers for nearly 41 years now. Notably, FedEx is currently the largest customer for both 767 and 777 cargo aircraft models of Boeing. FedEx also owns Boeing’s 777F EcoDemonstrator that provides clear air-turbulence detection and ground-collision avoidance, and flies on 100% biofuel to reduce carbon emissions.A Brief Note on 767 and 777 FreightersBoeing's 767 Freighter is a mid to large size, wide-body twin-engine jet airliner, which is capable of carrying approximately 52 tons of cargo with intercontinental range. Its advanced fuel-efficient 767-300 converted freighter comes with advanced avionics, aerodynamics, materials and propulsion systems.On the other hand, the 777 Freighter is long-range, wide-body, twin-engine jet airliner that can fly 4,900 nautical miles with a full payload. It features an advanced maneuver load alleviation system that redistributes the aero­dynamic load on the wing, during non-normal flight conditions.Our ViewOver the past two years, there has been a solid recovery in the air cargo market, driven by the rising e-commerce demand and strong trade which has boosted the global air freight businesses. Evidently, air freight demand is expected to increase 4.5% in 2018, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Given the solid growth prospects for this space, contracts like the latest one is likely to boost Boeing's top line from freighter aircraft.Boeing has witnessed a successful year so far from the perspective of its wide-body freighters. In February 2018, the company received a delivery order for 18 747-8 freighters along with four 767 freighters to UPS. Moreover, Amazon acquired 40 used 767 freighter jets for its Amazon Air service, according to The Seattle Times.Boeing has posted sales of more than 50 wide-body freighters this year compared to 11 sold in 2017, courtesy of the latest order placed by FedEx. This reflects the solid demand that exists for Boeing’s freighter aircraft. This must have prompted Boeing to increase the annual output of its 767 by 20% to 36 planes by 2020, as announced in May 2018.Boeing Commercial Airplanes Segment, which develops and markets commercial jet aircrafts, including the 767, 777 and 747 freighter jets, witnessed a solid 5% sales improvement in first-quarter 2018. We expect Boeing to reflect similar strong results in this segment going ahead, which in turn are is likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price MovementBoeing’s stock rallied about 78.8% in a year compared with the industry’s growth of 30.4%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and military jets.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked stocks in the same space include Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc.

141,TXT,"Bell-Boeing, a joint venture (JV) between The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Bell Helicopter — unit of Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report) — recently won a delivery order in relation to V-22 aircraft. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by July 2020.Details of the DealValued at $47.4 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Per the terms of the deal, the JV will procure non-recurring engineering, production and supportability. These procurements will facilitate the incorporation of optimized wiring and structural improvements on the nacelle into the V-22 production line and via forced retrofit at the depot level of maintenance for previously delivered V-22 aircraft. The effort will address all non-recurring activities through the critical design review, to include the delivery, installation, validation and any defined testing of one nacelle ship set. Majority of the work will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX.Fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Navy and Air Force) funds will be utilized to complete the project. Notably, the deal includes 85% of work for the U.S. Navy and 15% for the Air Force.A Brief Note on V-22 JetsBell-Boeing’s primary product, V-22 Osprey, is a multi-mission, tiltrotor military aircraft with both vertical as well as short takeoff and landing capabilities. It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft. This military aircraft has the capacity to carry 24 combat troops or up to 20,000 pounds of internal cargo or 15,000 pounds of external cargo.The V-22 tiltrotor has been deployed in numerous missions around the world, including casualty evacuation, tactical recovery of aircraft and personnel, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, resupply, VIP transport and theater security cooperation.Our ViewA rapid increase in terror attacks along with the widespread rise of ISIS has compelled nations across the globe to strengthen arsenal and bump up the defense budget. The present U.S. administration is also in favor of raising the defense spending in contrast to the budget sequestration enacted by the prior government.The fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal worth $716 billion further supports this fact. Thus, it is obvious that defense majors like Boeing and Textron will receive an increased flow of contracts from the Pentagon for their high-end defense equipment. In fact, the latest contract win by Bell-Boeing mirrors the same.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Boeing has soared about 95.7%, outperforming the broader industry’s rally of 42.9%. This impressive performance was driven by the company’s record backlog supporting revenue growth, increased orders for commercial airplanes and expanded presence in domestic as well as international markets.Meanwhile, Textron has surged around 46.6% in a year, ahead of the industry’s rally. This upside can be attributed to the company’s strong order growth along with its systematic inorganic growth strategy.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider    While Boeing has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Textron carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are AeroVironment (AVAV  -  Free Report) and Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (KTOS  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.AeroVironment delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 147.43% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 earnings moved north 10 cents to $1.00 in the past 60 days.Kratos Defense pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 9.52% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings climbed 2 cents to 19 cents in the past 60 days. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

145,TXT,"A smart beta exchange traded fund, the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Industrials ETF (RGI  -  Free Report) debuted on 11/01/2006, and offers broad exposure to the Industrials ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexBecause the fund has amassed over $301.49 M, this makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Industrials ETFs. RGI is managed by Invesco Powershares. Before fees and expenses, RGI seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 Equal Weight Industrials Index.This index is an unmanaged equal weighted version of the S&P 500 Industrials Index that consists of the common stocks of the following industries: aerospace & defense, building products, construction & engineering, electrical equipment, conglomerates, machinery; commercial services & supplies, air freight & logistics, airlines, marine, road & rail transportation infrastructure.Cost & Other ExpensesInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.40% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.20%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.For RGI, it has heaviest allocation in the Industrials sector --about 100% of the portfolio.Taking into account individual holdings, Transdigm Group Inc (TDG  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.71% of the fund's total assets, followed by Textron Inc (TXT  -  Free Report) and Csx Corp (CSX  -  Free Report).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 15.84% of RGI's total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, the ETF has lost about -1.73%, and is up roughly 13.74% in the last one year (as of 05/17/2018). RGI has traded between $103.35 and $127.83 in the past 52-week period.RGI has a beta of 1.10 and standard deviation of 14.90% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium choice in the space. With about 70 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGuggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Industrials ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Industrials ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.Vanguard Industrials ETF (VIS  -  Free Report) tracks MSCI US Investable Market Industrials 25/50 Index and the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report) tracks Industrial Select Sector Index. Vanguard Industrials ETF has $3.77 B in assets, Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund has $12.92 B. VIS has an expense ratio of 0.10% and XLI charges 0.13%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Industrials ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

151,TXT,"The defense space kick-started the Q1 earnings season with Textron (TXT  -  Free Report) releasing results on Apr 18. This multi-industry conglomerate’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  Today, sector behemoth Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results. In fact, majority of the defense giants are expected to release financial numbers this week.As of Apr 20, 87 S&P 500 index members reported their quarterly results, wherein earnings increased 25% on 10.7% higher revenues. The space’s earnings are anticipated to record an 18.3% increase on 7.7% higher revenues, while two of the 16 Zacks sectors are likely to suffer a decline in earnings. We expect to have a clear picture of the space’s performance by the end of this week as 178 of the index members are scheduled to release their quarterly figures.As of Apr 20, total Q1 earnings from the broader Aerospace sector are expected to increase 14.9% year over year on 4.6% higher revenues.  For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our Earnings Preview.Defense stocks remained on a growth trajectory in the first quarter, courtesy of fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal presented by President Trump. Of the total amount, $686.1 billion has been reserved as funding for the Pentagon, reflecting 5% real growth over the initial FY18 President’s budget and 10% real growth over the current Continuing Resolution (CR). A steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon also provided an impetus to the stocks. Moreover, growing international market for weaponries with several nations increasing their defense spending is also likely to fuel the industry’s growth.Let’s take a look at four defense majors—The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) and FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report)—all of which are scheduled to release Q1 results before the opening bell on Apr 25.Boeing delivered a positive earnings surprise of 64.95% in the last quarter. Notably, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 20.69%.Being the largest aircraft manufacturer and one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the United States, Boeing enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from both the Pentagon as well as foreign allies, courtesy its varied product offerings. Markedly, the company received a number of orders for both commercial as well as military jets in the first quarter.Such steady inflow of contract wins will surely boost Boeing’s quarterly sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter sales is pegged at $22.2 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 5.9%.During its fourth-quarter 2017 earnings call, Boeing announced that higher volumes will drive its bottom line in 2018. Though, the company’s overall deliveries declined, commercial deliveries remained high. With the commercial business constituting almost 60% of Boeing’s total revenues, we expect the unit to drive the company’s first-quarter earnings.Per our proven model, a stock is likely to beat earnings estimate if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Impressively, Boeing constitutes that right combination.The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Boeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sellrated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions (read more:Can Order & Cash Flow Growth Aid Boeing's Q1 Earnings?). The Boeing Company Price and EPS Surprise  The Boeing Company Price and EPS Surprise | The Boeing Company Quote General Dynamics delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.49% in the last quarter. The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.02%.Order flow form the Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the United States generally boost quarterly sales of defense bellwethers and General Dynamics is no exception.In sync with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter sales is pegged at $7.5 billion, reflecting 1.4% year-over-year growth.In the first quarter, General Dynamics offered to buy CSRA — an information technology provider — for $9.6 billion, including $2.8 billion of debt.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Dynamics’ first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.47 per share, marking 0.4% annual decline. This might have been caused by higher R&D expenses that management expects to incur across 2018.The current Earnings ESP for General Dynamics is -0.23%, while it carries a Zacks Rank #3.Therefore, our model does not show that the company is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter (read more: General Dynamics' Q1 Earnings: Is a Beat in the Offing?). General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | General Dynamics Corporation Quote Northrop Grumman delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.55% in the last quarter. The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 16.17%.The Aerospace Systems segment fetches almost half of Northrop Grumman’s sales and has traditionally been a primary contributor to its top-line growth. Notably, in the first quarter, the company received a number of contracts for this segment. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aerospace Systems segment is $3,131 million, reflecting annual growth of 16.1%.The company’s total sales growth has historically benefited from higher sales at the Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems segment. Cumulatively, this is likely to boost the company’s total sales growth for the first quarter. While lower corporate tax on account of the recent tax reform is likely to boost the company’s bottom line, Northrop Grumman is expected to incur notable expenses in regard to its Orbital ATK acquisition.The current Earnings ESP for Northrop Grumman is -0.99%, while it carries a Zacks Rank #2. Therefore, our model does not show that the company is likely to beat estimates this quarter (read more: Can Aerospace Unit Fuel Northrop Grumman Q1 Earnings?). Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northrop Grumman Corporation Quote FLIR Systems posted a positive earnings surprise of 3.57% in the prior quarter. Moreover, the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 3.59%.The company’s persistent focus on introduction of new products has enabled it to penetrate new markets and expand its customer base. Notably, since the launch of Lepton technology, FLIR Systems has witnessed solid compound annual growth rate in total unit volumes. We believe that steady market traction of the newly launched products should continue supplementing sales performance in the upcoming quarters as well.The Earnings ESP for FLIR Systems is +2.33%, while the company carries a Zacks Rank #3. Therefore, our model indicates that FLIR Systems is likely to beat on earnings this quarter (read more: Can FLIR Systems Keep Earnings Streak Alive in Q1?). FLIR Systems, Inc.

159,TXT,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Textron is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for TXT in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 48 cents per share for TXT, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for TXT, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +5.00% heading into earnings season.Textron Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Textron Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Textron Inc.

160,TXT,"Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report), known for brands like Bell Helicopter and Cessna Aircraft, is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results, before the market opens on Apr 18.We expect sales growth at the Industrial segment, which accounts for the majority of Textron’s top line, to drive first-quarter revenues. However, the rebound in the Bell segment in the last reported quarter may not continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Let’s discuss these factors in detail.Industrial Segment — Remains a Key CatalystTextron’s Industrial segment designs and manufactures automotive engine components, specialized vehicles as well as varied industry-related tools and equipment. While management expects the Arctic Cat acquisition to continue driving this segment, innovation of specialized vehicles is anticipated to provide more impetus. In line with this, Textron launched HF600 heavy-duty reel mower, new models of GA Aerator Series, TR Series trim mowers as well as Cushman Hauler 800 and 800X utility vehicles in the first quarter.Meanwhile, improved demand in the snow retail channel has been lately driving sales at this unit and is expected to do the same in 2018. These developments altogether are anticipated to substantially boost segmental revenues in the yet-to-be reported quarter. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s first-quarter sales is pegged at $1 billion, reflecting a 4.1% improvement from the prior-year quarter’s $961 million.Will the Bell Segment Weigh on Growth?  The Bell segment, managed to deliver improved results in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, after showing weak performance in many of the prior quarters. However, management fears that the segment may again see a drop in sales on account of lower military volumes.With management expecting lower military sales throughout 2018 and dearth of contract inflows from the Pentagon in the first quarter, we expect the upcoming results to reflect decline in revenues at the Bell segment. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s first-quarter sales is pegged at $680 million, reflecting a 15% decline from the prior-year quarter’s $800 million.Other Factors at PlayIn addition to the afore-mentioned factors, Textron expects to witness higher aftermarket revenues driven by increased aircraft utilization. This, in turn, is likely to boost first-quarter sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Textron’s total sales is pegged at $3.11 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 0.7%.Moreover, since the beginning of 2018, the company has adopted a revenue recognition accounting standard. As a result, Textron expects an increase in retained earnings of approximately $90 million in the first quarter of 2018, with no restatement of prior periods.The company is also expected to incur lower corporate tax expenses in 2018, thanks to the U.S. government’s latest tax reform. This, in turn, may get reflected in the form of improved bottom-line growth in the upcoming results. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Textron’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at 46 cents, in line with the year-ago quarter’s figure.Textron Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Textron Inc.

162,TXT,"PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) won a contract from Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report). Per the contract, PPG Industries will produce heated pilot and co-pilot windshields for the Bell 525 Relentless commercial helicopter. The windshields will be made available for customer specification for helicopters operating in hilly regions and cold environments and for off-shore rescue operations. PPG Industries demonstrated the functioning of Aircon heating system and provided a cross-section sample of the same to Bell Helicopter. Bell Helicopter approved PPG Industries’ design for the composite windshields by completing the critical design review. The windshield will have an outboard ply of stretched acrylic with a scratch-resistant coating and an inboard polycarbonate ply which enhance the product’s strength. The windshields can withstand the impact of a 2.2-pound bird at 185 knots — Bell Helicopter’s bird-strike requirement. PPG Industries, which is among the prominent chemical companies along with Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD  -  Free Report) and Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report), witnessed a roughly two-fold year-over-year jump in net earnings from continuing operations to $184 million or 72 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2017. Adjusted earnings of $1.19 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18. Net sales rose around 8% year over year to $3,682 million and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,605 million. The company gained from favorable currency translation in the quarter. For 2018, PPG Industries expects acquisitions to contribute to sales roughly $125 million. The company recently agreed to acquire Netherlands-based leading architectural paint and coatings wholesaler, ProCoatings. Through its network of 23 multi-brand stores, ProCoatings distributes a large portfolio of professional paint brands across the Netherlands. The transaction is expected to close in first-quarter 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. To improve its cost structure, PPG Industries is pursuing significant restructuring actions that are mainly focused on regions and end-use markets with the weakest business conditions. The restructuring activities are expected to deliver around $125 million in annual savings with roughly $50 million of savings already realized in 2017 and another $45-$50 million expected in 2018. During the fourth-quarter call, PPG Industries stated that it is committed toward deploying at least $2.4 billion of cash in 2018 on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of its earlier communicated goal of deploying $3.5 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined. However, the company is exposed to raw materials cost pressure. PPG Industries is seeing higher raw materials costs and implementing pricing strategies to offset the impact of inflation. The company anticipates raw material inflation to continue through first-half 2018.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early. See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

167,TXT,"Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report), known for brands like Bell Helicopter and Cessna Aircraft, is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 31, before the market opens.We expect sales growth at the Industrial segment, which accounts for the majority of Textron’s top line, to drive fourth-quarter revenues. Moreover, a rebound in the Bell segment after many quarters of weakperformance buoys optimism.Let’s discuss these factors in detail.Industrial Segment — A Key CatalystTextron’s Industrial segment designs and manufactures variety of products, including automotive engine components, specialized vehicles and varied industry-related tools and equipment. The acquisition of Arctic Cat — a leader in the recreational vehicle industry — made in the first quarter of 2017, has been boosting growth at this segment.In fact, this buyout drove third-quarter sales by double digits at the segment. We expect the takeover to drive revenues at this segment in the fourth quarter as well. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s fourth-quarter sales is pegged at $1.2 billion, reflecting a solid 21.6% rise from the prior-year quarter’s $952 million.Will Bell Segment Drive Growth?Bell, another important segment for Textron, has been able to deliver improved results in the third quarter, after quarters of poor performance. In particular, strong demand for commercial jets drove the top line higher at this unit. With management expecting to maintain the upside in commercial deliveries, we expect the fourth-quarter results to reflect top-line growth at the Bell segment.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s fourth-quarter sales is pegged at $918 million, reflecting a 3.5% rise from prior-year quarter’s $887 million.Other Factors at PlayIn addition to the aforementioned factors, improved growth pattern and performance and a steady inflow of orders from Pentagon are expected to provide an impetus to fourth-quarter sales. Among the deals clinched in the fourth quarter, the one worth mentioning is the $333-million contract from U.S. Army for up to 255 mobile strike force vehicles.All these factors are expected to boost Textron’s fourth-quarter revenues, as is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $4.04 billion, which reflects a year-over-year improvement of 5.6%.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 75 cents per share, reflecting a decline of 6.25% year over year. This could be because the company generates a significant portion of its revenues from fixed-price contracts, exposing the bottom line to cost overruns.Moreover, during the third-quarter earnings call, management announced that its vehicle business is lagging in terms of line rates and production output. These factors as well as a charge associated with the TAPV program incurred in the first quarter of 2017 have compelled management to slash the 2017 EPS guidance.Textron Inc.

The stock has delivered a one-year return of about 40.9%.Over the past 52 weeks, L3 Technologies’ share price has ranged from a low of $146.88 to a high of $209.98. Average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 0.55 million.What is Driving L3 Technologies?L3 Technologies is a consistent performer and has reported positive earnings surprises in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 9.13%. Its expected long-term earnings growth rate (three to five years) is 6.78%.Thanks to its quality product offerings, the company continuously receives contracts from the U.S. defense establishments and foreign governments. Funded backlog at the end of third- quarter 2017 was $9 billion, reflecting sequential growth of 5.8%.Apart from generating substantial organic revenue growth, thanks to its varied product range, L3 Technologies gains from inorganic growth. The strategic acquisitions made by the company have widened its market and created more opportunities.In addition to its strong presence in the U.S. defense space, the company continues to enjoy a steady flow of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) contracts. The company is expected to benefit from a large addressable international market with sales directly to foreign allied governments and under FMS agreements between the U.S. government and foreign governments.Other Defense Players Moving UpTrump’s presidency has been a boon for the  Zacks Aerospace sector , which was grappling with the budget sequestration implemented by the prior government. The fiscal 2018 (FY18) defense budget, reflecting a 10% hike from the FY16 level, was a major forerunner for this sector’s growth at the beginning of 2017.  Notably, the FY18 defense policy bill worth $700 billion that extensively surpassed Trump's budget request took stocks to new heights.The increase in the defense budget will also result in new orders for the major defense contractors and will have a positive impact on their performance and prices.

170,TXT,"Bell-Boeing, a joint venture between The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Bell Helicopter, unit of Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report), recently won a contract to offer support to ongoing flight tests and evaluation of the V-22 test aircraft. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by December 2018.Details of the DealThe contract, worth $23.3 million, was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland.Work will be carried out in Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Marylandand Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona. Fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement and fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funds will be utilized to complete the work.A Brief Note on V-22 JetsBell-Boeing’s primary product — V-22 Osprey — is a multi-mission, tiltrotor military aircraft with both vertical as well as short takeoff and landing capabilities. It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft. It has the capacity to carry 24 combat troops or up to 20,000 pounds of internal cargo or 15,000 pounds of external cargo.The V-22 tiltrotor has been deployed in numerous missions around the world, including casualty evacuation, tactical recovery of aircraft and personnel, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, resupply, VIP transport and theater security cooperation.Our ViewA rapid rise in terror attacks along with the widespread rise of ISIS has compelled nations across the globe to strengthen their arsenal and bump up their defense budget. The present U.S. administration is also in favor of raising the defense spending in contrast to the budget sequestration enacted by the prior government.The fiscal 2018 defense bill policy worth $700 billion, approved by the U.S. Senate last September, supports this fact. Thus, it is obvious that defense majors like Boeing and Textron will receive an increased flow of contracts from the Pentagon for their high-end defense equipment. The latest contract win by Bell-Boeing mirrors the same.Moreover, in November 2017, the V-22 fleet of tiltrotor aircraft was announced to have achieved the milestone of 400,000 flight hours. This reflects strong demand for the aircraft and more contracts for this product can be expected in the days ahead. Such contract wins will certainly drive revenues for Textron and Boeing.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has gained about 86.9% in a year’s time, surpassing the broader industry’s 37.2%. The outperformance was driven by the company’s record backlog supporting revenue growth, increased orders for commercial airplanes and expanded presence in domestic as well as international markets.  Meanwhile, Textron's stock has gained around 14.6% in a year, lagging the industry’s rally. The underperformance has been led by excessive capital expenditure incurred by the company along with declining profit margins.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoeing carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Textron has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Investors can consider better-ranked stocks in the same industry such as Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) and Leidos Holdings, Inc.

182,TXT,"Defense major Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell.We expect Missile Systems business unit to primarily drive the company’s revenues in the third quarter. Moreover, its overseas business expansion is also expected to boost the quarterly results.  Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing Raytheon’s quarterly results.Missile Systems Unit – A Key CatalystSegment-wise, Missile systems business unit that represent almost 30% of the company’s total business sales continue to be a major growth driver. The third quarter is also poised to benefit from this unit.  Notably, the company won a modification contract worth $615 million for manufacturing 17 Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA missiles. Such order wins indicate solid demand for missiles manufactured by Raytheon and in turn is expected to boost sales.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter sales is $1,980 million for the segment, reflecting year-over-year growth of 13.2%.Moreover, management earlier announced that it expects an  improvement in this segment’s margin in the second half of the year, starting from the third quarter. In this line, our consensus estimate for operating income of $267 million for this segment reflects an annual improvement of 13.6%; thereby hinting at possible operating margin rise in the to-be-reported quarter.International Operations: A Major PositiveApart from its strong forte in domestic front, international business expansion has always been a primary growth driver for Raytheon. The company is currently witnessing strong demand for varied product line not only from Middle East but also from Asia Pacific. In particular, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan have emerged as new abodes for the company’s expansion. Europe also continues to be a major contributor to sales growth. We believe once the company reports third-quarter results, these nations’ contribution to Raytheon’s growth story will become clearer.Other Contracts to Boost GrowthLike other defense bellwethers, Raytheon also won a number of contracts during the third quarter. Among the orders that Raytheon clinched, the significant ones include a $134-million modification contract for procuring Javelin containerized all-up rounds, command launch units, Javelin vehicle launcher-electronics and associated non-recurring engineering and a $119-million contract to support the Maritime Strike Tomahawk Program. It also won a modification contract of $127 million for procuring Excalibur Precision 155-mm Projectiles.It goes without saying that these contract wins will boost the company’s third-quarter sales. In line with this the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales stands at $6.3 billion, reflecting annual growth of 4.9%.Moreover, during second-quarter earnings call, Raytheon’s management raised its EPS guidance to reflect the company’s improved operating performance alongside expecting the bottom line to grow in the third quarter. In line with this our consensus estimate for Raytheon’s earnings is pegged at $7.90 per share, reflecting annual growth of 6.4%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Raytheon is likely to beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

183,TXT,"Military shipbuilder General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the opening bell.We believe substantial inflow of military contracts from Pentagon to drive the company’s revenues in the third quarter. However, Aerospace segment is expected to face margin pressure in the second half of the year, which is reflected in third-quarter sales estimate for this unit.Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing General Dynamics’ quarterly results.String of Contracts to Boost GrowthA scrumptious order flow form Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the United States tend to boost quarterly sales of defense bellwethers and General Dynamics is no exception. In this line, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third quarter sales is $7.9 billion, reflecting 2.1% year-over-year growth.Notably, the significant contract that General Dynamics secured in the third quarter, include a $5.1-billion special incentives contract to complete the design of the Integrated Product and Process Development for the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs); a modification contract worth $115.3 million for offering additional lead-yard services, development studies and design efforts to support Virginia-class submarines and a contract worth $310.6 million to design, develop and integrate several engineering changes into the Abrams M1A2 SEP V3.General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | General Dynamics Corporation QuoteThe company also won a $341.2-million modification contract to exercise the option for design agent, planning yard, engineering and technical support for in-service nuclear submarines and another modification contract worth $109.2 million for procuring Hydra rockets.Being one of the top-notch submarine contractors in the nation, such contracts are expected to bolster the company’s Marine Systems segment’s growth. Evidently, our consensus estimate for the Marine Systems’ sales stands at $2,068 million, up 0.2% annually.Will Aerospace Segment be a Spoilsport? During second-quarter earnings call, General Dynamics’ management expressed concern about the Aerospace segment’s sales growth in the second half of the year, citing unfavorable margins to play a spoilsport. In line with this expectation, our consensus estimate for the segment is pegged at $2,039 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 9.2%. Operating earnings for this business unit is also projected to reduce by 10.4% to $398 million, per our consensus estimate.Although the company continues to boast a strong forte in the Gulfstream business, which exhibits a strong pipeline growth, a substantial downtick on the margin may hamper this segment’s overall third-quarter growth. Other Factors at PlaySegment-wise, other two business units of General Dynamics indicate higher annual sales growth, considering the respective Zacks Consensus estimate.On the flip side, the company’s services business is expected to deliver weak performance due to slow execution of programs in several civilian agencies, owing to uncertainty and, in some cases, reduction in funding levels.For the to-be-reported quarter, our consensus estimate for General Dynamics’ earnings is pegged at $2.43 per share, down 2.14% year over year.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that General Dynamics is likely to beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. General Dynamics possess both of these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: General Dynamics has an Earnings ESP of +0.37%.

184,TXT,"Defense giant Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the opening bell.Aerospace segment continues to be the major growth driver for Northrop Grumman. The company’s third-quarter results too is expected to be gain from the same.  Substantial inflow of orders from Pentagon for the company’s varied product offerings also remains a major catalyst.Let’s discuss the factors influencing Northrop Grumman’s quarterly results, in brief.Aerospace Segment ­– A Key CatalystAerospace Systems segment that fetch almost half of Northrop Grumman’s sales is a primary contributor of the company’s quarterly growth.Notably, increased demand as well as deliveries of manned aircraft mainly boosts this segment’s sales growth. In the third quarter, the company won a number of contracts from the Pentagon in this regard.Among them, the significant one is an Army contract worth $117 million for offering logistics support services for government-owned fixed wing fleet performing special electronic mission aircraft missions.Impressively, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aerospace Systems segment stands at $2,928 million, reflecting annual growth of 12.9%.Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northrop Grumman Corporation QuoteOrder Flows to Drive SalesDefense majors have been receiving a slew of contracts from Pentagon and foreign U.S. allies. Northrop Grumman too has been no exception in this regard. During the third quarter, the company’s notable contract wins include a contract worth $124.7 million to support the AN/APR-39 program, a $329 million Air Force contract for the Ground-based Strategic Deterrent and another order of $409 million for Next Generation Thermal, Power and Controls (NGT-PAC) program.Consequently Northrop Grumman is expected to gain from the number of contracts it has won in the third quarter. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter sales is pegged at $6.3 billion, reflecting 2.6% year-over-year growth.Other Factors to ConsiderSegment-wise, Mission Systems business unit has been benefiting from the company’s successful cost-reduction initiatives. Considering this trend to continue in the second half of the year, Northrop Grumman has increased this unit’s annual sales expectation during second-quarter earnings call. Keeping this into consideration, we may expect the third-quarter results to reflect strong sales growth for this unit. Evidently, our consensus estimate called for sales of $1,156 million for Mission Systems, reflecting annual growth of 1%.On the flip side, increased unallocated corporate expenses and effective tax rate dented the company’s second-quarter earnings growth. Anticipating similar expenses to linger, our consensus estimate for Northrop Grumman’s earnings of $2.92 per share reflects 3.2% annual decline.Around the end of the third quarter, Northrop Grumman announced that it has agreed to acquire rocket-maker Orbital ATK  for $9.2 billion. Although no direct impact of this deal will get reflected in the upcoming results, further updates from the transaction can be expected once the company releases its third-quarter report.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively shows that Northrop Grumman is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as we have mentioned below:Zacks ESP: Northrop Grumman has an Earnings ESP of -1.93%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.87, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.92. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Northrop Grumman currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which along with a negative earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some defense companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

185,TXT,"Textron Inc.’s (TXT  -  Free Report) sub segment, Marine & Land Systems, recently secured a contract to procure up to 255 mobile strike force vehicles. The deal will also offer related fielding hardware and field representative services for system de-processing.Valued at $332.9 million the contract has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command Warren, MI. Notably, work related to this agreement is anticipated to be completed by Oct 13, 2024.Why Textron?Textron Systems, under which Marine & Land Systems come, is known for its unmanned aircraft systems, advanced marine craft, armored vehicles, intelligent battlefield and surveillance systems, intelligence software solutions, precision smart weapons, piston engines, test and training systems as well as total life cycle sustainment and operational services.Furthermore, the company’s geographically diverse network of aircraft, defense & intelligence along with industrial and finance businesses helps to counter any specific business-related risk.

However, revenues missed the same by 1.5% but improved 7.2% from the year-ago figure.With rising geopolitical tensions across the globe, Textron continues to witness increased demand for its combat-proven military aircraft and associated systems from the U.S. government as well as allied nations.

The company’s current rate of return is 34.5% compared with the industry’s 52.7%.This lacklustre performance might have been led by the company’s aviation business, which continues to exhibit dismal performance on account of lower military and commercial turboprop volumes.Zacks RankTextron carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Alongside, Northrop will integrate the initial radar A-kit and provide additional non-recurring engineering in the aircraft.Majority of the work will be executed in Fort Worth, TX and Ozark, AL; while the remaining part will be carried out in San Diego and Santa Clarita, CA and Edinburgh, U.K. The company will utilize fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funds to complete the task.A Brief Note on MQ-8CFire Scout is a combat proven, autonomous helicopter system designed by Northrop, which offers real-time Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Target-acquisition (ISR&T), laser designation, and battle management to tactical users without relying on manned aircraft or space-based assets. There are two variants of Fire Scout, MQ-8C being one of them.MQ-8C Fire Scout is the Navy’s next generation autonomous helicopter. Its airframe is based on the commercial Bell 407, an advanced helicopter with more than 1,600 airframes produced by Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report).The helicopter can take-off and land on any aviation-capable ship from both prepared and unprepared landing zones automaticatically. This helps to lower the reliance on man power. This enhancement increases the target range and endurance (more than double) and payload capacity (more than triple) of the helicopter.Our ViewBeing one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the United States, Northrop’s product line serves high-priority categories such as defense electronics, unmanned aircraft and missile defense satisfactorily. With more than 75 years of experience in advanced autonomy from the sea-floor to space, Northrop’s autonomous systems expand the boundaries of human potential to deliver end-to-end solutions that meet evolving mission requirements for a rapidly changing world. On top of that, its management is consistently innovating to ensure that the company’s autonomous platforms can meet the evolving mission requirements of its customers, both domestic and overseas.Meanwhile, rising terrorism and the recent spate in political hostility between the United States and North Korea have provided a solid boost to the aerospace and defense industry. Concurrently, the United States and its major allies’ move to strengthen their arsenals to combat the internal and external threats provided a substantial impetus to the stocks.On this note, the U.S. Senate recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion which provides about $640 billion fund for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops.Consequently, the current scenario in this industry is anticipated to boost defense majors like Northrop, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), as is evident from increasing number of contracts being awarded by the Pentagon in recent months. We believe the latest contract is an instance of the same and expect the company to win more such deals, in days ahead.Price MovementSince Northrop’s announcement of Orbital ATK  acquisition, shares of the company have rallied 5.8% compared with the industry’s gain of 3.1%. This shows that the news of the acquisition has received positive response from the market.Zacks RankNorthrop presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

189,TXT,"As the third-quarter earnings season rings in, defense stocks are gearing up to report their quarterly numbers. Multi-industry conglomerate Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report), well-known for its brands like Bell Helicopter and Cessna Aircraft, is scheduled to report its financial results on Oct 19, before the market opens.We expect sales growth in the Industrial segment, which constitutes a majority of Textron’s top line, to drive the company’s revenues. However, Bell segment continues to be a laggard, as witnessed in the past few quarters. Nevertheless, regular orders continue to provide an impetus to the company.Let’s discuss these factors influencing Textron’s quarterly results, in brief.Industrial Manufacturing — A CatalystTextron’s Industrial segment designs and manufactures variety of products including automotive engine components, specialized vehicles and varied industry-related tools and equipments. Within this segment, along the specialized vehicle business line, the acquisition of Arctic Cat — a leader in the recreational vehicle industry — in the first quarter of 2017, has been boosting the company's growth trajectory.Apart from gaining synergies from inorganic growth, this segment has also been benefiting from product innovation. It is worth mentioning in this context, the highly efficient ELiTE series lithium powered golf cars, which come with zero battery maintenance. Notably, the company delivered 8,000 units of this car, as of July, since its introduction earlier this year. All these factors led to an improved year-over-year expectation for Textron’s Industrial segment in the third quarter. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s third quarter sales is pegged at $1.1 billion, reflecting a solid 28% rise from prior-year quarter’s sales of $886 million.Will Bell Segment Dent Textron’s Growth?Bell, another significant segment for Textron has been consistently delivering poor performance over the past few quarters. This time too the company expects its top line to be adversely affected due to this segment’s weak performance.. Notably, the consensus estimate for this segment’s third-quarter sales is pegged at $765 million, down 3% year over year.Nevertheless, this segment has been witnessing strong commercial orders, of late, for products like 407 GXPs, 412 EP helicopters as well as 505 Jet Ranger X choppers. Taking into account such solid orders, the segment’s profit has been increasing and management expects similar result in the third quarter as well. In line with this, our consensus estimate projected for $95 million profit for Bell, up 10.5% year over year.Other Factors at PlayIn addition to the aforementioned facets of Textron’s quarterly results, a steady inflow of orders for the company’s varied products from Pentagon can be expected to provide an impetus to its third-quarter sales. Among the notable deals that Textron won in the quarter, worth mentioning is the Aerospace Systems Air Platform Technology Research program contract worth $499 million. Per the terms of the deal, the company will offer quality research to Air Force in developing, demonstrating, integrating and transitioning new air vehicle technologies and systems.On the flip side, improving pricing in the aviation market has not been able to boost the company’s aviation segment as evident from a declining year-over-year sales expectation for this unit. Our consensus estimate called for sales of $1.2 billion in third quarter, down 3% year over year.As a whole, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 62 cents, down 43.54% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is estimated at $3.54 billion, implying an 8.84% year-over-year increase.Textron Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Textron Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Textron Inc. Quote Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Textron is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Textron has an Earnings ESP of +2.24%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 64 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Textron currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some defense companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8.

190,TXT,"We issued an updated research report on Textron, Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report) on Oct 12. The company is a global multi-industry company that manufactures aircraft, automotive engine components and industrial tools.Textron follows a systematic inorganic growth strategy and thus remains focused on acquisitions. In line with this strategy, during the first quarter, Textron closed the acquisition of Arctic Cat, a leader in the recreational vehicle industry, for $247 million. This acquisition has expanded Textron’s presence in the power-sports segment as well as utility vehicle market, courtesy of Arctic Cat’s established dealer network. Management expects Arctic Cat to contribute $400-$500 million of sales for the company in 2017.The company also remains focused on innovation to expand its existing operations. To this end, Textron began delivering its new ELiTE series lithium golf cars in the second quarter. Notably, the ELiTE offers high efficiency with zero battery maintenance, apart from demonstrating Textron’s industry-leading product innovation.Moreover, Textron is forging ahead with the development of its 505 Jet Ranger X programs. We expect, new product offerings will heighten competition and ensure fresh orders for the conglomerate.On the flip side, Textron’s Aviation business continues to exhibit dismal performance on account of lower military and commercial turboprop volumes. Dearth of international order for the King Air turboprops was the primary reason for its weak performance. As a result, despite strong long-term fundamentals, we remain skeptical about the intermediate prospects of Textron’s commercial aerospace businesses.Moreover, the company faces tough competition from its peers like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report). This may have caused the company to underperform its industry over a year.Evidently, Textron's share price gained 41.7% in the last one year, underperforming the industry's rally of 47.7% Zacks RankTextron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

191,TXT,"Textron Inc (TXT  -  Free Report) announced that its Aviation Defense segment has been awarded a $30-million contract for maintenance training of the Beechcraft King Air 350. This deal is part of foreign military sales (“FMS”) for Iraq. Work related to the contract will be carried out at the Martyr Mohammed Ali Air Base, Iraq. Operations are expected to be concluded by Sep 20, 2020. An amount of $9 million from the FMS fund will be obligated at the time of the award.Originally developed by Beechcraft, King Air 350 has more payload capability and range. It is designed for a quieter interior with standard Wi-Fi and Pro Line Fusion avionics with full touch-screen simplicity. The aircraft can fly at an altitude of 35,000 feet, thanks to its pressurized cabin and can take off and land on unimproved fields too.Importance of Foreign Military SalesForeign military sales became an important tool of generating revenue for the U.S. defense contractors, in addition to the orders received from the different verticals of U.S. Defense. Defense contracts from the U.S. allies helped the contractors maintain their top line during tough times. Moreover, when these contracts are carried on in the right manner, they help in strengthening the regional security, strengthen alliances, lighten United States' warfighting burden, improve the trade balance and create jobs.The Defense Contract Management Agency regulates the FMS contracts. The purchasers place the orders directly to the contractors. Instead, the agency acts as an intermediary and handles the procurement, logistics and delivery and often providing product support, training and infrastructure construction.What is Boosting Textron?Textron is globally recognized for popular and valuable brand names, such as Bell Helicopter, Cessna Aircraft Company, Jacobsen, Kautex, E-Z-GO and Greenlee. Textron’s geographically diverse network of businesses negates any specific business risk. Its systematic inorganic growth strategy, along with its focus on strengthening international presence, is helping it in boosting results.The company has adopted the policy of spreading its operations in new fields with strategic acquisitions. During the first quarter, Textron completed its earlier announced acquisition of Arctic Cat, a leader in the recreational vehicle industry, for $247 million which expanded its presence in the power-sports segment and utility vehicle market. At the end of 2016, the company completed the acquisition of Premier and SAFEAERO, manufacturers of aircraft de-icing equipment. These expansions are likely to contribute to the company’s overall growth in revenue, earnings and cash.The company and its peers, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) etc., are also expected to gain from the recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion by the U.S. Senate. This bill provides about $640 billion for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops. The rest $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations will be utilized to fund the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.Price MovementShares of Textron have gained 10.5% during the last month outperforming the industry’s gain of 4.6% during the same time.  This outperformance could be attributed to the systematic inorganic growth strategy along with its focus on strengthening international presence, which has boosted Textron’s growth trajectory.Zacks RankTextron currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

193,TXT,"Wall Street witnessed a decent rally of the defense stocks at the onset of this week owing to North Korea’s missile launch that flew over Japan's Hokkaido island before crashing in to the sea. North Korea’s President justified the move as an action to counter the United States and South Korean military drills. In retaliation, South Korea dropped bombs on Korean peninsula.Notably, this event once again led to fresh altercations between the United States and North Korea. Defense stocks have been on growth trajectory since the beginning of the last month due to Trump’s “fire and fury” response against North Korea’s move. Also his plan to increase military spending in Afghanistan provided ample impetus to the stocks.A generous flow of funds from the Pentagon has also been boosting defense stocks’ prospects.All these factors led the major indices of Aerospace sector to end in the green, in the last five trading sessions.

194,TXT,"AAI Corporation, an operating unit of Textron Systems, a Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report) company, announced that it is one of the six companies to receive the Aerospace Systems Air Platform Technology Research program contract from the U.S. Air Force. In fact, it is the fourth company to receive this award from Pentagon. The contract has a ceiling value of $499 million.Contract DetailsPer the deal, AAI Corp will be responsible for providing quality research to Air Force in developing, demonstrating, integrating and transitioning new air vehicle technologies and systems. Such technology developments, in turn, will offer cost-efficient air vehicle platforms that will accurately deliver weapons and cargo worldwide.Work is anticipated to be completed by Aug 31, 2025 and will be carried out in Hunt Valley, MD. The contract will use fiscal 2017 research and development funds.Why Textron?AAI Corp.’s multi-mission capable unmanned aircraft, along with interoperable command and control technologies provide critical situational awareness and actionable intelligence for users, globally.Headquartered in Wilmington, MA, Textron Systems is known for its unmanned aircraft systems, advanced marine craft, armored vehicles, intelligent battlefield and surveillance systems, intelligence software solutions, precision smart weapons, piston engines, test and training systems, and total life cycle sustainment and operational services.Realizing the immense opportunity in the military aircraft space, the company continues to make consistent effort to usher in new products, to capture increased market shares. In this regard, at Paris Air Show in June 2017, Textron’s unmanned systems business unveiled its next-generation platform with the Night Warden tactical unmanned aircraft system. Markedly, the Night Warden system comes with enhanced capabilities and runway independence.With rising geopolitical tensions across the globe, Textron continues to witness increased demand for its combat-proven military aircraft and associated systems from the U.S. government as well as allied nations. The most recent contract mentioned above substantiates this fact. More such contracts can be expected in near future, thanks to increasing global security threats, which in turn might significantly boost Textron’s revenue growth rate. Price MovementTextron has underperformed the broader industry in the last 12 months. The company’s current rate of return is 16.8% compared with the industry average of 39.8%.This might have been led by the company’s aviation business, which continues to exhibit dismal performance on account of lower military and commercial turboprop volumes. Moreover, management expects Textron’s weakness in the global commercial helicopter market may affect segment revenues in 2017, which also added to this stock’s concerns.Further, the stock’s performance lagged behind that of The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Airbus Group SE (EADSY  -  Free Report) and Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report), which have surpassed the industry mark in last 12 months.Zacks RankTextron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

197,TXT,"Aircraft giant, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), has finalized an order for delivering 12 737 MAX airplanes to Air Lease Corporation (AL). Although details of the contract have been revealed recently, the order was announced during the Paris Air Show.The deal comprises order for five 737 MAX 7s and seven 737 MAX 8s. It also includes two new orders for the 787-9 Dreamliner.Notably, with this order Los Angeles, CA-based Air Lease Corporation’s total MAX orders reaches 130, and Dreamliner order reaches 49.As a member of the Next-Generation 737 family, the 737-800, continues to be an extremely popular single-aisle aircraft. This is because of its advanced technology and low operation as well as maintenance costs.The new 737s will feature the Boeing Sky Interior – the 787 Dreamliner inspired cabin – that provides passengers a sense of space with decorative sidewalls, larger windows, LED mood lighting and larger pivot overhead stowage bins.Deals Inked at the Paris Air ShowDemand for Boeing’s commercial airplanes has been rising, owing to a steady increase in passenger and freight traffic. This has been more strongly reflected in recent times, when the aerospace behemoth successfully won a huge number of commercial contracts at the Paris Air Show.In addition to the aforementioned deal,  other notable contracts secured by Boeing at the Air Show include a commitment from the Kuwait-based ALAFCO Aviation Lease and Finance Company for 20 737 MAX 8s, valued at $2.2 billion at current list prices. Moreover, Lion Group is committed to buy 50 737 Max 10 jets from the company for $6.24 billion.Also, Boeing signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with SpiceJet for 40 737 MAX airplanes worth $4.7 billion. Another MOU worth $2.5 billion was signed with Tibet Financial Leasing for 20 737 MAX airplanes. Again, the company signed an MOU with BOC Aviation Limited for 10 737 MAX 10 airplanes, worth nearly $1.25 billion.Apart from this, Boeing clinched an order from AerCap for 30 787-9 Dreamliners, worth $8.1 billion. Given the huge commercial demand, this aerospace behemoth is expected to witness significant traction in the near term, especially in the single-aisle market.Single-Aisle Aircraft in DemandBoeing anticipates demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion, in the next 20 years. This projected figure reflects a 5% increase over last year's projection.Moreover, the company expects single-aisle jets to be the major driver of demand growth, comprising 72% of the total commercial jets’ demand projection. While the new 737 MAX and the 737-800 is likely to grab the lion’s share of the new orders, Boeing’s arch-rival Airbus Group SE’s (EADSY  -  Free Report) A320neo is expected to pose significant challenges.Nevertheless, Boeing’s 737 model remains one of the best-selling planes in the single-aisle market, thanks to its fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Therefore, to maintain its dominance in the aerospace market, the company continues to invest in research and development for upgrading and churning out upgraded versions of its existing planes.Q2 Order DetailsBoeing’s second-quarter 2017 order details show that it booked 183 net commercial orders (accounting for cancellations) compared with 381 net commercial orders in the previous quarter.On the contrary, Boeing’s rival, Airbus registered net bookings of just 203 aircraft in the same period, trailing far behind.Notably, Boeing and Airbus are the two largest players in the commercial aircraft space and their direct rivalry is quite evident. This, in turn, leads to intensifying competition in the Aerospace–Defense industry.Nevertheless, Boeing’s huge orders have won it a better position in the industry.Price MovementShares of Boeing have rallied 77.1% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 34.3%. This could be because the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. Additionally, the stock’s performance is in line with that of General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report) that also surpassed the industry mark.Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company’s Ingalls Shipbuilding unit is the largest supplier of U.S. Navy surface combatants and has built nearly 70% of the U.S. Navy fleet of warships, till date.Notably, Huntington Ingalls’ revenues were $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2018, which increased 8.7% year over year. This upside was primarily driven by higher volumes in amphibious ships at the Ingalls business division along with higher volumes in aircraft carriers and navy nuclear support services at Newport shipbuilding. We expect the company’s Ingalls division to efficiently improve the construction and modernization of shipbuilding programs in the upcoming quarters and significantly contribute to its revenue growth, thereby.Furthermore, the U.S. Senate approved the fiscal 2019 U.S. defense budget last month, which provisions for a spending of $18.3 billion on shipbuilding and increasing the end strength for the U.S. Navy. These developments reflect massive growth prospects for shipbuilding giants like Huntington Ingalls, increasing its chances of acquiring major shipbuilding contracts. This, in turn, will boost the company’sprofit margin.Price PerformanceShares of Huntington Ingalls rallied about 12.4% in a year compared with the industry’s 28.1% growth. The underperformance might have been caused due to intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderHuntington Ingalls carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

205,TXT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Gyrocam Systems business unit recently clinched a contract involving the production and delivery of spare parts for the AN/VSQ-6B Vehicle Optics Sensor system (VOSS). Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Jul 3, 2023.Valued at $80 million, the contract was awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Land and Maritime, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 through 2023 Army working capital funds and other procurement (Army) funds to complete the task, at Florida.Gyrocam Systems & VOSSLockheed Martin’s Gyrocam Systems offer gyro-stabilized electro-optical sensors and night vision enhancements that allow users to see through fog, haze and complete darkness. These sensors are cost-effective and can be easily tailored with interchangeable universal mounts for ground vehicles, airborne platforms, maritime vessels and perimeter security application. To date, more than 1,100 Gyrocam sensor systems have been installed in all branches of the U.S. military, law enforcement and NATO and coalition partners.The VOSS is a remotely-controlled, gyro-stabilized, telescoping, high-resolution, zoom capable multi-sensor (daylight camera, night vision camera, thermal imaging camera) surveillance system that uses existing commercial camera technology. This system has been use in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Major Army Commands on various variants of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicle fleet.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin, being one of the Pentagon’s prime contractors, enjoys a steady flow of contracts each year and 2018 has not been any exception either. Recently, the company secured a contract worth $288 million for providing sensor systems along with other technical services for the Apache helicopter. Last week, it won a $175 million deal to support the F-35 Lightning depot implementation plan. Considering such frequent order inflows along with the latest one, we expect the company to reflect solid performance in the coming quarterly results, keeping its usual trend.Moreover, Lockheed Martin ended 2017 with backlog worth $99.9 billion, up 3.8% from the year-ago number. This upside reflects increased demand from domestic and international customers. Additionally, its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs guarantees a steady flow of follow-on orders not only from the U.S. government but also from a large number of foreign allies of the nation.The recently approved fiscal 2019 defense budget, which provisions for a spending of $716 billion in the United States’ defense, is also an added positive. These developments reflect solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s combat-proven program like the Gyrocam Systems, which in turn, should boost its profit margin.Price Movement    In a year’s time, Lockheed Martin’s stock has gained about 6% compared with the industry’s 28% rally. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

207,TXT,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently secured a deal worth $23.7 million for procuring F-15 vertical stabilizers. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by May 31, 2022.The contract was awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Richmond, VA. The company will utilize fiscal 2018 through 2022 defense working capital funds to complete the task at Missouri.A Brief Note on F-15Boeing’s F-15 Strike Eagle is a twin-engine, all-weather tactical fighter aircraft. Its proven design is unbeatable in air-to-air combat, with more than 100 aerial combat victories.Our ViewBoeing is one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors. Notably, its defense business stands out among peers on virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and backlog.Particularly, Boeing’s forte has been combat-proven aircraft among the other defense equipments. So far, the company has manufactured more than 1,600 F-15 aircraft for six countries and none of them plan to retire these jets, thus indicating this jet’s enhanced sustainability.In 2017, the company delivered 16 F-15s, up 7% from the year-ago tally. Moreover, its backlog increased 11% in the same period, primarily driven by contract wins for the F-15 program. Needless to say, this reflects the popularity that the F-15 jet enjoys in the United States.With rising security threats across the globe, developing economies like India, Qatar and a few more are ramping up their arsenal apart from developed nations like the United States. As a result, we may expect further expansion in F-15’s customer base, beyond its domestic realm, which in turn will boost Boeing’s profit from its defense business.Moreover, the $716-billion fiscal 2019 defense budget, which the U.S. Senate approved recently, is expected to boost the business of major U.S. defense contractors like Boeing.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Boeing’s shares have soared about 69.2%, outperforming the broader industry’s rally of 29.8%. This impressive performance was driven by the company’s record backlog supporting revenue growth, increased orders for commercial airplanes and expanded presence in domestic as well as international markets. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider    Boeing currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

219,TXT,"Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 financial results on Jul 19, before the market opens.In the prior quarter, the company’s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Textron has missed expectations in one of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 0.82%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderTextron is a multi-industry conglomerate that is well-known for its brands such as Bell Helicopter, Cessna Aircraft Company, Jacobsen, Kautex, E-Z-GO and Greenlee. Apart from manufacturing aircraft, automotive engine components and industrial tools as well as offering associated services, the company operates as a commercial finance corporation in select markets.With respect to second-quarter highlights, Textron won a couple of sumptuous contracts from Pentagon, which we believe will get duly reflected in the company’s increased revenue growth for the yet-to-be reported quarter. While one of these contracts, worth $475 million was awarded by the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) for the Mid-Endurance Unmanned Aircraft Systems (MEUAS), the other one was a Navy deal worth $146.6 million for repairing parts of the UH-1Y and AH-IZ aircraft.Coming to expectations regarding the quarter’s outcome, the company is likely to witness strong sales growth at its Industrial business segment, courtesy of the Arctic Cat buyout in the first quarter of 2017. This segment’s growth will be further boosted with Textron having started delivering its highly efficient ELiTE series lithium golf cars in the first quarter, which comes with zero battery maintenance.Although the company’s Bell segment has been dragging down its top line for quite a few quarters so far, management expects to see some upward potential, at least in terms of this segment’s margins, starting from the second quarter.  On the flip side, lower-than-expected Tactical Armored Patrol Vehicle (TAPV) production in the first quarter hampered the company’s growth. Textron has incurred a notable loss of $24 million under a contract related to TAPV. In the near future, no significant improvement in this situation can be expected. We believe this program will remain a challenge for the second-quarter results as well. Also, the pre-tax special charges of $22 million incurred in the first quarter owing to the Arctic Cat acquisition, has forced the company to increase the annual pre-tax charges forecast by almost $15 million. These charges may also impose greater expenses on the company’s upcoming results.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 55 cents, down 16.86% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is estimated at $3.59 billion, implying a 2.29% year-over-year increase.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Textron is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Textron has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 55 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Textron carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. But the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Textron Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Textron Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Textron Inc.

220,TXT,"Aircraft giant, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), has entered into a draft deal for delivering three Next-Generation 737-800 airplanes to Algeria-based Tassili Airlines, per Reuters. Although the details of the contract have been revealed recently, the order was announced during the Paris Air Show, last month.However, at that time, Boeing's orders & deliveries website had attributed the order to an unidentified customer.Coming back to the details, the contract is valued at $294 million at list prices. Per the terms, Boeing will deliver these airplanes during the second half of 2018.A member of the Next-Generation 737 family, the 737-800, continues to be extremely popular as a single-aisle aircraft. This is because of its advanced technology, and low operation and maintenance costs.The new 737s will feature the Boeing Sky Interior – the 787 Dreamliner inspired cabin – that provides passengers a sense of space with decorative sidewalls, larger windows, LED mood lighting and larger pivot overhead stowage bins.Recent Deals Inked at the Paris Air ShowDemand for Boeing’s commercial airplanes has been rising, owing to a steady increase in passenger and freight traffic. This has been even more strongly reflected in recent times, when the aerospace behemoth successfully won the maximum number of contracts at the Paris Air Show. In addition to the aforementioned deal,  other notable contracts secured by Boeing at the Air Show, include a commitment from the Kuwait-based ALAFCO Aviation Lease and Finance Company for 20 737 MAX 8s, valued at $2.2 billion at current list prices. Moreover, Lion Group is committed to buy 50 737 Max 10 jets from the company for $6.24 billion.Also, Boeing signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with SpiceJet for 40 737 MAX airplanes worth $4.7 billion. Another MOU worth $2.5 billion was signed with Tibet Financial Leasing for 20 737 MAX airplanes. Moreover, Boeing signed an MOU with BOC Aviation Limited for 10 737 MAX 10 airplanes, worth nearly $1.25 billion.Apart from this, the company clinched an order from AerCap for 30 787-9 Dreamliners, worth $8.1 billion. Given the huge commercial demand, Boeing is expected to witness significant traction going ahead, especially in the single-aisle market.Single-Aisle Aircraft in DemandBoeing anticipates demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion, in the next 20 years. This projected figure reflects a 5% increase over last year's projection.Moreover, the company expects single-aisle jets to be the major driver of demand growth, comprising 72% of the total commercial jets’ demand projection. While the new 737 MAX and the 737-800 is likely to grab the lion’s share of the new orders, Boeing’s arch-rival Airbus Group SE’s (EADSY  -  Free Report) A320neo is expected to pose significant challenges.Nevertheless, Boeing’s 737 model remians one of the best-selling planes in the single-aisle market, thanks to its fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Therefore, to maintain its dominance in the commercial aerospace market, this aerospace behemoth continues to invest in research and development for upgrading and churning out upgraded versions of its existing planes.Q1 Order DetailsBoeing’s second-quarter 2017 order details show that the company booked 183 net commercial orders (accounting for cancellations). In the first half of 2017, it booked 381 net commercial orders. On the contrary, Boeing’s rival, Airbus registered net bookings of just 203 aircraft in the same period, trailing far behind.Since, Boeing and Airbus are the two largest players in the commercial aircraft space their direct rivalry is quite evident. This, in turn, leads to intensifying competition in the Aerospace–Defense industry. Nevertheless, the huge orders Boeing has won recently places it in a better position in the industry.Price MovementShare price of Boeing has increased 55.8% in the last 12 months, outperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace–Defense industry’s gain of 26.7%. This could have been driven by the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases as well as earnings accretive acquisitions. Additionally, the stock’s performance is in line with that of General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report) that also surpassed the industry mark.Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
