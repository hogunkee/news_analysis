0,MMC,"Good news is scarce for emerging-market investors and some are seizing on the faint promise of a thaw offered by Monday's meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart, Donald Trump.Few expect a major breakthrough after the U.S. imposed its toughest sanctions to date in April as punishment for Moscow's alleged meddling in U.S. elections. But money managers from Swedbank Robur and EI Sturdza Investment Funds say the fact that the summit is happening at all is reason enough to buy Russian stocks and bonds.It's not just Trump's acknowledgment of Putin on the world stage that's boosting Russian assets. The economy has been buoyed by rising oil prices, while escalating political risks in Turkey, Brazil and Poland are pushing investors to hunt for alternatives.""I'm not expecting much from this meeting, but the fact that it'll take place creates positive sentiment and an excuse to buy Russian assets,"" said Elena Loven, a Stockholm-based fund manager at Swedbank Robur. ""Stocks look solid in comparison with Poland and Turkey so we've been switching into Russian equities.""The biggest exchange-traded fund focused on Russian stocks, VanEck Vectors Russia (RSX), added about $100 million during the week and the nation's equity index reached a record high. Credit default swaps dropped to the lowest level since the April sanctions, while local government bonds have handed investors a 2.2% return in dollars this month, compared with a loss of almost 10% for Turkey.Kremlin officials are said to be in intense talks with their counterparts in Washington to strike at least one deal that would allow Trump to declare the meeting in Helsinki a success. While Trump has declined to brand Putin friend or foe ahead of their meeting, he reiterated on Friday that he'll raise the question of attempted meddling in the U.S. elections.""For the world to see Putin and Trump shaking hands and simulating close friendship may well improve sentiment toward Russian assets and lower perceptions of their risk premium,"" said Julian Rimmer, a trader in London at Investec Bank. ""The summit should provide a modest boost to trading sentiment, but I doubt any significant agreements are made or that the various Russo-American disputes will be resolved because they are long-standing and complex.""Investors may even take profit on Russian shares after the meeting because ""the positive factors will be over,"" according to Robur's Loven.Citigroup (C) analysts are optimistic: They predict a Syria deal on counterterrorism cooperation, expanding the cease-fire and the removal of foreign forces.""We believe the planned 16 July Trump-Putin summit could boost the likelihood of sanctions de-escalation,"" Citi analysts including Barry Ehrlich said in a note dated July 5. Russian stocks that could benefit the most from improved relations are Russia's biggest lender, Sberbank, and its largest miner, MMC Norilsk Nickel, according to Citi.Shares of both companies climbed for a second day on Friday, helping lift the bench mark MOEX Russia Index 0.7%, its first gain in four days. Ten-year ruble bonds advanced last week with yields set for a 16 basis-point drop, the biggest decline since April.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEric Vanraes, who oversees a bond fund from Geneva for EI Sturdza, which has about $3 billion under management, said his company reinvested in Russian debt last week after a pause, buying Eurobonds of Gazprom, Russia's natural-gas giant.""I don't expect anything from this kind of meeting, but the mood of investors has changed,"" Vanraes said.

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.5%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.The company’s first-quarter results are expected to benefit from increased revenues at both its operating segments of Risk and Insurance Services as well as Consulting. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net operating revenues is pegged at $3.8 billion, reflecting 8.5% year-over-year growth.The company’s Risk and Insurance Services segment has been growing over the past several quarters on the back of accretive acquisitions and the trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segmental revenues is pegged at $2.2 billion, up 10% year over year.Also, the company’s Consulting segment has been significantly contributing to the revenue base, riding on both organic and inorganic growth efforts. The consensus mark for revenues from this segment is $1.6 billion, representing 6.7% increase year over year.The company is expanding its footprint in the regions of Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and South Africa, which remain underexplored with high-growth potential. Performance from these regions is likely to boost overall results. Additionally, the company is widening its horizon into new businesses, which are expected to drive the top line.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Marsh & McLennan is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Though the same witnesses progress at a slower pace, the impact of rate increase is clearly visible in the insurer’s investment results.

60,MMC,"The third-quarter earnings season is gaining pace with 87 members of the elite S&P 500 index having already reported quarterly numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, the performance of these index members (accounting for 24.7% of the index’s total market capitalization) indicate that total earnings have increased 9.4% on 7.3% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 71.3% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 70.1%, outperforming on the top-line front.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. About 50.7% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index that have reported results so far shows 7.8% earnings growth on 3.3% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 71.4% for the bottom line compared favorably with that of the S&P 500. However, the beat ratio of 50% for the top line is lower than the same of the S&P 500.  Insurance industry, an integral part of the Finance sector, will witness soft results this yet-to-be-reported quarter. A soft performance from the insurance industry will drag the Finance sector’s third-quarter results. Per our Earnings Preview, earnings of the Finance sector will decline 1.5% though revenues will increase 1.1%.The third quarter witnessed a slew of catastrophes, which will weigh on underwriting profitability as well as the bottom line of insurers. Per the catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide, the insured loss estimates from Irma could range between $25 billion and $35 billion and between $40 billion and $85 billion from Maria. Moody’s Analytics earlier estimated economic losses from Irma to come in the $58-$83 billion band while that from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion. Mexican tremors have all the more added to the woes.Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in underwriting results, we expect prudent underwriting practices and capital reserve piled up on a benign catastrophe environment to withstand the loss to some extent.We do not expect pricings to have been strong in the third quarter.However, net investment income, an important component of an insurer’s top line, is likely to witness improvement courtesy three rate hikes approved since December 2016. Though rate environment is improving at a very slower pace, the impact of rate increase is clearly visible in the insurer’s investment results. The third quarter will also not be an exception.Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers, which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to continuous low rates. Annuity sales should have also benefited from higher rates. However, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.With more than 700 companies (180 S&P 500 members) set to report results this week, let’s find out where the following insurers stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Oct 25.Chubb Limited’s (CB  -  Free Report) third-quarter underwriting results will be affected by a string of cat events. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for combined ratio is currently pegged at 101%, a deterioration of 980 basis points from the year-ago quarter.Premiums earned likely have reduced the company’s inability to generate enough underwriting returns. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net premiums earned is currently pegged at $7.2 billion, reflecting a decline of 2.8% on a year-over year basis.However, higher net investment income and continued share buybacks have likely cushioned the company’s bottom line. The company expects its quarterly investment income run rate to range between $830 million and $840 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss is 26 cents per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter, reflecting a 108.9% year-over-year slump. Chubb currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP. Further combined with an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, makes surprise prediction difficult.

The company estimates between $102 million and $114 million in cat losses in the third quarter, thereby deteriorating the combined ratio by 860-960 basis points.However, higher premiums earned and investment income likely have driven the top-line growth.

61,MMC,"Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC  -  Free Report) third-quarter results, scheduled for Oct 26, are expected to benefit from increased revenues at both its operating segments, namely Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting.Revenues in the company’s Risk and Insurance Services segment, which contributes nearly 55% to total revenues, have been growing for the past several quarters and we expect the trend to continue in the quarter. Top-line growth will be aided by an increase in underlying revenues along with accretion from numerous acquisitions made during the course of the past many years. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the segment is $1.7 billion, up 6.3% year over year.Also, higher contribution is expected from Consulting. A combination of organic and inorganic growth measures are likely to drive revenues in this segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the segment is $1.6 billion, up 5.8% year over year.The company is expanding in underpenetrated regions such as Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and South Africa, which are perceived as high growth areas. Performance from these regions is likely to aid overall results.Along with pushing into attractive geographical regions, the company is expanding in new businesses which should drive revenues. These include Marsh’s build out of MMA and its UK SME strategy, the emergence of cyber, flood and mortgage practices at Marsh and Guy Carpenter, investments at Mercer in Workday implementation capabilities, global health and benefits technology and the Mercer Marketplace Health Exchange, investments in Oliver Wyman and their digital technology and analytics platform, and continued pursuit of high-growth areas, including healthcare and the public sector.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model shows that Marsh & McLennan does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients, of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, to beat earnings estimates.Zacks ESP:  Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.53%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 77 cents per share is a penny below the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

63,MMC,"The untold damage and misery caused by Hurricane Harvey is not just being felt by the residents of Texas. Markets were also singed by the tropical cyclone on Monday, with energy and financials bearing the brunt of the pain. Stocks of energy companies suffered after key refineries in Texas had to close due to widespread flooding. But losses for insurers were possibly the most alarming, with the iShares U.S. Insurance ETF losing 1%.This was possibly a reaction to the enormous level of claims likely to be generated in the aftermath of this disaster. However, industry watchers think that the industry has the ability to absorb resulting losses and may even gain in the months ahead via higher rates. Adding select property and casualty insurers to your portfolio makes for a prudent option at this point.Insurers Possess Sufficient Capital Market watchers believe that insurers and reinsurers possess sufficient capital reserves to withstand the losses incurred by Hurricane Harvey. The damage generated by this Category 4 storm is yet to be correctly estimated. However, it is the fiercest hurricane to impact Texas since 2008. Even now, continuous rainfall is flooding the affected areas of the state. Current projections are that the hurricane may cost the U.S. nearly $30 billion.However, insurers serving individuals and businesses currently sport appreciably high levels of capital. Additionally, they do not require such funds to back existing obligations. Given such a state of affairs, Hurricane Harvey is unlikely to dent insurers’ financial position. At most, insurers with business concentrated in the storm-affected areas would experience a fall in quarterly earnings.Gains Likely in Months AheadIn 2005, insurers had suffered losses in the immediate fallout of Hurricane Katrina. Yet, over the next three months, industry heavyweights such as Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report), The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) and The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) notched up heavy gains. While Progressive and Allstate shares increased 20% and 10%, respectively, shares of Chubb skyrocketed over this period, gaining 27%.A similar scenario is likely to develop this time around as well. First, analysts think that the federal government’s National Flood Insurance Program will have to bear the lion’s share of losses incurred by Hurricane Harvey. Second, insurers will once again be able to raise rates in the aftermath of a storm of such ferocity. Reinsurers will also likely benefit since over the medium term they will gain the ability to increase their insurance rates. In the aftermath of Katrina, the likes of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC  -  Free Report), which is an insurance broker, notched up gains in keeping with insurers.Our ChoicesDespite initial losses, insurers should withstand the impact of Hurricane Harvey without much difficulty. Appreciably high capital reserves provide them sufficient cushion for such an eventuality.Further, they could actually move higher in the months ahead as they begin to raise rates. Investing in property and casualty insurers looks like a smart option at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM Score.First American Financial Corporation (FAF  -  Free Report) provides financial services through its Title Insurance and Services segment and its Specialty Insurance segment.First American Financial has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score of B.

70,MMC,"The second-quarter earnings season is picking up pace with 26% members of the elite S&P 500 Index having reporting quarterly numbers already. Per the latest second-quarter scorecard, the performance of 128 index members (accounting for 36.1% of the index’s total market capitalization) that have already reported their financial numbers this quarter, indicate that total earnings have increased 7% on 4.2% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 77.3% companies surpassing the bottom-line expectations and 70.3% outperforming on the top-line front. (For more information, please consult our Zacks Earnings Analysis).The Finance sector’s results (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) have not been very impressive, but aren’t too disappointing either. Of the sector’s total market cap in the S&P 500 index, 54.1% that have reported quarterly results show 7.4% earnings growth on 5.4% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 82.9% for bottom line and 68.6% for top line is higher than the beat ratio of the S&P 500.  The insurance industry is part of the broader Finance sector. Let’s see how the second quarter has turned up for insurers.Results of insurers exposed to catastrophe losses will witness a dent in underwriting margins on account of several catastrophe losses that occurred during the quarter under review. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON), catastrophe losses suffered globally is estimated at $53 billion in the first half of 2017.  Some insurers have estimated catastrophe losses in the second quarter stemming from severe wind and hail catastrophe events during April and May in the U.S.The Allstate Corp. projects $627 million (pre-tax) in catastrophe loss while Kemper Corporation estimates the same between $32 million and $38 million.Another component of insurer’s top line, net investment income, has witnessed improvement, but still remains below historical levels, owing to still-low interest rates.Nevertheless, the recent increase in interest rates by the Fed should offer some respite to life insurers that suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates. Annuity sales too should benefit from higher rates. Nonetheless, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Top line may also benefit from an improving economy and revived consumer sentiments which may lead to increased demand for insurance products.On the flip side, pricing woes linger. Insurers having fat capital reserves are fighting hard to gain business in a highly competitive environment and one of the most common ways to achieve underwriting targets is by lower pricing. Certain lines of insurance – commercial property, workers’ compensation and general liability are mostly experiencing soft pricing.Nonetheless, core business growth, geographic expansion, mergers and acquisitions and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase are like to benefit insurers.Let’s peek into these five insurance companies that are gearing up to report their second-quarter results on Jul 27.Aflac Inc.
