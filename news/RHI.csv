9,RHI,"The U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs in July, as the jobless rate dipped, revisiting a 16-year low of 4.3%, the Labor Department reported on Friday.XWhile average hourly wages rose a tame 2.5% from a year ago, and the data are unlikely to change near-term policy, the underlying details show strong labor market momentum and suggest that Wall Street may be underestimating the extent of Federal Reserve tightening in 2018.An inkling of realization crept into markets on Friday, with the 10-year Treasury yield scooting up 4 basis points to 2.26%. Meanwhile, the dollar clawed back a bit of lost ground after sinking to a 2-year low in recent days, and bank stocks, which can shine when the Fed is raising rates, moved higher.One prominent take on the huge lines of people that showed up at the nationwide Amazon.com (AMZN) hiring blitz this week was that there are droves of people who need jobs, so the economy must not be anywhere near full employment.Yet data from Friday's report, new hiring bonuses at Disney (DIS), discussions of labor-market tightness on earnings calls and the difficulty small firms are having in filling jobs all suggest that what slack there is in the job market is disappearing pretty quickly.Here are a few data points that show the job market has a serious head of steam:Not only has the monthly average job gain accelerated to 195,000 over the past three months, but that's happened as the workweek has lengthened. For the first time since late 2015, aggregate hours worked rose 2% from a year ago in consecutive months.Even with tame wage growth, more hiring and longer hours are boosting incomes, and that should gradually yield more pricing power for business. Aggregate pay rose 4.5% from a year ago in July, after increasing 4.6% in June. Again, that's the best two-month trend since late 2015.On a positive note, 349,000 workers joined the labor force in July, meaning they're working or looking for a job. But that figure is from the survey of households that can yield unreliable shifts in any month, both up and down. The trend is less impressive: Over the past four months, a total of 293,000 people have joined the labor force, but that's been swamped by the cumulative 513,000 increase in employed workers.The jobs data don't change the outlook for the Fed waiting until December for its next rate hike. The Fed is widely expected to announce that it will gradually begin scaling back its $4.5 trillion balance sheet at the conclusion of its Sept. 19-20 meeting. However some Fed policymakers have expressed concern that inflation will bubble up if the jobless rate keeps falling.The battered retail sector added 900 jobs in July. The data include non-store retailers, which added 1,400 jobs. Amazon had already been holding job fairs to staff various facilities around the country even before the nationwide event. Amazon also announced in April that it's hiring 5,000 part-time customer-service reps to work out of their homes.Employment in food service and drinking places surged 53,100. McDonald's (MCD) said in mid-June that the fast-food chain and its franchisees will add 250,000 workers this summer — more than the Golden Arches hired a year ago. McDonald's was recruiting through a partnership with Snap (SNAP), which will connect users to an online application if they click on a McDonald's recruitment ad on its Snapchat social media site.While such creative strategies might help connect employers with hard-to-find workers, Disney is trying to attract cooks, bus drivers and housekeepers by publicizing hiring bonuses that start at $500 and rise as high as $1,500 for culinary employees. Disney reports fiscal third-quarter earnings after the close on Tuesday.A National Federation of Independent Business survey out Thursday indicated that 35% of small firms reported job openings they couldn't fill in July, the highest percentage since 2001.IBD'S TAKE: For an analysis of why Amazon's stock chart is now signaling greater risk, read IBD Leaderboard, where IBD's top market writers help you spot buying opportunities as they emerge and sell signals to lock-in profits. With its post-earnings sell-off, Amazon has fallen to No. 10 in IBD's Internet-Retail group, based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see which companies are setting the pace. Before the jobs data, Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons characterized subdued wage gains as ""unprecedented"" at this advanced stage of the business cycle, but said they see ""a more sustained cyclical acceleration going forward.""Their view is that the labor market is approaching full employment for both skilled and unskilled labor, noting ""the increased inclination of workers to change jobs for higher wages.""The long lines at Amazon's job fairs do raise a lot of questions about how much those people reflect labor-market slack (the jobless looking for work or people looking to add a second job) or people looking for greener pastures. There are, after all, millions of retail workers who may be worried that their store is about to be ""Amazoned"" out of business, and Amazon's wages starting at $12 an hour, plus benefits, are surely a draw.On earnings calls within the past several weeks, numerous companies have talked about wage pressures and tight labor market conditions.Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) and railroad operator Union Pacific (UNP) both said they are seeing 5% wage inflation.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) is seeing 6% wage growth and an even-greater increase in compensation costs when non-wage benefits are included.On the other hand, staffing company Robert Half International (RHI), which serves accounting, health care and other professions, has seen temp bill rates decelerate to 2.5%.""What we're seeing is that our clients — they're just unwilling to pay more, because they don't believe they can pass it through in what they bill their clients,"" Robert Half CEO Harold Messmer said on a July 26 conference call, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.""So, it's actually pretty unprecedented in our experience that on the one hand the labor market tightens, on the other hand wage inflation declines,"" Messmer said.Yet NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said that the tight labor market is raising costs for small employers. ""More than a quarter of all owners reported raising wages in July, and the pressure was especially high in the construction industry,"" he said.Meanwhile, San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams is on edge about the falling jobless rate, which he expects to sink to 4.1% by year end.""I just think we don't want to let this go too long because eventually inflation pressures will emerge at some point,"" Williams said.Despite muted inflation readings in recent months, Williams still envisions four rate hikes between now and the end of 2018, while financial markets see slim odds of more than one through next August, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool.RELATED:The Fed Just Gave A Green Light To Wall StreetAmazon The Inflation Killer Will Lower Grocery Prices With Whole FoodsAmazon Still Prime With Analysts; Intel, EA Touted; Starbucks Cut

10,RHI,"The number that keeps Federal Reserve policymakers up at night isn't the monthly job gain. It's the jobless rate.Though unemployment ticked up to 4.4% in June from May's 16-year low of 4.3%, San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams said on Wednesday that he sees the jobless rate falling to 4.1% by year end.X""I just think we don't want to let this go too long because eventually inflation pressures will emerge at some point,"" Williams said.Wall Street expects Friday's jobs report to show that the unemployment rate returned to 4.3% in July as the economy added 178,000 jobs.Although the massive 50,000-job hiring spree by Amazon.com (AMZN) this week won't begin to show up until the next job report, the company had already been holding job fairs to staff various facilities around the country even before the nationwide event. Amazon also announced in April that it will hire 5,000 part-time customer-service reps to work out of their homes.McDonald's (MCD) said in June that the fast-food chain and its franchisees will add 250,000 workers this summer — more than the Golden Arches hired a year ago.

12,RHI,"After landing a new job, the way to solidify the position is to hit the ground running.Hiring managers don't want their newest recruits just to tread water in the first 90 days but to swim like the pros, according to a new Robert Half International (RHI) survey.Some 63% of 2,200 chief financial officers surveyed allow less than three months for new hires to prove themselves in a new role, with 54% saying one to less than three months and 9% saying less than a month.Another 25% said three to less than six months, and just 4% said that they could take as long as they need.Getting solid in a new position starts with the hiring interview, Robert Half Finance & Accounting Vice President Ky Kingsley told IBD. After working with hiring managers for the last nine years, she most often hears that they want new hires to live up to what they showed in their first impression.""If somebody appears to be technically skilled, for example, there will be an expectation that the person will be able to execute in the manner they discussed,"" Kingsley said.So what can a new hire do to shine in those first weeks and months?

13,RHI,"The big question for the economy is whether the service sector can keep on trucking, even amid manufacturers' struggles and financial market jitters.The news on Wednesday provided some cause for concern as the Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing index unexpectedly fell 2.3 points in January to a 23-month low of 53.5. Though still above 50, signaling expansion, it was the measure's third straight decline. That follows ISM's manufacturing index out Monday that showed factory activity contracting for a fourth straight month.A 53.5 reading for this closely watched indicator of the service sector's health is historically consistent with GDP growth of 1.8%, the institute said.Of particular concern, the employment index dropped to a 12-month low of 52.1 from 56.3. Yet ADP's monthly employment report out Wednesday showed that private service-sector firms added 192,000 jobs in January, just below the 199,000 average reported by the Labor Department for 2015.Still, that's a step down from the 230,000 private service sector job gains that ADP reported in December, as total private payrolls grew 266,900 vs. a 205,400 gain last month. Manufacturing jobs edged down slightly compared to both December and a year earlier.The Labor Department will release its January employment report on Friday.Meanwhile, another Federal Reserve official signaled unease about events since the central bank raised interest rates in December. Further weakening in the global economy and additional dollar appreciation could have “significant consequences” for the economy, New York Fed President William Dudley told MNI.Online employment postings advertised only 13,500 more jobs in January than in the prior month, the Conference Board said Wednesday. While calling it ""a disappointing start for 2016"" and highlighting a large drop in postings for sales-related positions, the research group noted that demand remains high, with nearly 5.5 million advertised vacancies.Wal-Mart (WMT) announced 10,000 job cuts in January, part of its plan to close 154 stores in the U.S. Macy's (M) said it would lay off 4,500 while closing as many as 40 stores.Sprint (S) detailed 2,500 job cuts last week, including 2,000 customer-care positions, many of them at call centers. Yahoo (YHOO) announced late Tuesday that it would cut 15% of staff.Staffing firm Robert Half International (RHI) said in an earnings call this week that it ramped up full-time staff in the second half of 2015 and ""wouldn't add significantly to headcount during this quarter.""The ISM services report's prices paid index fell from 51.0 down to 46.4, the lowest since July 2009. One of the survey respondents noted that ""falling prices are pushing margins down as many are forced to drop prices to meet the competition.""The ISM survey also highlighted the service sector's exposure to the weak global economy as the export orders gauge sank to a nearly seven-year low of 45.5 from 53.5 the prior month.

15,RHI,"The stars are aligned in favor of staffing provider AMN Healthcare Services as spending under ObamaCare, changing demographics and an improved economy have helped spark a surge in demand for health care workers.
"
16,RHI,"AMN Healthcare Services (AHS) is the largest health care staffing and workforce solutions provider in the U.S.
"
17,RHI,"Further fueling demand for its services has been the ongoing trend on the part of health care providers toward outsourcing the entire procurement and staffing functions.
"
18,RHI,"AMN is cashing in on that trend by using acquisitions and internal efforts to offer a far-flung suite of solutions to meet clients' needs from a single large partner.
"
19,RHI,"In the past 18 months, it has acquired five companies and launched efforts that have enhanced its position in the market by adding software and other services that meet clients' needs.
"
20,RHI,"Its strategy is bearing fruit. AMN has logged at least double-digit earnings growth in all but two of the past 12 quarters.
"
21,RHI,"CEO Susan Salka is upbeat about the demand for AMN's services on a number of fronts.
"
22,RHI,"""The demand for health care professionals is through the roof,"" Salka told IBD.
"
23,RHI,"The Affordable Care Act has been a key driver, she says. It added 16.4 million newly insured Americans into the system, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' 2015 estimate.
"
24,RHI,"As more insured people have been added to the system, more go to the emergency room, urgent care or to see a doctor, which has sparked more demand for doctors and nurses, Salka says.
"
25,RHI,"Demand From Demographics
"
26,RHI,"Another driver, she adds, is the point that more people in the U.S. are reaching the age of 65 and, as they age, require more medical services than the general population.
"
27,RHI,"Doctors and nurses are also getting older, she says, and are beginning to retire in greater numbers.
"
28,RHI,"An improved economy and brighter jobs picture have also helped provide more people the money needed for medical expenses and co-pays.

29,RHI,"""Lower general unemployment also drives higher attrition and job openings, particularly within nursing,"" Salka adds.
"
30,RHI,"AMN's stock has risen 35% this year after a 33% gain in 2014.
"
31,RHI,"AMN provides workforce solutions — including managed services programs, vendor management systems, recruitment process outsourcing and consulting services — meant to help health care providers more effectively and efficiently manage their temporary and permanent staffing needs.
"
32,RHI,"Its clients are hospitals, community health centers and clinics, physician practice groups and many other health care providers. Through its managed services program, or MSP, it provides clients with a single point of contact for all their dealings with workforce vendors. AMN handles all the financial, management, clinical and other aspects of agency workforce supply.
"
33,RHI,"Providing that single point of contact to meet clients' needs has worked in AMN's favor:
"
34,RHI,"""For years, the main driver (of our business) was helping clients fill hard-to-fill positions and deal with seasonal fluctuations,"" said Salka. ""Over the past decade more and more health care providers want to outsource the whole procurement and staffing function for temporary and permanent workers.""
"
35,RHI,"The result has been a ""pickup"" in clients; demand to work with one large outsourcing partner to fill their needs, Salka says.
"
36,RHI,"""Our strategy is to continue this evolution of not just being a staffing partner, but a holistic workforce solutions partner,"" Salka said.
"
37,RHI,"Acquisitions have helped AMN meet that goal.
"
38,RHI,"Staffing Up By Acquisition
"
39,RHI,"One important acquisition in this area was the 2010 purchase of Medfinders, a leading provider of clinical workforce managed services programs, and its Nursefinders brand that keyed in on the continuing high demand for nurses.
"
40,RHI,"""AMN embraced the managed service provider concept with Nursefinders ... pretty big in the MSP concept,"" SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Tobey Sommer told IBD. ""Prior to that acquisition AMN was not that big in MSP.""
"
41,RHI,"After the acquisition, he adds, AMN grew the MSP business ""nicely"" and in the last 18 months has bought companies that have software to implement MSP.
"
42,RHI,"""The acquisitions they've done in the last couple of years bring additional software and alternative staffing services that coincide with this trend of being a broader provider of workforce solutions to clients,"" William Blair analyst Timothy McHugh told IBD.
"
43,RHI,"One of AMN's recent acquisitions was Avantas, a leading provider of clinical labor management services, including workforce consulting, data analytics, predictive modeling and scheduling technology, a transaction it completed in December 2014.
"
44,RHI,"The price included an initial payment of $16.5 million, with an earn-out potential of up to $8.5 million based on future operating performance. Avantas' 2014 projected revenue was estimated then at about $8 million, with the acquisition expected to be neutral to AMN's earnings in 2015 and accretive by 2016, AMN said in a statement.
"
45,RHI,"""Avantas helps hospitals with workforce planning by providing technology and consulting services to help them better predict their total staffing needs,"" said Salka. ""They have scheduling and predictive analytics to predict what (hospitals') needs will be, so they can better schedule the clinicians. Most hospitals do scheduling (for nurses) two to three weeks in advance. We can help them do better than that by looking out 60 to 90 days.""
"
46,RHI,"In January, AMN closed on the acquisition of Onward Healthcare, Locum Leaders and Medefis from OGH for a total price of $82.5 million. Onward Healthcare is a top national nurse and allied health care staffing firm. Locum Leaders is a national locum tenens (temporary physicians) provider. Medefis is a provider of an SaaS (software as a service)-based vendor management system for health care facilities.
"
47,RHI,"Acquisitions have helped drive AMN's growth. In the first quarter, earnings climbed 67% to 30 cents a share, on an adjusted diluted basis. Revenue rose 36% to $327.5 million.
"
48,RHI,"Revenue for its Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment was $229 million, up 40% (24% excluding acquisitions) from a year earlier. This segment provides hospitals and health care facilities with temporary professionals.
"
49,RHI,"The Locum Tenens Staffing segment revenue was $87 million, an increase of 30% (19% excluding acquisitions). This segment involves the temporary placement of physicians as independent contractors.
"
50,RHI,"""Their growth the last few quarters is a reflection of longer-term demand drivers coming to fruition as well as positive market share trends,"" said McHugh.
"
51,RHI,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 39% to $1.03 a share. They see a 16% gain in 2016.
"
52,RHI,"Overall, temporary nurse staffing accounts for the biggest percentage of the company's revenue, or about half of the total, says Salka.
"
53,RHI,"""Our growth strategy is to help clients to be more efficient and effective in managing their entire clinical workforce, both permanent and temporary,"" said Salka. ""It's all about getting the right talent at the right time at the right cost.""
"
54,RHI,"Salka says the company continues to look for acquisitions, including those that would expand its workforce solutions.
"
55,RHI,"AMN is a part of IBD's Commercial Services-Staffing industry group. It has a 98 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. Also included in the group is TrueBlue (TBI), which also has a Composite Rating of 98, and Robert Half International (RHI), which has a 91.The stars are aligned in favor of staffing provider AMN Healthcare Services as spending under ObamaCare, changing demographics and an improved economy have helped spark a surge in demand for health care workers.AMN Healthcare Services (AHS) is the largest health care staffing and workforce solutions provider in the U.S.Further fueling demand for its services has been the ongoing trend on the part of health care providers toward outsourcing the entire procurement and staffing functions.AMN is cashing in on that trend by using acquisitions and internal efforts to offer a far-flung suite of solutions to meet clients' needs from a single large partner.In the past 18 months, it has acquired five companies and launched efforts that have enhanced its position in the market by adding software and other services that meet clients' needs.Its strategy is bearing fruit. AMN has logged at least double-digit earnings growth in all but two of the past 12 quarters.CEO Susan Salka is upbeat about the demand for AMN's services on a number of fronts.""The demand for health care professionals is through the roof,"" Salka told IBD.The Affordable Care Act has been a key driver, she says. It added 16.4 million newly insured Americans into the system, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' 2015 estimate.As more insured people have been added to the system, more go to the emergency room, urgent care or to see a doctor, which has sparked more demand for doctors and nurses, Salka says.Demand From DemographicsAnother driver, she adds, is the point that more people in the U.S. are reaching the age of 65 and, as they age, require more medical services than the general population.Doctors and nurses are also getting older, she says, and are beginning to retire in greater numbers.An improved economy and brighter jobs picture have also helped provide more people the money needed for medical expenses and co-pays.""Lower general unemployment also drives higher attrition and job openings, particularly within nursing,"" Salka adds.AMN's stock has risen 35% this year after a 33% gain in 2014.AMN provides workforce solutions — including managed services programs, vendor management systems, recruitment process outsourcing and consulting services — meant to help health care providers more effectively and efficiently manage their temporary and permanent staffing needs.Its clients are hospitals, community health centers and clinics, physician practice groups and many other health care providers.

67,RHI,"A murky jobs picture has clouded the economy until the past few months. But that hasn't stopped staffing firm Robert Half, which has shined through with impressive financial results and cashed in on Corporate America's push to cut costs by hiring temporary staffers.
"
68,RHI,"And now, with the jobs picture brightening and the jobless rate down to the lowest level since 2008, Robert Half's business is primed to shine even more.
"

"
74,RHI,"Work Trends Boost Business
"
75,RHI,"What's been fueling the company's long-running winning streak? Robert Half is benefiting from workplace trends, CFO Keith Waddell told IBD.
"
76,RHI,"For one thing, ""there's clearly a secular shift for companies using more temporary staffers to have a more variable workforce,"" he said.
"
77,RHI,"Since the economic recovery began in March 2010, almost 10% of the jobs created have been temporary jobs, he says, better than the last recovery cycle starting in September 2003, when temp jobs made up under 3% of jobs created.
"
78,RHI,"Waddell says 78% of Robert Half's revenue comes from its temporary and consultant staffing divisions such as Accountemps; 8% from its permanent placement division Robert Half Finance & Accounting and 14% from the Protiviti consulting and internal audit division, which specializes in risk, advisory and transactional services.
"
79,RHI,"""We believe the labor markets have begun to improve our growth rates,"" Waddell added. ""We've seen an acceleration in our year-over-year growth rates for four consecutive quarters in all our lines of business, and most recently we've seen improvement outside the U.S. as well, most notably Europe. ""
"
80,RHI,"In October, the temporary penetration rate, which represents the percentage of all jobs that are temporary, ""inched higher"" to 2.10% from 2.11% in September, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Tobey Sommer noted in a report citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"
81,RHI,"Sommer also noted that the previous ""high water mark"" of 2.03% was established in 2000.
"
82,RHI,"""We continue to expect the temp penetration rate to hit 2.4%-2.5% over the next three years as employers strive to increase the variable part of their labor expense,"" he added.
"
83,RHI,"Temporary workers placed by Robert Half are actually Robert Half employees. They're paid by Robert Half for hours worked with what typically is an hourly rate.
"
84,RHI,"Companies Watch Costs
"
85,RHI,"Waddell says the increased demand for temporary staffers stems from the point that companies have wanted to have ""cost flexibility"" in hiring with ""variable costs"" rather than fixed costs.
"
86,RHI,"""As companies have been uncertain about economic prospects they've been more apt to use temporary workers,"" he added. ""They've found that the quality of people they can source as temporary workers has been very high.""
"
87,RHI,"Even as the trend toward temporary workers helps the company, Waddell says, a trend toward more regulations and regulatory compliance burdens is benefiting the demand for services from Robert Half's Protiviti division, particularly in the financial services industry.
"
88,RHI,"College Grads In Demand
"
89,RHI,"Another point in Robert Half's favor is the demand for college-educated workers.
"
90,RHI,"""The college educated unemployment rate has dipped quite a bit more than (that of) the (overall) labor market,"" Sommer said, adding that the company's placements consist almost exclusively of college-educated people.
"
91,RHI,"The unemployment rate for people 16 and over with a bachelor's degree and higher was only 3.1% in October, according to the latest jobs report from the Labor Department.
"
92,RHI,"""Competition for experienced talent is intense right now in many cities and in some occupations the demand is growing faster than the supply of skilled workers,"" said Robert Half CEO Harold Messmer on the third-quarter conference call.
"
93,RHI,"Sommer says Robert Half's bill rate, or the amount it charges its customers per hour for the temporary workers it places, has been improving. It was up 3.4% vs. a year earlier in the third quarter, says Waddell. That followed a 3.5% rise in the second quarter and a 2.6% increase in the first quarter.
"
94,RHI,"Waddell says the ""slight deceleration"" in the third quarter was primarily currency driven, which reduced the bill rate by 30 basis points.
"
95,RHI,"The increased pricing, says Sommer, is being driven by the trend toward employers preferring temporary workers and a tighter labor market among professionals.
"
96,RHI,"Another thing Robert Half has in its favor, says Waddell, is its ""sweet spot"" in terms of client size — middle-market companies with fewer than 500 employees.
"
97,RHI,"Midmarket Sweet Spot
"
98,RHI,"Sommer says that other than Robert Half there is no other publicly traded staffing firm focused on companies in that midmarket size range.
"
99,RHI,"Waddell is upbeat about the company's prospects: ""We see broad-based improvement in demand across (our) functional areas, across geographies and particular strength in our sweet spot client size of middle-market companies. ""We believe the secular trends (I've) talked about will continue into the future as companies want to keep their cost structures variable and have flexibility.""
"
100,RHI,"And, he adds, with the ongoing ""war for talent"" in the workforce, ""we think we're in the best part of the staffing industry focusing on professional-level people.""
"
101,RHI,"Sommer says 2015 ""will be a very good year for Robert Half as a play on small business — I think earnings estimates are likely to keep rising.""
"
102,RHI,"He has a buy rating on the stock.
"
103,RHI,"""It's been an organic growth story and investors tend to like it,"" Sommer said. ""It doesn't spend a lot on acquisitions. Most of its cash flow is spent on share repurchases.""

""We believe the secular trends (I've) talked about will continue into the future as companies want to keep their cost structures variable and have flexibility.""And, he adds, with the ongoing ""war for talent"" in the workforce, ""we think we're in the best part of the staffing industry focusing on professional-level people.""Sommer says 2015 ""will be a very good year for Robert Half as a play on small business — I think earnings estimates are likely to keep rising.""He has a buy rating on the stock.""It's been an organic growth story and investors tend to like it,"" Sommer said. ""It doesn't spend a lot on acquisitions. Most of its cash flow is spent on share repurchases.""Robert Half is the largest company by market cap in IBD's Commercial Services-Staffing industry group, followed by ManpowerGroup (MAN), Fifty One Job (JOBS), On Assignment (ASGN) and Korn Ferry International (KFY). Robert Half gets the group's highest IBD Composite Rating, a 97 out of a possible 99.

Volume was strong for each of the four stocks.On the downside, chip designer Xilinx (XLNX) suffered the day's biggest percentage loss in the S&P 500. The stock gapped down 15% in tremendous volume. After Tuesday's close, the San Jose, Calif.-based company reported quarterly results that topped views on earnings but missed on revenue.
