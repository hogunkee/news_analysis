0,VIAB,"A struggle for power for the No. 2 spot of a potentially combined company is muddying up merger talks between CBS (CBS) and Viacom (VIAB), according to CNBC, citing sources.CBS COO Joe Ianniello and Viacom CEO Bob Bakish both want the job, says the outlet, which also reported sources saying that current CBS chief Les Moonves would be at the merged media company for at least two years.A special committee of five CBS board members formally submitted a below market-value bid for Viacom and called for CBS management, which would include Iannello, to lead the merged company, sources told Bloomberg.A final decision on the merger could be made as soon as this month, said the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.The outlet also said that 94-year-old Sumner Redstone, whose National Amusements controls about 80% of both CBS and Viacom, has only one vote on the board of the controlling company as his mental capacity comes under increasing scrutiny.National Amusements, which would have to sign off on any merger, reportedly has seven directors in total, including Sumner's daughter, Shari Redstone. She is said to be a driver behind current CBS-Viacom merger discussions.The elder Redstone is said to communicate via an iPad preloaded with recordings of his voice that are linked to ""yes,"" ""no"" and ""f*** you"" verbal commands, according to the Journal, citing people who have spoken with him.CBS shares finished 4.2% higher in the stock market today, while Viacom lost 3.7%.Fox News owner 21st Century Fox (FOXA) has floated a possible sale of Sky News to Walt Disney (DIS) as part of a set of remedies to U.K. regulators who seek to limit Rupert Murdoch's control of media in that market.Addressing concerns surrounding the editorial independence of Sky News, Fox offered new ring-fencing policies that would establish Sky News as a distinct company within parent Sky Group, equipping it with a Sky News-managed independent board and 15 years of guaranteed funding from Fox.The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority had provisionally found in January that the Fox-Sky deal was ""not in the public interest due to media plurality concerns,"" as it would give the Murdoch family ""too much control over news providers in the U.K. across all media platforms ... and therefore too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda.""As another option, Disney ""has expressed an interest in acquiring Sky News, with a view to adding it to Disney's existing portfolio of television channels, whether or not Disney's proposed acquisition of (21st Century Fox) proceeds,"" said Fox in a release. Disney said in December that it would acquire Fox's studio and entertainment assets for $66 billion.Fox announced back in December 2016 that it would acquire the portion of Sky it doesn't already own for 10.75 euros per share in cash. In February, Comcast (CMCSA) tossed its own bid into the ring with a $31 billion cash bid, a move that weighed on shares. Fox said then that it ""remains committed"" to its original cash offer for the company.Disney shares closed up 0.8%, while Fox shares ended flat.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Netflix Takes On Media Giants As Video Streaming War Goes GlobalComcast's Sky Bid Sends Cable-TV Firm's Stocks Down And Fox, DisneyThis Is Disney's 'Highest Priority' As Fox Deal Transforms Media SectorChart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityWhich Stocks Make This List Of The Fastest-Growing Companies?

Tesla (TSLA) Model 3 production missed targets by less than feared. Spotify (SPOT) launched its direct listing. Lennar (LEN) and LGI Homes (LGIH) signaled homebuilders are on the rise again.Stock market averages sold off Monday as China signaled it would aggressively respond to Trump tariffs. But even as the U.S. detailed its 25% tariff on Chinese imports followed by Beijing's retaliation, the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite rallied Tuesday-Thursday, but in lighter volume. But stocks sold off again Friday, ending the week lower, after Trump threatened to ratchet up China tariffs. Tesla (TSLA) rocketed from a one-year low.

New-home orders rose 30% to 8,456 as the big builder was bullish about housing demand. IBD 50 stock LGI Homes (LGIH) broke out to a buy zone Thursday after reporting a 63.5% jump in home closings.  Analysts say the results underline the high demand for entry-level homes.

Wynn rallied Friday on a report that MGM Resorts (MGM) might bid for its rival with Steve Wynn out of the picture.Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) fell for the week on U.S.-China trade fears. They did get a boost Tuesday as Delta forecast first-quarter unit revenue in the high end of expectations, citing solid global travel demand.21st Century Fox (FOXA), in its bid to acquire Sky Group, offered new ring-fencing policies designed to keep subsidiary Sky News independent of Fox owner Rupert Murdoch and his family's media empire.

In 2016, Sumner Redstone's National Amusements — of which daughter Shari is president — sent Viacom a letter asking for an all-stock merger with CBS. (National Amusements controls around 80% of both Viacom and CBS voting shares.)But Viacom shut down talks later that year, after the younger Redstone pulled the plug on the proposal, supporting then-new Viacom chief Bob Bakish and telling Recode last year that there was better value in CBS and Viacom remaining separate.But that was before Walt Disney (DIS) agreed to acquire 21st Century Fox (FOXA) entertainment assets. TheWrap said Redstone believes the companies need to have a bigger footprint to succeed.Viacom owns Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon and more, with teen and children's programming heavily exposed to Netflix (NFLX) and other streaming options. CBS is the most-watched broadcast network by catering to an older audience that is most likely to watch traditional TV as opposed to Netflix or mobile viewing.A key person in any move to merge is CBS head Les Moonves, who in the past has been reluctant to combine the network with another entertainment entity.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: The 5 Biggest Ways The Disney-Fox Merger Could Affect YouThis Is Disney's 'Highest Priority' As Fox Deal Transforms Media SectorDisney-Fox Deal Negative For Netflix, Positive For Roku: Analyst

8,VIAB,"Amazon (AMZN), Verizon Communications (VZ) and a possibly reunited CBS (CBS)-Viacom (VIAB) are all in active talks to acquire Lionsgate (LGFA), according to a Deadline report Thursday.X The news comes amid a flurry of studio M&A news, most recently that Shari Redstone, whose National Amusements controls both CBS and Viacom, is reportedly looking to merge the two companies, which split over a decade ago.The Wall Street Journal said late Wednesday that she is moving to replace members of CBS' board of directors. While CBS chief Les Moonves has not been keen on the possibility of a CBS-Viacom reunion in recent years, Bloomberg is reporting that he is now open to the idea.The recent, swift changes to the media landscape may be changing minds at the studio level, as digital players such as Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon plow deeper into Hollywood, and Walt Disney (DIS) takes possession of 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) TV and film assets.Lionsgate's class A shares shot up 6.9% to 34.50 in the stock market today, hitting the highest level in more than two years.

9,VIAB,"Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger stressed Thursday that in addition to beefing up an already-vast library of TV and movies, the $66 billion deal to buy 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) entertainment assets provides the opportunity to expand globally and ramp up its direct-to-consumer streaming.X The deal includes 20th Century Fox's movie and TV studios, FX Networks, National Geographic, Fox's regional sports networks, Fox Networks Group International and Star India, as well as Fox's stakes in Hulu, Sky, Tata Sky and Endemol Shine Group.It comes as Disney plans to launch an ESPN streaming service in 2018, a Disney-branded family-friendly streaming service in 2019, and use Hulu as a more adult-oriented streaming service.""One of the most exciting aspects of our Fox acquisition is that it will allow us to greatly accelerate our direct-to-consumer strategy, enabling us to better serve consumers around the world,"" said Iger, who will be extending his contract from 2019 through 2021 as part of the agreement, on a Thursday conference call. ""As I've said before, we believe creating a direct-to-consumer relationship is vital to the future of our media businesses, and it's our highest priority.""The cord-cutting trend, i.e. people shedding their cable subscriptions, has broadly pushed media companies to offset cable subscriber losses with more streaming options. The Disney-branded streaming service will already have original content in the form of the powerful ""Star Wars"" brand, as well as Pixar and Disney Animation movies, positioning the platform as a formidable competitor to Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN).Now, Fox movies like ""Fantastic Four,"" ""Deadpool,"" and the ""X-Men"" series will round out Disney's Marvel properties, with major franchises such as ""Aliens"" and ""Planet of the Apes"" further padding out a rich trove of content.Disney will pay $52.4 billion in stock and assume $13.7 billion in debt under the deal, which works out to 0.2745 share for each Fox share, equal to $29.54 as of Disney's Wednesday close. The transaction is expected to close by June 30, 2018, and is seen providing at least $2 billion in cost synergies.If the transaction doesn't go through, Disney is on the hook for a $2.5 billion breakup fee.Shares of Disney were up 2.75% at 110.57 on the stock market today, after weeks of speculation that a deal was imminent. Fox surged 6.5% to 34.88. Comcast (CMCSA), which abandoned its own bid for Fox earlier this week, rose 1.4%, Viacom (VIAB) gained 0.6%, CBS (CBS) rallied 1.7%.Time Warner (TWX), which has a deal to be bought by AT&T (T), was off 0.4%. Netflix rose 0.9% and Amazon picked up 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: On the search for even more stocks with actionable trading opportunities? Check out our Stock Lists page, where you can find stocks near buy zones, stocks hitting new highs, sector leaders, tech leaders, IPO leaders and more. Iger told ABC's  ""Good Morning America"" Thursday that he doesn't expect to reach the ""scale of Netflix quickly,"" but sees being a top competitor.Some analysts are already bullish on the prospects, though.""We view this as a 'home run deal' for Disney and while it's an aggressive acquisition with a high price tag, in our opinion this is the right move at the right time as the marriage of these assets creates a much more formidable Disney on both the content and streaming front for the coming years with its primary goal to invade Netflix's 'golden streaming sandbox' when it launches its competitive service in 2019,"" wrote GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives on Thursday.The deal also brings Disney's stake in Hulu to 60%, up from 30%. Comcast's NBCUniversal owns another 30% and Time Warner has a 10% stake in the streaming platform. Having a controlling interest in Hulu will help make management of the company more clear and efficient, said Iger on the call.By supersizing its library of intellectual property and annexing more of Hulu, Disney may be able to more easily brush off concerns surrounding subscriber losses at its media networks unit, in particular at premium sports cable network ESPN, which relies on being part of the traditional cable bundle.Iger is a firm believer in ESPN's power as a sports media brand. Now he is pointing to plans to take it international.""The addition of Fox's global sports platforms, which include 22 regional sports networks here in the United States, as well as a rich portfolio of sports rights and properties in Europe, India and Latin America, nicely complements ESPN's existing business and creates exciting new avenues to grow this brand far beyond the United States,"" said Iger on the call.Fox will spin off Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network into a separately traded firm before the Disney takeover. Disney will lease the Fox studio lot in the Century City neighborhood of Los Angeles for seven years, as part of the deal, reported Variety, citing an insider who attended the Fox town hall meeting Thursday.It's unclear how regulators may judge the Disney-Fox deal. Even if antitrust officials approve the merger, they could still impose significant concessions. The Justice Department recently moved to fight the AT&T-Time Warner deal in court.Another key question that remains is who might be next in line to fill the shoes of Iger after he is done seeing through the integration of Fox's assets.On ""Good Morning America,"" Iger said Fox CEO James Murdoch will assist in the transition, with the two chiefs also discussing over the coming months ""whether there is a role for him or not at our company,"" according to CNBC.RELATED:The Fox Likes The Mouse Better Than Comcast: ReportDisney's Parks Chief Emerges As Contender To Succeed IgerComcast, Verizon Reportedly Eyeing 21st Century Fox Assets'We Can't Believe This Is Serious': Does A Disney-Fox Deal Make Sense?8 Key Facts: What Disney's Rogue Move Means For Netflix Subscribers

""Following the management changes that the Viacom Board put in place, we have been very impressed with the forward‐looking thinking and strategic plan being pursued under Bob Bakish's leadership.""In September, the Redstones proposed a merger. Last month, Redstone said she and her father never supported the Viacom-CBS split 10 years ago.CBS investors had been lukewarm about uniting the No. 1 TV broadcaster with a sagging cable operator focused on children, teens and young adults.CBS CEO Les Moonves wanted a Viacom merger only if got control over the Redstone family's voting shares, Bloomberg reported, citing sources.On Friday, 21st Century Fox (FOXA) announced a tentative deal to buy British broadcaster Sky.

14,VIAB,"Between Walt Disney (DIS) and NBCUniversal parent Comcast (CMCSA), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) would rather sell some of its assets to the Mouse, according to Bloomberg.X Sources told the outlet that Disney is a better strategic fit that likely comes with less regulatory red tape. That follows a late-Friday report from the Wall Street Journal that Disney and Fox were back at the table to discuss the possible acquisition of some of Fox's assets, namely its movie and TV studio, and certain international and cable properties.Amid the Fox-fueled rally Monday, shares of Disney jumped as high as 7% on the stock market today to 112.67, briefly clearing a 110.93 buy point from a double-bottom base that has lows in July and September. The stock closed up 4.7% to 110.22, not far below that entry. Fox shares rose 2.8% to 33.09.Comcast made a definitive jump above its longer-term 200-day line; Journal sources say the conglomerate is also in active talks with Fox. Fox, Disney and Comcast all own 30% of streaming network Hulu.Verizon Communications (VZ) also has been bandied about as a potential wooer of Fox assets.IBD'S TAKE: In the right conditions, the W-shaped double-bottom base in a bull market can translate to solid gains. Learn more about that particular base pattern here. The rally in media stocks extended to Viacom (VIAB), which closed the session up 2.75% and continued its ascent above the 50-day moving average. CBS (CBS) popped 5%, and Discovery Communications (DISCA) surged 7%.Some analysts expressed skepticism last month about reports of such a Disney-Fox union.

15,VIAB,"Walt Disney (DIS) media networks segment, which houses ESPN, is ""no longer the crown jewel"" of the company, says one analyst — and that's a good thing.XESPN's subscriber figures may get a lot of scrutiny as viewers shed traditional cable bundles in favor of streaming platforms like Netflix (NFLX) and Hulu, but analysts at RBC Capital say the ever-smaller contribution from the sports cable network plus Disney's shift to direct-to-consumer platforms makes the media conglomerate a ""top pick"" with ""clear strategic direction."" That marks an upgrade from the firm's previous outperform rating.""Cord cutting remains the biggest risk, but ESPN has dwindled to <20% of our target earnings and since it gets a lower multiple than non-media (Disney) businesses it's just 12% of our target (enterprise value),"" wrote RBC analyst Steven Cahall, who lowered his estimates but affirmed his belief that the stock is currently undervalued.Focus instead on Disney's blockbuster studio and theme parks segments, he essentially said. Both units have been solid performers in recent quarters.Cahall has, for a while now, advocated turning the traditional Disney narrative on its head, now that the once-indomitable ESPN appears to be wobbling slightly and Disney has proved its Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm acquisitions to be well worth the money.Hollywood may be a risky business, but Disney's film slate is ""in a league of its own"" when it comes to earnings generation.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.And the demand for company's theme parks and resorts is likely a good indicator of what kind of audience might be awaiting Disney's recently announced Disney-only streaming platform, noted Cahall, putting its total addressable market at half a billion to a billion homes.As such, RBC argues that Disney's direct-to-consumer plans and earnings from other segments mean that the company is ""the least media stock in the media sector at a time when investors are ever worried about ad and affiliate trends.""Nevertheless, Disney CEO Bob Iger last month warned that profit would be softer than expected this fiscal year, blaming Hurricane Irma's effect on Disney's Florida resorts, higher costs for NBA broadcast rights, the investment in BAMTech, and the lack of a major ""Star Wars"" movie release (""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" will be released at the start of fiscal 2018).Shares rose as high as 110.98 on the stock market today, but closed down 0.5% to 99.56.

17,VIAB,"Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger warned Thursday that profit will be weaker than expected this year and seemed to dash hopes that Netflix (NFLX) will retain Star Wars and Marvel content after the media conglomerate launches its own streaming service.XWhile speaking at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2017 Media, Communications & Entertainment Conference, Iger put earnings per share this year ""roughly in line"" with Disney's fiscal 2016 EPS, according to CNBC.That fiscal year, which ended in September 2016, saw EPS of $5.72, and the consensus for this year has it rising to $5.87, according to Zacks Investment Research.The weaker fiscal 2017 outlook implies Q4 EPS of $1.09, well below consensus views for $1.25. Iger blamed the expected effects of Hurricane Irma in Disney's Florida resorts, higher costs for NBA broadcast rights, the investment in BAMTech, and the lack of a major Star Wars movie release (""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" will be released at the start of fiscal 2018).Disney shares closed down 4.4% at 97.06 on the stock market today.

CBS fell initially but rose to fresh two-year highs by Friday.Yahoo (YHOO) shares tumbled on fears that Verizon will scrap its planned takeover of the ailing portal's core operations. Yahoo late Wednesday disclosed yet another massive hack attack. Charter Communications (CHTR) rose on buzz that Verizon might bid for the cable operator instead.RELATED:Viacom Pulls Plug On Possible CBS MergerVerizon M&A Talk Swirls; Charter Stock Up, Yahoo Down

22,VIAB,"Walt Disney (DIS) is in talks with other Hollywood studios about joining its Disney Movies Anywhere service, which lets people watch and store their online movie purchases at a single site, Bloomberg reported.Disney Movies Anywhere has movies from all its brands, including Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. Anywhere users can store and rewatch digital films whether they are bought at Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) iTunes, Alphabet (GOOGL) Google Play or Wal-Mart (WMT).It's a way for Disney to continue to generate revenue from movie after the theater run with DVD sales plunging in the era of Netflix (NFLX) and streaming media.But offering a one-stop digital film locker and library would be a lot more attractive with other major studios. Disney Movies Anywhere competes with a similar service, UltraViolet has films from Warner Bros. (Time Warner (TWX)), Universal Pictures (Comcast (CMCSA)), Sony (SNE), Paramount (Viacom (VIAB)) and 20th Century Fox (21st Century Fox (FOXA)), along with many other smaller players.To form a digital media locker agreement, Disney may have to agree to change its service's name, Bloomberg reported.Many of the same parent companies already are allied in streaming media via Hulu. Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox and Comcast each own 30% of Hulu, with Time Warner recently acquiring a 10% stake. Hulu, which like rivals Netflix and Amazon Prime Video is beefing up original content, plans to introduce live streaming TV in 2017.IBD'S TAKE: With ESPN subscribers falling, Disney is relying on its Star Wars and Marvel franchises more than ever.

29,VIAB,"Discovery Communications (DISCA) agreed to buy Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI) for $11.9 billion in a bet that uniting ownership of cable channels like Animal Planet and HGTV will help the company adapt to the changing television landscape.Discovery, one of billionaire John Malone's key holdings, will acquire Scripps for about $90 a share and assume long-term debt of $2.7 billion, bringing the total price of the equity value plus liabilities to $14.6 billion, according to a statement Monday. The price represents a 34% premium over Scripps' closing price of $67.02 on July 18, the day before news of the companies' talks became known.Discovery, based in Silver Spring, Maryland, is grappling with shrinking audiences at some U.S. channels — including the Discovery channel and Animal Planet — as consumers drop cable subscriptions and get more entertainment online from Netflix (NFLX) and others. The deal combines two companies that specialize in so-called unscripted programming, focused on real-life adventures, travel, wildlife and home. With Scripps, Discovery gets the home-improvement channel HGTV, where hits like ""Property Brothers"" and ""Fixer Upper"" have made it one of the more popular cable networks.The combined company will have almost 20% of the ad-supported pay-TV viewership in the U.S., according to the statement. Buying Scripps could also help Discovery boost its international sales, which currently account for half of its annual revenue. Knoxville, Tennessee-based Scripps owns an interest in Polish TV operator TVN and is expanding HGTV to new countries.""This agreement with Discovery presents an unmatched opportunity for Scripps to grow its leading lifestyle brands across the world and on new and emerging channels including short-form, direct-to-consumer and streaming platforms,"" Scripps Chief Executive Officer Kenneth W. Lowe said in the statement.Discovery's offer had forced Viacom (VIAB) to abandon its own efforts to acquire Scripps, people with direct knowledge of the matter said last week.Scripps rose 1.25% to 88 before the opening bell in the stock market today. Discovery Communications dipped 0.4% to 26.69.After being left out of some new online TV packages in the U.S., Discovery has been looking to create a low-cost web-only TV service with its cable channels and those of others for consumers who don't want to pay for sports, people with knowledge of the matter said in April. Neither Discovery or Scripps broadcasts live sports in the U.S.Though smaller, Scripps has an especially valuable asset in HGTV, which was the fourth-most watched U.S. network in prime time this year, with an average of 1.51 million viewers a night through July 16, according to Nielsen data. Parties to the Scripps Family Agreement control 92% of the voting stock.Deal talk is picking up in the TV industry as network owners grapple with the decline in cable and satellite services amid online competition. Liberty Media's Malone also has discussed a deal to buy all or part of Spanish-language broadcaster Univision Holdings, according to people familiar with the matter.Pay-TV distributors like Charter Communications (CHTR) and AT&T (T) have grown through acquisitions in recent years, giving them added leverage in fee negotiations with channel owners like Viacom, Discovery and Scripps. That's led some network owners to conclude they need to sell as well. Time Warner (TWX), owner of TNT and HBO, agreed last year to be bought by AT&T (T) for $85.4 billion.Cable and satellite-TV providers pay fees to channel owners for the right to carry their channels, and the negotiations have grown more tense now that more pay-TV subscribers are cutting the cord.Network owners are also beginning to offer their own online services to compete with Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned YouTube and Netflix. CBS (CBS) offers its flagship network and Showtime as standalone services online. Walt Disney (DIS), which owns ESPN, is developing an online service to reach sports fans who aren't using traditional cable.RELATED:Is Softbank Eyeing Charter Bid, Shotgun Marriage For Sprint?

30,VIAB,"Sumner Redstone's National Amusements is officially pushing for CBS (CBS) and Viacom (VIAB) to get back together, a decade after the two entertainment conglomerates split. But how that could happen remains a puzzle, leaving some investors wondering what to do with shares.Viacom said Thursday that it had received a letter from National Amusements asking the company to consider an all-stock merger with CBS. National Amusements, of which Redstone is the CEO and his daughter Shari Redstone is president, controls about 80% of both Viacom and CBS' voting shares.""This has been a source of enormous confusion among investors, based on our conversations, given the diverse outcomes that are possible,"" Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar wrote in a note Thursday.The general sentiment among Wall Street analysts is that Viacom and its struggling cable channels, which include Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, MTV, VH1 and BET, would benefit from a merger, but that CBS is doing just fine on its own, given the success of its stand-alone broadcast network, premium cable channel Showtime and other CBS-branded properties.Here are three stock scenarios for any CBS-Viacom merger that Barclays lay out:Barclays advocates having exposure to both CBS and Viacom.""We believe this not only provides a hedge against a take-under scenario for Viacom and a premium deal for CBS, it also allows a more attractive payoff ratio relative to a stake in either company,"" Venkateshwar wrote.CBS shares rose 0.8% to 54.57 in the stock market today, adding to the 4% spike Wednesday, when reports of a merger proposal emerged. Viacom shares rallied 3.3% to 37.77 Thursday, after rising 3.1% the day before.Shares of other media giants also little changed in late-afternoon action. Disney (DIS) fell 0.4% while Time Warner (TWX) edged up 0.1%. 21st Century Fox (FOXA) fell 1.1% and NBCUniversal parent Comcast (CMCSA) dipped 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Media conglomerates are searching for new ways to reel in young viewers, and virtual reality is an appealing medium. Read IBD's recent cover story for more: Disney, Comcast Pour Cash In Virtual Reality As The 'Netflix Of VR' Looms.Any CBS-Viacom deal would have to be attractive enough overcome the reluctance of CBS CEO Les Moonves, who just two weeks ago downplayed the idea of a merger at Bank of America Merrill Lynch's annual media conference.""Truth of the matter is that we are a stand-alone public company. We are really happy with the hand we are playing. We're doing extraordinarily well on our own with our own assets,"" he said, according to the Hollywood Reporter. ""We're never going to do something that is bad for CBS shareholders or employees. We're not in active discussions for anything like that.""The two companies' different approaches to distribution and channel concentration depth are behind CBS' reluctance to make a deal, wrote Stifel analyst Benjamin Mogil on Sept. 6.""Further concerning CBS is not only the number of cable channels which need to be supported in carriage discussions but the eroding ratings at the core channels and programming underinvestment that continues to be a headwind for ratings growth,"" he said.Mogil also asserts that ""one of the major stumbling blocks for CBS"" in a merger scenario would be doing a deal that includes Paramount Pictures, Viacom's ailing studio arm. A partial sale of Paramount might make CBS view a combination more favorably.RELATED:Netflix 'Star Trek' Deal Helps CBS Chief Les Moonves Sleep At Night Twitter Stock Reverses Up As Disney Reportedly Weighs Bid

31,VIAB,"The media industry is ""likely one more deal away from potentially reshaping the landscape for at least a decade,"" said Barclays analysts in a lengthy dissection of the entertainment and telecom sectors following confirmation of the $85.4 billion merger of AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX).But there are a number of other scenarios in play, especially with CBS (CBS) and Viacom (VIAB) being forcefully nudged toward merger talks by Sumner Redstone's National Amusements, and even reports of Disney (DIS) potentially being interested in Netflix (NFLX).Could the latter be the landscape-changing deal?The House of Mouse, which owns ABC, ESPN, Marvel, Lucasfilm and has an investment in streamer BAMTech, is missing a key direct-to-consumer business, in Barclays' view, and its streaming efforts aren't coming soon enough to help offset ESPN's subscriber-loss issues.Streaming heavyweight Netflix would significantly bolster Disney's distribution and technological capabilities, Barclays said.But such a combination is unlikely, according to media reports. And comments from Disney CEO Bob Iger about the complementary, supplemental nature of an online ESPN-branded channel point to the conglomerate wanting to keep its premium cable network a sports destination and a valued cable-bundle component.""We have no misconceptions about how disruptive the deal could be to the Disney culture given a potentially toxic mix of Hollywood and technology mindsets having to coexist,"" said Barclays. ""However, we believe if there was ever a time to take this risk, it would probably be now given that technology players are for the first time outlining a real vision around video instead of the small scale experiments thus far. ""It added that such a merger would be ""a defining moment for the media industry,"" bringing together the top media company and the original streaming disrupter and potentially ""reshaping the industry for decades into the future.""Shares of Disney closed up 0.4% at 93.37 on the stock market today, falling just short of their 50-day after and hitting resistance at that key level of support for a second straight session. Netflix dipped 0.1%, after jumping 3.4% Friday, when news of the AT&T-Time Warner deal broke.IBD'S TAKE: Is Netflix still a tech company or a media company? The answer to that question may affect any price tag for Netflix as the two sectors converge.But a Disney-Netflix deal isn't the only move that would reshape the industry.Barclays sees a not-too-distant future, five to seven years in the making, in which three or four vertically integrated media conglomerates fight for share among themselves and online competitors.""With Comcast (CMCSA) getting into wireless and AT&T getting into content, Comcast's and AT&T's business models may become indistinguishable in the coming years, especially if 5G makes fixed wireless video delivery a real possibility,"" said Barclays.""We believe Charter (CHTR) and Verizon (VZ) are the other two companies that have the opportunity to reach this end state given their scales in wireline and wireless, respectively.""RELATED:Consumer Groups Knock AT&T-Time Warner MergerHow Aggressive AT&T Has Out-Maneuvered Verizon, ComcastNBCUniversal Doubles BuzzFeed Bet As Old Media Seeks New GrowthNetflix Countersues, Slams 21st Century Fox 'Involuntary Servitude'Disney, Salesforce Didn't Bid On Twitter Because Of 'Haters'

32,VIAB,"AT&T (T) has reached a deal to acquire Time Warner (TWX) for $107.50 a share, with an equity value of $85.4 billion, the two companies announced Saturday evening. But the merger faces major regulatory and political hurdles.The equal parts cash-and-stock acquisition, worth $108.7 billion including assumed debt, brings the parent company of HBO, CNN and Warner Bro. Studios under the umbrella of the telecommunications giant.""Premium content always wins. It has been true on the big screen, the TV screen and now it's proving true on the mobile screen,"" AT&T CEO and Chairman Randall Stephenson said in a statement. ""We'll have the world's best premium content with the networks to deliver it to every screen.""The big merger is not the first in recent memory for AT&T, which acquired satellite provider DirecTV last year for nearly $50 billion.Nor is it an unusual trend: Comcast (CMCSA) fully acquired NBCUniversal three years ago, and Verizon Communications (VZ) -Yahoo (YHOO) deal is currently in the works. Sumner Redstone's National Amusements is pushing CBS (CBS) and Viacom (VIAB) to reunite.Even Apple (AAPL) reportedly approached Time Warner about a merger several months ago, said the Wall Street Journal.IBD'S TAKE: As internet giants such Alphabet's Google add video content and launch services, AT&T and others are being pushed to gain more content.Time Warner turned down an $85-per-share offer from 21st Century Fox (FOXA) two years ago.But in a stump speech on Saturday, Donald Trump opposed the AT&T-Time Warner merger, saying that if he wins the White House, the deal will not be approved. ""Deals like this destroy democracy,"" the Republican nominee said, who vowed to go after the media ""power structure"" that he claims is opposing his presidential run.Whoever is in the White House, antitrust regulators likely would take a long look at the deal, with approval not certain.A combined AT&T-Time Warner would have a market cap around $300 billion. That's roughly equal to Comcast ($154 billion) and Walt Disney (DIS) ($150 billion) together.Separately, AT&T announced third-quarter results, ahead of Tuesday's scheduled release. AT&T earned 74 cents a share excluding various items, flat vs. a year earlier and meeting analyst estimates. Revenue, including DirecTV, climbed 4.6% to $40.9 billion, slightly below views.AT&T added 212,000 monthly wireless customers, slightly better than some forecasts.DirecTV added 323,000 customers, while AT&T added a net 171,000 broadband subscribers.AT&T said it's on track to meet or beat full-year targets. It also raised its quarterly dividend by a penny to 49 cents a share.It'll hold a webcast on Monday morning to discuss the Time Warner deal and its Q3 earnings.Shares of Time Warner closed up 7.8% on Friday to 89.48. AT&T shares fell 3% to 37.49. After Friday's close, Time Warner rose to about 93 and AT&T fell slightly further on reports that a deal could come this weekend.RELATED:Trump Expands Lead Over Clinton To 2 Points – IBD/TIPP PollNetflix: Still A Hot Tech Play Or A Media Stock That Acts Like Tech?

33,VIAB,"Netflix's (NFLX) whopping $6 billion content budget for 2017 may resemble a young tech company's strategy for growth before profit.But its Hollywood spending spree — like a reported $120 million budget for ""The Get Down"" and a $40 million price tag for two Chris Rock specials — has trained a glaring soundstage Klieg light on what could be Netflix's emerging identity crisis.""This is just idiotic,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told Investor's Business Daily. ""What's the replay-ability of Chris Rock? I mean, he's funny, but come on. I think Netflix's spending is out of control. I think they're doing really dumb things, like a four-picture deal with Adam Sandler.""Netflix's stock is nearing its record high, but concerns over costs — and plans for 1,000 hours of original content next fiscal year — are prompting a new question: Should investors still view the company as a tech disrupter shaking up Big Media, or has its seduction by Hollywood left it unable to still act like a nimble tech startup?The distinction between being considered a tech vs. a media stock isn't just a philosophical one. As the media and tech sectors converge, it may affect any takeover price for Netflix, and there's been chatter it could become a target for Walt Disney (DIS). While the pairing has been seen as unlikely, reports that AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX) are near a megamerger lifted shares of Netflix (3.3%), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) (2.2%), CBS (CBS) (2.1%) and Viacom (VIAB) (2.7%) as well as Time Warner's (7.8%) on the stock market today.Categorizing Netflix as a media stock vs. a tech stock would also prompt Wall Street to view its financials with a different lens.Tech hotshots can shell out big bucks, and investors hardly blink. Facebook's (FB) $2 billion acquisition of Oculus in 2014 knocked down shares for a bit, but even then analysts appeared to go easy on the Mark Zuckerberg-helmed Silicon Valley darling as they looked far into the future.Netflix has gotten ""a lot of free passes"" over the last few years, said Tim Nollen, a Macquarie media analyst.""I think internet companies are given a lot of credit for just growing viewership figures, or in this case subscriber numbers, without much regards to the cost,"" he said, adding that ""the cost is viewed as the driver of those subscriber figures, and 'We'll worry about earnings later on,' seems to be the attitude.""Not so with media companies, whose near-term and longer-term earnings figures get more scrutiny.""Costs are a major, major element here,"" said Nollen.Netflix's budget is already bigger than comparable ones at most entertainment conglomerates. The streaming company is expected to spend $4.93 billion on content this year, outdoing nonsports cable and broadcast programming expenses at Time Warner ($4.89 billion), Disney ($4.5 billion) and Viacom ($3.7 billion), according to MoffettNathanson's estimates.Indeed, Netflix's free-spending ways have caused friction with the incumbent companies by outbidding them for coveted new shows and films or often pushing up the price tags on deals they do secure.But rather than a tech company like Apple (AAPL), whose iTunes store helped transform the music industry, Silicon Valley-based Netflix has pointed to a media superstar when signaling its aspirations: Content Chief Ted Sarandos memorably told GQ three years ago that the company's goal was to ""become HBO faster than HBO can become us.""Wedbush's Pachter points out that HBO owns its originals, unlike Netflix, which could only count summer hit ""Stranger Things"" as a completely in-house effort during its conference call. And to label Netflix a media company like Disney, he said, would be ""unflattering to Disney.""But it was licensed shows like ""Orange Is The New Black"" and ""House of Cards"" that put Netflix on Hollywood's map, figuratively and literally. The company is leasing the 14-story, 323,000-square-foot Icon tower and several stages at Sunset Bronson Studios in Los Angeles.Now, like an actor-turned-director, Netflix appears to be yearning for more creative control, and is increasing investments in original programming.The step up from licensing other people's content to creating its own is a ""natural progression"" from its early days of being a content-licensing pure-play, said BTIG Research analyst Rich Greenfield.In his view, however, Netflix ""doesn't want just to be HBO; it wants to be HBO, FX, Nickelodeon, ABC, CBS."" (Time Warner owns HBO, 21st Century Fox owns FX, Viacom owns Nickelodeon and Disney owns ABC).But that evolution arguably nudges Netflix into the more traditional territory of being a hit-driven business, which is a risky business.""That helps when it's good,"" said Nollen. ""But all studios go through winning and losing streaks. And they could have high expectations for a show that maybe doesn't work so well and doesn't attract subscribers, and they're definitely exposing themselves to more of that.""In the near term, Netflix's growth-first strategy could be tested as Amazon (AMZN), the original tech disrupter that keeps disrupting new sectors, ramps up its video offerings and threatens to do to Netflix what it has done to Big Media.Like Netflix, Amazon spends aggressively to grow in new markets. Unlike Netflix, Amazon has pockets that are even deeper than those of the media conglomerates that dominate Hollywood. Netflix's projected 2016 revenue is $8.8 billion, while Amazon's is $136.8 billion.And Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said in July that the company is ""nearly doubling"" its content spend in the second half of 2016 vs. the latter half of last year. (It spent $1.3 billion on content in 2014.)Netflix's current share price ""fails to address the potential for meaningful competition from Amazon"" and its paid Amazon Prime Video-only offering, even if Netflix currently has the stronger brand as a subscription video-on-demand service, said Pachter in a recent note.""(W)e are confident that with its new stand-alone service, Amazon declared war on Netflix,"" he wrote.Meanwhile, investors largely overlooked Netflix's ""unacceptably high"" negative $1.5 billion in projected 2016 free cash flow, he added.For now, Netflix's stock looks to continue taking investors on a wild ride, especially around earnings season. The last three quarterly reports sent the stock soaring 19%, diving 13% and plunging 13% the following day.""I think we can all see that it's time for me to apologize for the volatility again,"" said Netflix CEO Reed Hastings in response to an analyst question during the earnings call. ""This time it's in a good direction. But I think more and more investors are able to look at the multiyear picture and they see the patterns emerging, and so then it will be less and less about our guidance.""That doesn't bother BTIG's Greenfield: ""The reality is, as the world shifts to (internet protocol) television, the legacy TV industry isn't equipped to meet the changing landscape and Netflix is taking advantage of that.""RELATED: Is Netflix Back On The Road To Prosperity, Or A Trail Of Tears?

The S&P 500 fell 0.1% in September but rose 3.3% for the third quarter. The Nasdaq advanced 1.9% in September and 9.7% for Q3.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said it would cap output at 32.5 million-33 million barrels per day, essentially giving up a two-year effort to drive out U.S. shale production. But the cartel won't enact those cuts until November when full details -- and individual production quotas -- are likely to be firmed up at an official OPEC meeting. In August OPEC's production was 33.2 million barrels a day. The Energy Information Administration said U.S. inventories fell by 1.88 million barrels vs. the 2.8 million-barrel increase analysts expected, falling for a fourth straight week.

At the 67th annual International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, Musk also said he hopes to complete a developmental spaceship in four years. While SpaceX isn't publicly traded, the event comes as Musk tries to rally support for Tesla's acquisition bid for sister company SolarCity (SCTY), and critics could see the Mars plan as another distraction for Tesla, which is already surrounded by doubts about its ambitious car production targets.September's Consumer Confidence Index rose to its best level since August 2007, before the last recession started. The U.S. economy rose at an upwardly revised 1.4% annual rate in Q2, still weak but helped by a less-negative reading on business investment in structures. August durable goods orders were flat, with core capital goods orders edging higher. New-home sales fell sharply in August, but less than expected after hitting a cycle high in July.

39,VIAB,"X Maybe honesty isn't always the best policy? Walt Disney (DIS) Chief Executive Bob Iger slogged through an array of ESPN-related questions on late Tuesday's earnings call after the sports cable giant logged another quarter of subscriber declines. His bullish reaffirmations hearkened back to calls of earnings past, after he first disclosed in August 2015 that ESPN had sustained subscriber losses.""Give us a little bit of credit for being very candid with you on an earnings call two summers ago,"" he told analysts, asserting that ""we had our eyes wide open"" about ESPN's issues, which allowed the company to deal with them head-on.Disney shares fell in late trade after ending Tuesday's regular session up 0.6% to 112.07 on the stock market today.Overall, Disney turned in a mixed quarter, falling short of second-quarter revenue forecasts late Tuesday with 3% growth to $13.34 billion. Profit of $1.50 per share marked a 10% year-over-year gain, ahead of estimates for 4% EPS growth.The entertainment heavyweight's media networks revenue, which includes both broadcast and cable TV, rose 3%, while operating income fell 3%. Programming costs also weighed on ESPN; cable networks' operating income fell 3%. The Disney Channels and Freeform, which appeal to children, teens and young adults, also lost subscribers during that period.Iger has his eyes on the future, as more people get their sports scores and highlights from mobile devices.While ""there's nothing we can really do to slow that down,"" he said it's important for the network to participate in the new wave of technology. That's translated to development of ESPN's apps, its upcoming streaming platform powered by BAMTech and the network's presence on over-the-top ""skinny"" bundles, which Iger says benefit from the inclusion of ESPN.""They've concluded that launching without ESPN is very challenged,"" he said on the call, adding, however, that despite ""really nice growth,"" subscriber growth on streaming platforms has not made up for traditional cable-package subscriber losses.ESPN found itself in the headlines late last month when it laid off around 100 on-air personalities, another reminder of the troubles facing the traditional pay TV landscape.""We're not sitting on our hands,"" said Iger.Disney's TV woes aside, Iger predictably lauded the studio's many box office successes, calling attention to ""Rogue One"" and ""Beauty and the Beast,"" each of which have brought in at least $1 billion globally.Still, theatrical results were only ""comparable"" to the prior-year quarter due to the strength of ""The Force Awakens"" and ""Zootopia"" in 2016, according to the earnings release. Studio revenue dipped 1%, while operating income grew 21%.The theme parks segment logged the greatest revenue growth, up 9%. Operating income grew 20%, thanks to higher attendance and more spending on food and drink.Lastly, revenue at Disney's consumer products and interactive media unit dropped 11%, as strong ""Frozen"" and ""Star Wars"" sales last year provided tough comparisons. Operating income grew 3%.Up until last week, shares had been on a fairly steady upward march, making their way back up to 2015 highs. But Disney tumbled last week, falling below a buy point and its 50-day moving average.That was part of a broader media stock sell-off, spurred by sector jitters about ad revenue and subscriber losses following quarterly results from Viacom (VIAB), Time Warner (TWX) and others, plus the introduction of Hulu's live-TV beta service. (Disney is a joint owner of Hulu.)Broadly, investors appear to remain nervous about the power of cord-cutting and the state of the traditional pay TV system.During the session, Viacom fell 0.5%, while Time Warner sank 0.3%. 21st Century Fox (FOXA), which will report earnings on Wednesday, dipped 0.6%.Discovery Communications' (DISCA) results Tuesday revealed a ""slight decline"" in subscribers in its U.S. networks segment. Discovery shares retreated 2.2%.RELATED:Disney Earnings Preview: Movie Magic Vs. TV Static
"
40,VIAB,"Ahead of its earnings report, Walt Disney's (DIS) quarterly story remains something of a split personality, as its studio segment boasts more hits but its media networks unit — notably ESPN — encounters obstacles.Questions over its recent talent bloodletting at the sports cable network will now likely add to by-now-routine scrutiny over its subscriber figures when the media conglomerate reports after the close Tuesday.For Disney's fiscal second quarter, Street analysts are looking for profit and revenue growth of 4% to $1.41 a share and $13.45 billion, respectively.Late last month, ESPN laid off about 100 of its on-air talent, as network chief John Skipper said that the network navigates ""changes in technology and fan behavior."" Subscriber loss concerns continue to dog the network.A shift in viewership habits and the proliferation of online platforms have, over the years, hit media companies where it hurts: paid subscriptions and advertising revenue.Last week, HBO and Warner Bros. parent Time Warner (TWX) reported a decline in advertising revenue at its Turner network, while Viacom (VIAB) shares dove, despite a beat, amid concerns that its flagships channels were losing ground in distribution.Notably, ""three of four biggest weekly sell-offs in media in the last decade have happened in the last three years, which shows the degree of uncertainty that has crept into the sector,"" wrote Barclays media analyst Kannan Venkateshwar.Additionally: Hulu, of which Disney is a joint owner, launched on Wednesday a live-TV beta service that promises around 50 channels for $39.99 a month, adding to the fray of over-the-top ""skinny"" bundle providers that includes Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue.21st Century Fox (FOXA), Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal and Time Warner also have stakes in Hulu.Disney shares fell 0.5% to 111.42 on Monday, still below a 112.09 buy point after undercutting that level last week. Viacom slipped 1.1% after diving 13.5% last week. Fox dropped 2.5% Monday, on top of its 4.6% weekly loss.IBD's TAKE: It's not all doom and gloom for media companies in the subscriber wars. There's one — perhaps surprising — media company that is still adding accounts while others bleed subscriptions.Disney's media networks unit makes up the bulk of total revenue — over 42% in the December-ended quarter — which is why ESPN alone receives so much attention. And the strength of the legacy sports news brand may not carry as much weight in the future.""In every evolution of OTT, the number of clicks needs to get to a program guide or a network viewing option is actually increasing,"" said Venkateshwar in his broad note on U.S. media. ""Given the importance of consumer inertia in usage patterns, this is not a trivial shift.""The interface of streaming platforms also means that coverage is divvied up by content and not by network, he added.""Instead, the default interface is organized by sport and/or teams... . As a result, it is tough to see the brands of individual networks retaining any value in the coming years,"" wrote Venkateshwar.But Disney still has some tricks up its sleeve.ESPN and BAMTech are slated to launch a direct-to-consumer sports streaming service ""probably"" this calendar year, said CEO Bob Iger in the company's most recent earnings call, though it is designed to be a supplement — and not a replacement — to the main ESPN network. Disney has a one-third stake in streaming technology firm BAMTech.And massive hits for Disney's studio segment as well as optimistic projections for its movie pipeline, which is packed with ""Star Wars,"" Marvel and Pixar films, have some analysts staying bullish.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" has so far earned over $427.6 million globally, debuting domestically this past weekend with a $145 million haul, according to Box Office Mojo. And Disney's March release of ""Beauty and the Beast"" remains the U.S. box office leader in 2017 with $487.6 million domestically, for a total of $1.19 billion worldwide.""We continue to be buyers of Disney as we believe the robust film slate will continue to broaden the company's moat and drive significant value across key segments,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers on Sunday. He has an overweight rating on the stock.RELATED:Viacom Tries To Calm Fears Its Channels Are Losing DistributionBig Media Stocks Unfazed Even As Hollywood Came To Brink Of StoppageIf You Think Netflix, Amazon Disrupted Hollywood, You'll Love Snap, FacebookESPN On-Air-Talent Layoffs Double What Was Expected

49,VIAB,"Shares of Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Zillow (Z) United Natural Foods (UNFI), FedEx (FDX), Viacom (VIAB) and Hawaiian Airlines (HA) are moving after hours Monday. Here's why:Alexion Pharmaceuticals sank 11% following disappointing results from a Phase 3 trial involving its drug Soliris. The company said the primary endpoint of a study examining Soliris’ use for patients with a rare neuromuscular disorder “missed statistical significance.”The study was for patients with refractory generalized myasthenia gravis, a disorder that causes people to have “profound muscle weakness throughout the body,” the company said.Alexion said it continues to examine the data from the study and would present detailed results on July 7 during the 14th International Congress on Neuromuscular Diseases in Toronto, according to a company statement.Zillow said it has settled a lawsuit brought by News Corp.

50,VIAB,"Netflix (NFLX) stock tumbled on Tuesday, a day after the Internet TV network posted mixed first-quarter results and gave disappointing guidance for the current quarter.Netflix shares were down 11%, below 97, in early afternoon trading on the stock market today. The stock fell below its 50-day moving average, a key technical support level.Late Monday, Netflix posted Q1 earnings per share that beat forecasts, but came up short on revenue.It earned six cents a share, up 20% year over year, on sales of $1.958 billion, up 24%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were looking for three cents EPS on sales of $1.965 billion.For the second quarter, Netflix is targeting earnings per share of two cents. It did not give a revenue estimate. Wall Street had been modeling Netflix to earn five cents a share, down 17%, on sales of $2.117 billion, up 29%.IBD Take: Netflix has often been a highly rated stock, though now its ratings are mixed.The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company gained 6.74 million total streaming subscribers worldwide in Q1, topping its guidance for 6.1 million. It added 2.23 million streaming subscribers in the U.S. and 4.51 million in foreign markets. It ended the quarter with 81.5 million subscribers worldwide.What follows are five key takeaways from Netflix’s Q1 report.Netflix expects to add 2.5 million new subscribers in Q2, its seasonally weakest quarter. That would be its lowest new subscriber total in two years, even though Netflix has since rolled out its service worldwide, excluding China.Netflix projects that it will add 500,000 streaming subscribers in the U.S. and 2 million in international markets in Q2.Netflix faces increased subscriber churn in the U.S. as many longtime customers see a $2 increase in their monthly fee to $9.99 a month, starting next month. Over the last two years as Netflix adjusted its pricing, it grandfathered existing customers at the earlier rates.Meanwhile, Netflix's international subscriber forecast for Q2 faces tough comparisons to the year-earlier quarter, when the company launched in Australia and New Zealand.On a conference call with analysts to discuss Q1 earnings late Monday, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said that the company plans to roll out price increases over the rest of the year to those U.S. customers given generous grace periods.Currently, more than half of Netflix’s U.S. subscribers pay only $7.99 or $8.99 for the company’s most popular plan, now priced at $9.99 a month. The plan provides HD video streams to two devices at a time.Netflix ended Q1 with nearly 47 million U.S. streaming subscribers.“We will phase out this grandfathering gradually over the remainder of 2016, with our longest-tenured members getting the longest benefit,” the company said in a statement. “We are rolling this out slowly over the year, rather than mostly in May, so we can learn as we go.”Well-heeled, better-educated consumers fueled Netflix's early growth in overseas markets. The streaming video leader first grabbed the low-hanging fruit: consumers who enjoy English-language content and have international credit cards.Getting the next group of consumers to subscribe will take more work, the company said. Netflix needs to add more content in local languages and new payment options, Hastings said.“Over the next couple of years, as we further localize, we’ll be able to see more opportunity,” Hasting said.Netflix will premiere its first French original series, “Marseille,” a political drama starring Gerard Depardieu, globally on May 5, and a new Japanese original series, “Hibana,” globally in June.Netflix also is working on “3%” in Brazil, “Suburra” in Italy, “Dark” in Germany, an as-yet-untitled period series in Spain, a second season of “Club de Cuervos” from Mexico and another Mexican original series starring Kate del Castillo called “Ingobernable.” Plus, it is producing a Japanese anime series, “Perfect Bones.”Netflix executives on Monday's conference call said that they had no interest in bidding on several movie studios reportedly in play, including Viacom (VIAB) subsidiary Paramount and Starz (STRZA).“It’s been 15 years we’ve been public and 20 years existing, and we’ve done no M&A,” Hastings said. “So I think that probably speaks for itself.”Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said Netflix is building its own production capabilities.Netflix has been successful growing its content production organically, so it doesn’t make sense to “juice it with M&A,” Hastings said.Netflix is considering allowing customers in some markets with poor Internet infrastructure to download shows and movies for offline viewing.“We’ve been so focused on click-and-watch and the beauty and simplicity of streaming,” Hastings said. “But as we expand around the world, where we see an uneven set of networks, it’s something we should keep an open mind about.”But Netflix executives scoffed at the idea of offering live sports. They also said that virtual reality programming was not something the company is considering.VR for the consumer market likely will be focused on video game experiences for the foreseeable future, Hastings said.At least 10 analysts cut their price targets on Netflix stock in response to the company’s Q1 report.Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein lowered his price target on Netflix to 123 from 140 but reiterated his outperform rating on the stock.The company’s second-quarter guidance suggests slower-than-expected international subscriber growth, Helfstein said.“The magnitude of the global launch in Q1 (to 130 new countries) makes a hyperlocal content strategy impractical in the short term,” he said in a report. “As such, it appears near-term momentum will slow as Netflix decides which countries to focus on.”Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak cut his price target to 145 from 155 but kept his buy rating.Netflix’s Q2 international guidance was well below expectations, he said. Wall Street analysts on average were looking for 2.8 million new international subscribers, vs. the 2 million that Netflix forecast.“We had frankly anticipated more pent-up demand in these international markets (even with an initially less appealing focus on English-language programming and international payments), and now it appears that in these new markets Netflix will need to first invest in new localized content/improved payment mechanisms to accelerate growth, which will take time,” Wlodarczak said in a report.FBR analyst Barton Crockett raised his price target to 104 from 100 and maintained his market perform rating. But he called the company’s international subscriber guidance “jarring.”

51,VIAB,"Sumner Redstone won his fight to be rid of a former girlfriend, as a Los Angeles probate judge threw out her lawsuit alleging the 92-year-old media billionaire was mentally incompetent.The ruling ends the case on the second day of a trial but may not avoid a further public airing of the infighting among the Redstone family, some of his former girlfriends, and the nurses who take care of the former Viacom (VIAB) and CBS (CBS) chairman. Within minutes of Monday’s ruling, Redstone’s former lover sued Redstone’s daughter Shari, her two sons and members of his household staff over claims they interfered with her expected inheritance.The trial opened Friday with Redstone’s videotaped testimony in which he used expletives to describe his ex-girlfriend, Manuela Herzer, and said he wanted her out of his life. While the recording confirmed Redstone was in frail health and required help speaking, his wish for Herzer to have no role in his health care decisions was clear.“Redstone’s testimony has ultimately defeated her case,” Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Cowan said Monday in his ruling. “Though Herzer may have believed that Redstone would not be able to say anything, or be able to understand the questions, he did both.”Cowan said there were no legal grounds for him “not to follow his stated wishes.”Herzer made her next step in the fight clear with her new lawsuit in Los Angeles state court. Sumner Redstone cut Herzer out of his will last year when he also removed her as his health care agent, the person to make decisions for him when he is no longer able. Herzer seeks at least $70 million in her lawsuit.The abrupt end of the trial lessens the chance that trustees of Redstone’s estate will step in for the time being. He owns majority voting rights through National Amusements Inc. and, were he declared incompetent by the judge, that could have set in motion a chain of events that would shift control of that company to seven trustees, among them Shari Redstone and Viacom Chief Executive Officer Philippe Dauman.“Ms. Herzer bet wrong when she assumed that Mr. Redstone’s difficulty communicating would result in her reinstatement in his life and fortune,” Robert N. Klieger, one of Redstone’s lawyers, said in a statement.Redstone will seek to recover money that he lavished on Herzer and another ex-girlfriend, Klieger said. “Mr. Redstone is looking forward to liberating the $150 million in ‘gifts’ to Ms. Herzer and her friend,” he said.Pierce O’Donnell, Herzer’s lawyer, said he will appeal Monday’s decision.Herzer filed a petition in November to have Redstone declared incompetent and have her reinstated as his health care proxy. Redstone’s lawyers accused her of being more concerned about being removed from his will, which would have left her $50 million and his Los Angeles mansion in the Beverly Park neighborhood valued at $20 million.Herzer, who describes herself as Redstone’s longtime friend, companion and caretaker, had lived with him since April 2013, together with then-girlfriend Sydney Holland. Herzer dated Redstone from 1999 to 2001, according to her petition. Redstone’s mental health declined rapidly after he broke off with Holland in August, according to Herzer.Trial witnesses would have included Dauman, who was named Redstone’s health care agent in October, and Shari Redstone, with whom the media mogul has had a rocky relationship. This year, she replaced Dauman as her father’s health care agent.Herzer claimed Redstone was being manipulated by the people around him when he kicked her out and that he had become a prisoner in his own home. She said Redstone had become a “living ghost.”Shari Redstone countered that her father’s health has improved since Herzer was out of his life. Keryn Redstone, the daughter of Redstone’s estranged son Brent, joined in the case to support Herzer, arguing that the “tempestuous and difficult” relationship between her grandfather and her aunt necessitated that he be put under court protection.“I am grateful to the court for putting an end to this long ordeal‎,” Shari Redstone said in a statement. “I am so happy for my father that he can now live his life in peace, surrounded by his friends and family.""

52,VIAB,"Disney (DIS) is helping fund digital publishing platform Playbuzz, just months after Disney put another $200 million into millennial-focused outlet Vice Media.New York-based Playbuzz said Thursday that it had raised $15 million in new funding led by Saban Ventures, an affiliate of the investment firm Saban Capital Group, which specializes in entertainment, media and communications.Playbuzz, which has existing partnerships with Mashable, USA Today, Viacom’s (VIAB) MTV and thousands of other digital publishers, offers slideshows, quizzes and other Internet-friendly content. The platform says that it has more than a billion users across its network and is accessed by more than 200 countries and territories in more than 40 languages.Saban and Disney mostly contributed the $15 million, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing sources familiar with the matter.The move comes as traditional media outlets fight to compete with quick online reads and entertainment companies contend with the likes of Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN). Such viewer trends have drawn scrutiny to Disney and others as investors and analysts keep a close eye on paid subscription figures.Comcast’s (CMCSA) NBCUniversal has previously invested in Re/code parent Vox Media and popular news and entertainment site BuzzFeed.Disney shares closed up 0.4%.

54,VIAB,"Even as media stocks short-circuit this week as subscribers trickle from cable to Netflix (NFLX), one company that many wrote off as a relic of Saturday mornings and Monday nights in prior decades has actually added paid subscribers.That would be World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which years ago launched a thousand elbow drops from recliners in kids' living rooms and just as many arguments over the campus-lounge TV between ""Monday Night Raw"" fans and, well, everyone else.However, WWE stock fell 4.8% to close at 19.79 on the stock market today, dropping along with other media stocks. The stock is above its 200-day moving average after undercutting that key level intraday.WWE on Thursday said its first-quarter earnings per share fell 55% to 8 cents, missing estimates for 10 cents. Revenue rose 10% to $188.4 million, beating expectations for $183.71 million.But WWE also said that the WWE Network, its online streaming service, averaged 1.49 million paid subscribers in the first quarter, a 16% jump from a year ago and slightly above the company's outlook for 1.48 million.WWE had faced concerns that it no longer had iconic stars.WWE also raised the low end of its second-quarter forecast range of average paid subscribers to ""at least"" 1.63 million, based on the viewers following WrestleMania 33, which took place in Orlando and was broadcast on April 2.The results indicate that a strategy that raised concerns among many in the financial world was starting to work.WWE launched the streaming service a little more than three years ago and now offers a free month's worth of programming upon signing up. WrestleMania 33 — the event during which many of the previous months' storylines reach their denouements — was also offered for free.At WrestleMania 33, the Undertaker retired after nearly 30 years with WWE. Donald Trump, who a decade ago helped shave CEO Vince McMahon's head in the ring, is in the WWE Hall of Fame.The company said WrestleMania made up nearly 30% of all ""social TV interactions"" on April 2, more than the season finale of AMC's ""The Walking Dead,"" the Country Music Awards or Major League Baseball's opening day, which aired on Disney's (DIS) ESPN, which has been struggling to retain its huge subscriber base.WWE Network costs $9.99 a month. Management has said that around 1.3 million to 1.4 million subscribers would need to sign on for it to break even, Bloomberg noted last month.UBS, in a research note on Thursday, said that pay TV net subscriber additions had missed expectations by around 400,000. That note also said Turner Broadcasting indicated that ""the national TV ad market softened up into 2017.""Pay TV subscriber declines ""appear to have accelerated markedly"" in Q1, the note said, possibly due in part to recent price hikes on traditional services.RELATED:Media Giants Dive On Ad Woes; Hulu Debuts Live-TV Service

56,VIAB,"Despite a major earnings topper, Viacom (VIAB) stock fell as much as 11% Thursday amid concerns that its flagship channels are losing ground in distribution.The MTV parent's chief executive said Viacom properties that appear on Charter Communications (CHTR) are now only on the cable giant's priciest cable-bundle tier, but Bob Bakish assured analysts that it was ""not a broad re-tiering,"" according to Bloomberg.Viacom shares ended the trading day down 7.7% to 37.85 on the stock market today, recovering from a low of 35.20 but extending the stock's two-day dive, which was sparked Wednesday by Time Warner's (TWX) soft subscriber numbers and advertising revenue.The HBO parent, which is being bought by AT&T (T), dipped 0.8% to 98.30 Thursday. Disney (DIS) ticked down 0.6% to 111.17 after losing 2.4% Wednesday, undercutting its 50-day line and a buy point. CBS (CBS), which reports late today, rose 0.6% to 63.85 after dropping 3.35% yesterday, and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) added 0.6% to 29.04 after tumbling 5.1%.Viacom's flagship channels, which also include Comedy Central, Spike, VH1, BET and Nickelodeon, aren't found on too many skinny bundles either, as online players rush to build out over-the-top package services.Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue stopped carrying Viacom-owned channels last November, because it was ""the best way for us to continue to offer the most compelling value to our fans."" Hulu's newly announced live-TV bundle does not include Viacom's stations in its 50 or so available channels.Comedy Central is part of the core packages on Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV, but MTV and Spike cost an extra $5 a month.For the quarter, Viacom's adjusted diluted earnings grew 4% to 79 cents a share, crushing views for 59 cents. Revenue growth of 8.5%, to $3.26 billion, exceeded estimates for $3.02 billion, on strength in Viacom's filmed-entertainment and media-networks segments.Media-networks revenue rose 1%, including a 2% decline in domestic revenue and a 11% bump in international revenue.Viacom' s filmed-entertainment segment, which includes Paramount Pictures, drew in $895 million, above estimates, as ""xXx: Return of Xander Cage"" helped the studio nearly double its theatrical revenue abroad.RELATED:Dow's Disney Is Breaching This Key Level Before Earnings Next Week: Warning Sign?Media Giants Dive On Ad Woes; Hulu Debuts Live-TV ServiceBig Media Stocks Unfazed Even As Hollywood Came To Brink Of Stoppage

62,VIAB,"X Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA), CBS (CBS), Viacom (VIAB), Comcast (CMCSA) and other big companies sold off on cable advertising concerns. Meanwhile, Hulu, the streaming platform jointly backed by four major media conglomerates, has officially entered the live-television fray with a more-than-50-channel bundle, priced at $39.99 a month.Time Warner (TWX) said Wednesday that advertising revenue fell 2% in the first quarter vs. a year earlier, with declines continuing the quarter. Comcast said last week that its NBCUniversal ad revenue fell in Q1. Pay-TV operators suffered big subscriber losses in Q1 as well.CBS tumbled 3.35% on the stock market today. Disney lost 2.4%, dropping below a buy point and its 50-day moving average. Viacom reversed sharply to sink 7.5%, below its 200-day line. Fox sold off 5.1%. Comcast sank 2%, closing just below a buy point cleared after reporting earnings. Dish Network (DISH) fell 4.4% and Charter Communications (CHTR) 3.9%, both undercutting their 50-day lines. Time Warner, which is being acquired by AT&T (T), dipped 0.3%. AT&T slid 1.4% to a five-month low.Meanwhile, Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins announced the live-TV service's beta launch at its annual upfronts presentation Wednesday, calling it a ""natural extension of our business.""Disney, Fox, Comcast's NBCUniversal and Time Warner all have a stake in Hulu, which explains its fairly comprehensive channel offerings, such as ABC, NBC, Fox, E!, Bravo, USA, TBS, CNN and CNBC. The service also includes access to the platform's streaming library.Live sports stations are also part of the basket. The live service includes NBC Sports, CBS Sports Network, Fox Sports channels, TNT and a number of different ESPN stations.Like rival products from Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue and Dish Network's Sling TV, Hulu's package isn't all-encompassing, although it does include CBS (CBS), which has been building out its own over-the-top streaming presence through CBS All Access.As Vulture points out, the Hulu bundle lacks AMC Networks (AMCX) channels and Viacom-owned MTV, Comedy Central and VH1.For comparison, Vue's comparably priced $39.99-a-month Access tier, the most basic of four levels, offers around 45 channels. (Its high-end $74.99-a-month Ultra level includes 90 channels, including HBO and Showtime.) Sling's $25 monthly Blue-level subscription includes 45 channels but no CBS or ESPN.Hulu's service includes 50 hours of recorded storage, but 200 more hours in ""enhanced cloud DVR"" will run subscribers an extra $14.99 a month. Vue offers unlimited cloud DVR storage for 28 days. YouTube TV, from Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, has launched a $35-a-month service in several major cities with no cloud storage limits either.Both CBS and Viacom report quarterly results Thursday.

63,VIAB,"It's business as usual on Wall Street, with big media stocks unfazed Tuesday, but writers and studios narrowly came to a contract agreement in the wee hours, preventing a major work stoppage in Hollywood that would've impacted the industry that Walt Disney (DIS), CBS (CBS) and others call home.Both sides came to a truce shortly after midnight, when the current contract expired, reported Variety.According to a statement posted on the Writers Guild of America site, negotiators were ""pleased to report that we have reached a tentative agreement with the AMPTP that we can recommend for ratification.""Disney shares dipped 0.3% in the stock market today. CBS sank 1.5%. 21st Century Fox (FOXA) rose 0.1%. Viacom (VIAB) fell 0.3%.Among the gains were health plan contributions ""that should ensure its solvency for years to come,"" and job protection for parental leave, it said. Pay-TV residuals were bumped up by 15% and options and exclusivity protections were expanded.The agreement, according to the memo, also help put to bed an issue spurred by the trend toward shorter seasons, such as those favored by Netflix (NFLX): now, episodic fees are worth 2.4 weeks of work, and overtime must be paid. A key TV writers' complaint going into the talks was that shorter seasons translated to less pay for the same amount of work, since Guild members are paid per episode.The last strike, which lasted 100 days in 2007 through early 2008, punished the industry to the tune of $2.1 billion, according to the Milken Institute.This time around, the addition of Netflix and Amazon (AMZN) to the mix means that a work stoppage could have accelerated a shift to digital platforms, said Barclays analysts last month.""While Netflix and Amazon's pipelines are also likely to be affected by the writers' strike, their library of original content could realize much wider viewership in the absence of competition from legacy TV,"" wrote Barclays analysts Ross Sandler and Kannan Venkateshwar on April 12. ""These companies also have the ability to source content globally, as evidenced by the number of British shows on Netflix.""Netflix edged up 0.&% while Amazon dipped 0.1% after both surged to record highs on Monday.Moody's said Monday that a strike would have weighed on media companies that need studio content to survive.""Most at risk if there is a protracted strike would be movie theater companies, followed by broadcast television networks and premium pay-TV channels, especially companies that are highly leveraged or weakly positioned relative to their existing credit ratings,"" said Moody's Senior Vice President Neil Begley in a Monday note.""Least at risk would be major studios and broadcasters that are well-diversified and have relatively strong balance sheets.""RELATED:Who Is Most At Risk If Hollywood's Writers Strike Tuesday?Why Netflix, Facebook, Amazon Could Flourish If Hollywood's Writers Strike

64,VIAB,"Watching a movie in 10-second snippets over the course of five days might sound maddening.But the 110 million cumulative views on Snapchat for teen thriller ""Sickhouse"" say otherwise. The numbers reinforce views that an audience exists for narrative content on nontraditional sites. And they suggest entertainment industry competition will continue to ratchet higher, with social media competing directly with television and streaming platforms for viewers.XWriters are poised to go on strike as they duke it out with studios over the sweeping changes to the industry wrought by Netflix (NFLX), Hulu and Amazon (AMZN) Video. But the next frontier already is at the door, thanks to moves by Snap's (SNAP) Snapchat and perhaps, soon enough, Facebook (FB).For now, traditional Hollywood studios are eager to team up with streaming video newcomers in a bid for coveted Gen Z and millennial viewers.""The team at Snap is thinking about mobile TV differently than anyone else in this space,"" said Barry Poznick, president of Unscripted Television MGM, in a March announcement on a partnership between MGM Television and Snap.The shared goal is to develop and produce ""TV-like mobile video content"" for Snapchat's Discover feature. ""We are excited to create content for their vast and hard-to-reach audience that consumes entertainment in a very specific fashion,"" Poznick added.The uniquely formatted ""Sickhouse"" — essentially ""Blair Witch Project"" for the internet age — was shot on just two Apple (AAPL) iPhones and rolled out in nearly 500 successive Snaps last year through the account of popular Snapchatter Andrea Russett. It wasn't a production backed by Snap, but has been billed broadly as the messaging app's first full-length movie.Indigenous Media produced the project and has since repackaged it in a standard format. COO Jake Avnet is more than pleased with the release of the full version of ""Sickhouse,"" which has been fleshed out to 68 minutes. A sequel is in the works.He won't say how much the first film has made so far, but it has ""performed well on virtually every platform (on which) it's been made available."" The film is available on AT&T (T)-backed Fullscreen and can be purchased for $5.99 on iTunes, Vimeo and Amazon Video.""We've been happy to see there's been a very healthy, sort of, second life to the film beyond that first Snapchat window,"" he said.The indie flick was no doubt unconventional in production, format and distribution. But as Twitter bloomed with discussion over whether Andrea Russett's increasingly creepy Snapchat activity was real or staged, the five-day social media debate perhaps indicates that young people's attention spans aren't gnatlike after at all, if the content is juicy enough to follow.""Sickhouse"" director Hannah Macpherson should know. She also writes and directs ""[email protected],"" an AwesomenessTV-produced series available through Verizon Communications' (VZ) Go90 app. A ""modern-day thriller that explores the terrifying risks of social media in a world of anonymity,"" the show's second season is about to begin.""That's a show that streams on teenagers' phones,"" she told Investor's Business Daily. ""So I'm very familiar that that's how teenagers are watching a lot of content. They're not watching just two-minute YouTube clips. They're watching 10 hours of 'House of Cards' on their cellphones.""Not surprisingly, traditional entertainment giants like Disney (DIS) and Viacom (VIAB) see an opportunity. Comcast (CMCSA) unit NBCUniversal even invested $500 million in Snap's initial public offering.As they scramble to be where younger eyeballs are, they've put their content on Snapchat, which features videos from ESPN, Comedy Central and the Wall Street Journal. Offerings also include ABC's ""Watch Party: The Bachelor,"" BBC's ""Planet Earth II"" and original shorts from NBC's ""Saturday Night Live.""Snap's fresh slate of programming has a decidedly ""Real World""-era MTV feel to it. There's A&E's ""Second Chance"" (exes meet to dissect their broken relationships) and the soon-to-debut Vice Media's ""Hungry Hearts with Action Bronson"" (the rapper/chef plays matchmaker).Then there's Snap's in-house production, ""Good Luck America,"" which is in its second season and attempts to make politics accessible for its viewers, Rock the Vote-style.Other social media heavyweights have their own plans in motion. Twitter (TWTR), for its part, has so far kept its video focus on sports and news. On top of partnerships with CBS (CBS) News, Bloomberg, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association and others, the company intends to stream 1,500 hours of e-sports on the platform this year.Facebook's TV guide is fuzzier, as the social networking giant builds out a video hub for all kinds of viewable content.It has begun funding ""seed video content"" that includes ""original and licensed scripted, unscripted and sports content that takes advantage of mobile and the social interaction unique to Facebook,"" the company's head of global creative strategy, Ricky Van Veen, told Recode in December.No specific show announcements have been made, but the Silicon Valley giant sounds like it's headed to Hollywood.In February, reports surfaced that Facebook had poached MTV's head of scripted development to become its head of development for original programming. Not long after that, Wall Street Journal sources said the company was looking for up-to-30-minute ""TV-like"" originals that focus on science, pop culture, sports and more — a far cry from the site's typical user-generated Facebook Live videos or short viral clips. Recent Facebook job listings also point to its desire to develop media and entertainment liaisons in Los Angeles.Long term, whether studios and networks benefit from partnering with social media outlets ""remains to be seen,"" said Morningstar tech analyst Ali Mogharabi.In Snapchat's case, content created for its nonstandard portrait-mode style renders it unusable on TV or even other online counterparts.""I think in the short to medium term, some of those (companies) will realize that this may not have been a worthy investment,"" he said.But it might also be a necessary evil, given the sway Snapchat, Facebook and Twitter have, and the chance that they could lure more talent away from the entertainment industry. Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton, an early Snap investor, announced in January that he would step down from the media conglomerate to focus on being Snap's chairman full-time.""Facebook's got a lot of money and a lot of pulse on the core millennial class,"" Magid Advisors President Mike Vorhaus told Investor's Business Daily. ""Snapchat's cool and edgy and all video all the time, and it's got a special kind of brand that you could've compared to brands like MTV 30, 40 years ago. So people are going to take a call from Snapchat, right? Joss Whedon gets a phone call (from) Snapchat — he's gonna take that.""For social media networks, whose users generate a seemingly endless stream of free video content every day, there's the inevitable question of risk. Why take on the unwieldy task of funding and creating original programming? Everyone knows entertainment is a hit-or-miss industry, so why not beef up those video libraries by licensing other people's shows?""We think (Facebook is) basically trying to expand its ecosystem, which they're hoping (will) keep users in the net ecosystem for a longer time,"" Morningstar's Mogharabi said. ""If they're successful at doing that, then they could attract some more ad dollars.""Snap, on the other hand, is ""pretty much doing the same thing for different reasons,"" he said. ""These guys actually need to build user base to begin with.""At this early stage, Mogharabi doesn't see Netflix-style ambitions in Snap's and Facebook's futures. But assuming that user growth and engagement follow, he says, Snap will be looking to rake in advertisers' money.A recent episode of E!'s ""The Rundown,"" which totaled fewer than 20 Snaps, included three ads for ""Fast and the Furious"" sequel ""The Fate of the Furious,"" which was slated to come out in theaters later that week.That could present a worry to entertainment executives courting advertising sales.Twitter recently announced plans to present for the first time at the Digital Content Newfronts in May. (The ""newfronts"" are an online-media counterpart to traditional upfronts, where media buyers make their ad-space purchases.) Without divulging much else, the company said it ""will showcase new original content offerings and live programming to brands and agencies entering the 2017 upfront season.""And last fall, eMarketer estimated that digital ad spending for 2016 would overtake TV ad spending for the first time. Its projections show a widening gap between digital and TV ad spending as the years go on.It's worth keeping in mind, however, that digital advertising growth ""hasn't necessarily come at a cost to TV ad budget,"" said Morningstar's Mogharabi.""TV ad dollars are still growing, of course at a much slower rate, but that's been the case for a while,"" he said. ""It's not necessarily that every percentage growth that you see in digital ad dollars is actually coming from television.  ...  It's not a so-called binary case.""That may give Hollywood — with its legacy entourage of agents, producers, directors and development execs — some comfort.And yet, while the big media companies aren't likely to quake in the face of Mark Zuckerberg's video tab or a few Venice Beach young guns with an app, they know better than to brush off competition from peculiar places.After all, with Amazon Studios' lauded ""Manchester by the Sea,"" the same e-commerce company that sells Echos, diapers and books online now carries the sheen of the Academy Awards. (The film, which was nominated for Best Picture, landed a statuette for Original Screenplay; star Casey Affleck notched a win in the lead-actor category.)""I think (network execs) kind of get it in a way that they might not have gotten it four years ago or six years ago, depending on who you were talking about,"" Vorhaus said.""So it's not, like, all of a sudden they're going to go, 'Oh my God, Snap and Facebook, they're surprising us just like — you know, some of us would admit — Netflix surprised us.' So I don't think the surprise is big. I think they get the frenemy concept.""

65,VIAB,"Hoping to attract cable TV cord-cutters and cord-nevers, Sony (SNE) on Monday took its Internet-based PlayStation Vue service nationwide.Sony launched its live and on-demand TV service in March 2015 in test markets, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Francisco and Miami.PlayStation Vue offers “skinny TV” bundles of channels starting at $29.99 a month, with no long-term contracts or hidden fees. It competes with a similar online service from Dish Network (DISH) called Sling TV.PlayStation Vue boasts that it offers the most popular channels, including AMC, CNN, Discovery, Disney and ESPN.However, content from ABC, FOX (FOX) and NBC is available for now only as on-demand content in Vue’s Slim multichannel plans. Most on-demand content will be available within 24 hours after broadcast. CBS (CBS) programming will be added later, Sony said in a press release.Sony Network Entertainment International (SNEI) said that it is working to add live local broadcast stations across all networks.Vue offers three service plans. Access Slim has over 55 channels and costs $29.99 a month; Core Slim has over 70 channels for $34.99 a month; and Elite Slim has over 100 channels for $44.99 a month.The Vue service is accessible through Sony’s PlayStation 3 and 4 game consoles, Amazon.com (AMZN) Fire TV and Fire TV Stick, as well as the Apple (AAPL) iPad and iPhone with the Vue mobile app.“Since launching a year ago, our priority with PlayStation Vue has been to secure the best TV content for our audience and make it available to consumers nationwide; today, we’re delivering on that promise,” Eric Lempel, senior vice president of marketing and head of SNEI’s PlayStation Network Americas, said in a statement. “PlayStation Vue has been an ambitious project from the start, and national expansion demonstrates our ability to innovate in an industry that’s overdue for a reinvented experience.""Thanks to the strong network relationships we’ve forged and technology we’ve built, consumers nationwide can enjoy a better way to watch TV.”Sony PlayStation Vue has program deals with AMC Networks (AMCX), CBS, Discovery Communications (DISCA), Disney (DIS)/ABC Television Group, ESPN, Fox, NBCUniversal, Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI), Turner Broadcasting and Viacom (VIAB).Vue also offers customers a cloud-based DVR, which allows users to store thousands of hours of content with conflict-free recording.

66,VIAB,"Viacom (VIAB) said it is exploring the sale of a ""significant strategic"" minority stake in its film studio, Paramount Pictures, after possible investors expressed interest. But who might those future partners be?""We have received indications of interest from potential partners seeking a strategic investment in Paramount Pictures and I have decided to pursue discussions with a select group of potential investors,"" said Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman in a Tuesday statement. He announced the news at the Jefferies Media & Communications Conference in New York City.Viacom shares were briefly halted and rose as high as 39.45 intraday, but in closed up just 0.4% at 37.01 on the stock market today.Dauman, who recently took the reins from Sumner Redstone as executive chairman, said in the company's Feb. 9 earnings release that 2015 was a ""challenging year"" as Viacom redesigned itself and adapted to ""significant industry disruption."" Revenue missed estimates, though earnings matched views. Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN), among other over-the-top services, have been shaking up entertainment consumption for several years now.Don't expect the new interest in an equity stake to come from anyone else in Hollywood, says one analyst.""We would expect minority partners to likely be from China, given that country's global box office ambitions and possibly as well as from India (Reliance),"" said wrote Stifel analyst Benjamin Mogil. ""We would not expect any domestic or European suitors.""Such a development would be favorable, he said, ""given that Paramount, from a replacement value, could be worth north of $10 (billion), in our view, compared to the current Viacom enterprise value of $28 (billion).""Other traditional media companies, including Walt Disney (DIS), Time Warner (TWX), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and others, have had to adapt to the modern viewer. Uncertainty in the industry has weighed on media stocks.Netflix fell 3.1% and Amazon 1.2%.

67,VIAB,"Walt Disney’s (DIS) first-quarter results trounced expectations as “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” boosted the studio and consumer products segments, though the media and entertainment giant continued to lose subscribers for its cable channels.But Disney CEO Robert Iger said Tuesday that ESPN, which lost 7 million subscribers in the last two years, has “actually seen an uptick” in subscribers in recent months, and has benefited from the growth of light cable packages, particularly from Dish (DISH).In what amounted to a vigorous defense of ESPN during a conference call, Iger said skinny bundles with the sports cable channel had even wooed cord cutters back. The idea that ESPN is cratering is “ridiculous,” he said. “Sports is too popular.”Disney shares fell 3% late.Iger also clarified the reason behind ESPN’s subscriber decline, blaming faulty Nielsen figures. Once Nielsen corrected those numbers, “we concluded that our sub loss was largely due to the fact that ESPN was not part of skinny bundles that had launched,” he said.He said Disney is exploring “new platform providers,” hinting at more over-the-top, or streaming, options for ESPN.Revenue from Disney’s media networks division, which includes ESPN, grew 8% in fiscal Q1. The segment logged higher ad revenue, offset by lower ratings. Higher programming costs weighed on the sports cable channel, due to the timing of the College Football Playoff bowl games, but that was partially offset by an increase in ad and affiliate revenue, said the company.""Affiliate revenue growth was due to contractual rate increases, partially offset by a decline in subscribers and unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts,"" Disney said in a statement.The hubbub over ESPN comes amid industry-wide concerns that cable viewers are taking their dollars elsewhere — namely, to Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) Prime and other over-the-top streaming services.During the quarter, adjusted earnings climbed 28% to $1.63 a share, well above views for $1.45 per share. Revenue grew 14% to $15.24 billion vs. consensus estimates for $14.75 billion.“Driven by the phenomenal success of ‘Star Wars,’ we delivered the highest quarterly earnings in the history of our company, marking our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth,” said Iger in a statement.“The Force Awakens” crossed the $2 billion threshold in global box office sales over the weekend. Studio revenue skyrocketed 46%, year over year.Disney’s theme park and resorts segment revenue rose 9%, said the company. Consumer products and interactive media revenue rose 8%.Earlier Tuesday, Viacom (VIAB) shares tanked 21.5% after the media company logged its fourth consecutive quarter of revenue declines and Q1 revenue fell short of expectations.Earnings fell 8.5% to $1.18, in line with consensus estimates, as sales fell 6% to $3.15 billion, below analysts’ forecasts for $3.26 billion.Viacom's filmed entertainment revenue tumbled 15% on theatrical and home-entertainment revenue declines. Media-networks revenue fell 3% as domestic ad revenue dropped 4% and ratings declined.

Oil drillers and services companies, and office supplies retailers posted Monday's worst declines.Key players in the Nasdaq's reversal were medical software maker Cerner (CERN) and biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN).Cerner jumped 3% in strong trade, giving the stock some breathing room above its 10-week line as it climbs the right side of a seven-month consolidation. Regeneron swung up 3% in above-average trade, although shares remain in a long-term consolidation.By the end of the day, Viacom (VIAB) was leading the Nasdaq 100, up 3% in average volume.

It hit a record high of 148.29 on Thursday.""Netflix has greatly accelerated the change in TV consumer behavior,"" Gould said in a report. ""However, as much as we admire the company's strategy and execution, we feel the stock is appropriately valued at close to $150 per share based on our sum-of-the-parts analysis.""Gould also initiated coverage of six other media stocks. He gave buy ratings to CBS (CBS) and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGFA). He rated Walt Disney (DIS), Twenty-First Century Fox (FOX), Time Warner (TWX) and Viacom (VIAB) as neutral.He set a price target of 80 on CBS and 32 on Lions Gate.CBS added 0.5% to 69.20, and Lions Gate was down a fraction to 26.31.As for Netflix, Gould sees the company exceeding 240 million global subscribers by 2025, resulting in more than $40 billion in revenue and $12 in earnings per share.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix is one of four closely watched internet stocks that make up the FANG group. The others are Facebook, Amazon.com and Google-parent Alphabet. For the latest news on the group, visit IBD's FANG stocks page.Netflix ended 2016 with 93.8 million streaming subscribers worldwide. It earned 43 cents a share on revenue of $8.83 billion for the year.""Netflix is building a content moat and amortizing it over a global direct-to-consumer audience,"" Gould said. ""It has the largest global subscriber base allowing it to be the lowest-cost provider on a per-subscriber basis. Furthermore, it has minimal distribution costs, and as Netflix produces more of its own content it becomes the producer, distributor and retailer allowing it to maximize profit.""He projects that Netflix will be spending $15 billion a year on content in five years and $25 billion annually in 10 years.RELATED:Netflix Gets Caution Flag Ahead Of First-Quarter EarningsWill Video Kill The iPhone Star?

76,VIAB,"Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) are transforming Hollywood with apparent clarity about what they want: original content, a solid library and paying viewers.But does Big Media, rooted in almost-quaint traditions like upfronts and Nielsen ratings, know how to fight back in this brave new world of cord cutting? Or will the entertainment industry's center of gravity shift permanently to Silicon Valley?The threat of over-the-top (OTT) streaming services keeps raising the stakes for the incumbents, whose varied responses face a daunting task. Channels once deemed impervious are now bleeding subscribers, advertising dollars are getting plowed into digital media, and the disruptors are piling up awards.The trends are once again expected to be scrutinized as media giants report quarterly results in the coming week.Millennials and teens largely consider televisions to be old-school technology. Most 18- to 34-year-olds prefer watching shows on a laptop or mobile device, not a TV, according to a Magid Advisors poll.Major networks have followed young eyeballs over to the web. A hodgepodge of streaming services are available to viewers, ranging from multi-network Hulu to NBC's new comedy-centric outlet, SeeSo.More than 30 new OTT services were introduced in 2015 alone, said research firm SNL Kagan, which tracks over 100 such offerings. The overwhelming number of options might make it seem like traditional media outlets are having a hard time refining their strategies.""I don’t think they’re hyper-focused; I don’t think they’re being sloppy,"" SNL Kagan analyst Ali Choukeir told Investor's Business Daily.But at the same time, there are so many different kinds of online streaming choices out there that it's ""like spinning plates,"" he added. ""There’s just a lot going on.""NBCUniversal parent Comcast (CMCSA) has Stream for Internet-only customers. Walt Disney (DIS) launched OTT services abroad. Viacom (VIAB) introduced Noggin for kids.TBS and CNN parent Time Warner (TWX) allows users to watch its content from any device. It also offers premium cable network HBO in two streaming forms, HBO Now and HBO Go, the former being a standalone service available to non-cable subscribers.Time Warner is also said to be in talks to acquire a 25% equity stake in Hulu, the online streamer jointly owned by 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Disney and Comcast's NBCUniversal.Wall Street is increasingly paying attention to the paid subscription service with Big Media backing. Once dismissed as ""Clown Co.,"" Hulu is now nothing to laugh at.The service has emerged as a viable OTT competitor to Netflix, Amazon and others, wrote Jefferies analyst John Janedis in a note to clients, highlighting its investment in content and new $11.99 ad-free subscription tier.""We think Hulu is 'the OTT service to watch in 2016,'"" he wrote last month, ""as the impact of these changes starts to unfold, not only to the extent that it may slow Netflix’s subscriber growth, but also if the value proposition accelerates cord cutting of traditional linear television.""Hulu has only 9 million subscribers to Netflix's nearly 45 million video customers in the U.S. (and over 75 million subscribers worldwide). But its growth rate outpaces that of Netflix and its broadcast parentage affords a unique feature: the ability to offer shows that have just aired on linear TV.""With all these guys, especially Netflix and Amazon, they’ve all got original content,"" said Choukeir. ""Original content is a differentiator for sure, but with Hulu, next-day (content) is a further differentiator.""Potential investor Time Warner reportedly is not a fan of the feature, but Choukeir said he doesn't see the core of Hulu's business changing.If Time Warner comes on board, that'll leave CBS (CBS) as the only major network not on the service.But it may be happy to be left alone as it focuses on its streaming service CBS All Access, which offers both a live CBS feed and previously aired content, and mulls a possible streaming subscription service for the CW network, which it co-owns with Time Warner's Warner Bros.So how are Hulu, HBO and the rest of the field faring against digital pure plays?There are no clear winners or losers just yet, said SNL Kagan's Choukeir.""There’s still a lot to be learned,"" he said. ""There’s a lot of experimentation going on.""Strategies may also evolve as media giants find their footing online. Netflix is a double-edged sword for them: Licensing revenue they receive is an appealing source of cash, but giving Netflix access to content is essentially feeding the competition.Time Warner and Fox executives have in recent months raised concerns about the issue, with Fox CEO James Murdoch reportedly saying the company might license more of its programming to Hulu instead.Advertising dollars are at risk, as marketers take their money to digital platforms at the expense of TV. Cowen & Co. believes that ""digital is likely to take several hundred basis points of ad share away from national TV in 2016 and 2017.""Additionally, one area that has long been considered a pay-TV stronghold -- live sports -- faces uncertainty. Disney's longtime moneymaker, ESPN, lost 7 million subscribers between 2013-15, bringing its total to 92 million as of late last year.Concern over subscriber losses and cord-cutting prompted a media meltdown last August. Cowen analyst Doug Creutz noted that media stocks should get ""a bit of a reprieve"" in the first half of 2016 as ad trends have improved, cord-cutting doesn't appear to be accelerating, and the group is trading at a discount to the market.But he also said the major media names ""remain difficult as longer-term investments.""When it comes to online efforts, it may simply be a matter of kicking back on the sofa and watching which streaming subscription services find fame and fortune -- and which get voted off the island.""It’s tough to forecast when we’re going to see a shakeout, because the marketplace is very saturated."" said Choukeir. ""But at the same time, there are a lot of services out there catering to audiences who are buying their content.""
"
77,VIAB,"Thanks to Netflix, Twitter and a seemingly bottomless well of material to rehash, the movie business has fundamentally transformed into a go-big-or-go-home arena — and chances are, it won't ever change back.
"
78,VIAB,"Out of the 691 titles released theatrically last year, just two brought in over 10% of domestic grosses, and they weren't based on new material, but on sequels to a 23-year-old dinosaur adventure and a space epic from the late '70s.
"
79,VIAB,"""Between 'Jurassic World' and 'Star Wars' alone, in 2015, they made over $1.2 billion,"" said Rentrak (RENT) box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian. ""You're talking about two movies making over a billion. Two.""
"
80,VIAB,"The lopsided box-office takes for ""Jurassic World"" and ""Star Wars"" were not for lack of new releases. The major studios, including Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Viacom's (VIAB) Paramount, Comcast's (CMCSA) Universal and Time Warner's (TWX) Warner Bros., collectively put out 86 movies last year, up 16% from 2014's 74 releases, according to Exhibitor Relations data.
"
81,VIAB,"And 2015 proved to be a banner year in film: Ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada climbed 7.4% to hit a record $11.1 billion.
"
82,VIAB,"But not all movies are created equal. The top-20 grossing movies carried 50% of last year's box office, up from 41% in 2014 and 42% in 2013, as Hollywood shifts its development strategy.
"
83,VIAB,"""You're sort of seeing a bifurcation of what studios are really looking to invest in,"" Morningstar analyst Neil Macker told IBD.
"
84,VIAB,"Studios are migrating to a ""barbell strategy,"" he said, developing more high-budget, blockbuster-type movies, as well as more lower-budget films that don't require crushed box-office records to prove profitable. That means mid-budget movies — often rom-coms and talky dramas — get left by the wayside.
"
85,VIAB,"This is partly a reflection of viewer trends. The average moviegoer has become more discriminating, said Stifel analyst Benjamin Mogil, as online streaming-video options like Netflix (NFLX) or Apple (AAPL) iTunes movie rentals gain steam.
"
86,VIAB,"Also not helping movies is the ""explosion of prestige drama"" on TV, as Macker puts it, from networks like Time Warner's HBO, Fox's FX, Netflix and Amazon (AMZN) Video.
"
87,VIAB,"""That's where a lot of the (screen)writers are going and a lot of the viewers are going also,"" he said.
"
88,VIAB,"So when consumers do plan on a Friday night at the movies, they want the ""full theatrical experience,"" Mogil told IBD. And surround sound and big screens merit explosions, special effects and pop culture fanfare.
"
89,VIAB,"Last year ""clearly marked one where dramas and comedies, along with many kids films and horror, had challenges,"" he wrote separately in a Jan. 3 note.
"
90,VIAB,"""While ticket prices have largely remained in check of late, the increased proliferation/ease of (video on demand) and (subscription video on demand) have made the theater-going experience one which outperforms for the major event titles but has difficulty for middle-of-the-road fare.""
"
91,VIAB,"Even Apple Flops In Theaters
"
92,VIAB,"That might explain why ""Steve Jobs,"" the biopic on the Apple co-founder, took in less than $18 million, despite being penned by Aaron Sorkin and starring heavy hitters like Kate Winslet and Michael Fassbender.
"
93,VIAB,"Meanwhile, 2015 box office winner ""The Force Awakens"" has raked in more money than all eight Oscar-nominated best picture contenders combined, both domestically and abroad.
"
94,VIAB,"Action-heavy spectacles appear to translate across cultures better than other films. Universal's ""Furious 7"" — the seventh installment of ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise — is the No. 6 grossing film of all time, according to Box Office Mojo.
"
95,VIAB,"But that's not to say that simply making any old blockbuster or sequel will do. Plenty have bombed. ""Fantastic Four,"" which had a reported $120 million production budget, brought in only $56.1 million domestically last year.
"
96,VIAB,"The Twitter Effect
"
97,VIAB,"This broad shift in cinema trends has contributed to a repetitive theatrical cycle of ""Groundhog Day"" proportions, with more franchise-based blockbusters, more people watching those blockbusters, and more studios making blockbusters because that appears to be what's working.
"
98,VIAB,"Only two of the top-grossing 2015 releases were originals: Disney Pixar's ""Inside Out"" and Twentieth Century Fox's ""The Martian.""
"
99,VIAB,"""Hollywood has always had the attitude of: If something succeeds, do it again and again and again until people get sick of it,"" said Exhibitor Relations analyst Karie Bible.
"
100,VIAB,"Online chatter can also add to the snowball effect that nudges people toward already-popular tentpole titles instead of smaller critical darlings, widening the chasm between blockbusters and average performers, as well as shrinking the margin of error for studios.
"
101,VIAB,"""Often when studios try to get very creative or original ... the audience just stays away,"" Dergarabedian said. ""It just depends on the movie and the buzz. All the marketing dollars in the world can't change the social media sentiment, and that's the thing the studios can't control.""
"
102,VIAB,"Mogil echoed the idea that the Twitter (TWTR)-verse has sway as a collective culture influencer.
"
103,VIAB,"""Because of social media, people know really quickly if it's a good movie or not,"" he said.
"
104,VIAB,"In 2016, more sequels and reboots are expected to lead the box office again. Stifel predicts that March's release of ""Batman v. Superman"" and December's ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" will each make about $400 million apiece. ""The Force Awakens,"" which came out in mid-December, is expected to deliver another $300 million this year for Disney.
"
105,VIAB,"'Fast and the Furious 27'?
"
106,VIAB,"If viewers' habits line up with all of Stifel's top-10 predictions, that will mean that all but one film — Disney's new animated princess, ""Moana"" — will be spinoffs or sequels to existing properties, such as ""Harry Potter,"" ""Star Trek,"" ""Independence Day"" and ""Alice in Wonderland.""
"
107,VIAB,"Will moviegoers ever weary of superhero sequels and epic franchises?
"
108,VIAB,"""It's a tougher question because you need a bunch of sequels to bomb out before you decide not to make them,"" said Mogil. ""And if they work abroad, you're still going to be making them. There will always be breakout hits from (intellectual property) that are brand new. (But) for the foreseeable future, (the industry will) go with stuff that works and stuff that's known.""Thanks to Netflix, Twitter and a seemingly bottomless well of material to rehash, the movie business has fundamentally transformed into a go-big-or-go-home arena — and chances are, it won't ever change back.Out of the 691 titles released theatrically last year, just two brought in over 10% of domestic grosses, and they weren't based on new material, but on sequels to a 23-year-old dinosaur adventure and a space epic from the late '70s.""Between 'Jurassic World' and 'Star Wars' alone, in 2015, they made over $1.2 billion,"" said Rentrak (RENT) box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian. ""You're talking about two movies making over a billion. Two.""The lopsided box-office takes for ""Jurassic World"" and ""Star Wars"" were not for lack of new releases. The major studios, including Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Viacom's (VIAB) Paramount, Comcast's (CMCSA) Universal and Time Warner's (TWX) Warner Bros., collectively put out 86 movies last year, up 16% from 2014's 74 releases, according to Exhibitor Relations data.And 2015 proved to be a banner year in film: Ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada climbed 7.4% to hit a record $11.1 billion.But not all movies are created equal. The top-20 grossing movies carried 50% of last year's box office, up from 41% in 2014 and 42% in 2013, as Hollywood shifts its development strategy.""You're sort of seeing a bifurcation of what studios are really looking to invest in,"" Morningstar analyst Neil Macker told IBD.Studios are migrating to a ""barbell strategy,"" he said, developing more high-budget, blockbuster-type movies, as well as more lower-budget films that don't require crushed box-office records to prove profitable. That means mid-budget movies — often rom-coms and talky dramas — get left by the wayside.This is partly a reflection of viewer trends. The average moviegoer has become more discriminating, said Stifel analyst Benjamin Mogil, as online streaming-video options like Netflix (NFLX) or Apple (AAPL) iTunes movie rentals gain steam.Also not helping movies is the ""explosion of prestige drama"" on TV, as Macker puts it, from networks like Time Warner's HBO, Fox's FX, Netflix and Amazon (AMZN) Video.""That's where a lot of the (screen)writers are going and a lot of the viewers are going also,"" he said.So when consumers do plan on a Friday night at the movies, they want the ""full theatrical experience,"" Mogil told IBD. And surround sound and big screens merit explosions, special effects and pop culture fanfare.Last year ""clearly marked one where dramas and comedies, along with many kids films and horror, had challenges,"" he wrote separately in a Jan. 3 note.""While ticket prices have largely remained in check of late, the increased proliferation/ease of (video on demand) and (subscription video on demand) have made the theater-going experience one which outperforms for the major event titles but has difficulty for middle-of-the-road fare.""Even Apple Flops In TheatersThat might explain why ""Steve Jobs,"" the biopic on the Apple co-founder, took in less than $18 million, despite being penned by Aaron Sorkin and starring heavy hitters like Kate Winslet and Michael Fassbender.Meanwhile, 2015 box office winner ""The Force Awakens"" has raked in more money than all eight Oscar-nominated best picture contenders combined, both domestically and abroad.Action-heavy spectacles appear to translate across cultures better than other films. Universal's ""Furious 7"" — the seventh installment of ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise — is the No. 6 grossing film of all time, according to Box Office Mojo.But that's not to say that simply making any old blockbuster or sequel will do. Plenty have bombed. ""Fantastic Four,"" which had a reported $120 million production budget, brought in only $56.1 million domestically last year.The Twitter EffectThis broad shift in cinema trends has contributed to a repetitive theatrical cycle of ""Groundhog Day"" proportions, with more franchise-based blockbusters, more people watching those blockbusters, and more studios making blockbusters because that appears to be what's working.Only two of the top-grossing 2015 releases were originals: Disney Pixar's ""Inside Out"" and Twentieth Century Fox's ""The Martian.""""Hollywood has always had the attitude of: If something succeeds, do it again and again and again until people get sick of it,"" said Exhibitor Relations analyst Karie Bible.Online chatter can also add to the snowball effect that nudges people toward already-popular tentpole titles instead of smaller critical darlings, widening the chasm between blockbusters and average performers, as well as shrinking the margin of error for studios.""Often when studios try to get very creative or original ... the audience just stays away,"" Dergarabedian said. ""It just depends on the movie and the buzz. All the marketing dollars in the world can't change the social media sentiment, and that's the thing the studios can't control.""Mogil echoed the idea that the Twitter (TWTR)-verse has sway as a collective culture influencer.""Because of social media, people know really quickly if it's a good movie or not,"" he said.In 2016, more sequels and reboots are expected to lead the box office again. Stifel predicts that March's release of ""Batman v. Superman"" and December's ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" will each make about $400 million apiece. ""The Force Awakens,"" which came out in mid-December, is expected to deliver another $300 million this year for Disney.'Fast and the Furious 27'?If viewers' habits line up with all of Stifel's top-10 predictions, that will mean that all but one film — Disney's new animated princess, ""Moana"" — will be spinoffs or sequels to existing properties, such as ""Harry Potter,"" ""Star Trek,"" ""Independence Day"" and ""Alice in Wonderland.""Will moviegoers ever weary of superhero sequels and epic franchises?""It's a tougher question because you need a bunch of sequels to bomb out before you decide not to make them,"" said Mogil. ""And if they work abroad, you're still going to be making them. There will always be breakout hits from (intellectual property) that are brand new. (But) for the foreseeable future, (the industry will) go with stuff that works and stuff that's known.""

109,VIAB,"The end of last year brought a host of predictions about how Apple (AAPL) might spend its more than $200 billion in cash and investments. Currently the Cupertino, Calif.-based company is using its cash on hand for stock buybacks and dividends.But some on Wall Street are itching for Apple to pull off a big acquisition with its pile of dough. The latest speculation has Apple among those interested in buying TV and movie giant Time Warner (), which has a current market cap of about $57 billion.The biggest deal Apple has ever made was purchasing Beats Music and Beats Electronics for $3 billion in August 2014.A New York Post article on Tuesday suggested that Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes is open to the possibility of a sale of the company. Since then, Apple, AT&T (T) and 21st Century Fox ()have been rumored as potential buyers of the entertainment conglomerate.The Post report said Apple would be interested in Time Warner's assets to support the launch of a stand-alone streaming TV service. Time Warner owns CNN, HBO, TBS, TNT and other cable channels.Fortune writer Philip Elmer-DeWitt outlined the reasons for a deal in a column titled ""Why Apple Should Buy Time Warner.""Apple has been trying for years to assemble a ""skinny bundle"" of popular cable channels for an Internet TV service but without success. Buying Time Warner would give that to Apple in an instant, he said.But just because Apple has the cash doesn't mean they will spend it on a big acquisition. Apple has been loath to make large acquisitions for fear of harming its corporate culture. Apple likes to make small tuck-in acquisitions of companies with interesting technologies or talented engineers. It also has a reputation for wanting to build new products and services in house rather than acquire what someone else has developed.In a Dec. 10 [PAGE[research]] report, FBR analyst Daniel Ives put together a ""Christmas M&A list"" of deals that Apple might consider in 2016. He listed Adobe Systems (ADBE), Box (BOX), GoPro (GPRO) and Tesla Motors (TSLA).""Although we clearly can see Cupertino focusing on a number of skunkworks initiatives (e.g., Project Titan, virtual reality Faceshift, etc.) in 2016 and not pursuing major M&A prospects, with $200 billion of cash in the coffer (and growing), we can finally envision Apple making a larger acquisition, as the conditions are ripe for (CEO Tim) Cook to make a move,"" Ives said.Research firm CCS Insight predicted Nov. 20 that Apple might buy either Box or Dropbox in 2016 to extend its iCloud package of services into the enterprise market.On Dec. 31, Investors.com published a list of ""The wildest tech M&A predictions for 2016."" Among those predictions, the writers and editors of entertainment magazine Variety predicted that Apple will buy a movie studio in 2016 to support its goals for a subscription Internet video service.Variety listed Viacom (VIAB), Sony (SNE) and Time Warner's HBO as possible targets.

111,VIAB,"At the end of every year, business journalists and Wall Street analysts sit down and write up their boldest predictions for mergers and acquisitions in the coming year. And like the people shown riding hoverboards in YouTube videos, they're likely to fall on their butts.Tech M&A predictions are often wrong because they're born out of wishful thinking. They ignore market realities, CEO personalities and other factors that can make such deals tough to pull off.But they're fun to consider. So with that in mind, here's a roundup of the boldest predictions for tech company mergers and acquisitions in 2016.Apple Buys Tesla MotorsApple (AAPL) is rumored to be working on an electric car and it could ""dramatically accelerate"" those efforts if it bought Tesla Motors (TSLA), says Aaron Task, digital editor at Fortune magazine.""With over $200 billion cash on hand, the iPhone maker has more than ample resources to absorb the purchase, especially now that some of the bloom has come off Tesla's once-rosy stock,"" Task wrote. ""In addition to its automobile know-how, Apple gets access to Tesla's battery, which CEO Elon Musk claims can help change 'the entire energy infrastructure of the world.'""Plus, Musk would be a worthy heir to Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and would be ideally suited to be Apple's futurist, chief technologist and CEO-in-waiting, Task said.AT&T Buys YahooWeb giant Yahoo (YHOO) will be sold to telecom powerhouse AT&T (T), mirroring Verizon's (VZ) acquisition of AOL earlier in the year, predicts Chris Ciaccia, technology editor at TheStreet.""Yahoo's purchase of BrightRoll could help AT&T with its reported streaming service, as it seeks to have ads inserted into it,"" Ciaccia wrote. ""There are other players for Yahoo, like a media company or a private equity firm, but AT&T just makes too much sense to me.""GoPro Sold To Larger Tech FirmWith GoPro's (GPRO) stock depressed, a larger technology firm is likely to sweep in and buy the maker of action cameras, according to Orange Peel Investments.""With zero debt and $513 million in cash, the company has a clean slate for an LBO to come in, whisk them off their feet and take advantage of the company's ability to lever,"" the firm said in a post on Seeking Alpha. ""The obvious acquiring party in this transaction would be a larger technology or electronics outfit, such as an Apple, Samsung or Microsoft (MSFT). They could use the company's brand in a way similar to how Apple is using Beats. They could continue to have the brand name separate from the core brand and then eventually vertically integrate the two companies for future projects.""Comcast Will Try To Buy NetflixIn a prediction out of left field, Yahoo Tech editor Dan Tynan believes cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) will try to acquire Internet TV service Netflix (NFLX) or possibly vice versa.""Whether or not you're a cord-cutter, streaming media is the future of entertainment — and nobody streams bigger than Netflix, which accounted for nearly 40% of all Internet traffic last year. Since Big Cable can't beat the streamers at this game, the only thing left is for it to join them by acquisition,"" Tynan wrote. ""Comcast ($192 billion valuation) and Netflix ($42 billion) are the most logical candidates for an arranged marriage. While it stands to reason that the larger company will swallow the smaller one, it's not inconceivable that the reverse will happen — not unlike AOL's acquisition of Time Warner 15 years ago, but perhaps with better results.""Apple Buys A Movie StudioVariety magazine's writers and editors are predicting a lot of M&A activity in Hollywood in 2016. Most notably, they think Apple will buy a movie studio to support its goals for a subscription Internet video service.""With more than $200 billion in cash on hand, the Cupertino colossus is poised to rewrite the rules of the media game,"" the Variety staff wrote. ""Viacom (VIAB) or HBO might seem the likeliest prey, but Sony (SNE) is a juicier target, given the mix of hardware and programming under its hood.""Variety thinks Chinese Internet giant Alibaba Group (BABA) also is interested in buying a Hollywood player. Possible targets for Alibaba include Viacom, CBS (CBS), Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF) and DreamWorks Animation.However, John Malone is most likely to snap up Lions Gate and merge it with cable channel Starz (STRZA), Variety said.Time Warner (TWX), parent of HBO and Warner Bros., could become an M&A target in 2016, Variety said. One likely bidder would be 21st Century Fox (FOXA), the trade paper said.Intel Or Qualcomm Buys InvenSenseU.K.-based research firm CCS Insight makes a lot of annual tech industry predictions, including some about mergers and acquisitions.It predicts that Intel (INTC) or Qualcomm (QCOM) will acquire InvenSense (INVN) in 2016.""The acquisition follows a large fall in the market capitalization of InvenSense in the second half of 2015,"" CCS Insight said in a report. ""Its purchaser recognizes the opportunity to snap up InvenSense's assets in sensor technology. As sensors take on greater importance in the Internet of Things and wearable devices, the buyer integrates InvenSense's technology into a wider range of semiconductors.""CCS Insight also predicts that Samsung will acquire chipmaker GlobalFoundries by 2017.""GlobalFoundries is currently struggling to compete against Intel, Samsung and TSMC (TSM),"" it said. ""Chip manufacturing becomes increasingly capital- and scale-intensive, with huge pressure on capacity as demand balloons for silicon for the Internet of Things. Samsung's foundry business accounts for a growing proportion of the company's profit, and the acquisition helps cement Samsung's position in this area.""Dish Network Gets MarriedDish Network (DISH) will merge with someone in 2016, says Phillip Swann, president of TVPredictions.com.""The nation's second-largest satellite TV service needs help to stay competitive, and that assistance can only come from a merger,"" Swann wrote. Possible merger partners include T-Mobile (TMUS), Verizon, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.""Out of full disclosure, I have predicted in the past that Dish will merge with someone, and it hasn't happened yet,"" Swann said. ""But this time, well, this time I really think it will happen.""RELATED:Apple 2016 Predictions: Acquisitions, Accessories.Cloud, Virtual Reality Among Top Tech Trends For 2016.

But diversification to new products and new customers will be key for Avago this year as the hockey-stick rise in smartphone sales levels off.Over the last three quarters Avago's revenue growth has slowed from 130% to 37% to 16% last quarter. Consensus for the current quarter is a drop to 7.4% growth amid reports of slowing iPhone sales. Still, Avago boasts a best-possible 99 Composite Rating from Investor's Business Daily, meaning it's outperformed at least 99% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.Shares closed down 3% on the stock market Wednesday.FacebookThe social network king, with more than 1 billion global users, continues to expand into adjacent markets.

171,VIAB,"Here's your weekly Investing Action Plan: what investors need to know for the coming week. After quickly soaring to 21,000, the Dow Jones industrial average may take a breather, along with other stock indexes, as markets look to the following week's central bank meeting. But oil prices and Dow energy stocks like Exxon Mobil (XOM) could be catalysts with top executives…
"
172,VIAB,"Here's your Investing Action Plan for Friday: what you need to know as an investor for the coming day. Movie awards don't necessarily translate to box office returns, and film studios are only one component of conglomerates that derive revenue from a variety of sources. But this weekend's Oscars highlight the solid performance of media stocks recently like Disney (DIS)…
"
173,VIAB,"When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences hands out its coveted Oscar for best picture on Sunday, odds are the 6,500-plus members will anoint a film that fits the mold of recent honorees — smallish and artsy.Gone are the days when megahits such as ""Titanic"" or ""Lord of The Rings"" — films that emanated from media giants News Corp. (NWS) and Time Warner (TWX) — win best picture.Today, the prize is more likely to go to a smaller-budget film with limited exposure outside of big cities like New York and Los Angeles. This year's nine hopefuls averaged $54 million in domestic ticket sales before their nominations were announced, according to ComScore Inc., not enough to rank in the top 50 for the year.While the Academy doubled the number of possible nominees to 10 in 2010 to make room for box-office hits, the appeal of the slate has dwindled over the years. That suggests members more than ever are emphasizing creativity over financial success. In 2015, the year ""Birdman"" won, the eight films vying for best picture had taken in an average of $25.6 million before their nominations, a recent low. When ""Titanic"" won in 1998, the pre-nominations average of the five contenders was $96.2 million.""La La Land,"" a musical about lovers struggling to succeed in show business, and ""Hidden Figures,"" about the contributions of three African American women to the early space program, have been the breakout pictures among this year's nominees. If either captures the Oscar, they would rank among the most successful in a decade.""Hidden Figures,"" from 21st Century Fox (FOX), has the largest domestic haul among the nominees at $144.5 million as of last weekend, according to ComScore. It's the third favorite to win at 50-to-1, according to awards tracker GoldDerby.com.""La La Land"" is the clear favorite, at 2-to-11. The film from Lions Gate Entertainment (LGFA) (LGFB) has the second-biggest tally domestically at $134.6 million and is the leader globally at $340.5 million. It's also still rolling up sales, with a Feb. 14 release in China and expanded play in the U.S. on Imax's (IMAX) big screens.The second favorite for top prize at 18-to-1 is Barry Jenkins's coming-of-age feature ""Moonlight,"" distributed by independent firm A24. If that picture wins, its $22 million in domestic sales would mark the smallest total since ""The Hurt Locker"" in 2010.Recent data suggest the financial benefit of an Oscar nomination has also waned, probably because the pictures themselves lacked wide appeal. Still, some studios have managed to maximize the opportunity. ""American Sniper"" from Time Warner's Warner Bros.' unit generated 99% of its $350 million in North American ticket sales after being nominated for best picture.Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at ComScore, said the nominee with most to gain from a win this year is ""Lion,"" from independent studio Weinstein Co. about a lost Indian boy who is adopted by an Australian couple. The film was the last of the best-picture nominees to gain wide release. It's an 80 to 1 shot at GoldDerby.The studios with most to celebrate at this year's awards have seen better days commercially. Lions Gate has struggled to develop big films with the appeal of earlier successes like ""The Hunger Games"" and the ""Twilight"" series, yet garnered the most Oscar nominations of any distributor with ""La La Land,"" the World War II drama ""Hacksaw Ridge"" and ""Hell or High Water,"" a crime thriller set in modern-day west Texas.Viacom's (VIA) (VIAB) Paramount Pictures had the second-most nominations because of two best-picture hopefuls, ""Arrival"" and ""Fences."" Yet Viacom replaced studio chief Brad Grey on Wednesday because of losses and is seeking a successor.

175,VIAB,"Walt Disney (DIS) was subject to mixed reviews Thursday, with one set of Wall Street analysts downgrading the stock and another raising its price target.Pivotal Research handed out a slew of downgrades in the media and tech sectors, as the firm updates its models to ""account for minor changes in earnings expectations and more significant changes to costs of capital associated with new political risks following the recent US elections.""While Disney's studio arm is performing ""spectacularly well,"" the company received a downgrade from Pivotal to sell from hold.""Once again, costs of capital are core to the price target change, which fall to a level that is more than -15% below current trading levels, obliging us to downgrade the stock,"" wrote Pivotal's Brian Wieser, noting that yields on 10-year Treasury notes have risen significantly.He said the firm wasn't making any ""meaningful"" changes to its view at an operating level, but noted ""soft TV audience trends, ongoing erosion of ESPN's subscriber base and mixed reports on Shanghai Disneyland from Asian press.""He also called out uncertainty surrounding Disney's succession plan. Current CEO Bob Iger said he will step down next year, and his heir apparent abruptly left the company last year.Pivotal, which cut its price target on Disney to 86 from 102, also downgraded Discovery Communications (DISCA) and CBS (CBS) from buy to hold. The firm maintained a hold on Viacom (VIAB) and buy ratings on 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Time Warner (TWX).Meanwhile, JPMorgan analyst Alexia Quadrani reiterated an overweight rating on Disney and raised her price target to 124 from 118, calling the media conglomerate's underlying business trends ""healthy, which we expect to translate into healthy longer-term earnings growth.""IBD'S TAKE: Traditional networks have been trying to find balance in a modern TV-viewing environment plagued by the threat of cord-cutting. That has led some players, like CBS, to maintain its own streaming service while agreeing to join pure-play platforms like Hulu.The bank's confidence in the company is bolstered by ""stable"" affiliate revenue growth and solid advertising in its cable segment, a ""significant"" market share lead by its studio unit, and well-performing parks and consumer products segments.""We believe Disney is one of the best-positioned companies in our media universe with a diverse portfolio of assets and unparalleled intellectual property that the company is able to monetize across its divisions,"" she wrote.Disney shares were down 1.75% at 107.53 in the stock market today, still in buy range after breaking out last week. Fox dropped 0.9%, Time Warner edged up 0.2%, CBS and Viacom slipped about 1%, while Discovery rose 2.6%.RELATED:Disney's 'Tide Is Turning' But GoPro, McDonald's Served Downgrades

The billionaire, who has been in frail health, relinquished his title as chairman this past February.With her father ailing, Viacom Vice Chairman Shari Redstone won a legal battle with former Chief Executive Philippe Dauman earlier this year to take the lead on major decisions involving the leadership and strategic direction of the company. This month, she installed Bob Bakish as CEO and scrapped a plan to merge Viacom with her family's other major media holding, CBS (CBS).Now the Redstones are entrusting Bakish to restore the luster of Viacom's best-known properties, including cable networks MTV and Nickelodeon and film studio Paramount Pictures.Viacom rose 2% to $35.61 in afternoon trades Friday.

239,VIAB,"New Internet television services from Dish Network (DISH), Sony and possibly Apple are unlikely to please either potential cable TV cord-cutters or cord nevers, Bernstein Research said in a report Thursday.The over-the-top video services announced or rumored so far are too narrow for existing pay-TV subscribers and are too expensive for people who have opted not to subscribe to traditional pay-TV services, Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger said in the report.His findings were based on comments made at focus groups in New York City and San Francisco. The groups were composed of people who identified themselves as ""highly likely to cut the cord in the next six months,"" as well as people who felt just the opposite.Based on the focus groups, Juenger is pessimistic on the prospects for Sling TV from Dish Network, PlayStation Vue from Sony (SNE) and a rumored Apple (AAPL) TV service.""A strong body of evidence is emerging that suggests to us that none of these services are likely to gain much traction,"" he said. ""Simply put, for existing pay-TV subscribers, the content is too limited (relative to the cost savings); and for cord-nevers, the price is too high (relative to the appeal of the content).""The OTT services are handicapped by having fewer networks in order to achieve a lower price, but not enough networks to make the service appealing.""Cord-cutting, in large numbers, isn't likely to happen,"" Juenger said. ""It's one of those ideas that sounds great in the abstract but crumbles when faced with the reality. OTT services seem poised to garner few subscribers, which is more good news than bad. We believe it's better for the pay-TV ecosystem to remain in the status quo than to add millions of OTT subscribers at the cost of blowing the whole system apart.""One of the big problems with ""skinny"" TV bundles is that individuals differ on what the ideal package of networks should be.Content Companies Cutting InAs Dish and others are putting together online programming bundles, some content companies are making stand-alone subscription video-on-demand services. These include Time Warner 's (TWX) HBO Go service, set to launch next month on Apple TV hardware; CBS All Access; and Nickelodeon's Noggin from parent Viacom (VIAB).Complicating matters even more are subscription streaming video services like Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Hulu, which offer original programming as well as licensed TV shows and movies.The concept of over-the-top television is appealing because many people hate their cable TV providers but are stuck with them unless an effective alternative emerges.""The vitriol toward the cable companies was intense"" in the focus groups, Juenger said. ""A surprising number of participants are currently subscribing to pay-TV only because it is actually cheaper than buying high-speed Internet on its own.""Bernstein rates Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Time Warner as outperform.It rates AMC Networks (AMCX), CBS (CBS), Discovery Communications (DISCA), and Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI) as market perform; and Viacom as underperform.RELATED:Apple building new set-top box for its Internet TV serviceSony pursues cord cutters with over-the-top TV service.

But Apple hasn't been able to secure the content deals needed to make it happen.Now that Dish Network (DISH) and Sony (SNE) have blazed a trail with such services, Apple once again is looking to enter the over-the-top television business. Apple is now negotiating with TV programmers and has shown demos of its proposed service, Re/code reported Wednesday.Apple's talks with TV programmers are at an early stage, and details like pricing and timing still need to be worked out, Re/code said.Meanwhile, Apple's streaming video box, the Apple TV, is overdue for an upgrade. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company hasn't come out with a new version of the $99 set-top box in two years.Dish Network began rolling out its Sling TV service last month after earning rave reviews with its introduction at the 2015 International CES show in Las Vegas.For $20 a month, Sling TV will deliver live sports, lifestyle, family, news and information channels, video-on-demand entertainment and the best of online video to broadband-connected devices at home and on the go. The base package includes 12 channels: ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, TBS, Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, ABC Family and CNN. Dish also will sell add-on packs costing $5 a month focused on sports, news and kids channels.Sony's PlayStation Vue will launch soon with about 75 channels from CBS (CBS), Discovery Communications (DISCA), Fox (FOXA), NBCUniversal, Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI) and Viacom (VIAB). By the end of March, the subscription cloud TV service is expected to go live in four cities: New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles.

Initially it will be available only in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia.Sony introduced the service in November, calling it a ""pioneering new cloud-based TV service that reinvents the television experience.""The company also is offering two higher-priced tiers of Vue that include more channels for $60 and $70 a month.PlayStation Vue follows the nationwide launch of Sling TV from Dish Network (DISH), another over-the-top Internet pay TV service. Sling TV offers a starting package of 20 channels for $20 a month and is available using Roku and Amazon.com (AMZN) streaming devices and Microsoft 's (MSFT) Xbox One game console.Apple (AAPL) reportedly is preparing to enter the OTT TV market this fall. Media reports say Apple will launch its service with about 25 channels for $30 to $40 a month. Apple stock has risen three straight days since the Wall Street Journal broke the news.The OTT services from Dish, Sony and Apple are aimed at ""cord cutters"" — consumers who have quit traditional pay TV services — and millennials who have never received cable. Each offers a different set of channels with noticeable absences. For instance, Sony's Vue is missing the CW network and channels from Walt Disney (DIS), including ABC and ESPN.Meanwhile, several content providers are launching their own OTT services. Time Warner (TWX) will launch its HBO Now service in April for $15 a month. CBS (CBS) offers CBS All-Access for $6 a month.

256,VIAB,"Apple's (AAPL) rumored pay-TV service, consisting of a skinny bundle of cable and broadcast channels, isn't likely to appeal to many consumers, UBS analyst Doug Mitchelson said in a report Monday.Consumers like the idea of a less expensive pay-TV service, but not when it's missing some of the channels they want, Mitchelson said.Current skinny bundles are ""unpopular because consumers have a surprisingly wide variety of channel bundles that they prefer,"" he said.Skinny bundles such as Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue offer fewer channels for a lower price than regular pay-TV services.Meanwhile, over-the-top Internet television services like Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video, Hulu and Netflix (NFLX) typically supplement linear TV services by providing a selection of on-demand TV shows and movies.UBS reached its conclusions based on data from a survey of 1,855 U.S. pay-TV households. Its study sought ""to understand whether a la carte pay TV was viable (it is not), whether slimmed down bundles could prove to be popular (they are not) and the level of importance that each major media network group has to the bundle (all are quite important, including Viacom (VIAB), but some much more than others),"" Mitchelson said.Apple has been in talks with media companies over the past year about launching an online pay-TV service with a bundle of channels that includes live and on-demand video, to be paired up with its Apple TV hardware, Mitchelson said. Those companies include CBS (CBS), Discovery Communications (DISCA), Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Time Warner (TWX). Apple has discussed offering a service costing $25 to $39.95 a month, he said.But media companies have been ""unwilling to let Apple cherry pick channels from their line-up,"" Mitchelson said.Content companies currently have little incentive to break up traditional pay-TV bundles. Cord-cutting, or pay-TV subscribers canceling their service, has not posed a big enough threat for content companies to change their business models, Mitchelson said.Also, media companies are mandating ""new entrant pricing,"" which is at a significant premium per customer than what the fully scaled traditional distributors have to pay, he said. ""Offering a healthy selection of high quality channels at a low price quickly becomes impossible under the constraints demanded by the media companies,"" Mitchelson said.Apple isn't the only tech company actively pursuing Internet-delivered pay-TV bundles, he said. Amazon.com and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google also are in the hunt, Mitchelson said.""In fact, Amazon and Google might beat Apple to market as Apple may be frustrated with the pricing and carriage demands of the media companies,"" Mitchelson said.UBS survey data indicate that Apple could be successful if it can pull together a compelling lineup of channels.Some 16% of U.S. pay-TV households surveyed indicated that they would consider signing up for an Apple TV service with 25 live TV channels (including CBS, ESPN and FX) costing $30 to $40 a month, Mitchelson said.""Not surprisingly, interest in the Apple TV offer skewed toward younger households, higher income homes, larger households and families with children, as well as streamers being significantly more interested than non-streamers,"" he said. ""Perhaps the most promising for media companies, among 18-34 year olds, 42% suggested they would definitely or probably subscribe to the Apple OTT service.""When asked to put together a custom bundle of channels, most survey respondents came up with bundles that would cost more than their current setups.The average custom bundle cost would be $127, 20% higher than their existing package, Mitchelson said. Only 28% of those who designed custom packages thought it was a better value, he said.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves came to a similar conclusion — doubting Apple's prospects in the pay-TV realm — two weeks ago.""Odds may be increasing that Apple has decided the opportunity is not worth the effort,"" Hargreaves said in a Nov. 16 report.Follow Patrick Seitz on Twitter @IBD_PSeitz and on Facebook.

417,VIAB,"Shares of Spotify (SPOT  -  Free Report) have climbed roughly 16% since the streaming music powerhouse went public in early April. But the industry Spotify helped popularize is more crowded these days. So let’s evaluate Spotify as it tries to push further into video after it announced a splashy new hire on Tuesday.VideoSpotify just appointed Dawn Ostroff as its new Chief Content Officer. She will lead “all aspects of Spotify’s content partnerships across music, audio, and video. Ostroff is set to join the company in August after she officially leaves her role as President of Entertainment at Condé Nast. Before heading up the entertainment division of the parent company of Vogue, Vanity Fair, GQ, and The New Yorker, she worked as a top executive at the CW and UPN networks, where she developed popular TV series, including Gossip Girl and The Vampire Diaries.Ostroff is set to take over a role left vacant since January when Stefan Blom left the company after three years. The new hire’s background far outside of the music world helps demonstrate Spotify’s willingness to explore a wide range of new video content.The news came roughly three years after Spotify promised a significant move into video. At one point, Spotify launched short-form video content from ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report), Comedy Central and MTV (VIAB  -  Free Report), and more. Today, Spotify’s video offerings mostly revolve around music-based content, which includes music videos, as well short behind-the scenes-type shows.FundamentalsSpotify’s video push also comes as it tries to find new revenue streams, beyond its main, low-margin streaming music business because, for all of the talk that Spotify is the next Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), the company eventually has to sidestep the major record label gatekeepers that it pays extremely high royalty fees.The company has tried to work directly with up-and-coming artists, in a more record label capacity, which has drawn backlash from the likes of Universal, Sony, and Warner. But unlike Netflix and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), which were able to become their own TV and movie studios, after they anticipated the likes of Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) and others starting their own streaming services, Spotify might never be able to break into the music business and own the rights even though it has helped revitalize the music business when it looked like the illegal download market might become the new norm.Still, Spotify is the most dominant player in the music industry, currently boasting 170 million monthly active users. Spotify claimed 99 million ad-supported users along with 75 million paid customers, with premium customers making up over 90% of its $1.37 billion Q1 revenues. Furthermore, the company’s premium users climbed 45% from the year-ago period, outpacing the free version’s growth of 21%—Spotify premium costs $9.99 a month. Industry OverviewOne might think its user base would give Spotify outsized influence to negotiate better deals with record labels, which it has to some degree, but it is hard to imagine a scenario where the people who own the rights to the music don’t always hold the upper hand. This dilemma looks even worse when investors consider that Spotify currently faces competition not just from Pandora (P  -  Free Report) and its 5.63 million premium subscribers, but from three of the biggest tech companies in the world.The much newer Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) Music reportedly has 38 million subscribers—though CEO Tim Cook recently noted the service has 50 million users including people on a free trial. Apple Music’s premium services are offered at nearly the exact same price point as Spotify, but Apple just has more money to spend, considering it pulled in quarterly revenues of $61.1 billion.Meanwhile, Amazon’s premium streaming service, called Music Unlimited, which is currently separate from Amazon’s widely popular Prime service, costs $7.99 a month for Prime members and $9.99 for non-prime members. Amazon last noted the service had “tens of millions"" of paid customers. And not to be outdone, Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report) is the latest tech giant to enter the premium streaming industry, with its new YouTube Music.Bottom LineSpotify is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. Meanwhile, the company is projected to see its full-year revenues reach $6.17 billion based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, which would mark a roughly 33% surge. However, like many other young tech companies, Spotify is projected to remain unprofitable over the next few years.Therefore, it seems like Spotify stock might be worth keeping an eye on in order to evaluate how its video push pans out and see if its tech giant competitors steal some of its market share. And don’t forget to pay particularly close attention to Spotify’s margins going forward. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

418,VIAB,"Shares of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) hit a new all-time high on Wednesday after the company’s photo-sharing app Instagram rolled out a new long-form video feature. The move helps demonstrate just how important video has become, and shows why fellow social media firm Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) looks like a strong buy stock at the moment on the back of its own live video push.Instagram launched its new IGTV yesterday that allows users to upload hour-long video content, up from its previous one-minute limit, in a move that seems aimed at taking on the likes of Google’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube and Snapchat (SNAP  -  Free Report). But while investors decide if they are ready to jump back into Facebook stock, despite its recent data scandal woes, it’s worth diving into why Twitter stock is worth buying (also read: Should You Buy Facebook  Stock At New All-Time High?).Live Video Twitter grew its daily active user base by 10% in Q1, while its monthly active user base climbed by 3% to reach 336 million. Now while these user figures don’t come close to matching Facebook or Instagram, the company’s video-based initiatives are in full-force and benefit from every added user.Twitter streamed more than 1,300 live broadcasts last quarter and also announced that it signed more than 30 new partnerships, including deals with the likes of Fox Sports (FOXA  -  Free Report), NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report), and Disney (DIS  -  Free Report)—featuring a ton of ESPN programming and a FIFA World Cup partnership.Twitter’s push into streaming sports, which is one of the last things people need to watch live, is also expected to pay off. The company now has partnerships with MLS and MLB for live games, after experimenting with the NFL’s Thursday Night Football.The @OrlandoCitySC take on the @NewYorkRedBulls this Saturday, and you can watch the full match right here on Twitter!Follow @TwitterLive to see what else is streaming all week long. pic.twitter.com/hIVrjRwJqt— Twitter Live (@TwitterLive) March 26, 2018The key here is that live video attracts more advertisers, and like Facebook, Twitter makes most of its money from advertising. The company’s advertising sales—which accounted for roughly 86% of Twitter’s $665 million total Q1 revenues—climbed 21% from $474 million in the year-ago period to $575 million. Meanwhile, the social media company’s international ad revenue surged 52%.Price Movement Moving on, some investors might be shocked to see that the previously struggling social media company has seen its stock price skyrocket over the last year. Coming in Thursday, shares of Twitter had soared nearly 151% over the last year, which not only crushes the S&P 500’s 14% climb but also tops Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) 74% surge. Narrowing the focus, TWTR has climbed roughly 46% over the last three months, which tops Netflix’s (NFLX  -  Free Report) 36% growth. Investors should also remember that despite Twitter’s strong year-long run, the company is still well below its all-time high that it reached shortly going public in 2013. This means it might have an easier time keeping its current streak alive, especially considering it is expected to expand its bottom line significantly.Outlook Twitter is expected to see its adjusted Q2 earnings skyrocket 112.5% to touch $0.17 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company’s fiscal 2018 earnings are projected to soar by 70.5% to reach $0.75 per share.Investors should also note that Twitter has received 11 earnings estimate revisions for Q2, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 60 days. Meanwhile, during this same time frame, Twitter earned 14 upward revisions for fiscal 2018, with almost 100% agreement.The company, which had struggled to grow its top line, is projected to see its Q2 revenues pop by nearly 22% to hit $698.93 million. For the current fiscal year, Twitter revenues are projected to hit $2.93 billion, which would mark a roughly 20% surge.Bottom LineTwitter is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. The company is also expected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of 23.1% over the next three to five years. Therefore, Twitter stock might be worth considering at the moment.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

419,VIAB,"After hitting a record high last week, the Nasdaq hit a fresh peak on Jun 20. Investors feel tech stocks can continue to chalk up gains even as trade relations between the United States and China worsen. This is because they are less susceptible to tariffs than industrials. Also, China’s ability to act against U.S. tech companies may be limited by its efforts to build its own tech industry.Investors also remain hopeful that negotiations can reduce the impact of tariffs.  Germany’s decision to do away with car tariffs is an example of how trade disputes can be settled amicably. With the economy in fine fettle and no signs of a bubble in sight, investing in tech stocks still looks like a profitable option. Tech Stocks Surge Higher, Germany Dials Down TensionsThe Nasdaq gained 0.7% on Jun 20 to hit a new all-time high, boosted primarily by Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) which also hit record levels. Shares of Facebook and Netflix gained 2.3% and 2.9%, respectively.Netflix’s surge was attributable to Disney’s revised offer for Fox’s entertainment business. Subsequently, other media majors like Netflix and Viacom, Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) gained with investors speculating that more such deals are around the corner.Meanwhile, heads of BMW (BAMXF  -  Free Report), Volkswagen (VLKAY  -  Free Report) and Daimler (DDAIF  -  Free Report) met the U.S. ambassador to Germany, according to The Wall Street Journal. During the meeting, they floated the idea of abolishing car tariffs between the United States and the EU. This development has dialed down trade tensions and indicates that negotiations could reduce the impact of tariffs.Can Tech Stocks Withstand Tariff Shocks?Investors increasingly feel that tech stocks are not as susceptible to tariffs as say home appliance markets or industrial companies. According to Sameer Samana, a strategist at Wells Fargo’s (WFC  -  Free Report) Investment Institute, losses suffered by U.S. markets due to trade tensions are largely temporary. Ultimately, investors choose to focus on the strong performance of the domestic and global economies.Samana stresses that tech companies have been the leading gainers during market recoveries from losses attributable to trade-related issues. This is primarily because of their strong earnings performances. Further, China’ ability to impose tariffs on U.S. tech companies may be limited even as its attempts to build up its own tech industry.Our ChoicesTech stocks have chalked up strong gains despite the persistence of trade tensions. Investors feel that technology may be not be as vulnerable to tariffs as other sectors, such as industrials. Further, China may not be able to raise tariffs on tech companies beyond a point as its attempts to develop its own tech sector.Investing in tech stocks, which make up the Nasdaq, looks like a smart option at this time.

420,VIAB,"Shares of Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) sunk on Monday following a Friday report from The Washington Post that the social media company had suspended millions of accounts. Yet, Twitter quickly assured people that most of the removed accounts aren’t included in its metrics. Plus J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) thinks yesterday’s slip represents a solid buying opportunity. And that’s just the start of why Twitter stock looks like a strong buy right now.The ReportThe Post reported last Friday that Twitter’s recent efforts to suspend and remove accounts hoped to “lessen the flow of disinformation on the platform.” Data obtained by The Post reportedly showed that Twitter has been suspending more than 1 million accounts per day in recent months.The worry here was that the removal or suspension of roughly 70 million accounts would negatively impact Twitter’s monthly active user totals, which reached 336 million last quarter. Twitter’s CFO Ned Segal took to his company’s platform on Monday to respond to concerns, stating that “most accounts we remove are not included in our reported metrics as they have not been active on the platform for 30 days or more, or we catch them at sign up and they are never counted.”“If we removed 70M accounts from our reported metrics, you would hear directly from us,” Segal continued. ""This article reflects us getting better at improving the health of the service. Look forward to talking more on our earnings call July 27!”J.P. Morgan Shares of Twitter closed down 5.4% on Monday despite its CFO’s reassurance that it won’t end the quarter with 70 million fewer MAUs, which would have an extremely negative impact on Twitter’s business and stock price. Based on this, J.P. Morgan analysts see Monday’s drop off as a great time to buy shares of red-hot Twitter.J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth reiterated his “overweight” rating and reaffirmed his $50 price target for Twitter, which represented a 13% upside from Monday’s close. “We’d be taking advantage of the weakness and recommend buying Twitter shares,” Anmuth wrote in a note to clients Monday.He also noted that the removal of “spammy and suspicious” accounts should be seen as a positive for the company going forward. “Importantly, improving quality on the platform is critical for the health of the service and attracting more users and driving stronger engagement over time,” he wrote.Twitter, like Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and other social media platforms have to navigate the somewhat murky waters of troll accounts and the spreading of “fake news.” Luckily for investors, it seems that Twitter has been relatively proactive about cleaning up this problem.Live VideoTwitter grew its daily active user base by 10% in Q1, while its MAUs climbed by 3% to 336 million. The company also noted that it streamed more than 1,300 live broadcasts last quarter and announced that it signed more than 30 new partnerships, including deals with the likes of Fox Sports (FOXA  -  Free Report), NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report), and Disney (DIS  -  Free Report)—featuring a ton of ESPN programming and a FIFA World Cup partnership.Twitter’s push into streaming sports, which is one of the last things people need to watch live, is also expected to pay off.

This climb includes a nearly 50% surge over the last three months on the back of its impressive first quarter.Looking ahead to the second quarter—which the company is set to report on July 27—Twitter is expected to see its adjusted Q2 earnings skyrocket 112.5% to touch $0.17 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company’s fiscal 2018 earnings are also projected to soar by 72.7% to reach $0.76 per share.The company is projected to see its Q2 revenues pop by nearly 22% to hit $700.02 million.

421,VIAB,"The U.S. box office hit a record high of $3.3 billion in the second quarter thanks to summer hits like Incredibles 2, Avengers: Infinity War and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Moreover, the figures for June came in at an estimated $1.27 billion, the largest ever for the month, beating the previous record set in 2013, according to Hollywood Reporter.Franchise films have been driving the box office for quite some time and the second quarter wasn’t any different. At the same time it also proves that the appeal for theatrical movie-viewing experience hasn’t faded at a time when streaming giants like Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) are giving film studios tough competition.U.S. Box Office on Record-Breaking SpreeThe U.S. box office recorded its highest-grossing quarter ever, with revenues of an estimated $3.3 billion.

422,VIAB,"Shares of Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) surged over 5.5% on Tuesday to hit a new 52-week high of $43.99 after J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) analysts raised their price target for the social media company, citing Twitter’s advertising growth as a major reason for their more upbeat outlook.J.P. Morgan analysts upped Twitter’s price target from $39 per share to $50 per share, which marks a 21% premium over Monday's closing price. ""We are raising our estimates on TWTR shares as we believe advertising momentum is strengthening, particularly among large marketers,"" analyst Doug Anmuth said in a note to clients Tuesday. ""Industry conversations suggest the value for advertisers on TWTR is increasing, driven by double-digit DAU [daily average users] growth (6 straight qtrs), improving product for both users & marketers.""The analyst also reiterated his ""Overweight"" rating for Twitter stock. Anmuth noted that the upcoming 2018 FIFA World Cup will likely boost the company’s ad sales because of Twitter’s real-time highlights video partnership with Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report)—which is broadcasting the world’s biggest sporting event for the first time (also read: From TV Deals to VR, Here's Everything Investors Need to Know About the FIFA World Cup).""We believe Twitter is uniquely positioned as the real-time broadcast and communications network, making it complementary to all other forms of media, including TV. Twitter is also well positioned to benefit from the large shift in dollars toward mobile and native,"" Anmuth stated. ""We believe Twitter has multiple growth drivers ahead, and we believe the company is well positioned to grow its ad revenue next year as the product continues to improve.""Why It Matters J.P. Morgan analysts upped their price target almost completely on the back of Twitter’s advertising growth picture, and noted one specific partnership for a month-long event as an example. For some, this might seem a little one-track-minded.But the World Cup is simply a microcosm of Twitter’s overall standing as a complement to live entertainment and a vital tool for up to the second information. And advertising is how the company makes most of its money.Twitter’s advertising sales—which accounted for roughly 86% of Twitter’s $665 million total Q1 revenues—climbed 21% from $474 million in the year-ago period to $575 million. Meanwhile, the social media company’s international ad revenue surged 52%.Going forward, investors should expect to see Twitter’s adverting business become even more lucrative as it expands it live video reach. Twitter streamed more than 1,300 live broadcasts in Q1 and also announced that it signed more than 30 new partnerships in the first quarter, which includes deals with the likes of Fox Sports, NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report)—which includes a ton of ESPN programming—and many more.Twitter’s push is part of a larger effort by social media companies, such as Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), to offer more live video content.Outlook Twitter is expected to see its Q2 revenues pop by nearly 22% to hit $698.93 million, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. For the current fiscal year, Twitter revenues are projected to hit $2.93 billion, which would mark a roughly 20% surge.Meanwhile, the company, which reported GAAP profits for the first time in Q4, is expected to see its adjusted quarterly earnings skyrocket 112.5% to $0.17 per share. The company’s fiscal 2018 earnings are also projected to soar by 70% to reach $0.75 per share.Investors should also note that Twitter has received 10 earnings estimate revisions for Q2, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 60 days.

423,VIAB,"Viacom Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) has signed a long-term deal with Trevor Noah’s Day Zero Productions, an international production and distribution company for future film and TV projects. In fact, Trevor Noah and Viacom are no strangers as the former has been hosting Comedy Central’s The Daily Show since September 2015. Comedy Central is a unit of Viacom. Given the immense popularity of the award-winning late night talk show, Comedy Central extended its contract with Noah till 2022.The long-term deal is another step by Viacom to strengthen its relationship with one of the most versatile talents in the entertainment space. Under the expanded alliance, financial terms of which remain undisclosed, the owner of Comedy Central has gained exclusive “first look” rights on all projects developed by Day Zero Productions and Noah. The projects pertain to all types of media content (television, feature films, digital and short-form video).Moreover, the long-term association with this creative personality will see Viacom invest in his company. Furthermore, Viacom’s Paramount Players will adapt Noah’s biopic Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood as a feature film and produce and distribute it as well. Oscar winner Lupita Nyong’o will play the multifaceted performer’s mother in this previously-announced project.Viacom’s decision to expand its relationship with the comedian should find favor with all concerned and we believe that this is another step by the company to redeem itself, as it has been struggling due to weak domestic affiliate revenues, hurt by decrease in subscribers. Moreover, the potential Viacom - CBS Corporation (CBS  -  Free Report) merger has also been making news lately.Price PerformanceViacom’s shares have struggled primarily due to the above-mentioned headwinds. Moreover, the stock has lost 33% of its value in a year’s time, wider than the industry’s decline of 13.7%. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderViacom carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

424,VIAB,"Shares of Roku (ROKU  -  Free Report) soared over 7% on Tuesday one day after Oppenheimer analysts upgraded the streaming TV firm. So now let’s take a look to see if Roku stock might be worth buying with the streaming content revolution set to continue. Upgrade Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein upgraded Roku to “outperform” on Monday. The company sells an array of devices that allow customers to watch their favorite streaming services such as Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime all in one place, similar to Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) TV, Google’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Chromecast or an Amazon Fire Stick. Yet, Oppenheimer cited the company’s Roku Channel and its new targeted advertising push as reasons to be more optimistic about Roku’s future.  The Roku Channel allows users to watch hundreds of streaming movies and TV shows for free without a subscription, which Helfstein sees as a great way for the company to bolster its user base—Roku had roughly 21 million customers at the end of the first quarter, up 47% from the year-ago period. The relatively new offering makes Roku devices more enticing because it then becomes a standalone streaming service akin to Hulu and Netflix, on top of the ability to access users’ other streaming accounts. “The rapid adoption of The Roku Channel gives us incremental confidence in the channel's ability to garner viewership on other platforms, such as Samsung, allowing Roku to monetize a broader portion of the OTT ecosystem than we had previously assumed was possible,” Helfstein wrote.Helfstein also set a new $50 price target for Roku, which marked 15% upside from Monday’s closing price. Roku, which went public last September at $14 per share, is also set to make much more money from its video advertising.This upgrade comes just a week after Roku launched a new “Audience Marketplace” that will allow advertisers to buy ad space targeted directly to specific audiences, “by leveraging Roku’s first-party data and proprietary ad technology,” according to a company release.21st Century Fox, (FOXA  -  Free Report), Turner, Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report), and others have all signed on to sell TV ad inventory in the new marketplace. These ads will appear during programming that users watch on Roku devices that would already show advertisements.  “Over-the-top distribution has been a key audience driver for Turner’s portfolio of premium content, with Roku being one of the preeminent partner platforms,” VP of Ad Innovation & Programmatic Solutions at Turner, Larry Allen, said in a statement. “Participating in Roku’s Audience Marketplace gives us access to rich insights and enhanced audience targeting capabilities, extending the ability for ad buyers to reach and engage with streaming viewing audiences that are critical to grow their business.”Fundamentals Now that we have covered the upgrade and what Roku does, let’s dive into some of the company’s other fundamentals to help investors see if the stock might be worth buying at the moment.Last quarter, the company posted an adjusted loss of $0.07 per share, which actually came in well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate that called for a loss of $0.16 per share. Meanwhile, Roku’s revenues climbed 36% to $136.58 million. The company's average revenue per user also soared 50% to $15.07.Looking ahead, Roku noted that it expects to operate at or near break-even on an adjusted EBITDA basis. The company also boasted that one in four smart TVs sold in the U.S. during Q1 were Roku TVs—televisions with built-in Roku—up from one in five in 2017.For the full-year, Roku is projected to see its revenues climb by 35.5% to $694.99 million, based on our current estimates. At the other end of the income statement, Roku is once again expected to post an adjusted loss, which is hardly uncommon for a young tech company. With that said, Roku is projected to swing from an expected loss of $0.30 per share in fiscal 2018 to adjusted earnings of $0.04 per share in fiscal 2019.Bottom LineRoku is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that has earned five full-year upward earnings estimate revisions against zero downgrades for 2018 and 2019, all within the last 60 days. The company is also expected to grow its user base through its free streaming content offerings, and bolster its advertising revenues through its new marketplace.Meanwhile, the TV industry is slowly shifting toward an OTT model, which means companies like Roku will start to get more customers based on larger market trends alone.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

425,VIAB,"After a six-week trial, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon approved AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner  without any condition. This will give the pay-TV provider an ownership of cable channels such as HBO and CNN as well as film studio Warner Bros. AT&T vowed to close the deal by Jun 20.  This long-awaited decision will change the landscape of the media industry by setting the stage for mergers of media companies and telecom providers. Cable operator, Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has also been eyeing  the film production and studio assets of Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA for as much as $60 billion, should regulators approve AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner.The expected move would create a bidding war for The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), which struck a deal in November to acquire the same assets of Fox for $52.4 billion in an all-stock deal. The acquisition of Fox assets will enhance the streaming and television content of both Comcast and Disney and pose a significant threat to growing digital rivals like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report). In fact, Comcast would become the biggest player in Hollywood by acquiring Fox (read: Comcast Might Thwart Disney-Fox Deal: Media ETFs in Focus).Fox’s film production business includes Twentieth Century Fox, Fox Searchlight and Fox 2000, and the highest grossing Marvel movies - X-Men, Fantastic Four and Deadpool. Fox TV film studio includes This Is Us, Modern Family, and The Simpsons, regional sports networks and entertainment cable channels like National Geographic, FX Networks, Fox Sports Regional Networks, as well as international networks like Star India, a controlling stake in Hulu, and a 39% stake of European satellite provider, Sky.The ruling has also opened doors for AT&T’s biggest rival Verizon Communication (VZ  -  Free Report) to bid for a media company. The potential target of Verizon is the combined CBS Corp (CBS  -  Free Report) and Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report). Other media stocks like Charter Communications CHTR, Dish Network (DISH  -  Free Report), and Discovery DISCA are also in the spotlight in light of the merger mania.Additionally, the verdict has spread optimism beyond the media space as well. It would aid the proposed T-Mobile/Sprint (S  -  Free Report) combination and a pair of significant healthcare deals. This includes the potential buyout of the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna AET by a drug chain CVS Health Corp CVS and the largest pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding ESRX by Cigna (C  -  Free Report)I) (read: Cigna to Buy Express Scripts: Healthcare ETFs in Focus).How to Play?Investors seeking to capitalize on the upcoming boom in M&A activities and potential reshaping of the media industry should consider any of the following ETFs:IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF MNA This fund offers capital appreciation by investing in global companies for which there has been a public announcement of a takeover by an acquirer while at the same time provides short exposure to global equities as a partial equity market hedge. This is done by tracking the IQ Merger Arbitrage Index. Healthcare takes the top spot at 22%, while energy and technology round off the next two spots. The product has amassed $556.7 million in its asset base and trades in average volume of around 129,000 shares a day. It charges 77 bps in annual fees (read: How to Play the Surge in Global M&A With ETFs).ProShares Merger ETF MRGR This product provides exposure to a global merger arbitrage strategy, which seeks to capture the spread between the price at which the stock of a company (a target) trades after a proposed acquisition of such target is announced and the value (cash plus stock) that the acquiring company has proposed to pay for the stock of the target (a spread). This can be easily done by the S&P Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund has key holdings in financials, healthcare and technology. The ETF has been able to manage assets worth $4.4 million while it sees light volume of just 1,000 shares a day. Invesco Dynamic Media ETF PBSPBS provides exposure to media stocks under one roof. It seeks to offer capital appreciation by investing in companies that are selected on a variety of investment merit criteria, including price momentum, earnings momentum, quality, management action and value by tracking the Dynamic Media Intellidex Index. The product has AUM of $49.4 million and average daily volume of 15,000 shares. It charges 63 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook (see: 6 ETFs to Score High from World Cup Spending Spree).iShares Evolved U.S. Media and Entertainment ETF IEMEThis newly actively managed ETF employs data science techniques to identify companies with exposure to the media and entertainment sector.

426,VIAB,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Viacom, Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Viacom has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7.3, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.4. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Viacom’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 12.1. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Viacom has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 6.9, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Viacom stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Viacom has a P/S ratio of about 0.9. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, VIAB is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Viacom currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Viacom a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Viacom is just 0.9, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.6. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 1.7, which is far better than the industry average of 6.6. Clearly, VIAB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Viacom might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of F. This gives VIAB a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current fiscal quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to six lower, while the fiscal full year estimate has seen eight upward and three downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 6.2% in the past two months, while the fiscal full year estimate has inched lower by 0.5%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Viacom Inc. Price and Consensus  Viacom Inc. Price and Consensus | Viacom Inc. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineViacom is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 41% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock.However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has underperformed the broader market.So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick. Moreover, broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Notably, shares of Twitter have gained 65.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 15.5% rally.Twitter’s strategy to diversify from a mere micro blogging site to a destination for video and live streaming seems to be working in its favor.The social media platform recently announced reorganization of its business structure by folding the live video unit into its content partnership team that will make it “easier to put together future deals.”Variety reported that with the move, the company is adopting a regional management structure instead of the earlier one, which was category (news, sports and live video) based.Twitter’s Video PushTwitter has been focusing on ""live"" to turn around its fortunes. Live streaming has resulted in an increase in user engagement.

In the last reported quarter, video ads accounted for the majority of total advertising revenues for the company. Strength in Video Website Cards, Video App Cards, In-Stream pre-roll and mid-roll ads continue to be the key growth drivers.Moreover, video growth in Japan was attributed to surging international ad revenues, which is currently the key catalyst.Twitter, Inc.

429,VIAB,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Viacom Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 12.8% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is VIAB due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsViacom reported better-than-expected results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended Mar 31, 2018), wherein both earnings per share and revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company’s adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 92 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents. Moreover, the bottom line expanded approximately 16.5% year-over-year.Total revenues of $3.15 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04 billion. However, revenues decreased 3% from the year-ago quarter owing to lower revenues from Filmed Entertainment due to “fewer theatrical releases and the performance of Paramount's legacy slate.” This dampened growth of the Media Networks segment.Quarterly adjusted operating income increased 4.7% year over year to $641 million. Viacom exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $417 million, compared with $394 million at the end of the previous quarter.Moreover, Viacom’s debt (non-current) at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $10.1 billion, at the same level as the prior quarter.Segmental PerformanceMedia NetworksQuarterly revenues for the company’s Media networks segment were $2.43 billion, up 1% year over year. The decline in domestic revenues was offset by strong growth internationally.While domestic revenues were down 3% to $1.86 billion, international revenues surged 18% to $566 million. Foreign currency movements aided segmental results to the tune of 9%.The segment generates revenues principally from three sources: (i) affiliate revenues (ii) advertising revenues; and (iii) ancillary revenues.Total affiliate revenues remained flat at $1.16 billion. On the domestic front, the metric was down 4% to $934 million. Nevertheless, international affiliate revenues increased 23% to $222 million.Total advertising revenues were $1.11 billion, flat year over year. The 11% surge in international advertising revenues to $264 million was offset by 3% decrease in domestic advertising revenues to $841 million.Ancillary revenues increased 30% to $168 million in the quarter on the back of “consumer product, recreation and live event revenues.”Quarterly operating income (on an adjusted basis) declined 5% to $706 million in the reported quarter, owing to higher expenses.Filmed EntertainmentQuarterly revenues declined 17% year over year to $741 million due to weaknesses in three sub-groups.Notably, licensing revenues increased 37% year over year to $477 million backed by the release of “The Cloverfield Paradox” and Paramount Television product, including “The Alienist.”However, theatrical revenues were down 79%. Ancillary and home entertainment revenues declined 54% and 18%, respectively, in the reported quarter.This segment’s adjusted operating income was $9 million in the quarter against loss of $66 million in the year-ago quarter. Decline in distribution expenses owing to lower number of theatrical releases helped the company in posting the encouraging number.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

430,VIAB,"A successful investor understands the importance of adding well-performing stocks in the portfolio at the right time. Notably, indicators of a stock’s bullish run include a rise in share price and strong fundamentals.Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) is one such technology stock that has been on healthy growth trajectory, of late. The company’s shares have returned 29.3% year over year, outperforming the 28.1% rally of the industry.Let’s delve deeper and take a look at some of the factors aiding the performance.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryCisco has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive earnings surprise of 2.9%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 5%.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cisco’s current year witnessed upward revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year is pegged at $2.51 per share compared with $2.46 per share projected 30 days ago.Valuation Looks ImpressiveOn the valuation front too, the stock looks attractive. The company currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 19.9x, significantly lower than the Zacks industry’s average of 25.4x. The ratio, which is obtained by dividing a stock’s current market price with its historical or estimated earnings, measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings. Consequently, the lower the P/E of a stock, the better it is for a value investor.Q2 UpbeatCisco delivered second-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 63 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents. Further, the figure increased 6 cents from the year-ago quarter of 57 cents.Revenues increased 3% year over year to $11.887 billion and marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.817 billion. Acquisitions contributed 80 basis points (bps) to revenue growth in the quarter. Security, Infrastructure Platforms and Applications revenues increased in the quarter.Management also provided positive top-line guidance for third-quarter fiscal 2018 based on order strength and improving traction of the subscription-based model.For third-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues are projected to increase 3-5% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated between 64 cents and 66 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 62 cents, while that for revenues is at $12.18 billion.Other Driving FactorsDuring the quarter, the company closed its previously announced acquisition of BroadSoft for $1.9 billion. The planned buyout of Broadsoft will boost the company's recurring revenue base.Cisco also completed the acquisition of Skyport Systems during the quarter.The company also witnessed enhanced product adoption. The majority of the companies including the likes of Ameritas and Orange selected Cisco to improve IT security, and enhance work processes and automation.The company also announced various product innovations and partnership programs during the quarter. With emphasis on multicloud, the company announced its HyperFlex platform and Container Platform, which is expected to further expand product portfolio. The company is also reportedly working on a hyperconnected car in collaboration with Hyundai, which will help it in penetrating the smart-vehicle solutions market.We believe that Cisco’s expanding footprint in the rapidly growing security market looks promising. The company’s security solutions continue to add customers. Additionally, the company’s partnerships with Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report), Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) division Google and Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) will help Cisco gain significant traction in the cloud and IoT space in the long run.Cisco’s extended partnerships with the likes of Apple, IBM and Microsoft are also likely to bolster growth, particularly in the cloud and IoT. Moreover, Cisco joined forces with Aon and Allianz to provider better cyber risk management solutions for business, which is another positive for the company.Bottom LineLooking at these positives, we believe that Cisco is one technology stock that deserves a place in investors’ portfolio.Consequently, investing in this stock can yield returns in the short term.Zacks RankCisco carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Twitter’s year-long surge also tops its industry’s 27% gain—this industry includes the likes of Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report), PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report), and others.Maybe more impressively, shares of Twitter have skyrocketed 160% over the last two years, which outpaces social media behemoth Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) roughly 63% climb. Investors will also note Twitter’s great year to date performance.Growth InitiativesMoving on, Twitter grew its daily active user base by 10% in Q1, while its monthly active user base climbed by 3% to reach 336 million. Twitter’s MAU growth might not seem that significant, adding only 10 million new users over the last year, but every user counts when it comes to growing its top line.The company’s advertising sales—which accounted for roughly 86% of Twitter’s $665 million total Q1 revenues—climbed 21% from $474 million in the year-ago period to $575 million. Meanwhile, the social media company’s international ad revenue surged 52%.Going forward, investors should expect to see Twitter’s adverting business become even more lucrative as it expands its live video reach. Twitter streamed more than 1,300 live broadcasts in Q1 and also announced that it signed more than 30 new partnerships in the first quarter, which includes deals with the likes of Fox Sports FOXA, NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report)—which includes a ton of ESPN programming—and many more.Outlook Twitter is expected to see its Q2 revenues pop by nearly 22% to hit $698.93 million, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. For the current fiscal year, Twitter revenues are projected to hit $2.93 billion, which would mark a roughly 20% surge.Meanwhile, the company, which reported GAAP profits for the first time in Q4, is expected to see its adjusted quarterly earnings skyrocket 112.5% to $0.17 per share. The company’s fiscal 2018 earnings are also projected to soar by 68% to reach $0.74 per share.Investors should also note that Twitter has received 10 earnings estimate revisions for Q2, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 60 days. Meanwhile, during this same time frame, Twitter earned 13 upward revisions against zero downgrades for fiscal 2018.Bottom LineTwitter has been a great platform to share news instantly for years, but it had struggled to monetize its importance. Now, the company looks ready to profit from its live video push.Twitter is also currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

439,VIAB,"Shares of Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) popped on Thursday to inch closer to their 52-week high as investors continue to assess the social media company’s newly brighten outlook. With that said, let’s take a look at why Twitter stock is currently a strong buy.Twitter reported GAAP profitability in the first quarter, after doing so for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2017. This alone helps show investors that Twitter is slowly becoming a legitimate money maker and might be shedding its post-hype negativity. Growth InitiativesTwitter’s user base pales in comparison to Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), and is much closer to Snapchat (SNAP  -  Free Report). But company grew its daily active user base by 10% in Q1, while its monthly active user base popped by 3% to reach 336 million. Twitter’s MAU growth might not seem that significant, adding only 10 million new users over the last year. But investors should understand that every user counts, especially as it grows its advertising revenue.The company’s AD revenues, which accounted for roughly 86% of Twitter’s total Q1 revenue, climbed 21% from $474 million in the year-ago period to $575 million. Meanwhile, the social media company’s international ad revenue surged 52%, lifted by growth in the Asia-Pacific region. Going forward, investors should expect to see Twitter’s adverting business become even more lucrative as it expands it live video reach.One metric that helps demonstrate live video’s power and appeal to content producers and advertisers is ad engagements. Twitter saw this key figure skyrocket nearly 70% in the first quarter, while its cost per engagement dropped 28% from the year-ago quarter. Video also made up more than half of Twitter’s total advertising revenues and was the company’s fastest-growing ad segment.Twitter streamed more than 1,300 live broadcasts in Q1, with roughly 80% reaching a global audience. The company also announced that it signed more than 30 new video deals in the first quarter, which includes live-streaming rights, highlights, as well as VOD partnerships.The company locked down new deals with Fox Sports (FOXA  -  Free Report), MLB, MLS, NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report)—which includes a ton of ESPN programming—and many more well-known outlets. This streaming video push should help Twitter expand both its top and bottom lines, especially as people consume more and more content from their mobile devices.More Fundamentals & OutlookTwitter’s live video push and its bottom line growth have made its stock look far more reasonably priced. Twitter is now trading at 43.79x earnings, which marks a substantial discount compared to the “Internet – Software” industry’s average P/E of 59.92x. Shares of Twitter also currently sit roughly 10% below their 52-week high, despite the company’s strong first quarter and recent surge. This means now might be a great time to buy Twitter stock before it faces the added burden of having to break into a new range.With that said, Twitter could easily fly by its 52-week high as momentum mounts, considering that the company is expected to see its earnings and revenues continue to climb. Twitter is expected to see its Q2 revenues pop by nearly 22% to hit $698.93 million, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates.Twitter’s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to skyrocket over 112% to $0.17 per share. The company’s fiscal 2018 earnings are also projected to soar by 68% to reach $0.74 per share.Investors should also note that Twitter has received 10 earnings estimate revisions for Q2, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 30 days. Meanwhile, during this same time frame, Twitter earned 13 upward revisions against zero downgrades for its full-year. This means that analysts covering the stock have recently become more positive about the company’s bottom line expansion in 2018.Bottom LineFor years, Twitter has been a fantastic platform to share instant news. But even as it grew into a resource that is currently used by nearly every major company, public entity, and news outlet, Twitter struggled to make money. Now, Twitter finally looks like it might have hit its stride with live video—which commands much more advertising dollars than nearly all other digital mediums.Twitter is also currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that rocks an A grade for Value and a B for Momentum in our Style Scores system. Furthermore, on top of its near-term bottom line expansion, Twitter is projected to see its EPS figure expand at an annualized rate of 23.1% over the next three to five years.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

440,VIAB,"Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) has for years struggled to grow its user base, but the social media company’s push into live video could turn into a game-changing move. With that said, let’s dive into the details of Twitter’s streaming video future as it continues to secure big-time partnerships and more advertising dollars.Twitter reported GAAP profitability for the first time in the fourth quarter. This positive trend continued in the first quarter, with Twitter posting GAAP earnings of $0.08 per share. Meanwhile, the company’s Q1 revenues surged 21% to reach $665 million, which topped our Zacks Consensus Estimate of $609.3 million by a healthy margin.The social media company expanded its daily active user based by 10% year-over-year, while its monthly active user base reached 336 million. This marked only a 3% year-over-year gain, but 10 million new MAUs helped the company boost its ever-growing advertising revenue.AdvertisingTwitter's advertising revenues climbed 21% from $474 million in the year-ago period to $575 million. Investors will notice that Twitter’s ad revenue surge matched its overall revenue climb. The simple reason is that like fellow social media firms, including Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report), Twitter makes a large chunk of its money from advertising—roughly 86% in Q1.The social media company’s international ad revenue climbed by 52%, bolstered by growth in the Asia-Pacific region, highlighted by strong video performance in Japan. This advertising growth is what should give people hope that Twitter might finally be ready to turn into the money-maker many hoped it would be years ago.Twitter’s quarterly ad engagements also surged 69% in Q1, while its cost per engagement dropped 28% from the year-ago quarter. Video accounted for more than half of Twitter’s advertising revenues and was also the company’s fastest growing ad segment.Live VideoTwitter’s march toward live video success has been slow, but it seems that the company might have finally hit an inflection point. The company streamed more than 1,300 live broadcasts in Q1. Investors should also note that roughly 80% of these live-streams reached a global audience.Looking ahead, the social media company announced that it signed more than 30 new video deals last quarter. This includes live-streaming rights, highlights, as well as VOD partnerships.On its surface, 30 new video contracts might sound insignificant. But Twitter has really positioned itself well as the world shifts more and more toward streaming. The company locked down a new deal with Fox Sports (FOXA  -  Free Report) for multiple FIFA World Cup-related shows—which is by far the most popular sporting event in the world.Twitter also inked new deals with MLB and MLS, along with NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), and others. Twitter now has a live video foothold in everything from video gaming and sports to news and entertainment.Looking AheadTwitter’s live video push and its bottom line growth have also made its stock look far more reasonably priced. Twitter is now trading at 41.7x earnings, which marks a substantial discount compared to the “Internet – Software” industry’s average P/E of 58.3. Furthermore, despite its strong first quarter, Twitter stock currently sits roughly 20% below its 52-week high, which means now might be a great time to buy.Twitter’s full-year revenues are also expected to climb roughly 19% to hit $2.89 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, the company’s fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings are projected to soar by 66% to reach $0.73 per share.Bottom LineThe social media company became famous and hugely important for its breaking news and instant dissemination capabilities. Now, Twitter can couple its interactivity and breaking news features with both stand-alone and complimentary live video.Twitter is still nowhere near where Facebook and other tech companies are in terms of live video reach. But it is not hard to envision Twitter becoming a much more legitimate live streaming video player as it continues to secure deals with major content creators.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

441,VIAB,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Viacom, Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Viacom has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Viacom’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 14.1. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Viacom has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 8.3, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Viacom stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Viacom has a P/S ratio of about 1. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.7x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, VIAB is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Viacom currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Viacom a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Viacom is just 1, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.5. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, VIAB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Viacom might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of A. This gives VIAB a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen seven estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen eleven up and no down in the same time period.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 13% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has gone up by 8%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Viacom Inc. Price and Consensus Viacom Inc. Price and Consensus | Viacom Inc. QuoteThis bullish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineViacom is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 43% out of more than 250 industries) further strengthens its growth potential.So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa! The new asset class may expand even more rapidly in 2018 as new investors continue pouring in and Wall Street becomes increasingly involved.Zacks’ has just named 4 companies that enable investors to take advantage of the explosive growth of cryptocurrencies via the stock market.Click here to access these stocks. >>

Moreover, the company witnessed strong demand for the intuitive network solution in the quarter. Further, wireless revenues were strong and demand for the HyperFlex data-center solution along with Wave 2 offerings and Meraki was solid.However, continued weakness in service provider and a slowdown in enterprise routing business remained a headwind during the quarter.Management stated that the new subscription-based Catalyst 9000 switching platform has been adopted by more than 1,100 customers within a short span of time since its release. Moreover, results benefited from the continuing customer shift to 10 gig, 40 gig and 100 gig architectures.

The planned acquisition of Broadsoft will boost the company's recurring revenue base.Cisco also completed the acquisition of Skyport Systems during the quarter.Product LaunchesDuring the quarter, the company witnessed enhanced product adoption. The majority of the companies including the likes of Ameritas and Orange selected Cisco to improve IT security, and enhance work processes and automation.The company also announced various product innovations and partnership programs during the quarter. With emphasis on multicloud, the company announced its HyperFlex platform as well as its Container Platform, which is expected to further expand product portfolio. The company is also reportedly working on a hyperconnected car in collaboration with Hyundai, which will help it in penetrating the smart-vehicle solutions market.Operating DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin expanded 70 bps from the year-ago quarter to 64.7%. The increase primarily stemmed from higher product gross margin (up 90 bps) which was positively impacted by favorable product mix and improved productivity benefits.Non-GAAP operating expenses during the quarter came in at $3.9 billion, up 2% year over year.

The company’s security solutions continue to add customers. Additionally, the company’s partnerships with Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report), Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) division Google and Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) will help Cisco gain significant traction in the cloud and IoT space in the long run.Cisco’s extended partnerships with the likes of Apple, IBM and Microsoft are also likely to boost growth, particularly in the cloud and IoT. Moreover, Cisco joined forces with Aon and Allianz to provider better cyber risk management solutions for business, which is another positive for the company.However, weakness in the switching and routing is a headwind. Moreover, ongoing transition to subscription-based model will continue to hurt the top line. Further, weakness in the service provider business segment and intense competition from the likes of Huawei, Juniper and Arista Networks are other major concerns.Cisco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

443,VIAB,"Markets slipped into a correction on Thursday after a 1,000 point decline in the Dow. Both the S&P 500 and the blue-chip index closed 10% below their respective record closes on Jan 26. Further, the CBOE Volatility Index surged once again after declining for two straight sessions. Meanwhile, market watchers speculated a possible government shutdown would ensue if the budget deal is not passed by the Senate. Finally, the initial jobless claims hit a 45-year low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 4.2%, to close at 23,860.46. However, the S&P 500 fell 3.8% to close at 2,581. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 6,777.16, losing 3.9%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 14.5% to close at 31.76.A total of around 10.6 billion shares were traded on Thursday, lower than the last 20-session average of 8.2 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by an 8.26 -to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 5.58-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Markets in Correction, Major Stocks Pull BackThe Dow suffered severe losses after plummeting as much as 1,033 points on Thursday. This is the blue-chip index’s second decline by over 1,000 points during this week. Such a dip also led the Dow to finish 10.4% off its record close on Jan 26, 2018, charting its second-biggest decline in terms of points since its inception.Also, this marked its third decline by more than 500 points in a matter of five days. The blue-chip index finished at its lowest level since Nov 28, 2017 and is set to post its worst weekly decline since October 2008. Despite these losses, the Dow still managed to finish above its lowest close for the week of 23,778.74 that it hit on Tuesday.Losses for the Dow were broad based. Shares of American Express (AXP  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) declined 5.6%, 5.4% and 4.4%, respectively, contributing majorly to the Dow’s losses.The S&P 500 bled 100.7 points to end in negative territory, finishing 10.2% off its all-time high. This was it lowest close for the week, finishing below the 2,600 level and falling below its 100-day moving average. The broader index has dipped more than 2% over three of the last five sessions.All of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 ended in negative territory, with financial and technology shares leading the decliners. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) declined 4.4% and 4.1%, respectively.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq tanked 275 points to end in the red after a bloodbath in the tech shares. Shares of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) plummeted 4.8%, 4.7% and 5.1%, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Broader markets suffered huge losses on Thursday following concerns over increasing market volatility, a possible surge in inflation which might lead to a rate hike and an increase in bond yields. Analysts also stated that this correction was just a pullback from massive gains scored for the major part of 2017 and the first month of 2018. Market watchers also speculated a government shutdown would come about if the Senators do not pass the budget deal by midnight.CBOE VIX Rears its Ugly Head AgainHaving fallen for two consecutive sessions, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) surged almost 24% in intraday trade to 34.48. However, the fear gauge mellowed down to 14.5% by the end of the session. The index of market uncertainty has shown severe fluctuations over the week, highlighting the frenzy that market watchers have gone through over this period. Such panic has arisen primarily out of speculations regarding a hike in inflation even as the economy has been burgeoning.Possibility of Partial Federal ShutdownLeaders from Congress announced on Wednesday that they had agreed upon a two-year budget deal to end the uncertainty regarding government spending and immigration laws. Such tensions had led to a government shutdown earlier in the month. Agreement on the budget legislation came months after both Republicans and Democrats tried to reach a consensus on the deal.The deal seeks to increase federal spending by $300 billion over the next two years. This would exceed the ceiling that was imposed by in 2011. The deal increases military spending by $80 billion over the remainder of the fiscal year through September and further by $85 billion in fiscal 2019. This comes over and above the emerging war funds of about $140 billion.The new agreement also seeks to extend funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program by 10 years and spare another $80 billion for disaster relief funding. Moreover, the legislation also beefs up non-defense spending by $63 billion for this year and by $68 billion for 2019.The future of the deal is uncertain as it requires the support from the Democrats, who are expected to out rightly oppose any surge in government spending. Further, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wants a vote in favor of the protection of undocumented immigrants termed as ‘Dreamers’, in return for voting in favor of the budget spending. This issue has gone unaddressed in the $300 billion deal. Finally, if the deal is not passed by the midnight, the U.S. is headed for another partial federal shutdown.Jobless Claims near a 45-Year LowInitial jobless claims for the last week came in at 221,000 as opposed to 230,000 for the previous period. The consensus estimate for the current period was 233,000. The monthly average of the jobless claims plummeted 10,000 to 224,500 on Thursday. This marks its lowest level since March 1973.Stocks That Made HeadlinesViacom Q1 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Decrease Y/YViacom (VIAB  -  Free Report) reported mixed results in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31, 2017), wherein earnings per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagged the same.

445,VIAB,"The fourth-quarter 2017 earnings season is shaping up as one of the best quarters in recent times. In fact, the season has so far been spectacular, displaying all-round strength and momentum. Apart from an above-average proportion of positive surprises, we are witnessing solid upward revisions in estimate  for the current quarter.Per the Earnings Preview dated Feb 2, about 251 S&P 500 index members have reported results. Of these, about 80.5% delivered a positive earnings surprise and about 78.1% beat revenue estimates. The blended beat ratio (companies beating both earnings and revenues) so far has been 64.9%. Further, total earnings for these companies were up 16%, on 10.5% revenue growth.Undoubtedly, the fourth-quarter earnings season is on track to be among the best in recent quarters. The results are better not only in terms of enhanced growth from the same group of 251 index members but also a greater proportion beating top- and bottom-line estimates.Coming to expectations, total fourth-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to increase 13% year over year, with a 7.7% rise in revenues. This follows 6.7% earnings growth and 5.9% revenue increase recorded in the third quarter.A Look at Consumer Discretionary SectorThe performance of the index is determined by all 16 Zacks sectors, out of which 14 are estimated to witness year-over-year earnings growth. The Consumer Discretionary sector, which houses major media stocks, seems to be one among the sectors to lag this quarter. Per the report, the Consumer Discretionary sector is likely to witness earnings decline of 3.7% while revenues are expected to increase 3.7% this earnings season.Currently, the Consumer Discretionary sector is ranked among the bottom 31% (11 of 16) of all the Zacks sectors. Nonetheless, the sector has rallied 8.4% in the last three months, outperforming the S&P 500 market’s gain 2.2%. So, let’s see what awaits the following Media stocks that are queued up for earnings releases on Feb 8.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP have higher chances of delivering positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Let’s See How VIAB, NWSA, WWE & LGF.A Are PlacedLeading entertainment content company operating primarily in the United States and Europe, Viacom Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report), is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31, 2017). Although the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), our earnings beat criteria was let down by its Earnings ESP of -1.64%.Viacom Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Viacom Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Viacom Inc. QuoteViacom’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 results are likely to be hurt by weak affiliate revenues in the United States due to loss of subscribers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for affiliate revenues is pegged at $1,076 million, below $1,150 million in the previous quarter. Additionally, advertising revenues are expected to remain weak in the fiscal first quarter. Soft advertising and affiliate revenues are expected to hurt the company’s primary division — Media Networks too. Below-par performance of the company’s principal revenue generating division will naturally hurt its overall results. Moreover, higher programming expenses have the potential to hurt results in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the company’s performance on the international front is anticipated to be much better. Additionally, strong growth in international consumer products is likely to boost ancillary revenues. Similarly, internal growth should boost total advertising revenues, mitigating the weakness on the domestic front. (Read more: Will Subscriber Woes Mar Viacom's Earnings in Q1?Moving to News Corporation (NWSA  -  Free Report), this diversified media and information services conglomerate carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Moreover, the company’s current Earnings ESP is -8.11% makes surprise prediction impossible. Nevertheless, its efforts to diversify revenue streams through strategic acquisitions and operational enhancement alongside stringent cost cutting are impressive. The company is also expanding its digital offerings, emphasizing on real estate businesses and augmenting digital subscriber base.News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | News Corporation QuoteHowever, advertising, which forms a major part of total revenues, continues to be highly vulnerable to economic conditions. In fact, advertising revenues in the News and Information Services segment remained flat in the preceding quarter. This is because contributions from the buyouts of Australian Regional Media and Wireless Group, favorable foreign currency fluctuations and modest rise in digital advertising revenues were offset by sluggishness in the print advertising market and lower free standing insert revenues at News America Marketing. Previously, management had highlighted that FOX SPORTS Australia is likely to struggle against higher costs during the second quarter due to the amortization of NRL rights throughout the year. (Read more: Factors Likely to Decide News Corp's Fate in Q2 Earnings)Taking a sneak-peek at World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. (WWE  -  Free Report), we note that this integrated media and entertainment company is likely to beat expectations in the to-be reported quarter. The company fulfills the Zacks earnings beat criteria as it has an Earnings ESP of +2.56% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. QuoteWWE has garnered a stellar revenues record with sturdy growth delivered in the last three quarters. We believe this record is likely to continue as it has not only extended its earlier deal but also signed agreements with the new service provider for airing its flagship program — Raw and SmackDown — in different countries. Further, subscriber growth and worldwide increase in TV rights fees are anticipated to provide an impetus to the top line. Furthermore, revenues from international sponsorship will receive an additional stimulus from WWE’s agreement with sports marketing agency — Lagardère Sports. We believe with increasing subscription-based video streaming services, WWE Network through its vast presence in more than 180 countries will be able to capitalize on the trend. (Read more: Subscriber Growth, TV Right Fees to Drive WWE Q4 Earnings)Finally, let’s assess the earnings beat criteria for Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation (LGF.A  -  Free Report), a producer and distributor of motion pictures for theatrical and straight-to-video release. The surprise prediction for this stock is also difficult given its Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -4.19%.Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation QuoteLions Gate’s strategic acquisitions and alliances to enhance its competitive position and maximize returns along with building a diversified portfolio bode well for the company. Notably, the addition of Starz is aiding Lions Gate to emerge as a major player in the TV space and helping it regain lost ground in the streaming network. Moreover, the company has invested in The Immortals to capitalize on the increasing popularity of eSports. It expects the eSports market to grow more than$1 billion in fiscal 2018.However, fewer movie releases in fiscal 2018 compared with the previous year might hurt Motion Pictures revenue performance. Dismal television production performance in the past few quarters has also been a concern for investors. Further, the escalating cost of motion picture production and marketing in recent years may jeopardize Lions Gate’s margins.

446,VIAB,"The first-quarter 2018 earnings season has commenced on a better note than the preceding one. Per the latest Earnings Preview, “the earnings and revenue growth rates and the proportion of positive earnings surprises are tracking materially above historical periods.”As of Apr 20, 87 S&P 500 members have reported quarterly numbers. Total earnings of these companies are up 25% on a year-over-year basis (82.8% of the companies beat EPS estimates) while total revenues are up 10.7% on a year-over-year basis (67.8% of the companies beat top-line estimates).Overall first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are anticipated to be up 18.3% from the year-ago quarter on revenues that are estimated to increase 7.7%. This would be better than growth of 13.4% in fourth-quarter earnings on 8.6% higher revenues.Growth is expected to be broad-based, with double-digit earnings improvement expectation for 11 out of the 16 Zacks Sector. Apart from Finance and Technology, Energy sector is estimated to be a big contributor (earnings likely to surge 59.6% on 15.9% higher revenues).Consumer Discretionary is one of the five sectors that are expected to report single-digit earnings growth. The sector, which primarily comprises retail stocks, has been plagued by ever expanding presence of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).Media also forms a significant part of the sector. The industry has been suffering from relentless cord-cutting and stiff competition from streaming services like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu, HBO and Amazon Prime.Here we take a look at three media companies that are set to report on Apr 25.Viacom’s (VIAB  -  Free Report) second-quarter fiscal 2018 results are expected to be driven by strong international growth due to expanding market share in Latin America and India. Moreover, management expects domestic ad revenues to improve sequentially in the second quarter.However, Viacom is likely to be hurt by weak affiliate revenues in the United States owing to loss of subscribers.

These features are likely to improve customer engagement, consequently benefiting top-line growth. Comcast Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Comcast Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Comcast Corporation Quote However, we remain concerned about the company’s operation in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market. Comcast lost 33,000 video customers and 13,000 voice customers in the fourth-quarter 2017, due to cord-cutting and stiff competition.

Moreover, the company’s improving position in the automotive market is a key catalyst. Sirius XM Holdings Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Sirius XM Holdings Inc.

448,VIAB,"Meredith Corporation (MDP  -  Free Report) is expected to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 26. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 25.3%. Moreover, it has an average earnings beat of 11.6% for the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is 51 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 41.4%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $983 million compared with $425.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Factors Influencing This QuarterWith the unprecedented rise of technology, print media is dying a slow death. Increasing online readership is compelling Meredith to go the extra mile with its portfolio of magazines. Notably, the company’s strategic initiatives, particularly in the digital space, brand licensing activities, solid portfolio of television stations and robust earnings surprise history reinforce its position as one of the leading media and marketing companies.Meredith Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Meredith Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Meredith Corporation QuoteIn keeping with its strategy to focus on core operations, Meredith has decided to offload Meredith Xcelerated Marketing to Accenture. This closely followed Meredith’s announcement of a new sales and marketing structure for its National Media Group and strategic plans to integrate the recent buyout of Time Inc. This strategy mainly involves the reviewing of media asset portfolio and divestiture of non-core brands; augmenting advertising as well as circulation feat of the Time Inc. properties; increasing revenue and profits of Time Inc. digital assets; and generating cost synergies. With the completion of portfolio review, Meredith intends to sell the TIME, Sports Illustrated, Money and Fortune magazine brands.In order to strengthen its foothold in the digital space, the company teamed up with eMeals to chalk out meal plans for home cooks. For all to know, eMeals provides digital meal planning solutions. Allrecipes, Better Homes & Gardens and EatingWell users will now have access to an end-to-end meal planning app, which helps one learn recipes, prepare shopping lists and even aids in grocery fulfillment.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show a beat for Meredith this earnings season. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Meredith has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

449,VIAB,"Viacom, Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release its first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31, 2017) results on Feb 8, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company’s earnings (on an adjusted basis) of 77 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents. The bottom line, however, expanded 11.6% on a year-over-year basis owing to lower expenses and higher revenues.Quarterly revenues increased 2.9% year over year to $3,319 million. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,240.5 million. The outperformance was primarily owing to growth in the Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment units.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider This QuarterViacom’s results, in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, are likely to be hurt by weak affiliate revenues in the United States owing to loss of subscribers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2018 affiliate revenues is pegged at $1, 076 million, below $1,150 million in the previous quarter.In the United States, the company expects affiliate revenues to remain weak, particularly in the first half of fiscal 2018.  On the domestic front, the same is projected to decline in mid-single-digits in the current year.Apart from soft affiliate revenues, advertising revenues are likely to remain weak in the fiscal first quarter. In fact, soft advertising and affiliate revenues are likely to hurt the company’s primary division — Media Networks. Below-par performance of the company’s principal revenue generating division will naturally hurt its overall results. Moreover, higher programming expenses have the potential to hurt results in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the company’s performance on the international front is anticipated to be much better. Additionally, strong growth in international consumer products is likely to boost ancillary revenues. Similarly, internal growth should boost total advertising revenues, mitigating the weakness on the domestic front. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2018 advertising revenues stands at $1,313 million, above $1,220 million in the previous quarter.Performance of the company’s other division — Filmed Entertainment — is likely to be hurt by a decline in theatrical revenues in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for theatrical revenues is projected at $89 million, well below $115 million in the preceding quarter.Apart from the earnings numbers, investors are likely to keenly await for detailed commentary on the potential Viacom - CBS Corporation (CBS  -  Free Report) merger.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too does not show conclusively that Viacom will beat earnings in first-quarter fiscal 2018. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Viacom has an Earnings ESP of -1.64% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 2 cents below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Viacom carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction inconclusive. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings reflects a 5.8% decrease on a year-over-year basis, mainly due to weak advertising and affiliate revenues. The same for sales is projected at $3.1 billion, down 5.5% year over year.Viacom Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Viacom Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Viacom Inc. QuoteStocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Consumer Discretionary sector may consider the following stocks, possessing the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in their next releases.Discovery Communications (DISCA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.50% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company will report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 27.Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.48%. The Zacks #3 Ranked company is expected to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 20.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

450,VIAB,"Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 25.Earlier this month, CBS Corp (CBS) offered a below market bid for Viacom, which was immediately rejected. The CBS offer of 0.55 shares for each Viacom class B share failed to impress the owner of Nickelodeon and MTV networks.The company believes a market price of 0.62 is suitable. Notably, it expects cost synergy of $1 billion from the merger.Notably, Viacom beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.09%. In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. Viacom Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Viacom Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Viacom Inc. Quote Viacom’s top-line has also beaten the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters. In the last quarter, revenues came in at $3.07 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.14 billion and decreased 7.6% from the year-ago quarter.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderShares of Viacom have lost 0.4% on a year-to-date basis as compared with the industry’s decline of 2.5%. The decline can be attributed to the ongoing scuffle over the merger with CBS.  Moreover, growth projections are muted. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings of 80 cents per share represents a year-over-year increase of 1.3%. However, the consensus sales expectations for the second quarter stand at $3.03 billion, representing year-over-year decline of 6.91%.Viacom is likely to be hurt by weak affiliate revenues in the United States owing to loss of subscribers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2018 affiliate revenues is pegged at $1.14 billion, unchanged on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, management expects domestic ad revenues to improve sequentially in the second quarter. Ratings improvement, new original programming content, greater carriage benefits from improved distributor penetration and higher contribution from digital initiatives are key catalysts.However, the company’s performance on the international front is anticipated to be much better driven by expanding market share in Latin America and India.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a good chance of beating estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Viacom has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.77%, which indicates a likely positive surprise.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Viacom is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for VIAB in this report.Analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for VIAB, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.77% heading into earnings season.Viacom Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Viacom Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Viacom Inc.

453,VIAB,"Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) has dropped Univision Inc.’s Spanish language TV channels from its fiber-based FiOS TV network. Notably, FiOS TV has approximately 4.7 million subscribers. In a letter to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Univision complained that the U.S. telecom behemoth pulled down its TV channels at 4:59 p.m. on Oct 16, two minutes before Univision's carriage deal with Verizon was set to expire, without any prior notice to the company.Univision has urged the regulator to assure Verizon to come to the negotiation table to reach a fresh new deal. Univision is the largest Spanish-language TV broadcaster in the United States and is partially controlled by the Mexican cable MSO (multi service operator) Grupo Televisa SA (TV  -  Free Report).On the other hand, Verizon has claimed that Univision has proposed an increase of more than double of what they charge as retransmission fees for access to their channels. This is an excessive price increase by any means. The company also believes that the appeal for Univision’s programming is waning given their reported declining viewership.Conflict between TV broadcasters and pay-TV operators is not new in the United States. At present, Viacom Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) are still holding discussion to reach a negotiation. Earlier this month, The Walt Disney Co. (DIS  -  Free Report) and Altice USA Inc. (ATUS  -  Free Report) jointly signed a new retransmission deal after a bitter fight.In the last three-four years, the internal dynamics of the U.S. pay-TV industry have been gradually shifting from cable-TV operators to low-cost OTT (over-the-top) service providers. Online streaming service providers have become a severe threat to cable-TV operators because of their extremely cheap source of TV programming. The trajectory of subscriber losses in pay TV continues to signify an unprecedented annual decline as cord-cutting intensifies.Video offering, which represented the core business function of cable-TV operators, is losing popularity. At this juncture, pay-TV operators must revamp their business model otherwise they may gradually lose market share. Consequently, the TV broadcasters are also bearing the brunt of it.Price Performance of VerizonVerizon’s shares have increased 11.62%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.49% over the past 90 days.

454,VIAB,"Shares of Viacom Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week low of $25.37 per share during the trading session on Oct 9, before retracing a bit to close at $25.42. The stock has underperformed its industry in a year. It declined 28.9% in contrast to the industry’s 6.4% gain.  Reasons for the DowngradeThe company continues to face declining domestic advertising revenues. Also, the bleak outlook with respect to domestic affiliate revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter remains a concern. The company expects the metric to fall in low-single digits in the fiscal fourth quarter.Viacom’s high debt level is also a concern. The company exited the fiscal third quarter with a high debt-to-capitalization ratio of more than 66%. In fact, its long-term debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage) ratio is currently well over 100. This compares unfavorably with the industry’s tally of 57.4% and also the S&P 500 index’s reading of 84%.The company is also liable to be hurt by adverse foreign currency movement as it operates globally. Plus, cable distributorsmay intend to cut costs due to stiff competition in the cable television industry which in turn might affect media stocks like Viacom.Zacks Rank & Key PicksViacom currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Discretionary sector are American Woodmark Corporation (AMWD  -  Free Report), Anta Sports Products Ltd.

456,VIAB,"Shares of Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report) have plummeted 30% over the last year and 8% during the last 12 weeks, as its struggles mount. With that said, Viacom could see its stock price pop if the entertainment company is able to report better-than-expected quarterly earnings results.Viacom, the owner of BET, MTV, Comedy Central, and Paramount Pictures, has fallen on hard times over the last couple of years as it fails to perform well amid the rapidly changing media landscape. Investors are also likely displeased with the recent back-and-forth between Viacom and CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) and might be worried that a merger between the two media firms has become less likely. The current merger talks are unlikely to be resolved before Viacom reports its quarterly earnings results on Wednesday, April 25. Therefore, investors need to take a look at Viacom’s current quarterly estimates to help them understand if an earnings beat might be in store because it could be one of the only ways Viacom impresses in the near-term.Quarterly OutlookViacom’s quarterly revenues are projected to sink by 6.9% to hit $3.03 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, Viacom’s earnings are expected to climb by 1.3% to reach $0.80 per share.It is also worth noting that Viacom has earned three earnings estimate revisions, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 30 days. Still, investors need to know a bit more to see if Viacom is actually expected to top its current earnings estimates.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, either way.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Viacom is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an Earnings ESP of 0.77%. The company’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $0.81 per share, which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate.Therefore, investors should consider Viacom a stock that could beat quarterly earnings estimates when it reports its Q2 financial results before the market opens on Wednesday.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

463,VIAB,"The Walt Disney Company’s (DIS  -  Free Report) Star Wars: The Last Jedi is flying high at the box office, with its worldwide collection crossing the $1 billion mark. The movie which recorded the second largest opening ever has already become the eighth highest grossing movie domestically.

464,VIAB,"On Dec 27, Charter Communications Inc (CHTR  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Charter Communications is the second largest cable multi service operator (MSO) in the United States after Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report).Let’s have a look at the catalysts that led to the stock’s upgradation.Bullish Developments Charter Communications intends to venture in the U.S. wireless industry with the launch of wireless services in 2018. Notably, the company inked an agreement with national telecom behemoth Verizon Communications to operate as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO). The company will utilize Verizon’s wireless network along with its WiFi network to offer mobile services. On May 8, Charter Communications and Comcast announced their joint wireless venture to better explore their opportunities, accelerate and enhance each other’s ability to participate in the national wireless marketplace.Charter Communications has plans to execute field trials for the upcoming 5G wireless network. Notably, these trials were backed by spectrum test licenses granted to the company by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the U.S. telecom regulator.The twin buyout of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks have strengthened the company’s foothold in hybrid fiber coax (HFC) and fiber networks. The company is adopting various initiatives to improve Spectrum products and cloud-based user interfaces.The company witnesses growth in residential and commercial internet as well as voice customer addition, which is evident from increase in revenues and subscriber gain. Further, investments in business services division and rollout of several initiatives will drive upcoming results.The company’s recent activities look promising and likely to add to its prospects.Charter’s Latest Deals On Dec 13, Altice USA, Charter Communications and Comcast announced a preliminary agreement to form a new Interconnect in the New York market. This will provide a one-stop advertising solution to reach more than 6.2 million households across the New York DMA — the largest advertising market in the country. For marketers, agencies and advertisers, the new Interconnect will provide an enhanced way to strategically reach audiences through TV and digital platforms. The Interconnect is expected to be launched in second-quarter 2018.On Dec 11, Charter Communications settled a year-long content licensing dispute with Univision Communications Inc. Per sources, Univision agreed to dismiss the case against Charter Communications. The companies have informed the court about the settlement. However, the terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.On Nov 30, Charter Communications and Altice USA Inc (ATUS  -  Free Report) have reportedly inked an agreement to broadcast respective regional cable news networks. Per the deal, Charter will telecast i24NEWS, which was launched by Altice USA in January. The channel is available on Altice USA’s Optimum and Suddenlink systems. Meanwhile, Charter’s Spectrum News NY1 will be available to Optimum users in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.On Nov 15, Charter Communications and Viacom Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) announced a multi-year renewal and expansion deal of their distribution relationship. The companies formed an alliance for the co-production of original content and collaboration around advanced advertising.Price Performance The company portrays an impressive price performance backed by positive prospects, latest ventures and opportunities. On a year-to-date basis, the stock has returned 18.3% compared with the industry’s rally of 13.4%.  Estimates Trending UpWe note that the sales and Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimate for Charter Communications has moved up for fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2018.Sales growth for fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2018 are estimated to rise 3.1% and 4.4%, respectively. For 2018, sales are expected to improve 4.9%.The EPS growth for fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2018 is estimated to increase 167.1% and 54.2%, respectively. For full-year 2018, EPS is expected to soar 150.6%.DownturnsDespite such positives, Charter Communications’ presence in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market is a concern. Like other cable operators, the company continues to lose subscribers to online video streaming service providers such as Netflix, Hulu.com, YouTube etc. because of their cheap source of TV programming. Notably, in third-quarter 2017, the company lost 1,04,000 video customers in the residential segment. The company will continue to witness subscriber loss in the upcoming quarter as well.Further, gaining customers from competitors is a difficult task as most pay-TV operators are offering innovative packages. Moreover, the U.S. pay-TV industry is affected by the ongoing massive consolidation between telecom and cable-TV operators.Charter Communications’ high debt level is a potential hazard. At the end of the third quarter, the company had $2,164 million of cash and cash equivalents and $68,132 million of outstanding debt compared with $1,535 million and $62,464 million, respectively, in the year-ago quarter. The debt-to-capitalization ratio at the end of the reported quarter was 0.61 compared with 0.54 at the end of 2016.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

467,VIAB,"Investors in Viacom, Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 15, 2017 $45 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Viacom shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Viacom is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Media Conglomerates industry that ranks in the Top 40% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six analysts have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.01 per share to 89 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Viacom right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

468,VIAB,"Yesterday, the U.S. media sector saw sell-offson the double whammy of Hurricane Irma (and Harvey to some extent) and downbeat guidance issued by management of Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) and Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report). Disney lost about 4.4% on Sep 7, while it added about 0.04% after hours, and Comcast retreated about 6.2% on Sep 7.Behind the Downcast MoodFlorida is bracing up to face Hurricane Irma on Friday and has issued a state of emergency. Since the storm is deemed to be the most powerful to lash out on the U.S. mainland since 1992, Miami is readying for its largest evacuation in almost a decade (read: Hurricane Irma: ETF Winners & Losers).Though Disney remains open, many of its events have been called off. Disney's Blizzard Beach will be shut on Friday and Saturday, “the park's Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground will be closed beginning Saturday 2 P.M.”, as per the source. Disney was shut down in 2016 for Hurricane Matthew.Added to this, Disney CEO Bog Iger cautioned about profits this year which are likely to be similar to last year. The company reported $5.72 in earnings per share for fiscal 2016, which is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($5.87) for the current year.On the other hand, Universal Studios of Comcast Corporation also cancelled Saturday's ""Rock the Universe"" concert due to Irma. Comcast’s management warned about a significant drop in subscribers during the third quarter. As many as 150,000 video subscribers could be lost in the quarter.Comcast management attributed the loss in subscribers to stiff competition in the telecom sector, as the industry grapples with pressures from streaming. However, management also held two big hurricanes in the quarter responsible for subscriber loss. “Comcast management said this quarter has been one of the most competitive in recent memory,” going by an article published on MarketWatch.Impact on Industry Such downbeat indications from two industry biggies acted as a cornerstone for the entire space, though some of the players have positions in the streaming market. Altice USA Inc. (ATUS  -  Free Report), which is a broadband communications and video services provider, lost about 3.4%. Viacom Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report), a global entertainment content company, was off about 3.6%. Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) shed about 2.4%.

469,VIAB,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Viacom, Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Viacom has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7.4, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.1. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Viacom’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 13.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Viacom has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 7.4which is roughly in line with the current level. Hence the forward earnings estimates are already incorporated in the company’s current share price.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Viacom has a P/S ratio of about 0.8. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, VIAB is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Viacom currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Viacom a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, its PEG ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 1, which is better than the industry average of 1.3. Clearly, VIAB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Viacom might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of D. This gives VIAB a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging. The current quarter has seen no estimate to go higher in the past sixty days compared to six lower, while the full year estimate has seen one up and four down in the same time period.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 12% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.5%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Viacom Inc. Price and Consensus Viacom Inc. Price and Consensus | Viacom Inc. QuoteThis bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineViacom is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Bottom 40% out of more than 250 Zacks industries) further strengthens its growth potential.So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without.

470,VIAB,"World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE  -  Free Report) banks on subscriber growth, rise in TV rights fees and strategic initiatives. Though these positives instil optimism, factors like declining revenues at home entertainment and highly competitive market of entertainment video raise concerns. Further, with WrestleMania 34 around the corner, investors are treading cautiously as the stock has failed to perform post the show. Though, the stock has returned 18.3% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 2.7%, it has declined 4.4% in a month.Hidden CatalystWe believe that WWE will continue to report record revenue growth as it has not only extended previous deal with different companies but also signed agreement with new service providers for airing its flagship program Raw and SmackDown in different countries. In fact, the company’s 2016 and 2017 revenues of $729 and $801 million not only beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but also jumped 10.7% and 9.8%, respectively. The company’s record revenues primarily came on the back of a substantial increase in revenues in North America, Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) and gain in WWE Network’s total subscriber base.Revenues from international sponsorship surged in 2017, courtesy of the addition of blue-chip advertisers such as KFC, Nestlé, AT&T and other gaming partners. Moreover, in an effort to boost revenues, WWE has reached an agreement with sports marketing agency Lagardère Sports that will facilitate it to acquire international sponsorship.In the long haul, the company will continue to bank on its content distribution agreement. Recently, the company stated that distribution agreement, which generated a large chunk of television rights revenues, will expire in 2019 in some regions. Licensing of Raw and SmackDown in the United States will terminate in Sep 30, 2019, while in the UK and India it will expire on Dec 31, 2019. The company is looking to renew the distribution agreement in these regions somewhere between May 2018 and first-half 2019.After posting robust adjusted OBIDA growth in 2017, management is optimistic about witnessing another great year of OIBDA growth. In this regard, the company is targeting adjusted OIBDA of at least $115 million in 2018. Moreover, excluding stock-based compensation expenses, WWE projects adjusted OIBDA to be at least $140 million in 2018.HurdlesWWE, which distributes home entertainment content in both physical (DVD and Blu-Ray) as well as digital formats, has been witnessing decline in revenues. In 2016, home entertainment net revenues came in at $13.1 million, down from $13.4 million and $27.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Further, the trend continued in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2017, with home entertainment revenues declining 27%, 3.2%, 8% and 79%, respectively.With WrestleMania 34, to be held on Apr 8, 2018, at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans. The success of this event was earlier decided on the pay-per-views (PPV) for the show, as this was the most important source of revenue generation. The company has been broadcasting PPV since the 1980s with WrestleMania considered as the longest-running PPV event. However, with the launch of WWE Network there has been a sharp decline in PPV revenues, which is a major concern for the company.Mega event like WrestleMania is considered the Super Bowl of Sports Entertainment. Looking back, we note that WWE has not achieved its projected targets. Despite the hype, the stock has witnessed declines of 1.7%, 4.3%, 14.7% and 14.7% post the WrestleMania 33, 32, 31 and 30, respectively.Zacks Rank & Key PicksWWE carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks are Time Warner Inc. , MSG Networks Inc. (MSGN  -  Free Report) and Viacom, Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report). All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

471,VIAB,"The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) seems to be gaining ground with its latest release Star Wars: The Last Jedi raking in $450 million in the opening weekend. This is the second flick under the Lucasfilm’s latest Star Wars trilogy, the first one being Star Wars: The Force Awakens. In fact, this eighth episode of Star Wars has set expectations soaring for the final part of the trilogy — Star Wars: Episode IX in the Star Wars saga — scheduled for release in December 2019.The latest movie has got off to a great start in the domestic market, with the film earning $220 million on its opening weekend in the United States and Canada.

473,VIAB,"Walt Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) shares climbed on Tuesday morning after Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) upgraded the media giant’s stock.Wells Fargo upgraded Disney from ""market perform"" to ""outperform"" and raised its price target to $116 a share from $109 a share, which would mark a 14% gain from Friday's close. The firm pointed to Disney’s new commitment to enter the streaming and over-the-top programming sector as the key reason for its renewed faith in the media powerhouse.Disney recently announced that it expects to introduce a Disney brand direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019. The company also hopes to roll out a streaming version of the struggling ESPN channel as soon as 2018.“With DIS’s foray into direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming, we can’t help but believe the TV ecosystem will soon embark on an accelerated over-the-top (OTT) path,” Wells Fargo analyst Marci Ryvicker wrote in a note to clients Monday. “Thus, investors may need to start thinking about increasing exposure to those media cos. with solid streaming strategies, such as CBS (CBS  -  Free Report), FOXA (FOXA  -  Free Report), and DIS…”Disney announced in early August that the company would leave Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) to set up an exclusive streaming platform for all Disney and Pixar movies.""We like the entry point for DIS even if we're early. … We view the risk/reward as heavily skewed to the upside,"" Ryvicker noted. ""We continue to believe Disney is a premium brand with one of the best management teams in media.""Wells Fargo also said that if Disney’s move into video streaming is successful that “we might even see the stock return to trading at a 1-2x premium to the market, putting the stock at $128/share.”Disney’s stock has had an up and down year thus far, and shares of the conglomerate have dropped significantly from its 52-week high water mark of $116 a share that it reached in April.Shares of Disney popped over 1% in morning trading on Tuesday, but now hover around 0.50% higher than Friday’s closing price at $102 a share.Other Note Highlights Ryvicker upgraded Disney based on a strong belief in the company’s ability to successfully progress into the world of digital streaming. The same Wells Fargo note cautioned investors about media companies that don’t have enough exposure in nonlinear television.The analyst pointed to three companies—Discovery Communications (DISCA  -  Free Report), Scripps Networks , and Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report)—as media outlets that could potentially be hurt as the shift towards streaming continues to heat up.Ryvicker singled out Viacom as being particularly exposed and downgraded the stock accordingly. Ryvicker downgraded Viacom’s non-voting stock to “market perform” from “outperform.” The analyst also lowered her price target from $43 a share to $32 a share. Shares of Scripps Networks fell marginally, while Discovery Communications saw its stock price sink by around 1% to touch a new 52-week intraday trading low of $21.89 a share.Viacom’s class B shares dropped by over 3.20% to hit a new 52-week intraday trading low. The company’s voting  shares dipped by roughly 2%.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

However, management stated that the transition improves visibility, which bodes well for the company’s operations.Cisco shares have returned 12.9% year to date, slightly outperforming the industry’s 11.4% rally.  Top-line DetailsProducts (74.6% of total revenues) declined 2.7% to $9.05 billion, while services (25.4% of total revenues) increased 1% to $3.08 billion.

Americas, EMEA and APJC increased 1%, 2% and 1%, respectively.Cisco realigned its reporting segments into five distinct categories — infrastructure platform, applications, security, services and other.Routing, Switching Remain WeakInfrastructure Platforms (57.4% of first-quarter revenues) comprise Switching, NGN routing, Wireless and Data Center solutions. Revenues declined 4% from the year-ago quarter to $6.97 billion.The year-over-year decline was primarily due to sluggish routing revenues. This can be  primarily attributed to continued weakness in service provider and a slowdown in enterprise routing business. Management expects enterprise routing to be weak due to SD-WAN architectural transition.Switching revenues also declined modestly. However, the company witnessed strong demand for the intuitive network solution in the quarter.Further, wireless revenues were strong and demand for the HyperFlex data-center solution was solid.Management stated that the new subscription-based Catalyst 9000 switching platform has been adopted by more than 1,100 customers within a short span of time since its release. Moreover, results benefited from the continuing customer shift to 10 gig, 40 gig and 100 gig architectures. Additionally, rapid adoption of multi-cloud infrastructures was a key catalyst.Cisco’s ACI solution is currently used by more than 4K customers. The company believes that ACI customers are benefiting from increased business agility due to network automation, simplified management and improved security features of the product.AppDynamics Drive GrowthApplications (9.9% of revenues) consist of Collaboration portfolio of Unified Communications, Conferencing and TelePresence, Internet of Things (IoT) and application software businesses such as AppDynamics and Jasper.Segment revenues increased 6% to $1.20 billion.

Revenues fell 16% to $296 million.Services (25.4% of revenues) segment inched up 1% from the year-ago quarter to $3.08 billion. This was driven by growth in software and solutions services.AcquisitionsDuring the quarter, Cisco completed the acquisition of Springpath, Viptela and Observable networks.The company also announced the acquisition of privately held Perspica, a provider machine learning and data processing technology. The acquisition will enable Cisco’s customers to analyze large amounts of application-related data, in real time and with business context.Recently, the company announced its plan to acquire BroadSoft for $1.9 billion.Product LaunchesDuring the quarter, Cisco unveiled its management and automation platform, Cisco Intersight. The platform is designed to be compatible with the company’s Unified Computing System (UCS) and HyperFlex Systems so that adoption related complexity can be avoided.Moreover, Cisco recently launched a new portfolio of subscription offers called Business Critical and High Value Services powered by AI to predict future IT failures.Operating DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin contracted 150 bps from the year-ago quarter to 63.7%. The contraction was caused by lower product gross margin (down 180 bps), which was negatively impacted by higher memory prices (almost 130 bps).As percentage of revenues, sales & marketing (S&M) expenses declined 30 bps.  Research and development (R&D) expenses as well as general and administrative (G&A) expenses declined 40 bps and 10 bps, respectively.Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, increased 170 bps to 33.3%.As a result, Non-GAAP operating margin contracted 320 bps to 30.4%.

Cash & cash equivalents and investments available in the United States at the end of quarter were $2.5 billion.Cisco repurchased approximately 51 million shares of common stock for an aggregate price of $1.62 billion. As of Oct 28, the remaining authorized amount under the current share repurchase program is approximately $10.1 billion.GuidanceFor second-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues are expected to rise 1-3% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated between 58 and 60 cents per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 58 cents, while that for revenues is at $11.73 billion.Gross margin is expected in the range of 62.5-63.5%, while operating margin is anticipated between 29.5% and 30.5% for the quarter.ConclusionWe believe that Cisco’s expanding footprint in the rapidly growing security market looks promising. The company’s security solutions continue to add customers. Additionally, the company’s partnerships with Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report), Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) division Google and Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) will help Cisco gain significant traction in the cloud and IoT space in the long run.However, weakness in the switching and routing is a headwind. Moreover, ongoing transition to subscription-based model will continue to hurt the top line. Further, weakness in the service provider business segment and intense competition from the likes of Huawei, Juniper and Arista Networks are other major concerns.Cisco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1,148 million, below the year-ago reported figure of $1,160 million.Viacom’s high-debt levels are also concerning and might hurt the overall results in the quarter. Additionally, the company’s performance is liable to be affected by adverse foreign currency movement as it operates globally.Due to these headwinds, shares of the company have lost 17.7% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s 2.8% decline.  However, the company’s initiatives to expand its portfolio are encouraging. In order to strengthen foothold in Europe, Viacom International Media Networks, a division of Viacom, acquired the Italian free-to-air channel, LCN 49, from Scripps Networks Interactive in September. The company also announced collaboration with Cisco Systems in the same month to develop an enhanced video distribution network foundation.

483,VIAB,"Shares of Viacom, Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) tumbled to a 52-week low of $28.48 during the trading session on Aug 18. However, the figure recovered marginally to close the trading session at $28.59, down 2.1% from the closing price of Aug 17.Why the Decline?Earlier in the month, while releasing results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017,the company issued a bleak outlook with respect to domestic affiliate revenues. In fact, this New York- based company expects the metric to decline in low-single digits in the fiscal fourth quarter. The view displeased investors. Consequently, the stock declined in after-market trading on Aug 3, despite the outperformance in fiscal third quarter.Moreover, we note that Ancillary revenues at the company’s primary division, Media Networks, declined 9% to $135 million in the fiscal third quarter, primarily due to a massive 17% fall in Domestic Ancillary revenues.In fact, the company’s shares have been on a downtrend since its third-quarter fiscal 2017, losing 18.5%. Notably, investors remain concerned about the lowering rate of cable subscriptions as consumers switch to online streaming services. In comparison, the industry it belongs to has declined 5.8% in the period.Moreover, Viacom's high debt levels remain concerning. The company exited the fiscal third quarter with a debt to capitalization ratio of more than 66%, which is very high. In fact, the ratio of its long-term debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage) is currently well over 100. This compares unfavorably to the figure of 60% for its industry and also the S&P 500 index, for whom the measure reads 84%.Furthermore, the company is hurt by adverse foreign currency movement as it operates globally.Certainly Not a Broker FavoriteGiven the challenges faced by the company, it is natural that the stock is not a favorite of brokers right now. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal fourth quarter has moved down 11.9% to 89 cents in the last month, due to multiple downward revisions.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interests of investors to be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. Notably, the direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderViacom carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company has an impressive track record of beating estimates in each of the preceding four quarters with an average beat of 17.07%.Let’s see how things shape up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlayViacom’s proposed merger with CBS Corp. (CBS  -  Free Report) has been called off. National Amusements Inc., which owns the majority voting shares of both the companies, has decided that the companies should function as separate entities. This is a concern for the investors as a merger would have been beneficial for Viacom, as that would have provided it with the much-needed cost synergies. However, a lack of this development might affect the company’s results in the third quarter. Also, its high debt levels remain a big concern and are anticipated to hurt results in the to be reported quarter.Due to these headwinds, shares of the company have underperformed the industry it belongs to in the last three months. The stock has lost a massive 16.29% compared with the industry’s 2.67% loss.However, Viacom is expected to perform well on the top-line front in the fiscal third quarter, owing to higher revenues at its Filmed Entertainment segment.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Viacomis likely to beat estimates this quarter.

488,VIAB,"In the last couple of years, The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) has struck gold with almost every movie release. Analysts believe that Disney will continue to taste success at box office as the company is slated to release 21 films in the coming two years. Notably, movies will be released under Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm animated and live-action banner.Live-Action FilmsAt Disney’s D23 event, the company unveiled its movie slate, which includes live-action films like “A Wrinkle in Time”, ""The Lion King"", ""Aladdin"", ""Dumbo”. “A Wrinkle in Time” will hit the theatres on Mar 9, 2018, while ""Dumbo” will be released on Mar 29, 2019. ""The Lion King"" is scheduled for Jul 19, 2019 release. The company also revealed that Hollywood star Will Smith will be voicing the ever lovable Genie in ""Aladdin"".In the past, the company’s strategy of rehashing old animated movies into live-action remakes has paid-off well. The company’s recent live-action movie “Beauty and the Beast” collected more than $1.2 billion at the box office. Further, its earlier live-action remakes like “The Jungle Book”, “Cinderella”, “Maleficent” and “Alice in Wonderland” had garnered $967 million, $544 million, $759 million and more than $1 billion, respectively, worldwide.Other MoviesApart from the aforementioned, live-action films, Disney in the coming two years will release ""The Nutcracker and the Four Realms"", ""Mary Poppins Returns"",  ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" and ""Avengers: Infinity War"".The success of the movies will ensure great business for the company’s Consumer Products division as demand for merchandise associated with successful movies usually skyrockets as seen in case of Frozen.We note that fiscal 2016 has been a magnificent year for the company’s movie business. Four of its releases, namely, “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”, “Captain America: Civil War”, “Finding Dory” and “Zootopia” surpassed the $1 billion mark, each. The company has not disappointed movie lovers far in 2017 with hits like “Beauty and the Beast” and “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales”.Stock PerformanceDespite the fabulous run of its movies, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s shares have declined 7.9% in the past three months, in comparison with the Zacks categorized Media Conglomerates industry’s fall of 6.7%. Meanwhile, shares of Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Time Warner Inc.  have gained 4.3% and 0.1%, respectively.The success of movie business is crucial for Disney as the loss of subscribers at ESPN has been a major concern for investors. Disney’s primary cash cow, ESPN, has been under immense pressure as the Pay-TV landscape continues to change owing to migration of subscribers to online TV. Further, the recent news of the decline in rating at the company’s youth-focused Disney Channel may hurt the stock more.Key PickA better-ranked stock worth considering in the media space include Viacom, Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report), which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 17.1%.
