4,EQT,"Which famous investor said in recent times that he does not do international and never has? That would be — brace yourself for this — the founder of Vanguard and inventor of the index fund.While Jack Bogle may not be on board with investing in foreign markets, many investors are.They poured $19.19 billion into foreign stock ETFs in the first two months of this year, not too far behind the $26.93 billion of net inflow into U.S. equity ETFs over the same period, according to Morningstar data. Roughly $3.77 billion of that haul went into iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets (IEMG) and Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets (VEA) combined.Still, given the robust returns from the U.S. stock market, many investors and financial advisors are wondering whether international investments are overrated, in the view of David Garff, president and chief investment officer of Accuvest Global Advisors.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017Garff disagrees. He sees substantial value and improving relative strength in some foreign markets. And he considers the current outperformance of U.S. equities vs. international equities to be significantly stretched relative to history, setting up the stage for a reversal.Garff's investment advisory firm specializes in country-specific strategies for global investors. Its ETF-based portfolios generally hold between 10 and 20 single countries. An international tactical strategy has the ability to move to cash on certain technical triggers.Accuvest, based in California, has $375 million in assets under management. Exchange traded funds are key to its investment team's efforts in ""building equity portfolios from the top down and focusing on country selection, rather than stock selection.""In an interview with IBD, Garff discussed his best ideas for investing with ETFs in international markets as the cycle of U.S. outperformance gets ever-longer in the tooth. This is what he said:The U.S. market has had a strong run of outperformance vs. international markets, causing investors and advisors to question the wisdom of diversifying internationally.Since 1970, the typical outperformance cycle of U.S. markets vs. international markets has been just over 68 months, with an average outperformance of 79%. The current cycle is now 107 months long, with outperformance of 91%. The U.S. is also the fourth most expensive country that we follow, leading us to ask the question: Where should we be investing going forward?(Editor's note: The Global X and Deutsche ETFs are relatively small ETFs that have lower trading volumes, but the liquidity of the underlying assets matters more to investment managers like Accuvest's Garff, who can transact in the primary market.)RELATED:3 Best ETFs To Capture Improving Foreign Markets

5,EQT,"After years of calling for it privately, Barnes Hauptfuhrer decided that early 2017 was finally time to go public with his desire to see a makeover of America's hottest natural gas play.Last week, the 62-year-old sent a 10-page open letter to the board of EQT (EQT), urging the gas explorer to merge with either Range Resources (RRC) or Antero Resources (AR). That prompted Range to put out a statement saying it hadn't been contacted by EQT about a potential deal and that it had no plans to hold talks.It was a ""difficult decision"" to go public for the founder of Charlotte, N.C.-based Chapter IV Investors, who prides himself on having spent the past decade working quietly and amicably alongside corporate leaders.""It creates a bit of awkwardness,"" Hauptfuhrer acknowledged in a phone interview Friday. ""Sometimes in life you have to encourage management to think outside of the box about something big.""In this case, that ""something big"" would usher in a new era for the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, where the last decade's gas boom has helped reshape America's energy markets. The region is ""fragmented"" with too many companies and should follow the example of North America's midstream sector, which saw several multibillion-dollar deals last year, he said.The timing's right for consolidation on the production side, Hauptfuhrer said, as energy prices recover from last year's lows and it becomes clearer who the strongest companies are. Hauptfuhrer wants EQT — because of its low debt levels and high market capitalization — to lead the way by either pairing off with Range or Antero.He's calling for an all-equity transaction that would result in a company with a $25 billion enterprise value that could produce twice as much gas as any of its Marcellus and Utica rivals.Such a large-scale merger would be rare in the exploration and production sector, where companies have historically been more likely to buy up acreage or smaller assets, said Vincent Piazza, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.""The basic premise for corporate consolidation in the E&P space may not really hold,"" Piazza said. ""Usually smaller and bolt-on transactions tend to work.""Hauptfuhrer's decision to go public owed, in part, to the fact that EQT will change its leadership this spring. Starting March 31, Steven Schlotterbeck will take over as chief executive of the company.""That unique moment allows them to objectively look at the pros and cons of a potential merger of equals,"" Hauptfuhrer said. ""What we want to see is the company emerge as the 800-pound gorilla.""EQT was down 3.3%, Range fell 4.3% and Antero lost 2.3% by Monday's close. U.S. natural gas futures ended the day down roughly 5%, extending declines after capping the worst weekly loss in a year.Hauptfuhrer started Chapter IV in 2006, with plans to invest up to half of his assets in private equity and the rest in publicly traded companies. After the 2008 crisis, he decided to focus solely on the latter. He likes investing for the long term in about 10 companies. He's owned shares of EQT and Range since 2010 and Antero since 2014.Chapter IV isn't a huge player. The fund has about $250 million under management and had a less than 1% ownership stake in all three of those gas companies as of Dec. 31, he said. Beyond that, it has stakes in Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) — as well as companies in the paper and packaging and construction sectors.Hauptfuhrer expects U.S. gas output to grow by 3% annually for the next decade or two. Gas prices will stay mostly between $2.50 and $3.50 per million British thermal units for the next few years, which he acknowledges is cheap.""We are focused on owning the lowest-cost producers,"" he said. ""If you're the low-cost producer, you can still make money.""Chapter IV's name reflects the fact that Hauptfuhrer's in the fourth phase of his career, he said. He started at Kidder, Peabody during the 1980s, where he specialized in mergers and acquisitions. Then he founded and ran the private-equity group First Union Capital Partners. From there, he became co-head of First Union's — later, Wachovia's — corporate and investment bank. He left that post in 2004.Generally, he likes establishing relationships with management teams and working with them privately. He's talked with the EQT, Range and Antero management teams for years about consolidation, he said. While he knew that going public with his pitch could risk those relationships, he said the response he's heard thus far from other investors and analysts has been mostly good.""We haven't had one person, not one, who hasn't said: 'This makes a lot of sense,' "" Hauptfuhrer said. ""We think we're going down the right path.""Neither EQT nor Antero immediately responded to emailed requests for comment Friday. Range referred to its earlier statement.
"
6,EQT,"Officials expect domestic natural gas prices to rise next year, but even if prices stay steady or fall, analysts are bullish on Antero Midstream (AM) and other operators in its sector.The provider of water and other services for fracking operations is 62% owned by oil and gas exploration company Antero Resources (AR). Antero Midstream operates its parent's pipelines and compressor stations and is expanding its presence among fracking operations. It operates mostly in the southwestern core of the Marcellus Shale field in northwest West Virginia and the core of the Utica Shale field in southern Ohio.More importantly, as a supplier/distributor, it's shielded in large part from the volatility involved with the natural gas extraction business.""Overall, midstream guys are doing pretty well and aren't so directly exposed to the vagaries of commodity price movement,"" said Barrett Blaschke, a senior analyst at MUFG Securities Americas.On top of that, parent Antero Resources is hedged through 2019, giving stability and security to its master limited partnership, or MLP, with Antero Midstream. Under the rules, MLPs don't pay any taxes but have to pay out most of their profit through dividends. That makes Antero Midstream one of the stronger names in the Marcellus and Utica shale region.""What we like about the story is the way it interacts with its parent,"" Blaschke said of Antero Midstream.But even when you look at the prospects for natural gas, the outlook is bright. In a report issued recently, the Energy Information Administration said it sees natural gas spot prices rising to an average of $3.12 per million British thermal units next year — up from $2.50 this year — as consumption grows and more gas is exported to Mexico.Further, nearly half of all homes in the U.S. are heated with natural gas during the winter and the EIA said the cleaner burning fuel is expected to account for 34% of all electricity generated in the U.S. this year, topping coal, which will only account for 30%.Antero Midstream was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in Denver. Other key midstream companies in the sector — also offshoots of other companies — include Rice Energy's (RICE) Rice Midstream (RMP), EQT Corporation's (EQT) EQT Midstream (EQM) and Cone Midstream (CNNX), which was formed by Consol Energy (CNX) and Noble Energy (NBL).Antero Midstream's new water business also helps distinguish it from its peers. In hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, water is injected into wells along with sand or another type of stimulant to break free the natural gas or oil trapped in the rocks. In the third quarter, Antero Resources used 43 barrels of water per foot in the Marcellus field, up 35% from 2015 and up 2% from the second quarter.In September 2015, Antero Midstream bought its parent company's integrated water business for $1.05 billion in a deal involving cash and assumed debt. Under the transaction, Antero Midstream gets the exclusive right to provide water for Antero Resources' well-completion operations in West Virginia and Ohio.By the end of 2016, the company will have built 19 more miles of surface pipelines. It also is constructing an advanced wastewater-treatment complex scheduled for completion in late 2017.Erik Stevens, an analyst at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., said profits from water operations has accounted for 35% to 40% of earnings to date and he expects the water business to be ""underappreciated going forward.""""Antero Resources is drilling more (completed wells) and as that ramps up they'll be using more fresh water per lateral foot,"" he said.Antero Midstream also benefits from lower drilling costs at its parent. Antero Resources has cut well costs in the Marcellus field by 36% since 2014 on operational efficiencies from faster drilling and completions, and new contracts set a lower prices. Not only are Antero Resources' fields located near the key cores of the play, they're also situated near large customer bases in the Northeast.IBD'S TAKE: Antero Midstream ranks sixth among companies in IBD's Oil & Gas Transport/Pipeline group with a 90 Composite Rating while KNOT Offshore Partners (KNOP) leads the group. Antero Midstream has closed above its 50-day line since Sept. 30.""Deep proximity to demand centers in the U.S. drive growth of production in the Marcellus and Utica,"" said Brian Brungardt, analyst at Stifel.And while regulations have been a risk for pipeline companies out West — with protesters and law enforcement clashing over Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline project — natural gas pipeline companies aren't seeing too much pushback over operations in the Eastern U.S.Currently 2.5 million miles of pipeline snakes its way through the U.S. to carry oil and natural gas to processing plants and then eventually to homes and businesses. Companies have been seeing approval delays for pipelines by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Brungardt says.In Antero Resources' third-quarter conference call in October, Chief Executive Glen Warren said ""given the current environment today as it relates to pipeline projects, I think many would agree there is significant risk.""But Brungardt downplayed the risk, saying he doesn't see any risk in the near term unless things were delayed significantly.Further approval delays could be a thing of the past after Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election and with a Republican majority in both houses of Congress.In a note dated Nov. 9, Brungardt said he thinks midstream MLPs will get a boost from Trump after market volatility settles. He sees Trump offering ""a more conducive regulatory environment, and the easing of a threat to MLP tax code changes.""One caveat: MLPs could be hit by trade policy changes as Trump has been advocating ""America first"" isolationist policies.Shares of the company have camped out above their 50-day moving average since late September, despite a seven-session losing streak that ended the day before Election Day. Antero Midstream shares ended Friday trading down nearly 2%, but rebounded some of that on Monday and ended the day up more than 1% to 28.25.

Higher volume suggests institutional investors are more active in the market's move.A slight upward revision to the Commerce Department's fourth-quarter GDP estimate, as the economists' consensus had been expecting a lower result, boosted investor confidence ahead of the open. Additional lift came from markets in China and Japan, which booked positive sessions, and from Europe's markets showing healthy gains as they neared the end of their week.News on consumer outlooks was at least not negative, with the University of Michigan revising its final Consumer Sentiment Index reading for February lower, to 91.7, vs. a 92 reading in January.

The second straight advance put shares up 1.7% for the week, but still below their 10-week moving average.LinkedIn (LNKD), Veeva Systems (VEEV) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) rose more than 4%.Ligand is rebounding from a test of support at its 200-day moving average, preparing to test resistance at its 50-day line.

27,EQT,"Battered, bruised and coveted: Energy ETFs have been gutted in the past year amid falling oil prices, but investors keep piling in. The three largest exchange traded funds holding broad-based energy stocks absorbed roughly $3 billion in new money combined in the first seven months of this year.CLS Investments, an ETF strategist firm in Nebraska, has been cautiously adding to its energy stakes.""While we believe current prices are attractive, we are inclined to maintain our current overweight, without being heavy buyers,"" said senior portfolio manager J.J. Schenkelberg.She likes Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) and Fidelity MSCI Energy (FENY) for their focus on fully integrated large companies, which have strong balance sheets and react more nimbly to shifting conditions.Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are the top two holdings in both. FENY has almost a third of its assets in these two titans.Stewart Glickman, an equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, is overall negative on energy stocks.""I don't see oil prices going meaningfully higher"" for a while, he said. Oil prices hit a fresh 6-1/2-year low Monday as slowing China growth caused global panic. Plus, renewed concerns about an oil glut dog the industry.That's eroding profits for ""upstream"" exploration and production companies that get oil and gas out of the ground, as well as equipment and services companies providing the tools to get the job done.Higher RiskETFs tracking these industries have lost as much as 23% year to date. ""Industry ETFs can incur elevated risk that investors may not want,"" according to S&P Capital IQ.Still, there are pockets of opportunity for successful investing.Glickman describes ""downstream"" companies, such as refiner Valero (VLO), as benefiting from weak commodity prices. IBD 50 stock Tesoro (TSO), a Texas refiner, grew earnings 172% in the past quarter.""Crude oil prices are an input cost for them,"" Glickman said. So they are profiting from an attractive ""crack spread,"" or the difference between the price of crude oil and its refined products.A new ETF, Market Vectors Oil Refiners (CRAK), provides targeted, pure-play exposure to global oil refiners. It has a 0.59% expense ratio.Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at S&P Capital IQ, also likes Alerian MLP (AMLP).The ETF holds 23 infrastructure-related master limited partnerships, including EQT Midstream Partners (EQM). Profits for EQT and other ""midstream"" pipeline-type companies depend on the volume of oil, natural gas or electricity transported, not commodity price.Pipeline SpaceRosenbluth says ""trends are supportive"" of the pipeline space, given demand for improved energy infrastructure. Plus, he likes their income aspect.MLPs must distribute at least 90% of their profits to investors, boosting their yields.AMLP was down 15% year to date as of Friday vs. a 19% fall for XLE and 20% for FENY.ETFs based on price or earnings momentum have also held up better, relatively speaking. PowerShares Dynamic Energy Exploration & Production (PXE) was down 12% year to date as of Friday.""In a rapidly moving energy marketplace, a momentum strategy can have its benefits,"" Rosenbluth said. ""These alternative approach ETFs shift holdings and go where the style is working, instead of being static and fixed on the largest or smallest holdings.""PXE's No. 1 holding is Valero, with 7% of assets. Valero has an IBD Composite Rating of 87.

68,EQT,"After a steep run-up that began more than three months ago, stocks in IBD's Oil & Gas-Integrated industry group were down for a second straight session Friday, possibly because some investors are ready to cash in their winnings, an analyst says.The group — which includes heavyweights like Exxon Mobil (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS) and Chevron (CVX) as well as smaller leaders such as EQT (EQT) and Imperial Oil (IMO) — was down nearly 1% in midday trading in the stock market today. On Thursday, the group declined 1.2% — a day after it set a record high.Even with the recent retreat, the group is still up about 15% since Feb. 5, when it began a long, steady climb. These stocks have benefited from rising oil and gas prices in recent weeks, which has helped lure more investors to the energy sector, analysts say.""I've seen more energy investing the last few weeks than I've seen for a long time,"" said Neal Dingmann, analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. ""There are a lot of 'generalists' — investors who don't normally gravitate to energy — because of the sentiment that oil and gas prices will continue to be strong.""He says many of these investors have already seen a nice return from the sector — so nice that they're ready to start taking profits.""Some investors have been saying, 'We're already going to pack it in we've made so much money,'"" Dingmann said. ""Some of these names are up 40% to 50% for the year. That's enough of a return that some investors are ready to start taking profits.""The Oil & Gas-Integrated group ranks No. 15 of 197 that IBD tracks.

84,EQT,"Now that the haze of nostalgia is starting to settle, it's becoming clearer that Adidas' (ADDYY) American resurgence isn't just a one-off fad built on the back of fashion geeks, but perhaps a more permanent comeback to the spotlight.XAdidas' currency-neutral revenue rose 12% to 5.677 billion euros, missing estimates for 5.86 billion and sending shares down 4.55% Thursday. But the company earned 526 million euros ($610 million) in Q3, topping views for 512 million, according to Thomson Reuters, and reaffirmed full-year guidance.Where Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UAA) have recently struggled, Adidas is tearing through North America, growing currency-neutral revenue 23% to 1.1 billion euros in the quarter.""In all, Adidas continues to outperform in key markets like (North America) and Greater China despite a slowdown in (Western) Europe,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Christopher Svezia, who has a neutral rating on and 195 euro price target on the stock.""It was another very good quarter for us,"" Adidas' head of North America, Mark King, told Investor's Business Daily ahead of the late Wednesday earnings release. ""And I think it was driven, really, in multiple categories, which is really, I think, one of the exciting things about the progress of our business here in North America.""Originals, the segment that includes the now-cool-again Superstar and Stan Smith footwear, did ""a lot of the heavy lifting"" in 2016 and continues to sell well this year, he said. The NMD, Tubular and EQT lines are ""just really, really good franchises for us in '17.""But Adidas has also more than doubled its U.S. footwear market share in running over the last year, thanks to its UltraBoost, PureBoost and AlphaBounce collections, said King, who's been at the helm of the region since 2014. Growth in the training apparel category merited a shout-out, too; he noted the push to get more products on display in Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) stores.According to Matt Powell, NPD Group's sports industry analyst, Adidas leapfrogged Nike's Jordan Brand over the summer to reach the No. 2 spot domestically, less than a year after reclaiming its lead over once-impressive Under Armour.Adidas has overtaken Jordan as the #2 brand in U.S. sport footwear. This is an achievement I never thought I would see in my lifetime.— Matt Powell (@NPDMattPowell) September 18, 2017Year-to-date, Adidas' U.S.-shares are still well ahead of the game, up 36.5% through Wednesday. That's much better than Nike, which is up 10%, and Under Armour, which has plunged 59%.Like Adidas, Nike is looking to differentiate itself at the retail level with special in-store displays and strategic partnerships. Both companies are focusing on their own direct-to-consumer shops both online and off, as they look to keep pace with the way modern consumers shop. And both are directing their energies at certain major cities. Adidas announced late Wednesday the opening of a 31,000-square-foot office and ""open source collaboration hub"" in downtown Los Angeles.But Nike, the world's No. 1 athletic apparel player, has promised to trim and curate its inventory, indicating that it would pull back from stores that don't highlight its gear in favor of featuring products only on Nike.com and investing in same-day deliveries in certain cities.""Undifferentiated, mediocre retail won't survive,"" said Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards at its investor day conference late last month.King's remarks pointed to a different strategy, however, one that segments Adidas products by type of retailer — sports performance products at Dick's, for example, and more fashion, running and Originals at the mall — which offers up a whiff of exclusivity.""In terms of bringing it (exclusively) to our own retail stores — probably not. I don't see that,"" he said. ""I see us telling branded stories, with really new exciting products at our retail stores.""Similarly, Adidas' attitude toward Amazon (AMZN) splits with the Swoosh. Nike only recently announced a test run to sell its products directly through the e-commerce behemoth. But Adidas is three years into its relationship with Amazon in the U.S., calling it ""a very good customer of ours,"" even as Amazon reportedly develops a private-label sportswear collection of its own.King appeared to throw a little shade Nike's way.""We're looking and exploring opportunities not only with them but (with) everybody,"" he said, ""so any announcement by anyone else to me is a little strange, to be honest, because I don't know how you would do business and not include Amazon.""IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is moving in on traditional retail's turf, in more ways than one. Read our recent cover story on how e-commerce giant's private label lines are giving clothing kings a run for their money. Lastly, for those with a score to settle, there's this.NPD analyst Powell, which GQ recently called ""the best-credentialed Yeezy hater in the sneaker world,"" has repeatedly brushed off the idea that rapper Kanye West or any other celebrity is the force behind Adidas' current momentum, a notion that infuriates sneakerheads in the Twittersphere.Lucky for Adidas that neither are that important to success— Matt Powell (@NPDMattPowell) November 9, 2017So we asked King to weigh in.""My take is this: I think if you really understand what's happened to the brand in North America, it's honestly quite remarkable, and to point to any one thing would be a mistake,"" he said.Adidas' products in North America are ""much better than they were in '14,"" said King, highlighting Adidas' investments in retail and professional sports.""You throw on top of that the impact of Kanye West a couple of years ago, the Yeezy, wearing the UltraBoost — did it help? Absolutely, it helped,"" he said. ""Did it create what we have today? I don't think so.""West's influence is ""just one piece of many things that we've been able to do successfully over the last three years,"" he said. ""So I think it's a pretty easy answer, I don't think it's that complicated. . . It definitely helps, but certainly it's not what's defined our success.""RELATED:'Undifferentiated, Mediocre Retail Won't Survive': Nike Rolls Out Retail RevampUnder Armour Reportedly Mulls Getting Out Of These CategoriesHow Private Labels Are Looking To Be Amazon, Target's Next Cash CowRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To Watch

86,EQT,"Stocks posted a weak open Thursday after Asia's stock markets slumped and as U.S. investors factored fresh inflation data into next week's Fed policy vote.XThe Dow Jones industrial average opened a fraction in the red, while the S&P 500 slid 0.3% and 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5%.Economic news rose into the headlines Thursday, beginning with Asian stock markets, which put an early, negative spin on global trade. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 dipped 0.3% to snap a three-day rally, and China's markets shifted lower after the country's industrial output slowed to below forecasts for a second straight month in August.Leading U.S.-traded China names were under firm early pressure, with Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA), JD.Com (JD), Sina (SINA) and New Oriental Education (EDU) all opening down more than 1%.Europe's markets traded lower after the Bank of England voted to hold its rate policy unchanged.Consumer prices rose 0.4% in August, the Labor Department estimated. That was well above July's 0.1% uptick, and slightly above consensus views for a 0.3% increase.Core prices, minus gas and food, gained 0.2%, above a 0.1% gain in July and in line with expectations.  The data is some of the last reading investors will receive on price inflation pressure — or the lack of it — ahead of a key policy shift expected to be announced following next week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.The Labor Department also reported first-time unemployment claims dipped to 284,000 in the week ended Sept. 9, down from the prior week's 298,000 claims and far below estimates for an increase to 302,000 applications. The four-week moving average for claims jumped to 263,260, up from 250,250.Apple (AAPL) dropped 0.4% at the open, and Microsoft (MSFT) dived 0.8% to the bottom of the Dow, down 0.4% apiece. Apple has now been trading tight for nearly seven weeks since first clearing a buy point at 156.75, making the buy point all but meaningless. A rebound in strong trade from the stock's 10-week moving average (or a breakdown below that line), and a break of resistance to move to new highs above 165 are more likely to signal when the stock is next set to be on the move.Chevron (CVX) topped the Dow, up 0.7%. Among S&P 500 stocks, oil names Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and EQT (EQT) grabbed the early lead.Hospital owner Tenet Healthcare (THC) jumped 3% at the start of trade. Tenet surged late Wednesday, after a Wall Street Journal article said the company has hired bankers to consider a possible sale. The stock ended Wednesday 30% above a mid-August low, and down 73% from a high set in July 2015.LGI Homes (LGIH) added 1% to take an early lead among IBD 50 stocks. The stock is fighting to maintain 10-week support in the sixth week of a possible basing pattern.Credit scorekeeper TransUnion (TRU) gained 0.4% trade. The IBD 50 name was looking for a rebound, suffering collateral damage and taking an 8% fall Wednesday after a data breach of peer EquiFax (EFX) data base compromised personal information of a reported 143 million consumers. Despite Wednesday's tumble TransUnion shares remain up 43% year to date.Hertz Global Holdings (HTZ) dropped 10%, after a downgrade to underweight from Morgan Stanley. The is overdue for a breather, after a run up that has left the rental car leader 153% above a late-June low. The stock is still 60% below a July 2016 high, but above key levels of technical support and showing strong signs of institutional interest.RELATED:4 Top Stocks In Buy Zones With Tech Giant Due: Investing Action PlanThe Big Picture: Record Closing Highs For Dow, Nasdaq, S&P 500 IBD Investor Research Tools Getting Started With IBDFollow The Market: Stock Market TodayUnderstand The Market: The Big Picture

87,EQT,"EQT Corp. (EQT) on Monday said it would buy Rice Energy (RICE) for roughly $6.7 billion, a move that would create a natural gas giant in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions in the eastern and Midwest portions of the U.S.Under the terms of the deal, which is set to close in the fourth quarter, EQT will pay 0.37 share and $5.30 cash per share of Rice common stock, EQT said. At Monday's close, that's equal to $25.10 per Rice share.""This transaction brings together two of the top Marcellus and Utica producers to form a natural gas operating position that will be unmatched in the industry,"" EQT CEO Steve Schlotterbeck said in a statement.The deal would also give EQT Rice's midstream holdings, and EQT would also assume around $1.5 billion in net debt and preferred equity.""Natural gas is the key to a cleaner energy world,"" Rice Energy CEO Daniel Rice said in a statement, ""and the combination of Rice and EQT — two of the United States' largest, lowest-cost, and most responsible natural gas producers — creates an unparalleled leader in shale gas development that will benefit the environment and our shareholders for many decades to come.""EQT estimates that the purchase would more than triple its core acreage in the Marcellus Shale to 670,000, while its acreage in the Pennsylvania and West Virginia Utica shale region would expand roughly six-fold to 616,000.Shares of Rice Energy surged 25% to close at 24.57 on the stock market today, while EQT slid 9% to 53.51, losing support at its 50-day line.""The transaction makes sense for EQT, expanding its Marcellus/Utica position significantly with contiguous core acreage which adds synergies, in our view,"" Williams Capital Group analyst Gabriele Sorbara said in a research note.RELATED:Stocks Open Higher; Two Mergers Make Early HeadlinesWhy This Energy Firm May Hold Key To The 'Product Of The Future'

Visa (V) led the Dow as the payment processor stood only 1% off a new high.The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 strolled 0.3% and 0.2% higher respectively Friday, while the Dow Jones industrial average added about 0.1%. The small cap Russell 2000 popped 0.6%. Volume in the stock market today fell vs. the same time Thursday but that could change.At today's close, the Russell indexes will do their annual reconstitution. Last year, volume on the major indexes rose to twice their usual pace on Russell reconstitution day. The adjustments, though, can begin earlier. The preliminary list was issued June 9 with an update June 16. And IPOs are added on a quarterly basis for stability's sake.Blue chips were mostly up midday Friday. Visa led the 30 Dow components with a 1.4% advance. Recently Visa bounced off its 10-week line, establishing a secondary buy zone above 92.81.When buying a stock on a bounce off the 50-day line — an area where strong stocks will find support and then rise — it's best to grab shares as close as possible to the support line.The Dow's worst performer midday Friday was Home Depot (HD). The home-improvement retailer sliced 2% lower as it lost its 50-day line. The stock is 11% above a 137.42 buy point in a January breakout.In mid-May, Home Depot's gain was at 17%.

89,EQT,"Extracting oil and gas out of the ground is one thing, but having access to the necessary infrastructure in order to distribute those resources appropriately is quite another.
"
90,EQT,"Fortunately for Antero Resources (AR), it has mastered both sides of the equation.
"
91,EQT,"The Denver, Colo.-based oil and gas explorer and producer has mostly focused on two geographic areas: the Marcellus Shale in northern West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania, and the Utica Shale in eastern Ohio.
"
92,EQT,"The company went public last October and had 7.6 tcfe (trillion cubic feet equivalent) in proved reserves at the end of 2013. By volume those reserves were 88% natural gas, 11% natural gas liquids and 1% oil. The proportion of liquids is expected to rise to 15% by 2016.
"
93,EQT,"In Marcellus, Antero has 350,000 net acres, where it's currently running 15 rigs. That area accounts for approximately 80% of Antero's reserves. While the liquids portion of the production vs. dry gas is rather small right now, it is expected to grow to at least 15% of the production by 2015.
"
94,EQT,"""If you look at some of the operating metrics there, they've found some huge wells, they operate a large number of rigs in that region and really continue to refine their production techniques, so they're able to extract more gas per well,"" said David Beard, energy analyst at Iberia Capital Partners.
"
95,EQT,"The company is very quick at getting the best land position, he said. ""These are very prolific wells. A lot of it has to do with geology, and then you also have to have the right people to go out and sign the leases. The whole leasing process is very complicated.""
"
96,EQT,"Antero has also amassed some of the best acreage positions in the Utica Shale. It has 106,000 net acres in the core rich gas and condensate area and operates five rigs. Utica has been an emerging play, with its production run rate growing from nearly zero in 2012 to 13% in 2013, and anticipated to keep expanding in 2014 and beyond.
"
97,EQT,"Working The Wells
"
98,EQT,"The company's overall goal is to drill out its substantial — approximately 25-year — inventory of high-return, low-cost well locations, writes Beard in a research report.
"
99,EQT,"In addition to its solid drilling activities, Antero has also been the frontrunner in establishing firm contracts and building out the necessary infrastructure to get its gas into the pipelines and out of the region.
"
100,EQT,"A key competitive advantage for Antero, noted Beard, is ""they've really done a good job getting what they call midstream capacity, so that's not only building their own gathering systems but then securing takeaway capacity on pipelines.
"
101,EQT,"""And they are big enough to negotiate room on the pipeline, because the pipelines need them as much as they need the pipelines.""
"
102,EQT,"The company estimates its cumulative year-end 2014 total capital investment in midstream to be $1.6 billion. This includes gathering pipelines, compressor stations and water-distribution pipeline and storage facilities.
"
103,EQT,"""I think they've been a little bit more forward-looking with how they lock up their takeaway capacity agreements,"" said David Deckelbaum, analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. ""They've been certainly ahead of peers in that regard. That's a pretty big differentiating factor. You're looking at almost over 1.5 bcf (billion cubic feet) a day of gas firm capacity in 2015.""
"
104,EQT,"Range Resources (RRC), EQT (EQT) and Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) are some of the other operators in the space.
"
105,EQT,"To monetize its midstream assets better, Antero filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 7 for an initial public offering of its midstream business as a master limited partnership, or MLP.
"
106,EQT,"""From a pricing perspective ... the benefit there is that you could potentially get a better multiple for your midstream business than what you're getting for your consolidated business right now,"" said Deckelbaum. ""As an Antero holder right now in the upstream, you would be able to benefit from the company getting a certain percentage of proceeds from that deal.""
"
107,EQT,"The company can use some of the money to fund growth endeavors in 2014 and 2015. Beard expects production to grow in the 60% to 65% range in 2014 and the 30% to 50% range through 2016.
"
108,EQT,"Given the ramp-up in drilling and production, Antero is expected to need $2.3 to $2.6 billion per year for capital expenditures. This need is driven by drilling up to 250 wells per year and adding an additional $850 million in infrastructure spending, writes Beard.
"

111,EQT,"Risk Profile
"
112,EQT,"Due to the abundance of natural gas, especially in the Marcellus Shale, there is always a risk of a collapse in gas prices. Such a collapse happened in April 2012 as natgas prices sank to $1.90 per thousand cubic feet (mcf). Because of this sensitivity, Beard says each $0.50/mcf change in gas prices would equate to a $9 change in share value.
"
113,EQT,"Other risks include problems or delays with the infrastructure, resulting in a shortage of takeaway capacity. While there have been some challenges recently, the company's guidance has allowed for some production that cannot be put to sale.
"
114,EQT,"Issues with deployment of new technologies can also pose risks. Beard notes that hydro-fracturing has come under increased scrutiny by environmental and regulatory groups, and that some groups believe ""fracking"" is damaging to the environment.
"
115,EQT,"""The science of fracturing is probably not causing a lot of these problems, but that's only one step in many, many steps to get gas to your stove,"" Beard said. ""And it only takes one innocent mistake or an unscrupulous operator to cut corners and bad things happen.""
"
116,EQT,"Antero's management has a solid track record, with CEO Paul Rady and CFO Glen Warren, Jr., having been in the oil and gas business for a long time. Private equity firms Warburg Pincus and Yorktown Energy Partners V have stakes in the company, Beard notes.
"
117,EQT,"""Management definitely has a vision and they have proven themselves to be world-class operators as it relates to getting some of the best wells in the Utica and certainly in the Marcellus,"" said Deckelbaum. ""They've done a very commendable job of managing midstream needs with upstream production. I think that's very evident in the level of production they have. I think they've done a good job.""Extracting oil and gas out of the ground is one thing, but having access to the necessary infrastructure in order to distribute those resources appropriately is quite another.Fortunately for Antero Resources (AR), it has mastered both sides of the equation.The Denver, Colo.-based oil and gas explorer and producer has mostly focused on two geographic areas: the Marcellus Shale in northern West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania, and the Utica Shale in eastern Ohio.The company went public last October and had 7.6 tcfe (trillion cubic feet equivalent) in proved reserves at the end of 2013. By volume those reserves were 88% natural gas, 11% natural gas liquids and 1% oil. The proportion of liquids is expected to rise to 15% by 2016.In Marcellus, Antero has 350,000 net acres, where it's currently running 15 rigs. That area accounts for approximately 80% of Antero's reserves. While the liquids portion of the production vs. dry gas is rather small right now, it is expected to grow to at least 15% of the production by 2015.""If you look at some of the operating metrics there, they've found some huge wells, they operate a large number of rigs in that region and really continue to refine their production techniques, so they're able to extract more gas per well,"" said David Beard, energy analyst at Iberia Capital Partners.The company is very quick at getting the best land position, he said. ""These are very prolific wells. A lot of it has to do with geology, and then you also have to have the right people to go out and sign the leases. The whole leasing process is very complicated.""Antero has also amassed some of the best acreage positions in the Utica Shale. It has 106,000 net acres in the core rich gas and condensate area and operates five rigs. Utica has been an emerging play, with its production run rate growing from nearly zero in 2012 to 13% in 2013, and anticipated to keep expanding in 2014 and beyond.Working The WellsThe company's overall goal is to drill out its substantial — approximately 25-year — inventory of high-return, low-cost well locations, writes Beard in a research report.In addition to its solid drilling activities, Antero has also been the frontrunner in establishing firm contracts and building out the necessary infrastructure to get its gas into the pipelines and out of the region.A key competitive advantage for Antero, noted Beard, is ""they've really done a good job getting what they call midstream capacity, so that's not only building their own gathering systems but then securing takeaway capacity on pipelines.""And they are big enough to negotiate room on the pipeline, because the pipelines need them as much as they need the pipelines.""The company estimates its cumulative year-end 2014 total capital investment in midstream to be $1.6 billion. This includes gathering pipelines, compressor stations and water-distribution pipeline and storage facilities.""I think they've been a little bit more forward-looking with how they lock up their takeaway capacity agreements,"" said David Deckelbaum, analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. ""They've been certainly ahead of peers in that regard. That's a pretty big differentiating factor. You're looking at almost over 1.5 bcf (billion cubic feet) a day of gas firm capacity in 2015.""Range Resources (RRC), EQT (EQT) and Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) are some of the other operators in the space.To monetize its midstream assets better, Antero filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 7 for an initial public offering of its midstream business as a master limited partnership, or MLP.""From a pricing perspective ... the benefit there is that you could potentially get a better multiple for your midstream business than what you're getting for your consolidated business right now,"" said Deckelbaum. ""As an Antero holder right now in the upstream, you would be able to benefit from the company getting a certain percentage of proceeds from that deal.""The company can use some of the money to fund growth endeavors in 2014 and 2015. Beard expects production to grow in the 60% to 65% range in 2014 and the 30% to 50% range through 2016.Given the ramp-up in drilling and production, Antero is expected to need $2.3 to $2.6 billion per year for capital expenditures. This need is driven by drilling up to 250 wells per year and adding an additional $850 million in infrastructure spending, writes Beard.Operating cash flow would increase from $500 million in 2013 to $2.3 billion by 2016. As a result, the company's net debt could climb from the $2.1 billion on its books at the end of last year to $4.3 billion by 2016, Deckelbaum notes.

127,EQT,"Natural gas is making such a resurgence that some are calling it ""the product of the future,"" and Rice Midstream Partners (RMP) is evidence of that.The natural gas distributor is a master limited partnership formed by Rice Energy (RICE), one of several companies making a big bet on natural gas. Rice Energy owns more than 40% of the relatively young Rice Midstream.Unlike many companies of its kind, Rice Midstream concentrates almost exclusively on natural gas when it comes to transporting energy.""Rice Midstream is a pure play on gathering dry gas production and getting it to the market,"" said Tristan Richardson, an equity research analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. ""Other midstream firms are diversified across wet gas and crude.""But Rice Midstream isn't the only sign energy companies are turning to natural gas for future revenue. BP (BP) has said it wants natural gas to make up 60% of its energy mix in the next 10 years.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said the liquefied natural gas market will grow four times faster than oil, and double in the next 15 years. Plus, Dow component Exxon Mobil (XOM) announced plans to build liquefied natural gas terminals in Texas and Louisiana.There are others who are joining the party in the same vein as Rice, with midstream companies founded by parent energy firms. They include Antero Resources' (AR) Antero Midstream (AM), EQT Corp.'s (EQT) EQT Midstream (EQM) and Cone Midstream (CNNX), which was formed by Consol Energy (CNX) and Noble Energy (NBL).The Oil & Gas-Transport/Pipeline group is ranked No. 84 out of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. Rice Midstream has a 92 Composite Rating, meaning it's outperforming 92% of stocks tracked by IBD. It's also on IBD's IPO leaders list.Rice Midstream debuted in December 2014 and is headquartered in Canonsburg, Pa., near the heart of the Marcellus shale oilfield in the state's Appalachian basin. That's where most of Rice Midstream's natural gas operations are.In addition to distributing natural gas, Rice Midstream supplies water for hydraulic fracturing, a key ingredient in the process. During ""fracking,"" water is injected into wells along with sand or another type of material to loosen the natural gas or oil trapped in the rocks.""The water business has tailwinds right now,"" said Brian Brungardt, a research analyst at Stifel. ""Every (exploration and production) operator continues to improve the well designs they are employing on the fracking side. Improvement largely means using more sand per well.""With more sand comes more water. Another improvement is longer laterals from each well, requiring more water.Of the midstream companies, only Antero and Rice supply water — and Rice stands out from Antero on that count as well.While Antero Midstream just services the needs of parent Antero Resources, Rice Midstream serves third-party customers like EQT, along with parent Rice Energy, its primary customer.Water accounts for 30% of Rice Midstream's operational revenue, but Richardson said the business will be a smaller piece of its operations in the next two to three years as Rice Midstream acquires more infrastructure for distributing natural gas, known as gathering.Midstream companies gather natural gas from wellheads in the field and then ship it along smaller pipelines to larger pipelines that carry gas across state borders.Rice Midstream's gathering volumes jumped 25.7% to 1.2 million cubic feet of natural gas in the fourth-quarter vs. the third quarter. Its Q4 gathering and compression revenue was up 25% to $41.8 million compared with Q3.IBD'S TAKE: Rice Midstream Partners holds a high IBD Composite Rating of 92, but it's not even the highest-ranked stock in its group. Tops on the list is Argentina's TGS (TGS). For more on that company, check here.Gathering volumes could increase even more this year as natural gas prices rise, spurring exploration and production firms to increase spending and drill more.In a January 2017 report outlining short-term production, the Energy Information Administration said it sees natural gas spot prices averaging $3.55 per million British thermal unit this year and $3.72 next year vs. an average of $2.51 in 2016.Rice Energy plans to boost 2017 net production by 59% vs. 2016 and raised its capital spending outlook to $1.035 billion for drilling and completion activity from $686 million in 2016.Even if natural gas prices fall, Rice Midstream will be shielded from commodity price fluctuations as Rice Energy is ""significantly hedged through 2017,"" said Stifel's Brungardt.But if prices were to drop and stay low for an extended period and Rice Energy scaled back production, then Rice Midstream's revenue results could take a hit on reduced volumes, according to SunTrust's Richardson.President Trump's election has given energy firms a boost as his energy policies are widely viewed as a plus for the industry as he promised to push back environmental regulations and allow drilling on federal lands.He also allowed construction on the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline to restart and said TransCanada should ""resubmit its application"" for the Keystone XL project President Obama rejected.But local politics could still inhibit drilling and pipeline expansion.""It appears the new administration early on is taking a more constructive view with various infrastructure projects, pipelines included,"" Brungardt said. ""But local opposition, that 'not in my backyard' mentality, certainly continues to be an issue.""But Richardson said the local regulatory environment has been more bullish as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state governments approved more pipelines in Appalachia in recent months, including the Williams' (WMB) Atlantic Sunrise pipeline and Energy Transfer Partners' (ETP) Rover pipeline.Brungardt has a hold rating on the stock due to valuation, but says Rice Midstream has a ""solid balance sheet."" Richardson has a buy rating on the stock.Shares of Rice slipped 1.3% to close at 24.92 Friday.RELATED:'Permania' Infects CERAWeek But Don't Count Out Bakken, Natural GasAnalysts Are Bullish On Fracking Supplier Antero Midstream

It fell through its 200-day moving average line on July 30 for the first time in more than a year. Its 50-day has now dipped below the 200-day, a bearish signal.Growing PainsVGK's peers such as iShares S&P Europe 350 (IEV) and SPDR Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 (FEZ) have traced similar moves.A core fund for international exposure, VGK holds 520 large- and midcap stocks in 17 developed European markets. It allocates 33% to the U.K., 15% to France and 13% to Germany. Top holdings include Novartis (NVS) and Roche (RHHVF).It has lost 9% year to date, as has IEV; FEZ is down 11%. Those losses were outpaced by iShares MSCI Germany's (EWG) 16% plunge.In a relative sense, currency-hedged European ETFs performed better. WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity (HEDJ) and Deutsche X-Trackers MSCI Europe Hedged Equity (DBEU) lost 3% and 4% respectively so far this year.For U.S. investors, hedged ETFs mitigate currency risk and give a ""purer return"" approximating the return of the local market, Dodd Kittsley, head of ETF strategy for Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management, wrote in a report last month.""They remain an underutilized risk-management tool, particularly in today's environment when many investors are expecting a stronger U.S. dollar,"" he said. Of course, these hedged ETFs will lose out on any further rally in the euro. So far it's rallied 2% from its Oct. 3 low.But given market conditions, Leahy does not advise direct European exposure to his clients. Still, he noted indirect exposure is inevitable when owning American companies.An ETF he likes is Market Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat (MOAT). Its top 10 holdings, he notes, include General Electric (GE) and other U.S. heavyweights with global exposure, especially to Europe.""We continue to underweight Europe and overweight U.S. large-cap companies,"" Leahy said. Small- and midcap stocks are starting to struggle as they typically do when the stock market enters the final innings of its recovery, he added.

163,EQT,"Oil and gas shipper Teekay (TK) is trading at multi-year highs thanks to a new dividend policy announced this week as well as continued high demand for oil and gas transportation services.
"
164,EQT,"The Bermuda-based company, which has a fleet of more than 170 oil and gas shipping vessels, has seen its shares rise 15% since Monday, with a fractional gain on the stock market today.
"
165,EQT,"After Monday's close, Teekay unveiled a plan that includes an 80% rise in its yearly dividend effective during the first quarter of 2015.
"
166,EQT,"On Tuesday, Teekay shares shot up 14% to 66.36. The stock fell back some a day later, then rose to a closing price of 67.04 on Thursday.
"
167,EQT,"The company's ""bold new dividend policy"" was one reason Deutsche Bank analyst Amit Mehrotra upgraded Teekay to buy from hold earlier this week.
"
168,EQT,"In addition to the 80% increase, Mehrotra said, the dividend plan includes a policy designed to link future dividend increases to cash flow growth at Teekay's two master limited partnership (MLP) subsidiaries: Teekay LNG Partners (TGP) and Teekay Offshore Partners (TOO).
"
169,EQT,"""The result should be 20%/year grow in Teekay's dividend for the foreseeable future, which together with today's increase easily justify a $90+ share price in the relatively near-term,"" Mehrotra noted.

170,EQT,"On Thursday, RBC Capital Markets analyst TJ Schultz raised his price target on Teekay to 90 from 80, saying he expects the company to sell its Knarr FPSO (Floating production, storage and offloading) unit to Teekay Offshore Partners in a transaction valued at around $1.1 billion.
"
171,EQT,"""We expect TK to take back about $200 million in TOO equity as a part of the transaction,"" Schultz wrote. ""TK will use the proceeds to pay down debt, which significantly lowers its interest burden and supports the dividend growth outlook.""

177,EQT,"The first quarter was a stock pickers' market, given the great divide between the leaders and the laggards. Coffee heated up 62% as copper was hammered 11%. Russia crashed 17% while Egypt rallied 24%.
"
178,EQT,"How should investors position their portfolios in the second quarter? We asked several professional investing strategists for their outlook on the stock market and single best ETF recommendation.
"
179,EQT,"1. Martin Kremenstein, head of U.S. ETFs at Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management with $63 billion in assets under management in New York City: I think we've seen a strong indication that the Federal Reserve under Janet Yellen will continue to taper its quantitative easing policy, which will naturally lead to a strong U.S. dollar vs. both developed and emerging market currencies.
"
180,EQT,"In this market environment, investors should consider hedging their non-U.S. equity investments against a strengthening U.S. dollar. Db X-trackers MSCI EAFE Hedged Equity (DBEF) is designed to provide exposure to securities in developed international stock markets while at the same time mitigating exposure to fluctuations between the value of the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies from 22 component countries.
"
181,EQT,"As developed markets outside of the U.S. continue to look increasingly interesting from both a valuation and recovery standpoint, the currency-hedge strategy offered by the ETF is a great investment idea for 2014. The structure of DBEF allows an investor to remain invested abroad, while still being protected against the impending rise of the U.S. dollar.
"
182,EQT,"2. Prateek Mehrotra, chief investment officer at Endowment Wealth Management with $50 million in AUM in Appleton, Wis.: Our outlook for the U.S. and global stock markets is positive for the current calendar year, albeit with a little more volatility than last year. Valuations in the U.S. are reasonable and not stretched by any parameter. Global markets are cheaper vs. the U.S. on a pure valuation basis. Equities are still cheaper relative to fixed income.
"
183,EQT,"As long as corporate America continues to churn out good earnings growth, stocks will have a tail wind, given that we still have a loose monetary-policy environment, low inflation and the global economy is continuing to grow, barring any unforeseen geopolitical event that could turn the tables.
"
184,EQT,"One area that we like as contrarians is emerging markets in general and the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) in particular. We generally do not recommend sector- or country-specific ETFs. However, we have strong contrarian conviction in Market Vectors India Small Caps (SCIF) and Guggenheim BRIC (EEB).
"
185,EQT,"SCIF has fallen over 19% annualized over the last three years, whereas EEB has fallen over 9% annualized. Assuming a reversion to the mean occurs, we believe that going forward, the returns could be higher than the rest of the markets. India's elections in May could spur a political party change at the top, which should bode well for the exchange rate and small caps. A new central banker at the helm of monetary affairs has already put a leash on runaway inflation.
"
186,EQT,"Obviously, the risks to this thesis lie in the unintended consequences from the Fed's tapering causing the continuation of money flows away from high current account deficit countries like India.
"
187,EQT,"3. Dick Wolfe, managing director at Saddle River Capital Management with $27 million AUM in Saddle River, N.J.: The market was expected to be up around 10% this year, but it looks like it's going to be up around 7% for 2014. That means the market is slow to get moving. For the next quarter, gross domestic product (growth) should pick up, as it didn't do that well in first quarter.
"
188,EQT,"We anticipate the market to be more positive in the second quarter. It is likely the weather had a lot to do with the slow market. Also risk is up a bit with the Ukraine situation and the unknown outcome of what Russia will eventually do or not do there.
"
189,EQT,"Going forward, we are bullish on health care ETFs, particularly the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV). Companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), one of the top holdings of XLV, are undervalued. With the passing of ObamaCare, there are lots more people signing on to insurance, thus making health care companies a large beneficiary of this legislation.
"
190,EQT,"The risks are a bit lower in the health care space because they are value-style companies. XLV has outperformed so far this year and will continue to do so. It has a nice dividend yield and low-volatility companies.
"
191,EQT,"4. Tim Landolt, managing director at ETF Model Solutions in Appleton, Wis.: Our firm has a positive bias towards equities for 2014 although we expect equities may see corrective activity in 2014 after the strong gains of 2013. Equities appear a bit tired right now, and we perhaps are experiencing some of that correction activity now. A correction is healthy for longer-term investors.
"
192,EQT,"While gold has received more media attention, some of the broader agricultural commodity indexes have very quietly experienced returns of 10% or more and have been holding those gains very nicely.
"
193,EQT,"Elements Rogers International Commodity Agricultural ETN (RJA) looks attractive right now. After an approximate 10% gain in the first quarter, there has been a pause the past few weeks that has been constructive and offers the possibility that could continue to advance into the second quarter.
"
194,EQT,"A confluence of factors could prolong the move, including the ongoing drought in California, livestock numbers that are near 65-year lows, growing worldwide demand from improving global economies, the drought in Brazil and the unrest in grain-producing Ukraine.
"
195,EQT,"Of course, commodities are typically more volatile than other asset classes, and prices are driven by supply-and-demand issues that are not highly predictable. For instance, drought-ending rains or a good spring planting season in the U.S. could bring a correction as investors anticipate a bumper grain crop in the fall. There is also the underlying credit risk with any ETN that investors should consider on a case-by-case basis.
"
196,EQT,"5. J. Andre Weisbrod, CEO and chief investing officer at Starr Financial Advisors with $41 million AUM in Pittsburgh, Pa.: I think this market is struggling to retain its momentum. From a historical and common-sense perspective, it (is) reasonable to expect more than a 5% correction to keep this market honest. Without a good pullback, we risk at least a modest bubble. I think this market is due for a 10% pullback, and if that doesn't happen, a sideways trading range is the second most likely scenario.
"
197,EQT,"Some sectors' and companies' prices are approaching higher valuation ranges that increase risk. We are also concerned about continued systemic risks in the financial and government sectors. We should not underestimate the risks of extreme debt ratios, fractured leadership and geopolitical risks.
"
198,EQT,"Given such conditions, we like iShares S&P Global Infrastructure Index (IGF). It offers global diversification with only about one-third of U.S. stocks, significant positions in utilities (40%), industrials (39%) and energy (19%). IGF holdings appear to be reasonably valued to slightly undervalued. Plus it is currently paying a 3.3% dividend. The global exposure is also self-hedging against any major currency fluctuations.
"
199,EQT,"This ETF is likely to hold up better than the major indexes during 10% or greater market correction. It has been going up over the past couple weeks, while the broader indexes have faltered. And the long-term total return potential, while not extraordinary, is very healthy. This is a way to keep hitting singles and scoring well rather than relying on a grand slam to win the game.
"
200,EQT,"6. Vern Sumnicht, founder and CEO of iSectors with $150 million AUM in Appleton, Wis.: Despite the poor results of the U.S. stock market and recent volatility, I still see the U.S. stock market doing well in 2014.
"
201,EQT,"The activist nature of the Federal Reserve will prevent volatility from escalating into a more serious market downturn. I've been recommending investors overweight large-cap value with a focus on those companies that have been consistently increasing dividends over the last 10 or more years. With the Fed's accommodative protection, the nice dividend yield and liquidity these dividend-yielding stocks provide are one of the few attractive places left to put all that newly printed money from central banks around the world.
"
202,EQT,"While that money has been inflating equities and keeping interest rates artificially low, at some point the newly printed money from the Fed must slow down and stop. At that point interest rates and inflation will move higher and bonds will go lower. The fear of Federal Reserve policies causes me to direct investors' fixed-income purchases toward very short-term bonds to achieve better returns than cash and avoid losing principal when interest rates do increase.
"
203,EQT,"Over the last few weeks, events in Ukraine have opened the eyes of the world to Russian president Vladimir Putin's agenda. Putin's move on Ukraine's Crimea, without a significant U.S. response to protect them, increases free-world fear and economic uncertainty, and adds to volatility.
"
204,EQT,"Investors will continue to turn to gold as an uncorrelated investment to dampen volatility. Investors also want an investment with upside potential during periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) is a satellite investment that still remains significantly undervalued and fits an increasingly volatile and uncertain market environment.
"
205,EQT,"Three years ago GDXJ was $170 a share. Today, despite moving up a bit in the first quarter it is $37 a share. This ETF holds 68 attractive gold-mining stocks; 95% are in Canada, Australia and the U.S. Investors need to remember 400% to 500% potential upside comes with risk. However, selling at book value today with increasing political uncertainty and looming inflation, I'd think there is relatively limited downside.The first quarter was a stock pickers' market, given the great divide between the leaders and the laggards.

265,EQT,"Before the Marcellus Shale leaped into prominence as the largest natural gas play in the U.S., there was the Barnett Shale in Texas.Range Resources (RRC) has worked both basins. But the Fort Worth, Texas-based firm is now largely focused on the Marcellus in Pennsylvania, which has fueled most of its growth.Range Resources is so sold on the Marcellus that it sold off all its holdings in the Barnett. The $900 million in proceeds from that sale two years ago were reinvested into the Marcellus.""The Marcellus Shale is now larger than the Barnett and the largest gas field in the U.S. by far,"" said Range's CEO Jeff Ventura. ""In fact, you could argue that its reserves' potential makes it the second largest in the world.""The largest is the South Pars/North Dome field in Iran and Qatar. As Ventura tells it, Range ""discovered"" the Marcellus and ""everyone agrees with that.""In looking to find ""the next Barnett,"" Range saw that the Marcellus Shale had a lot of the same characteristics as the Barnett.That was in 2004. Range began drilling in the Pennsylvania portion of the play soon after, using the then-new hydraulic fracturing techniques needed to crack the hard shale rock in order to extract gas. It found great commercial value there.""Barnett is a good play, but the quality of the rock and the economics don't really compete with the Marcellus,"" Ventura said.He says wells in its southwest Pennsylvania sweet spot produce three times as much as its wells had in the best spots in the Barnett.Other firms followed Range into the Marcellus in what eventually became a virtual stampede. They include Chesapeake Energy (CHK), Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), EQT Corp. (EQT) and Chevron (CVX), among others.""Chevron has good (acreage), but I would argue that ours is better,"" Ventura said. ""They're in the dry (gas) area of southwest Pennsylvania. We have the advantage of having more wet gas, plus we have more net acreage than Chevron, which gives us greater leverage for future growth.""Though Range still has some oil operations in Oklahoma and Texas, most of its production comes from the Marcellus.Range is currently one of the largest producers in the Marcellus, accounting for 10% of the basin's total production.100% PositionsWhile its 1 million net acres may be topped by a couple of other players, Ventura says Range stands out for holding 100% positions in its acreage, unlike others that often form joint ventures and other deals with third parties.Moreover, most of Range's holdings are in the core region of the play, especially the more lucrative liquids-rich southwest part of Pennsylvania. Liquids-rich gas fetches higher prices than dry gas.""The best wet gas is in the southwest corner and the heart of it is in our big position in Washington County, the bull's eye of the highest quality rock with the wet gas in it,"" Ventura said.Analyst Leo Mariani of RBC Capital Markets says Range has ""the largest net acreage position in the wet gas window,"" which makes it stand out from other operators. He says it's also a low-cost producer with ""extremely substantial inventory to drill.""Range operates 500 wells and counting in the Marcellus.Range expects to grow production 20% to 25% annually for the foreseeable future. At that pace, Ventura says, its output will double about every three years.At the end of 2012, Range was producing nearly 800,000 million cubic feet equivalent per day. He thinks the firm can get to 1.6 billion cubic feet in roughly three years. And in six years, it would be about 3 billion.That latter number is significant. It would mean Range would surpass the previous U.S. record set by a single company in a single play, the 2.6 billion cubic feet per day by ARCO in Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oilfield in the late 1970s.""The largest producing oilfield in the U.S. still is in Prudhoe, though the Bakken may surpass it,"" Ventura said.""My expectation is that (Range) will do better than that 20% to 25% (growth),"" said Mariani. ""Production in the play has grown like a weed for the last several years.""While second-quarter financial results won't be released until Wednesday, Range reported that production volume in the quarter reached a record high of 910 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day. That's a 27% gain over the prior year's same quarter.Of that total, 79% was natural gas, 15% natural gas liquids and 6% crude oil and condensate.Natural gas fetched $4.20 per mcf, natural gas liquids $32.92 per barrel and crude oil and condensate $89.09 per barrel.Natural gas prices have risen from ultralows last year of around $2. Earnings fell 17% last year to 92 cents a share due largely to ultra-low gas prices.Earnings SurgeAnalysts expect second-quarter earnings to rise 190% over last year to 32 cents a share and end the year 60% higher than in 2012, to $1.47, according to a Thomson Reuters poll. Revenue is seen growing 19% to $1.7 billion.""You're going to see strong growth and cash flow,"" Mariani said, adding he expects natural gas prices to keep trending up.But analysts from Societe Generale caution that greater activity in the Marcellus could create shortages in rigs and services, which could hurt operating margins and cash flow.And Macquarie Capital analysts note that other challenges may surface in the future if volumes ""outrun available take-away capacity.""CEO Ventura doesn't seem too worried: ""Infrastructure is better in the southwest part of the state.""

268,EQT,"Forget about low natural gas prices. Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) has location on its side.
"
269,EQT,"It works the most prolific shale gas region in the U.S., the Marcellus, near densely populated East Coast markets where demand for fuel is high.
"
270,EQT,"And within that vast region, which spans multiple states, Cabot has secured 200,000 net acres in the ""sweet spot"" of Susquehanna County in northeast Pennsylvania, says Matt Portillo, director of exploration and production research at Tudor Pickering.
"
271,EQT,"""Cabot owns one of the lowest, if not the lowest, cost dry gas plays in the U.S,"" he said. ""Cabot's wells are wildly economic.""
"
272,EQT,"Low gas prices aren't a problem for a company that can start making money on its output when natural gas prices are as low as $1.50 to $2 per million cubic feet. Prices are now around $4, still relatively low but up from last year's even lower lows of $2 to $3.
"
273,EQT,"Sustainable Free Cash Flow
"
274,EQT,"""Marcellus economics rival most oil plays even at low gas prices,"" noted Jefferies & Co. analyst Biju Perincheril in a recent report on Cabot titled, ""Promised Land: Free Cash Flow From Shale Development.""
"
275,EQT,"""Sustainable free cash flow is one of the ultimate goals of shale development, and Cabot is one of the first companies to reach it,"" Perincheril wrote. ""The company will soon have to wrestle with the novel question of what to do with all that cash.""
"
276,EQT,"How much cash? In the first quarter alone, Houston-based Cabot generated $212.7 million in cash flow from operations.
"
277,EQT,"Jefferies & Co. estimates Cabot will have a cash flow surplus of $60 million in 2013 and at least $300 million in 2014, based on a $3.60 to $4.00 gas price and $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion in capital spending.
"
278,EQT,"Portillo expects gas prices to stay range bound between $4 and $4.50 through 2015 as the number of gas rigs rises because of higher prices fetched this year and as coal takes back market share lost when natural gas prices fell below $3.
"
279,EQT,"Management didn't respond to a request for an interview. But it's indicated that higher investments in the Marcellus would be the most likely use of free cash flow. Other options include a dividend hike and share buybacks.
"
280,EQT,"Another option would be further investments in infrastructure, something akin to the Constitution Pipeline, in partnership with Williams Partners (WPZ), set to go into service in March 2015.
"
281,EQT,"The pipeline will be capable of moving 500,000 cubic feet of gas per day from Marcellus fields in northeast Pennsylvania to markets in New York and New England.
"
282,EQT,"Takeaway capacity is one of the biggest constraints to production growth. Even so, Cabot expects production to grow 35% to 50% this year.
"
283,EQT,"""As additional infrastructure projects throughout our Marcellus position come online during the year, it will afford us further increases in production,"" CEO Dan Dinges stated in the firm's first-quarter report.
"
284,EQT,"Cabot says it plans to spend around $1 billion in capital improvements in 2013.
"
285,EQT,"Perincheril calls Cabot ""a high-growth company with a top-notch position in the Marcellus.""
"
286,EQT,"The company's southern U.S. oil projects such as the Marmaton in Oklahoma and Eagle Ford in Texas are ""still side shows,"" he noted.
"
287,EQT,"Those smaller oil plays ""will struggle to compete for capital in the organization and to capture the attention of investors given the much larger scope and the outsized returns of the Marcellus,"" he said.
"
288,EQT,"Investors have already run up Cabot's stock, with shares more than doubling in the last year. Though they fell 1% Thursday,they're still up over 46% this year.
"
289,EQT,"Cabot has cornered 15% of the total supply in the Marcellus, making it one of the region's biggest players, along with Range Resources (RRC), a liquids producer; Chesapeake Energy (CHK), EQT Corp. (EQT), Southwestern Energy (SWN) and Talisman Energy (TLM), Portillo says.
"
290,EQT,"With a sixth rig Cabot expects to bring into the Marcellus in early fall, wells drilled per year could rise from around 85 to 100, Perincheril estimates.
"
291,EQT,"Seven-Fold Increase
"
292,EQT,"Through hydraulic fracturing methods, gas production in the Marcellus has soared almost sevenfold since 2009, going from 1 billion cubic feet per well a day to 7 billion currently, Portillo says.
"
293,EQT,"Cabot generally spends $6.5 million to drill and complete one well, he says. That well will produce reserves of about 14 Bcf, at the high end for the Marcellus, which starts at 4 Bcf per well for the dry gas.
"
294,EQT,"In contrast, some of the legacy fields that initially drove the shale revolution in the U.S., such as the Barnett in Texas, produce 1 to 3 Bcfs per well, Portillo adds.
"
295,EQT,"Cabot's production in the Marcellus has grown quickly, with the first quarter setting an all-time record of 89.3 Bcf equivalent, up 50% from last year.
"
296,EQT,"Dinges noted that per-unit costs were down 15% over last year's same quarter.
"
297,EQT,"Earnings in the quarter rose 90% to $54.2 million, or 26 cents a share. It was the third straight quarter of double-digit profit growth.

That well will produce reserves of about 14 Bcf, at the high end for the Marcellus, which starts at 4 Bcf per well for the dry gas.In contrast, some of the legacy fields that initially drove the shale revolution in the U.S., such as the Barnett in Texas, produce 1 to 3 Bcfs per well, Portillo adds.Cabot's production in the Marcellus has grown quickly, with the first quarter setting an all-time record of 89.3 Bcf equivalent, up 50% from last year.Dinges noted that per-unit costs were down 15% over last year's same quarter.Earnings in the quarter rose 90% to $54.2 million, or 26 cents a share. It was the third straight quarter of double-digit profit growth.Analysts expect full-year profit to grow 129% over last year to $1.51 a share, and go up another 72% next year.

299,EQT,"It was a week where oil prices finished at their highest since November 2014. Meanwhile natural gas futures fell slightly.On the news front, BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) announced the expansion of its electric vehicle charging business, while Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) is on the verge of ending its disastrous relationship with parent General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report). Meanwhile, EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report) will sell around 2.5 million non-core acres for $575 million.Overall, it was another mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained more than 8% to close at $74.15 per barrel, natural gas prices edged down some 0.7% to $2.924 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Shell, Baytex, Petrobras & OPEC)The U.S. oil benchmark hit a new three-and-a-half-year high last week on significantly higher-than-expected decline in domestic stockpiles, worries about tightening global supplies and doubts over OPEC’s ability to boost production.On the other hand, natural gas prices moved southward last week following an upward revision to EIA’s previously reported figures and forecasts for cooler temperatures that might lead to the fuel’s tepid use for air-conditioning.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    BPannounced that it has agreed to acquire Chargemaster, touted to have the largest network of charging points for electric cars in the UK.After the conclusion of the accord, BP will have the opportunity to set up ultra-fast chargers in all of its U.K.-based filling points. The united entity, BP Chargemaster, will likely own and operate roughly 1,200 forecourts of BP along with 6,500 charging units of Chargemaster. As per media reports, the transaction will be valued at $170 million.It is to be noted that BP Chargemaster will operate as a wholly owned affiliate of BP and all the current Chargemaster employees will be serving the newly-formed company. The British energy giant foresees mounting demand for electric vehicles (EV) in the coming years. From 1 million electric cars in 2016, the world will see roughly 300 million EVs by 2040, per BP.

In July 2017, General Electric had acquired Baker Hughes and merged the affiliate with its oil and gas equipment and services businesses.However, investors didn’t cheer the acquisition as following its closure, share prices of both the companies plunged. Baker Hughes has lost 39.2% since the acquisition, underperforming the 5.3% collective decline of the stocks belonging to the industry, while General Electric slipped 49.1%.

The net acres are located in Southern Appalachia. The transaction is expected to conclude in July 2018.The all-cash deal enabled the company to sell net acreages in Kentucky, Virginia, and southern West Virginia. In the last reported quarter, net production from around 12,000 wells in the area came in about 200 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. Per the company, the assets consist of net proved developed reserves of 1.6 trillion cubic feet of gas equivalent.  Around 250 employees, currently working at the site, will be transferred to Diversified Gas and Oil.The financial and operational guidance for 2018 will be revised as a result of the divestment, which the company plans to disclose in the April-June earnings report that is slated to be announced on Jul 26.

(OAS  -  Free Report) recently inked two separate deals to offload some of its non-operating assets in the Williston Basin, in a bid to upgrade its portfolio. The transaction is valued at $283 million. However, details of the buyers have been kept under wraps. The divested non-core assets comprise 65,000 acres in North Dakota and Montana, having an estimated production capacity of 4,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d).The proceeds from this transaction will enable the company to pay for the acquisition of Permian acreage from San Antonio-based Forge Energy. In an attempt to diversify its holdings away from North Dakota, Oasis Petroleum acquired around 22,000 acres in the prolific Delaware Basin earlier this year. The deal has undoubtedly opened the gateway for Oasis Petroleum in the Delaware Basin, which is the most profitable area for oil explorers of late due to low production cost.Oasis Petroleum paid a huge premium for this $946-million acquisition deal, funded through cash and stock. In order to finance the deal, the company had resorted to issuing new stocks and also planned to jettison its non-core Williston assets to raise cash. In fact, it had announced its plans to sell around 200,000 acres, accounting for 8000-10,000 Boe/d, for approximately $500 million.The latest agreements highlight the company’s progress toward its target. Oasis Petroleum remains committed to evaluate and vend the additional non-pivotal acreage in order to streamline portfolio and strengthen its position in the prolific Delaware Basin.

302,EQT,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a larger-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies. Despite the headline miss, the report pointed to a tightening market dynamic and boosted the fuel’s price, which added around 1.5% for the week.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: A Larger-than-Expected Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 106 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended May 11, slightly above the guidance (of 104 Bcf gain) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.Moreover, the third injection of the 2018 refill season was higher than both last year’s build of 64 Bcf and the 5-year (2013–2017) average addition of 87 Bcf for the reported week.Still, the current storage remains well below benchmarks. At 1.538 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – natural gas inventories are 501 Bcf (24.6%) under the five-year average and 821 Bcf (34.8%) below the year-ago figure.Fundamentally speaking, total supply of natural gas averaged around 85.6 Bcf per day, essentially flat on a weekly basis due to steady production. Meanwhile, daily natural gas consumption rose 4% to 57.5 Bcf. The increase in demand was triggered by higher natural gas usage for power generation.In other words, EIA’s latest commentary points to a tightening supply-demand balance with growing natural gas use for air-conditioning amid flat production. As a result, natural gas prices gained around 1.5% last week to settle at $2.847 per MMBtu on Friday.Positive Long-Term ThesisThe fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run, considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia-Pacific region in particular.The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow from 340 Bcf per day in 2015 to 485 Bcf per day by 2040. Countries in Asia and in the Middle East – led by China’s transition away from coal – will account for most of this increase.And it will be the world’s largest gas producer U.S., which will step up to meet this soaring demand. With domestic prices struggling to break the $3 per million Btu threshold, U.S. natural gas companies see a big opportunity in selling cheap U.S. production at higher prices to rest of the world.In fact, more than 50% of the domestic volume growth in the near future will be used for export in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG). As per Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States will vie with Australia and Qatar as the top LNG exporter by 2022.Apart from the growing use of LNG and booming exports, the replacement of coal-fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand with price eventually settling well above $3.The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report), Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy, Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report), Antero Resources Corp.

307,EQT,"Picture Thus FarThe Q3 earnings cycle is in full swing with 138 S&P 500 members that account for 32.9% of the index’s total market capitalization having reported their numbers. Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 7.3% from the same period last year on 4.9% higher revenues, with 70.3% positive earnings surprises and 68.1% beating revenue estimates.As of now, very few energy companies have reported their third-quarter results. Notably, just two energy companies on the S&P 500 index have reported their Q3 numbers. These include the major oilfield services players Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report). Schlumberger reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of 42 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and higher than the year-ago figure of 25 cents.(Read more: Schlumberger Posts In-Line Q3 Earnings, Revenues Miss)Halliburton Co. reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America. Halliburton’s income from continuing operation came in at 42 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents. Notably this is the 13th consecutive earnings beat recorded by the company. Moreover, revenues of $5,444 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,318.9 million.(Read more North American Strength Drives Halliburton Q3 Earnings)Q3 Report Card: Oil and Gas Prices End on a Positive NoteOil: Prices of oil at the end of the third quarter improved amid continued decline in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, price of oil at the end of the third quarter was $51.67 per barrel, up about 10.5% sequentially. A year ago, crude prices lingered around $45 per barrel.Natural Gas: Prices of natural gas dropped about 3.5% in the July-September period owing to the fuel’s tepid demand due to mild weather conditions and hurricane-related power outages. Despite the sequential fall, natural gas prices remain favorable when compared with the corresponding period of 2016. The commodity futures ended the quarter at $3 per MMBtu, up more than 3% from the Sep 30, 2016 settlement of $2.9 per MMBtu.Energy Companies to Gain from Higher Prices: As we know, the profitability of energy companies is directly affected by fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Therefore, all oil/gas-related stocks are poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Year-over-Year Gain Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the Q2 earnings season reflects that earnings for the sector recorded a massive 252.7% jump from the same period last year — by far the highest growth among all sectors — on 16.8% higher revenues.The energy sector is poised to see the strongest growth in Q3 again. Per our expectations, earnings for the sector are expected to jump 122% from third-quarter 2016, while the top line is likely to witness an improvement of 16.3% from the year-ago levels.Energy Stock Reporting Q3 Earnings on Oct 26Let’s see what’s in store for four energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers.Texas-based leading refinery player Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) is slated to report results before the opening bell.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 13.89%, courtesy of higher throughput margin. Moreover, Valero surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, with an average of 18.24%.Valero Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Valero Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Valero Energy Corporation QuoteValero is expected to keep its earnings streak alive this quarter also as it has the right combination of the two ingredients. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s refining segment earnings is $1,372 million, higher than $990 million recorded in the year-ago quarter and $959 million in the prior quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $20,183 million for the third quarter, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and carried a Zacks Rank #2.Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) an independent oil refiner and marketer is set to release results before the market opens.The Findlay, OH-based downstream operator has a mixed earnings surprise history. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the last four quarters. In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.96% on lower gross margins and elevated costs.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Petroleum Corporation QuoteHowever, our model indicates that Marathon Petroleum is likely to beat on earnings estimates this time, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.09%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s revenues from refining and marketing is pegged at $419 million, 36.9% higher than the reported figure in third-quarter 2016. We also expect profitability in its midstream (or pipeline transportation) segment to be 62.8% higher than the year-ago quarter to stand at $420 million. Earnings are likely to be driven by solid process and fractionation volumes, along with contribution from investments in new projects.Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of +0.14% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.Energy equipment supplier National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) will report its results after the closing bell.National Oilwell Varco has a good track record of earnings surprise history, courtesy of its cost-reduction initiatives and improved efficiencies. The company delivered average positive earnings surprise of 10.46% in the trailing four quarters.National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | National Oilwell Varco, Inc. QuoteBased on our model, National Oilwell is likely to beat on earnings even this time, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +13.04%.Rising momentum in the U.S. markets and modest improvement in international markets along with increasing consumer demand are likely to improve the revenues of the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of the Wellbore Technology segment is $672 million compared with $614 million reported in second-quarter 2017 and $526 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an earnings ESP of +10.91% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.Upstream energy player EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report) is set to report results before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 6 cents per share surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents. EQT delivered average positive earnings surprise of 102.17% in the trailing four quarters.EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | EQT Corporation QuoteHowever, our proven model does not show that EQT is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of -31.31% and a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the average daily sales volume for the current quarter is estimated at 2,303 million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfe/d), which is higher than 2,177 MMcfe/d recorded in the preceding quarter and 2,131 MMcfe/d in the year-ago quarter. The company is poised to benefit as the midstream business might rake more profits for EQT given the fact that U.S. drillers continue to bank on shale plays.However, we are concerned by the increased spending of the company. EQT is expected to spend $1.5 billion in 2017.  During first-half 2017, EQT’s operating expenses related to transportation and processing activities surged more than 66%. If the trend continues, it might hurt EQT’s earnings.Even earlier, our model did not indicate that EQT will beat on earnings this season. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of -163.91% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

308,EQT,"Activist investors are calling for a paradigm shift in compensation methods to leaders in the energy sector. The current model awards shale drillers as per growth in production. This has increased production vastly and hence CEOs' pay has also been excessive.However, the boost in production didn’t help in improving financials. Therefore, investors didn’t gain anything. This fired up investors to demand a change in the pattern of compensating executives. Investors want CEO pays to be linked to returns.Previous Methods V/S New Practice of CompensationPer the earlier norm, the executives received large compensation when they made large investments in new wells. This sparked a new age of shale gas that made the United States a global energy powerhouse and encouraged higher oil and gas drilling. In fact, the current crude output in the country amounts to a robust 9.6 million barrels a day — the highest since July 2015.Per this practice, the 10 biggest U.S. shale producers paid their chief executives $2.2 billion over the past decade despite shareholder returns of 1.7%. These companies include Apache Corp (APA  -  Free Report) and Devon Energy Corp (DVN  -  Free Report). Both these companies hold a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.On the other hand, the integrated companies like ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and others paid their executives cumulatively a total of $600 million during the same period and achieved a stronger 3.5% return.The performance of the broader oil industry can also be gauged by the returns it has delivered in comparison to the S&P 500 index. The industry’s performance did not reach any closer to the index’s return of 7.4% in the last 10 years. The difference became more prominent this year, with shares of shale producers down over 20% and the index gained about 14%.Companies like Cabot Oil & Gas Corp (COG  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) are an exception. These companies have more investor-friendly policies. Even executive compensation is calculated in a manner keeping in mind long-term benefits. Shares for executives are to be vested after three years rather than immediately. These companies also benefited due to their practices as their shares have outperformed peers. Since 2012, EOG Resources’ share price increased 96%.Gradually, other companies have started or are planning to follow suit. One such company having transformed its practice is Range Resources plc (RRC  -  Free Report). The company decided to switch policies after its shares dropped about 70% since 2012, per Reuters analysis.This comparison of prices between companies following different policies is evidence enough to establish the rationality of the more relevant strategy.On the other hand, companies not agreeing to follow suit are facing the heat. EQT Corp (EQT  -  Free Report) is one such company, which is being asked to explain the logic behind the payment of $130 million to its executive. In September, the company has agreed to eliminate that bonus and focus on efficiency and cost, not production.Even as investors get more aware, they are allocating their money to companies that compensate leaders for returns.Change is Not EasyDespite low returns, the companies will continue to increase production as they would need cash flow to pay debt and other expenses. Executives will continue with their old habits till they are paid per the production increase. Shale executives receive higher pay. For example, Noble Energy Inc’s (NBL) executive was paid $10.1 million in 2016, up 40% from 2015. SandRidge Energy Inc CEO was also awarded $18.8 million in the year the company exited bankruptcy protection.Winners & LosersIf the change is implicated, it would put an end to spending on new wells, disturbing a shale boom that has placed U.S. motorists and consumers advantageously. However, it will benefit the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers who are aggressively trying to control global crude surplus. Flourishing U.S. shale production has mainly upset OPEC output cuts expected at lifting prices. Consecutively, low oil prices have damaged shareholder returns.ConclusionIf more companies changed policies, production will decline,leading to increase in shareholder returns. These will have widespread impacts on the shale sector as well as international oil markets.If there is a change in the payment structure, shareholders will benefit from higher cash flows and less funds would be directed to drilling. The surplus funds would be distributed in the form of dividends rather than financing new shale wells. This is likely to result in higher share prices and better return on capital. But that would also mean more reserved oil production.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

309,EQT,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a smaller-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies that took inventories below their five-year average. However, unfavorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s production, induced a big drop in prices.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: A Smaller-than-Expected Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 42 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Sep 29, 2017, below the guidance (of 47 Bcf gain) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.Moreover, the increase was lower than both last year’s addition of 76 Bcf and the 5-year (2012-2016) average net injection of 91 Bcf for the reported week. This caused the current storage level – at 3.508 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – fall below the five-year average for the first time since January. Stocks are now 8 Bcf (0.2%) under the five-year average, while dropping 161 Bcf (4.4%) below the year-ago figure.Fundamentally speaking, supply remained essentially unchanged on a weekly basis at 79.7 Bcf per day, while daily natural gas consumption decreased 13.3% to 64.7 Bcf. The flattish supply could be attributed to stagnant dry natural gas production.On the demand side, the fall was triggered by sharply lower power consumption that tumbled 24.2% week over week on the back of cooler temperatures. A more than 12% dip in residential/commercial consumption further dented demand.Futures End Down Despite Bullish EIA DataShrugging off EIA’s latest commentary, natural gas prices went down 4.8% last week to settle at $2.863 per MMBtu on Friday as investors chose to concentrate on mild temperature predictions (translating into easing cooling gas demand) over the next few days. Prices were further dented by the continued strength in dry gas production, which are hovering near record levels.Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, long-term fundamentals for the commodity continue to be supportive on the back of structural imbalances. While domestic natural gas production is expected to rebound this year, the growing use of liquefied natural gas (or LNG), booming LNG and Mexican exports, replacing coal-fired power plants and higher demand from industrial projects will likely take care of the increased output.The resulting effect will ensure natural gas storage keeping pace with the five-year average in the near future, with deficits piling up later on. Over time, these secular tailwinds are likely to support natural gas sentiment and price.The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Rice Energy Inc. , Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report), Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report) and EQT Corp. (EQT  -  Free Report).As of now, we expect the fuel to continue to be range bound around $3 with little chance of any drastic increase.Want to Own a Natural Gas Stock Now?If you are looking for a near term natural gas play, PetroQuest Energy Inc.  may be a good selection.

311,EQT,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed an above-average increase in natural gas supplies. The bearish data, together with unfavorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s production, weighed on prices.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas.

This caused the current storage level – at 3.408 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – to widen its surplus to the five-year average to 67 Bcf (2%), while stocks are still 136 Bcf (3.8%) below the year-ago figure.Fundamentally speaking, supply edged up 1.4% to 80.2 Bcf per day, while daily natural gas consumption jumped 11.3% to 71.1 Bcf. The slight increase in supply could be attributed to growth in dry natural gas production and Canadian imports. On the demand side, the healthy improvement was triggered by hot weather in the East and sharply higher power consumption in Florida as demand returned to pre-Irma levels.Futures End Down After Bearish EIA DataFollowing EIA’s latest commentary, natural gas prices fell 2.2% last week to settle at $2.959 per MMBtu on Friday.

312,EQT,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed an above-average increase in natural gas supplies. However, bullish weather forecasts and lower-than-expected power loss from Hurricane Irma propped up prices.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: A Larger-than-Expected Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 91 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Sep 8, 2017, marginally above the guidance (of 88 Bcf gain) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.Worse, the increase was higher than both last year’s addition of 58 Bcf and the 5-year (2012-2016) average net injection of 63 Bcf for the reported week. This caused the current storage level – at 3.311 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – to widen its surplus to the five-year average to 43 Bcf (1.3%), while stocks are still 179 Bcf (5.1%) below the year-ago figure.Fundamentally speaking, supply remained unchanged on a weekly basis at 79.2 Bcf per day, while daily natural gas consumption declined 4.1% to 63.8 Bcf. The flattish supply could be attributed to stagnant dry natural gas production. On the demand side, the fall was triggered by sharply lower power consumption in Florida on the back of cool weather and demand loss associated with Hurricane Irma. This was partly offset by elevated residential/commercial demand due to high temperatures in parts of the Northeast and Midwest.Futures End Up Despite Bearish EIA DataShrugging off EIA’s latest commentary, natural gas prices rose 4.6% last week to settle at $3.024 per MMBtu on Friday as investors chose to concentrate on warmer-than-normal weather predictions (translating into higher cooling gas demand) toward the end of September. Prices were further supported by suggestions that the demand destruction from Irma was less than expected.Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, long-term fundamentals for the commodity continue to be supportive on the back of structural imbalances. While domestic natural gas production is expected to rebound this year, the growing use of liquefied natural gas (or LNG), booming LNG and Mexican exports, replacing coal-fired power plants and higher demand from industrial projects will likely take care of the increased output.

315,EQT,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed an above-average increase in natural gas supplies following which the commodity traded down. Worries over the fuel’s tepid demand on the back of Hurricane Irma-related power outages further pushed down natural gas prices.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: In-Line Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 65 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Sep 1, 2017, at par with the guidance as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.However, the increase was higher than both last year’s addition of 38 Bcf and the 5-year (2012-2016) average net injection of 58 Bcf for the reported week. This caused the current storage level – at 3.220 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – to slightly widen its surplus to the five-year average to 15 Bcf (0.5%), while stocks are still 212 Bcf (6.2%) below the year-ago figure.The largely unsupportive data prompted natural gas prices to fall 1.9 cents (or 0.6%) to $2.981 per MMBtu on Thursday.Fundamentally speaking, supply rose 2.3% on a weekly basis to 79 Bcf per day, while daily natural gas consumption declined 1.5% to 66.5 Bcf. The increase in supply could be attributed to higher dry natural gas production. On the demand side, the fall was triggered by sharply lower residential and commercial consumption. Meanwhile, Mexican gas exports were up some 5.1% to inch up closer to pre-Hurricane Harvey levels.Prices Suffer From Irma Impact The aftermath of Hurricane Irma also weighed on natural gas prices.With the storm cutting off electricity to at least 4.5 million customers in Florida, power and manufacturing sector consumption will be depressed for the next several days. The big storm has also brought cool temperatures to the region, limiting air conditioning demand. This prompted natural gas to end down 5.9% for the week to $2.89 per MMBtu.Further, Irma-induced demand losses – following on the heels of Hurricane Harvey’s disruptions – are set to translate into big storage builds over the coming weeks, extending the two-year old supply glut and pressurizing prices.The perceived short-term price weakness from the above factors might negatively impact natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Rice Energy Inc. , Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report), Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report) and EQT Corp. (EQT  -  Free Report). Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, long-term fundamentals for the commodity continue to be supportive on the back of structural imbalances. While domestic natural gas production is expected to rebound this year, the growing use of liquefied natural gas (or LNG), booming LNG and Mexican exports, replacing coal-fired power plants and higher demand from industrial projects will likely take care of the increased output. The resulting effect will ensure natural gas storage keeping pace with the five-year average in the near future, with deficits piling up later on. Over time, these secular tailwinds are likely to support natural gas sentiment and price.Want to Own a Natural Gas Stock Now?If you are still looking for a near term natural gas play, Range Resources Corp.

316,EQT,"Results from 179 S&P 500 members are already out, bearing evidence to a strong start this earnings season.Picture This FarPer the latest Earnings Trends report dated Apr 20, 87 S&P 500 members have already reported results with their total earnings up 25% from the same period last year on 10.7% higher revenues. Notably, 82.8% of the firms surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings, while 67.8% topped revenue estimates.So far, just five of the energy companies on the S&P 500 index have reported their Q1 results. These include Halliburton Company, Kinder Morgan, Inc., Schlumberger Limited, Baker Hughes and Hess Corporation.Both the oilfield services players, Schlumberger and Halliburton met earnings estimates, indicating that the North American drilling market remains robust, driven by increased activity. Kinder Morgan delivered an earnings beat on the back of increased contribution from the liquid terminals and Texas Interstate System. Further, Baker Hughes and Hess Corporation also delivered better than expected results.Year-over-Year Gain Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the last earnings season reflects that earnings for the energy sector saw the strongest growth, recording a massive 136.6% year-over-year gain on 23.6% higher revenues.Also, for the first quarter of 2018, we expect the energy sector to eclipse all the 16 Zacks sectors. Per our expectations, earnings for the sector are expected to jump 59.6% from first-quarter 2017, while the top line is likely to witness an improvement of 15.9% from the year-ago levels.What’s Going in Favor of the Energy SectorThe first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite record high domestic production. Per EIA data, the commodity rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at $64.87 per barrel. It goes without saying that all oil-related stocks are thus poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices, as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Crude was supported by various catalysts, including strong demand and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies. Needless to say, such favorable developments have buoyed investors’ optimism surrounding the sector’s first-quarter results.Stocks’ Earnings to Watch on Apr 26Let’s find out what’s in store for the below-mentioned five energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers on Apr 26.Contract drilling services provider Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) is expected to report fiscal second-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell.In the preceding quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 85.71% on the back of higher drilling activities at its U.S. Land Segment. Further, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 37.06% in the last four quarters.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Our proven model shows that Helmerich & Payne is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The company has an Earnings ESP of +16.93% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Recovering commodity prices along with higher rig utilization in Helmerich & Payne’s largest segment — U.S. Land segment — are expected to buoy the results this quarter also. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Helmerich & Payne’s largest segment’s operating income is pegged at $27.51 million, up from the last quarter’s figure of $24.75 million and the year-ago quarter’s operating loss of $51.85 million. (Read More: Can Helmerich & Payne Deliver a Beat in Q2 Earnings?)Pittsburgh, PA-based integrated energy company EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report) is slated to come up with January-March operational results before the opening bell.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, EQT — an Appalachia-focused natural gas firm, with primary focus on production and midstream operations — has a decent record, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate just once in the last four reports.For this quarter as well, our model predicts an earnings beat as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +18.59%.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the average daily sales volume for the first quarter is pegged at 3,959 million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfe/d), higher than 3,200 MMcfe/d in the preceding quarter and 2,110 MMcfe/d in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the Production segment is pegged at $371 million, reflecting an increase from $267 million in the last quarter and $257 million in the year-ago quarter.( Read more: EQT Corp Gears Up for Q1 Earnings: A Beat in Store?)The largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the United States, Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report), is another company to come up with quarterly numbers before the opening bell.The company boasts an excellent track record of having outperformed estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 10.26%.However, our model indicates that Valero Energy’s earnings streak might come to a halt this time around, as the company does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients. While the company carries a Zacks Rank #3, its negative Earnings ESP of 4.58% makes surprise prediction difficult.While improved refining margins and tax reform benefits bode well for the downstream operator, unplanned downtime and weather-related issues might affect Valero’s bottom line in the first quarter of 2018. (Read More: What to Expect From Valero Energy in Q1 Earnings?)Then there is Houston, TX-based exploration and production major, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), coming up with first-quarter numbers tomorrow, before the opening bell.ConocoPhillips has an average positive earnings surprise of 144.45% in the trailing four quarters. Our model indicates that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around too, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.62%.Higher expectations for prices of natural gas, natural gas liquid and crude oil will likely favor the company’s first-quarter earnings.Lastly there is Houston-based, National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report), another energy company set to report results after the closing bell.  Last quarter, the company met the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents. In the trailing four quarters, National Oilwell witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 6.9%, without missing any estimates.Our proven model does not show that National Oilwell is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -20.00%.Apparently, National Oilwell even warned investors that its first-quarter 2018 revenues are expected to miss expectations primarily due to declined progress in new offshore rig construction as well as client-associated equipment deferrals. The company expects its revenues to come in at $1.8 billion in the first quarter, reflecting 3.4% year-over-year decline.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

318,EQT,"Major oilfield service provider Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its first-quarter 2018 results on Monday, Apr 23, before market opens. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 41 cents on revenues of $5,760 million.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.2% thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America -- the company’s largest market by sales.On a further encouraging note, the world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates. Investors should note that Halliburton hasn’t missed earnings estimates since mid-2014, as you can see in the chart below:Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteEven pricewise, the stock has done better than the peer group so far this year; it is up 4.5% in 2018 as against 0.2% loss for the Zacks Oil and Gas Field Services industry. Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Houston, TX-based provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells surpasses earnings estimate this time too.Unfortunately, as per our model, the trend is likely to be broken in the first quarter. Evidently, multiple headwinds including fracking sand logistics issues have dampened expectations.Thus, while U.S. activity continues to accelerate and margins remain strong, Halliburton’s underlying results are unlikely to come ahead of our expectations. The tepid sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the estimate revision trend has been negative with four downward estimate revisions and none up in the last month.Let’s delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Halliburton’s third-quarter results.Factors to Consider This QuarterWith U.S. rig count falling to record levels in 2016, oilfield services players (like Halliburton) were hit hard. Unprecedented declines in activity levels and a sharp fall in upstream spending led to lower revenues and pricing headwinds. However, as commodity prices steadily improve and drilling activities pick up, the market for services companies is on the mend.The U.S. oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, the first quarter of the year saw U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014.Consequently, spending on exploration projects have experienced a much-awaited rebound. The energy explorers, buoyed by the jump in commodity prices, are set for improving sales and earnings – a part of which is likely to be pocketed by the oilfield service providers. In particular, the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing -- particularly for pressure pumping.As a proof of the resurgence in activities, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Completion and Production revenue is pegged at $3,822 million, higher than $3,804 million reported in the previous quarter and way above the first-quarter 2017 sales of $2,604 million. To put things in perspective, the Completion and Production unit makes up around two-thirds of the oilfield service provider’s total revenue and operating income.However, cost inflation triggered by increased fracking sand pricing is likely to drag down the company's bottom line. Rising prices of sand – used to hydraulically fracture new wells – increases the expense associated with the drilling of a new shale well and puts upward pressure on the cost of contractors like Halliburton.As it is, Halliburton had to shell out more to purchase the sand from spot markets to minimize the impact on client completion timelines after extreme weather and rail shut-downs disrupted deliveries.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Halliburton will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -3.42%.Zacks Rank: Halliburton is #3 Ranked. Though a Zacks Rank of 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Halliburton, here are some energy companies you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.33% and a Zacks Rank #3.

319,EQT,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed an in-line increase in natural gas supplies following which the commodity traded up. However, worries over the fuel’s tepid demand on the back of bearish weather predictions and Tropical Storm Harvey-related power outages offset the gains and pushed down natural gas prices to week-ago levels.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: In-Line Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 43 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Aug 18, 2017, within the guided range (of 39–50 Bcf gain) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.While the increase was higher than last year’s addition of 12 Bcf, it was well under the 5-year (2012-2016) average injection of 53 Bcf for the reported week. This caused the current storage level – at 3.125 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – narrow its surplus to the five-year average to 45 Bcf (1.5%). Meanwhile, total stocks are 223 Bcf (6.7%) lower than last year’s levels at this time. The supportive data prompted natural gas prices to climb 2.1 cents (or 0.7%) to $2.949 per MMBtu on Thursday.  Prices Suffer from Harvey ImpactEventually, the commodity ended the week at $2.892 per MMBtu, essentially unchanged for the period as the initial optimism over a modest storage addition was offset by weather and Tropical Storm Harvey-related worries.Firstly, the electricity generation fuel sold off as investors took note of cooler weather predictions (translating into tepid heating gas demand) for the week ahead. Natural gas was also down on concerns of depressed power and manufacturing sector demands due to temporary electricity outages for the next several days caused by Tropical Storm Harvey. However, with the big storm playing havoc with around 23% of total Gulf natural gas output and half of the nation’s gas processing plant capacity, the commodity’s price is set for a spike on supply disruptions.Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, the natural gas demand situation looks promising with warmer-than-average conditions set to prevail in most U.S. pockets over the next few days and power generators burning more gas to meet intensifying cooling demand. However, there are apprehensions that the peak summer demand will begin to recede within the next few weeks. In any case, long-term fundamentals for the commodity continue to be supportive on the back of structural imbalances. While domestic natural gas production is expected to rebound this year, the growing use of liquefied natural gas (or LNG), booming LNG and Mexican exports, replacing coal-fired power plants and higher demand from industrial projects will likely take care of the increased output. The resulting effect will ensure natural gas storage keeping pace with the five-year average in the near future, with deficits piling up later on. Over time, these secular tailwinds are likely to support natural gas sentiment and price.The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Rice Energy Inc. , Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report), Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report) and EQT Corp.

320,EQT,"We issued an updated research report on energy player EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report) on Aug 23. The company’s strong focus on natural gas rich Utica and Marcellus shale plays will create long-term value for stockholders. However, rising processing costs are a concern.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that the stock will perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.In a landmark deal signed in June 2017, EQT decided to acquire Rice Energy  for a total consideration of $6.7 billion. On completion of the deal, the upstream companies will create the largest natural gas producer in the United States. Most importantly, the acquisition will significantly raise EQT’s core acreage positions in the Marcellus and Utica shale plays.Moreover, we appreciate EQT’s strong financials as reflected by its improving net cash flow from operations since the beginning of this year. Long-term debt also plunged during the first half of 2017, reflecting its strong balance sheet.  EQT’s earnings surprise history is encouraging as well. The company managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 102.17%. Also, we expect the company to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 397.6%.However, during first-half 2017, EQT’s operating expenses related to transportation and processing activities rose more than 66%. If the trend continues, the company’s revenues might get affected.Also, EQT lacks geographical diversification as its resources are concentrated in the Appalachian Basin. This increases the risk exposure of the company as any disruption in the region will affect financials.Moreover, the company’s pricing chart shows weakness. Over the past year, EQT stock – belonging to the Zacks U.S. Oil Exploration industry – fell almost 15%.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked players in the energy sector are TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report) and Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.   Headquartered in Calgary, Canada, TransCanada is a midstream energy firm in North America. The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 4.06% over the last four quarters.Based in Fort Worth, TX, Range Resources is an independent oil and gas company, engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of U.S. oil and gas resources.

321,EQT,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a larger-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies. Adding to the bearish sentiment, the build outpaced the five-year average for the first time in six weeks.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: A Larger-than-Expected Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 53 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Aug 11, 2017, above the guidance (of 47 Bcf gain) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.Worse, the increase was higher than both last year’s build of 23 Bcf and the five-year (2012–2016) average addition of 50 Bcf for the reported week. Following past week’s climb, the current storage level – at 3.082 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – is now 55 Bcf (1.8%) above the five-year average although stocks are 254 Bcf (7.6%) lower than the year-ago figure.The above-average build in natural gas inventories – first in six weeks – initially instilled pessimism and prompted spurts of selling.Storage Revision Comes to the Rescue However, natural gas futures actually rose later that day to finish Thursday at $2.929 per MMBtu, up 3.9 cents (or 1.4%) from Wednesday’s close. The trigger to the rally was EIA’s bullish stocks data revisions for the weeks ending Jun 30 through Aug 4 associated with the reclassification from working gas to base gas. More than offsetting the effects of the bearish inventory report on prices, the revisions cut stocks for the week ended Aug 4 by 9 Bcf from EIA’s previous estimates.Still, Prices Fell for the Week Notwithstanding the positive revisions by the EIA, natural gas slumped around 3% for the week to end Friday at $2.8933 per MMBtu as investors were keen to book profits after surges over the prior two weeks.Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, the natural gas demand situation looks promising with warmer-than-average conditions set to prevail in most U.S. pockets over the next few days and power generators burning more gas to meet intensifying cooling demand. However, there are apprehensions that the peak summer demand will begin to recede within the next few weeks.  In any case, long-term fundamentals for the commodity continue to be supportive on the back of structural imbalances. While domestic natural gas production is expected to rebound this year, the growing use of liquefied natural gas (or LNG), booming LNG and Mexican exports, replacing coal-fired power plants and higher demand from industrial projects will likely take care of the increased output.The resulting effect will ensure natural gas storage keeping pace with the five-year average in the near future, with deficits piling up later on. Over time, these secular tailwinds are likely to support natural gas sentiment and price.The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Rice Energy Inc. , Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report), Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report) and EQT Corp.

323,EQT,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a below-average decrease in natural gas supplies. Unfavorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s production added to the bearish sentiment, bringing prices down sharply.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: A Smaller-than-Average DrawStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell by 69 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Dec 8, above the guidance (of 63 Bcf decline) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.However, the decrease was lower than both last year’s drop of 132 Bcf and the five-year (2012-2016) average net shrinkage of 78 Bcf for the reported week. Following the past week’s decline – the fourth withdrawal of the 2017-2018 winter heating season – the current storage level now stands at 3.626 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) - 27 Bcf (0.7%) under the five-year average and 201 Bcf (5.3%) below the year-ago figure.Fundamentally speaking, total supply of natural gas averaged around 82 Bcf per day, essentially flat on a weekly basis due to steady production. Meanwhile, daily natural gas consumption jumped 25.1% to 106.7 Bcf. The sharp increase in demand was triggered by a 49.6% surge in residential/commercial consumption on the back of cooler temperatures. Moreover, natural gas consumption for power generation was up by 18% from the previous week.Futures Slump Following EIA DataFollowing EIA’s latest commentary, natural gas prices slumped around 5.8% last week to settle at $2.612 per MMBtu on Friday. Apart from the below-average draw, investors were spooked by expanding dry gas production and forecasts of tepid heating demand from another relatively warm winter.Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, the fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run, considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia-Pacific region in particular.The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow from 340 Bcf per day in 2015 to 485 Bcf per day by 2040. Countries in Asia and in the Middle East – led by China’s transition away from coal – will account for most of this increase.And it will be the world’s largest gas producer U.S., which will step up to meet this soaring demand. With domestic prices struggling to break the $3 per million Btu threshold, U.S. natural gas companies see a big opportunity in selling cheap U.S. production at higher prices to rest of the world. In fact, more than 50% of the domestic volume growth in the near future will be used for export in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG). As per Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States will vie with Australia and Qatar as the top LNG exporter by 2022.Apart from the growing use of LNG and booming exports, the replacement of coal-fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand with price eventually settling well above $3.The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Rex Energy Corp. , Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report), Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report) and EQT Corp.

324,EQT,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices logged gains.On the news front, upstream energy biggies Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) and Devon Energy Corp. (DVN  -  Free Report) came up with their respective earnings reports, while natural gas operator EQT Corp. (EQT  -  Free Report) announced plans to separate its midstream business into a new publicly traded company.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 3.3% to close at $63.55 per barrel, while natural gas prices increased 3.9% to $2.657 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Occidental, Williams, Marathon Report Strong Q4)The U.S. oil benchmark scored its second consecutive weekly bump. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded a surprise drop.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 35 of the last 46 weeks and are down more than 110 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall – stemming from a combination of lower imports and spiraling exports – has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 420.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 18.9% below the year-ago period.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved higher last week following a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. The improvement was primarily on account of strength in the commodity’s production amid the upcoming conclusion to the winter heating season.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Concho Resources reported strong fourth-quarter results on the back of higher commodity price realizations and robust production growth. The independent energy explorer came out with net earnings per share of 66 cents, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. The bottom line also improved significantly from the prior-year quarter adjusted income of 20 cents per share.Concho Resources' average quarterly volume increased 28% year over year to 211 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (exceeding the high-end of the company’s guidance range), of which 61.6% was liquids. Overall, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company fetched $40.18 per barrel compared with $34.70 a year ago. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Concho Resources has provided a preliminary guidance for 2018. The company expects its total production to grow 16-20%, with crude oil growth about 20%. The upstream player forecasts its output to grow at 20% CAGR over the 2017-2020 timeframe. Capital expenditures for 2018 are estimated to be around $2 billion. (Read more Concho's Q4 Earnings Top on Price, Output Gains)2.    Devon Energy reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 38 cents, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents by 36.7%. The underperformance primarily stemmed from an accounting change and lower-than-expected production volumes, partly offset by higher realized prices.In the fourth quarter of 2017, total production touched 548,000 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day. The actual production was lower than the expected range of 551,000-571,000 Boe per day. Meanwhile, realized oil prices in the quarter were $42.21 per barrel, up 20.9% from $34.90 per barrel in the year-ago quarter. Realized prices for natural gas were up 11.2% to $2.48 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) from $2.23 per Mcf in the prior-year quarter.Devon estimates total production from its assets in the first quarter of 2018 in the range of 530,000-554,000 Boe per day. Full-year production is expected in the range of 552,000-576,000 Boe per day. Capital expenditure (capex) in the first quarter of 2018 is anticipated within $585-$700 million. 2018 capex is expected in the range of $2.33-$2.61 billion.(Read more Devon's Q4 Earnings Lag Estimates, Expands Reserves)3.    Natural gas producer EQT Corporation’s board of directors has finally succumbed to months of pressure from investors and agreed to separate the company's upstream and midstream businesses. It will form an independent publicly traded company (NewCo), whose operations will focus on the midstream businesses of EQT. The deal is devised to be tax-free for the company's shareholders, who will retain their EQT shares and receive a pro-rata share of the NewCo.The spin-off is expected to enable the company to concentrate on its upstream assets, and exploration and production business. The deal will leave EQT with 680,000 core Marcellus acres and 65,000 Ohio Utica acres.With the shale production to ramp up in the coming quarters, this move can help the company benefit largely through efficient allocation of capital, compared with the previous company set-up that constrained the company's returns in the recent years. Additionally, $2.3-$2.8 billion of free cash flow over the 2019-2023 timeframe is expected to trickle down from the move, which forecasts 10-15% annual production growth. (Read more Will EQT's Spin-Off of Midstream Businesses Prove Beneficial?)4.    U.S. energy firm Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter earnings per share – excluding one-time items – of 33 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents. The bottom line also turned around from the year-ago adjusted loss of 6 cents. The outperformance stems from higher oil realizations, and lower cost.The production of oil and natural gas (excluding divested assets and non-controlling interests) averaged 362,251 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d) (68% liquids), essentially flat from last year. The company aims to grow production by 7-13% in the next year. The average realized crude oil price during the fourth quarter was $58.36 per barrel, representing an increase of 23.1% from the year-ago realization of $47.39.Apache’s fourth quarter lease operating expenses totaled $334 million, down 10.9% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, total costs and expenses fell 16.4% from the fourth quarter of 2016 to $1,308 million. (Read more: Apache Posts Q4 Earnings Beat on Oil Price, Cost Cuts)5.    U.S. gas exporter Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report) reported strong fourth-quarter results on robust production volumes and strong pricing. The company’s net income per share came in at 54 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents and the comparable 2016 period profit of 48 cents.During the quarter, the company shipped 70 cargoes from Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas terminal in Louisiana. Total volumes lifted in the reported quarter were 252 trillion British thermal units.Overall costs and expenses soared 190% to $1,305 million from the same quarter last year. The increase is mainly attributed to the higher cost of sales which jumped to $980 million compared with $229 million in the prior-year quarter, while operating and maintenance expenses rose 87.7% year-over-year to $137 million.Cheniere Energy raised its EBITDA guidance for full-year 2018 following the better-than-expected profit. The upbeat forecast reflects higher-than-anticipated realized margins on marketing volumes. The adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $2,000 million and $2,200 million, compared to the prior guidance of anything between $1,900 million and $2,100 million.Meanwhile, distributable cash flow is likely to be between $200 million and $400 million, in line with the previous prediction.

325,EQT,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a smaller-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies following which the commodity traded up to its highest level since Jul 28.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: A Smaller-than-Expected Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 28 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Aug 4, 2017, below the guidance (of 34 Bcf gain) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.While the increase was higher than last year’s addition of 24 Bcf, it was well under the 5-year (2012-2016) average injection of 54 Bcf for the reported week. This caused the current storage level – at 3.038 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – narrow its surplus to the five-year average to 61 Bcf (2.0%). Moreover, total stocks are 275 Bcf (8.3%) lower than last year’s levels at this time.The lower-than-expected build in natural gas inventories instilled optimism and prompted spurts of buying. As a result, the commodity spiked 7.5% for the week to end Friday at $2.983 per MMBtu – a 3-week high. Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, the natural gas demand situation looks promising with hot conditions set to prevail in most U.S. pockets in the later part of August and power generators burning more gas to meet intensifying cooling demand.In any case, long-term fundamentals for the commodity continue to be supportive on the back of structural imbalances. While domestic natural gas production is expected to rebound this year, the growing use of liquefied natural gas (or LNG), booming exports to Mexico, replacing coal-fired power plants and higher demand from industrial projects will likely take care of the increased output. The resulting effect will ensure natural gas storage keeping pace with the 5-year average in the near future, with deficits piling up later on.Over the summer, these secular tailwinds are likely to support natural gas sentiment and price.The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Range Resources Corp.

328,EQT,"We are entering the heart of the Q2 earnings season, with more than 50% S&P 500 members expected to come out with results by the end of this week.Picture Emerging Thus FarWe now have Q2 results from 97 S&P 500 members that combined account for 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization. According to the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 8.4% from the same period last year on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% positive earnings surprises and 72.2% beating revenue estimates.At this stage, we don’t have too many results from the ‘Energy’ sector. However, a number of companies have earnings lined up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.Energy: First-Half RecapLast year, 'Energy' was the strongest S&P sector performer, with a market-thumping 24% return. In particular, November's historic OPEC-led production cut deal to alleviate a supply glut managed to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important $50 per barrel threshold. The commodity was on a stellar run on optimism surrounding the agreement, and the outlook for oil stocks was getting better.The seemingly positive developments encouraged investors to bet on firming prices for 2017 with the oil industry finally hoping that 'this would be the year.' True to the strong sentiments, U.S. oil prices reached around $55 per barrel in late February, the highest level in 19 months.However, the situation is drastically different now, with the commodity having floundered in recent weeks. By Jun 21, crude had cratered more than 20% from its February highs and officially plunged into bear territory. In fact, prices ended down 14.3% for the first half of the year – the worst performance since 1998.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the second quarter of this year.Strong Q2 Earnings Growth PredictionA look back at the Q1 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index.The Jan-Mar 2017 period turned out to be a rather good one with both oil and natural gas prices benefiting from easier comparison figures from the year-ago period. While crude slumped to some 12-year low in the first quarter of 2016, natural gas futures dropped to its worst level in almost 17 years.As a result, the sector – whose year-earlier comparison was to an aggregate loss – came out swinging. For the sector components on the S&P 500 index, total Q1 earnings had robust year-over-year dollar growth on 33.8% higher revenues. While 69.7% of the companies were successful in beating earnings estimates, 63.6% of them outperformed the topline.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q2 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared to the second quarter of 2016 when the energy companies reported unusually low bottom-line. While earnings for the Oil/Energy sector are set to jump a massive 271.4% – the highest year-over-year growth among all sectors – the top-line is likely to show a growth of 15.1% from the second quarter 2016 levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Jul 27Let’s see what’s in store for six energy companies expected to come up with Jun quarter numbers on Thursday, Jul 27.Contract drilling services provider Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) is expected to report before the opening bell.In the previous quarter, this Tulsa, OK-headquartered provider of drilling rigs, equipment and personnel to explore for and develop oil and gas missed estimates, weighed down by lower drilling activity, especially in the international markets.Regarding earnings surprises, Helmerich & Payne is on a bit of a slippery surface, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four reports. And our model indicates that the company is unlikely to beat on earnings this time around too.This is because, as per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat earnings. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For the quarter to be reported, Helmerich & Payne has an Earnings ESP of -6.45%, while it carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. (Read more: Helmerich & Payne's Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)Simultaneously, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Helmerich & Payne, Inc. QuoteHeadquartered in Houston, TX, National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) is another energy company set to report second-quarter 2017 results – this time after market closing. The company – which is one of the biggest manufacturers of drilling equipment – has a good track of having outperformed estimates in three of the last four quarters.However, National Oilwell is likely to break the trend in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because the company is a Zacks Rank #4 stock that has an Earnings ESP of -14.29%.National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | National Oilwell Varco, Inc. QuoteThen there is Pittsburgh, PA-based integrated energy company EQT Corp. (EQT  -  Free Report) coming out with Apr-Jun operational results before the opening bell.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, EQT – an Appalachia-focused natural gas firm with primary focus on production and midstream operations – has a decent record, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate just once in the last four reports. However, with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3, our proven model shows that an earnings beat is uncertain for EQT in the upcoming quarterly release. (Read more: Can EQT Corp Spring a Surprise this Earnings Season?)EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | EQT Corporation QuoteWe also have Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) reporting second-quarter 2017 results tomorrow - again ahead of the opening bell. Coming to the earnings surprise history, this Findlay, OH-headquartered downstream operator has a good record: it’s gone passed estimates in three of the last four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 189.75%.But our model does not indicate that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. While a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

(VLO  -  Free Report) is the fifth company to come out with quarterly numbers tomorrow morning.Boasting of an excellent track of having outperformed estimates in each of the last four quarters, Valero Energy is likely to encounter a speed breaker in the upcoming release. This is because the combination of Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -1.85% makes it an unlikely candidate for earnings beat.

Our model does not indicate that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around too, as it has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.ConocoPhillips Price and EPS Surprise  ConocoPhillips Price and EPS Surprise | ConocoPhillips QuoteThe Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

329,EQT,"Markets ended in negative territory on Wednesday following the release of minutes from Fed’s latest policy meeting. Bond rates surged to a 4-year high following the release of the minutes and weighed heavily on equities. Earlier in the session, major benchmarks had rallied after the minutes expressed concerns on the lack of broad-based wage gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 0.7%, to close at 24,797.78. However, the S&P 500 fell 0.6% to close at 2,701.33. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,218.23, losing about 0.2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 2.8% to close at 20.02.A total of around 6.96 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 8.49 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.17-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.24-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow tumbled 167 points to end in the red. The blue-chip index had earlier rallied 303 points at its session high. For the month, the Dow industrials are trading 5.2% down. Also, the Nasdaq declined 16 points to also finish in negative territory.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 shed almost 15 points to end in negative territory. Of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500, only two finished in the green. While the laggards were led by real estate and energy sectors, financials led the gainers. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) and the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) were down 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively. However, the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) rose a paltry 0.1%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The three major indexes along with the broader market suffered losses following mixed signals from the Fed at the end of its policy meeting on Wednesday. This led to a surge in yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which rose to a 4-year high at above 2.95%. This surge in yields in turn weighed heavily on equities paring gains notched up earlier in the session.Fed Indicates a Series of Upcoming Rate HikesAt the end of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, Fed officials stated that most members had revised their economic growth projections upward from the last meeting in December. Officials also stated that continuing economic expansion and rising inflation would warrant a gradual increase in interest rates in the future.Moreover, the minutes also stated that gradually increasing the interest rates would also help in sustaining the current economic growth as well as ‘balance the risks to the outlook for inflation and unemployment.’Members of the FOMC also commented that ‘upside risks’ to economic growth had increased due to a combined effect of tax reforms, an uptick in consumer spending and consumer confidence and other indications which showed that the economy had maintained an uninterrupted pace of growth. This is what led the Fed officials to increase projections on economic growth.Coming to inflation, the officials stated that core personal consumption (excluding food and energy) would increase ""notably faster in 2018."" Notably, personal consumption expenditure index is the preferred measure of inflation that the Fed uses.Further, members also commented that the Fed had actually ‘underestimated’ the effects that tax reforms would have on consumer spending and economic growth. Also, they remained highly skeptical about how much of an ‘impact’ tax reforms would have on wage growth. Following the tax cuts, several companies have issued bonuses to their employees. But the long term impact of these recent cash transfers remains unclear at this point.Economic DataOn the economic data front, existing home sales for the month of January came in at 5.38 million units, below the consensus estimate of 5.61 million units. In December, the metric came in at 5.56 million units.Stocks That Made HeadlinesFoot Locker Unveils Capital Spending Plan Before Q4 EarningsJust few days to go for its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings release, and Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) has already played smart.

330,EQT,"EQT Corporation’s (EQT  -  Free Report) board of directors has finally succumbed to months of pressure from investors and agreed to separate the company's upstream and midstream businesses. It will form an independent publicly traded company (NewCo), whose operations will focus on the midstream businesses of EQT. Following the news of spin-off, the stock declined 3.1%, making the stock fall 11.1% in the last 30-day time period.Notably, since the $6.7 billion Rice Energy acquisition by EQT, activist Jana Partners and hedge funds D.E. Shaw & Co had pushed for the separation, as they thought it would bring better returns for shareholders.DetailsThe deal is devised to be tax-free for the company's shareholders, who will retain their EQT shares and receive a pro-rata share of the NewCo.Moreover, midstream assets of the company will drop down to its master limited partnership, EQT Midstream, which will then merge with the Rice Midstream Partners, the master limited partnership of Rice. The merged entity, NewCo, will focus on midstream businesses. The deal is expected to be over by the third quarter of 2018.  The Senior Vice President of EQT, Jerry Ashcroft, is expected to continue as the CEO of the newly independent company.How will it Help EQT?The spin-off is expected to enable the company to concentrate on its upstream assets, and exploration and production business. The deal will leave EQT with 680,000 core Marcellus acres and 65,000 Ohio Utica acres. With the shale production to ramp up in the coming quarters, this move can help the company benefit largely through efficient allocation of capital, compared with the previous company set-up that constrained the company's returns in the recent years.Additionally, $2.3-$2.8 billion of free cash flow over the 2019-2023 time frame is expected to trickle down from the move, which forecasts 10-15% annual production growth. This is much needed for the company as its free cash flow generating ability did not work much in the last few years, staying in the negative region for most of the quarters.Price PerformanceEQT has lost 17.7% in the last year compared with 15.1% fall of its industry.About EQT CorporationBased in Pittsburgh, PA, EQT Corporation is an integrated energy company. It focuses on natural gas production, gathering and transmission in the Appalachian region. Notably, the company is one of the largest natural gas producers in the United States.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderEQT carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report).  All these companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

331,EQT,"Integrated energy player EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 27, before the market opens.In the last quarter, the company saw a negative earnings surprise of 2.22%. However, EQT posted an average positive earnings surprise of 103.15% for the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Factors Likely to Affect EarningsThe commodity pricing scenario did not show improvement in the second quarter. Oil and gas prices have been low for almost three years now and the prices slipped further during second-quarter 2017. The prolonged weakness can be attributed to a persistent supply glut in the commodity market.During the April-to-June quarter of this year, oil and natural gas prices fell 8.4% and 5%, respectively. Hence, the OPEC’s historical production cut extension deal until Mar 2018 has failed to drive oil. Natural gas is also an oversupplied commodity as is reflected by its inventory level of 2.816 tcf – as of Jun 23 – almost 7% higher than the five-year average mark (as per The U.S. Energy Information Administration).However, as compared to the prior-year comparable quarter, both oil and gas prices have improved considerably.On top of that, the company projects production sales volumes in the range of 190–195 Bcfe for second-quarter 2017, higher than 184.5 Bcfe produced during the April-to-June quarter of 2016.Hence, though the pricing scenario of the commodities is not favorable for the upstream business if we consider the sequential comparison, the year-over-year comparison is positive in terms of production and price.Also, the midstream business might rake in more profits for EQT given the fact that U.S. drillers continue to gather on shale plays. With the rise in production, demand for midstream assets for gathering and transmission activities is likely to scale higher.Q2 Price PerformanceDuring the April-to-June quarter of this year EQT Corp lost 4.1% as compared to the 16.9% fall of its industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for EQT this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 9 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: EQT carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | EQT Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the energy sector that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP (BWP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.90% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

332,EQT,"The Fed hiked its benchmark rates on Wednesday, as was widely expected, helping most benchmarks finished in the green. Even though the Dow notched up a record close, the S&P 500 closed in the red after financials tanked. Meanwhile, Democrat Doug Jones won elections in Alabama, disturbing the Republican majority in the Senate.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) increased 0.3%, to close at 24,585.43. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 0.05% to close at 2,662.85. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,875.8, gaining 0.2%. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.31-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.83-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues. The CBOE VIX increased 0.1% to close at 9.9.Fed Hikes the Benchmark Interest RateThe Federal Reserve finally increased its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday by a quarter percentage point. The new rate of interest will hover between 1.25% and 1.5%. This marks the fourth rate hike by Fed in a year’s time. Further, central bank officials reiterated their earlier projection of three possible rate hikes in 2018. Central bankers reasoned that a hike in interest rate would actually prevent the economy from overheating and negate the effects of a sudden increase in inflation.Also, the central bank did not alter its initial forecast for inflation. The Fed projects a gradual increase in inflation with officials forecasting that the year will end with inflation levels still below 2%. This also marked Janet Yellen’s last news conference as the Fed Chief before her term ends in February next year.Doug Jones’ Win Upsets Republican Advantage on Tax BillDemocrat candidate Doug Jones won the Senate elections in Alabama late on Tuesday. defeating Republican Roy Moore. His victroy actually upset the Republican majority in the Senate, required to push through the Tax Bill. Earlier in the month, U.S. Senate Republicans approved the much awaited tax Bill to be passed in the Senate. These developments weighed on investor sentiment.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow advanced 80.6 points on Wednesday to post its fifth straight day of gains and notching up a record close in the process. Such gains were buoyed by an increase in shares of Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report), which surged 3.6% in intraday trade. Moreover, Fed’s decision to hike the interest rate also boosted gains for the Dow.The S&P 500 decreased 1.26 point to end in the negative territory, ending its four–day streak of gains. Of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500, four ended in the positive territory, with financials leading the decliners. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) declined 1.2% and weighed on the S&P 500. Financial stocks such as Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) all declined 1.6%, 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively and led the S&P 500 lower.

Gains for the tech-heavy index were broad based.Economic DataThe consumer price index (CPI) for November came in at 0.4%, in line with the consensus estimate. Meanwhile, Core CPI came in at 0.1%, below the consensus estimate of 0.2%. Increasing oil prices led to a surge in the cost of living for the average consumer and this led to an increase in the CPI. Moreover, higher rents and increased spending on new and used cars also spiked the CPI last month.Stocks That Made HeadlinesTarget to Acquire Shipt to Augment Online Delivery ServicesWith the objective of capitalizing on the booming online shopping, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) has announced its intention to buy Shipt, Inc., a same-day delivery platform.

The 2019 development plan is expected to be financed by the cash flow provided by EQT Production.In 2018, the company plans to focus on the Marcellus acreage, with a target of 111 wells in Pennsylvania and 28 wells in West Virginia. About 139 wells are planned for drilling in the region, with around 160-17 wells to be turn-in-line (TIL). The rigs to be employed in the region are projected at 10.In Ohio Utica Development, EQT intends to drill 38 gross (25 net) wells and 40-50 gross wells are expected to be TIL during 2018.During 2018, EQT proposes to drill 19 Upper Devonian wells and 20-25 wells are expected to be TIL. These wells will be restricted to joint development on Marcellus pads in Pennsylvania.The merger between EQT and Rice Energy has led to savings of about $45 million. The savings can be attributed to the replacement of lower investment grade debt by Rice Energy’s senior notes worth $1.3 billion.Earlier this week, EQT turned in line the longest lateral completed to date by any operator in the Marcellus. The Haywood H18 well in Washington County, PA, has a lateral length of 17,400 feet and will develop 42 Bcfe of reserves.

334,EQT,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a smaller-than-expected decrease in natural gas supplies. Nevertheless, prices rose for the week on expectations of colder weather and the resultant strength in the commodity’s demand.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: Smaller-than-Expected DrawStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell by 33 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Nov 24, below the guidance (of 38 Bcf decline) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.Worse, the decrease was lower than both last year’s drop of 43 Bcf and the five-year (2012-2016) average net shrinkage of 47 Bcf for the reported week. Following past week’s decline – third withdrawal of the 2017-2018 winter heating season – the current storage level now stands at 3.693 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) - 107 Bcf (2.8%) under the five-year average and 309 Bcf (7.7%) below the year-ago figure.Fundamentally speaking, total supply of natural gas averaged around 81.9 Bcf per day, up marginally (less than 1%) on a weekly basis due to higher production. Meanwhile, daily natural gas consumption decreased 5.4% to 80.8 Bcf. The sharp pullback in demand was triggered by a 10.1% fall in residential/commercial consumption on the back of warmer temperatures. Moreover, natural gas consumption for power generation was down by 5% from the previous week.Futures Jump Despite Bearish EIA DataShrugging off EIA’s latest commentary, natural gas prices soared around 5% last week to settle at $3.061 per MMBtu on Friday as investors chose to bet on the return of colder weather (translating into strong heating gas demand) over the next few weeks.Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, the fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run, considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia-Pacific region in particular.The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow from 340 Bcf per day in 2015 to 485 Bcf per day by 2040. Countries in Asia and in the Middle East – led by China’s transition away from coal – will account for most of this increase.And it will be the world’s largest gas producer U.S., which will step up to meet this soaring demand. With domestic prices struggling to break the $3 per million Btu threshold, U.S. natural gas companies see a big opportunity in selling cheap U.S. production at higher prices to rest of the world. In fact, more than 50% of the domestic volume growth in the near future will be used for export in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG). As per Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States will vie with Australia and Qatar as the top LNG exporter by 2022.Apart from the growing use of LNG and booming exports, the replacement of coal-fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand with price eventually settling well above $3.The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Rex Energy Corp. , Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report), Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report) and EQT Corp.

335,EQT,"Domestic oil and gas explorer Whiting Petroleum Corp. (WLL  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Wednesday, Jul 26.In the preceding three-month period, the Denver, CO-based company reported stronger-than-expected results on robust output and cost control.Coming to earnings surprise history, Whiting Petroleum has a mixed record: its missed estimates in 2 of the last four quarters.Whiting Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Whiting Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Whiting Petroleum Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider This QuarterOil prices have been on a freefall over the past few weeks, erasing all the gains associated with the OPEC-led output cut. The continued rise in domestic production thanks to soaring shale output have dragged down the commodity well below the psychologically-critical $50 threshold. This will hamper Whiting Petroleum’s earnings and cash flowsHowever, efficiencies on the production front might be able to mitigate some of the damage. The company expects to maintain a flat-to-rising production profile in the upcoming few quarters despite asset sales.Moreover, Whiting Petroleum has been able to reduce costs that will provide some buffer amid the tumbling commodity prices.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Whiting Petroleum will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -5.26%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 20 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged narrower, at a loss of 19 cents.Zacks Rank: Whiting Petroleum’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further decreases the predictive power of ESP, making us less confident of an earnings surprise call.As it is, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Share Performance: Shares have fallen 41.8% during the second quarter, as against the industry's loss of 16.9%. Over the last 12 months, Whiting Petroleum stock has lost 37.4%.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Whiting Petroleum, here are some energy firms you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:TransCanada Corp. (TRP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.84% and a Zacks Rank #1. The energy infrastructure developer is expected to release earnings results on Jul 28. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +10.53% and a Zacks Rank #3.

The oil and gas company is likely to release earnings on Jul 27.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

336,EQT,"Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) will release second-quarter 2017 financial results after the market closes on Jul 24, 2017. In the prior quarter, the oil and gas company reported a negative earnings surprise of 130.77%. Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe company is presently streamlining its operations. It has divested Eagleford and Marcellus assets worth nearly $2.8 billion and is working to improve oil production from its existing assets.Due to the tragic incident in Colorado during the second quarter, Anadarko has shut all its producing vertical wells operating in the regions. These wells will resume operations post necessary inspection, which produced 13,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. So, this unexpected shut down could impact production goals.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Anadarko Petroleum is going to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Anadarko Petroleum has an Earnings ESP of -6.67%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 32 cents, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 30 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) when combined with its negative ESP, makes positive surprise unlikely this season.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Anadarko Petroleum Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderAnadarko Petroleum does not have the right parameters to come out with earning surprise this season. However, we have a few players in the Zacks categorized Oil &Gas – Exploration & Production – U.S. industry, which have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +42.86% and a Zacks Rank #3.

337,EQT,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a smaller-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies following which the commodity traded up. Moreover, optimism over the fuel’s strong demand on the back of bullish weather predictions further spurred natural gas prices.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: A Smaller-than-Expected Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 57 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended July 7, 2017, below the guidance (of 59 Bcf gain) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider. Moreover, the increase was lower than both last year’s addition of 61 Bcf and the 5-year (2012-2016) average net injection of 72 Bcf for the reported week.This caused the current storage level – at 2.945 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – narrow its surplus to the five-year average to 172 Bcf (6.2%), while stocks have now fallen 289 Bcf (8.9%) below the year-ago figure.The bullish build in natural gas inventories instilled optimism and prompted spurts of buying. As a result, the commodity spiked 4.1% for the week to end Friday at $2.98 per MMBtu. Apart from the EIA data, the electricity generation fuel also got a lift from investors who took note of hot weather predictions (translating into strong heating gas demand) for the week ahead.Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, the natural gas demand situation looks promising with hot conditions set to prevail in most U.S. pockets in the later part of July and power generators burning more gas to meet intensifying cooling demand.In any case, long-term fundamentals for the commodity continue to be supportive on the back of structural imbalances. While domestic natural gas production is expected to rebound this year, the growing use of liquefied natural gas (or LNG), booming exports to Mexico, replacing coal-fired power plants and higher demand from industrial projects will likely take care of the increased output. The resulting effect will ensure natural gas storage keeping pace with the 5-year average in the near future, with deficits piling up later on.Over the summer, these secular tailwinds are likely to support natural gas sentiment and price.Which Stocks to Bet OnThe perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Rice Energy Inc. , Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report), Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report) and EQT Corp. (EQT  -  Free Report).However, each of these firms has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which means that investors should preferably wait for a better entry point before buying shares in them.In case you are looking for natural gas names for your portfolio, one could opt for Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report). It has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.With domestic prices remaining constrained on the back of abundant supplies, the company sees a big opportunity in selling U.S. natural gas production at higher prices overseas. Houston, TX-based Cheniere Energy is the only liquefied natural gas exporter of the U.S. and plans to turn the commodity’s glut into export revolution, currently exporting to over 20 countries.The 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate for this company is for a loss of 13 cents, representing some 93.1% earnings per share growth over 2016. Next year’s average forecast is 56 cents, pointing to another 514.8% growth.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

341,EQT,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 4% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout?

The bottom line also improved from a loss of 28 cents in the prior-year quarter.Net operating revenues in the quarter rose 18.6% year over year to $660.3 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $651 million.The strong third-quarter results were supported by improved production sales volumes and average realized commodity prices.Segment DetailsEQT Production reported third-quarter adjusted operating revenues of $566.8 million, up 31.6% year over year.Adjusted operating loss from this segment was $9.7 million, substantially narrower than $82.1 million loss in the year-earlier quarter.The improvement was mainly driven by higher average realized commodity prices and increased production sales volumes.In the EQT Gathering segment, net gathering revenues increased 17.6% year over year to $116.5 million.Operating income rose 18.3% year over year to $85.8 million in the reported quarter.Improvement in this segment can be attributed to production development in the Marcellus Shale.In the EQT Transmission segment, net transmission revenues grew 16.9% to $90.7 million.Operating income jumped 11.2% year over year to $59.7 million in the quarter under review.The improvement in this segment occurred mainly due to the Marcellus Shale’s production development.FinancialsThe company’s adjusted operating cash flow was $205.9 million during the quarter, up 23.7% year over year.EQT’s capital expenditure in the quarter included $449.3 million spent on EQT Production, $48.2 million invested in EQT Gathering and $22.3 million in EQT Transmission.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to three lower.VGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has a great Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for growth and momentum investors than value investors may want to look elsewhere.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift.

It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: Season’s First DeclineStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell by 18 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Nov 10, above the guidance (of 14 Bcf decline) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.The past week’s decline represents the first withdrawal of the 2017-2018 winter heating season. This compares with last year’s addition of 34 Bcf and the 5-year (2012-2016) average net injection of 12 Bcf for the reported week.Following the official start to the draw season, the current storage level now stands at 3.772 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) - 101 Bcf (2.6%) under the five-year average and 271 Bcf (46.7) below the year-ago figure.Fundamentally speaking, total supply of natural gas averaged around 82.2 Bcf per day, up 1.5% on a weekly basis due to higher production and imports. Meanwhile, daily natural gas consumption increased 12.8% to 89.6 Bcf. The sharp acceleration in demand was triggered by a 40.6% surge in residential/commercial consumption on the back of cooler temperatures.Futures End Down Despite Bullish EIA DataShrugging off EIA’s latest commentary, natural gas prices lost 3.6% last week to settle at $3.097 per MMBtu on Friday as investors chose to concentrate on warmer temperature predictions (translating into moderate heating gas demand) over the next few days. Prices were further dented by the continued strength in dry gas production, which are hovering near record levels.Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, the fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run, considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia-Pacific region in particular.The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow from 340 Bcf per day in 2015 to 485 Bcf per day by 2040. Countries in Asia and in the Middle East – led by China’s transition away from coal – will account for most of this increase.And it will be the world’s largest gas producer U.S., which will step up to meet this soaring demand. With domestic prices struggling to break the $3 per million Btu threshold, U.S. natural gas companies see a big opportunity in selling cheap U.S. production at higher prices to rest of the world.In fact, more than 50% of the domestic volume growth in the near future will be used for export in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG). As per Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States will vie with Australia and Qatar as the top LNG exporter by 2022.Apart from the growing use of LNG and booming exports, the replacement of coal-fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand with price eventually settling well above $3.The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Rice Energy Inc. , Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report), Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report) and EQT Corp.

344,EQT,"EQT Corp (EQT  -  Free Report) is expected to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 12 cents per share against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 5 cents. The bottom line also improved from a loss of 28 cents in the prior-year quarter. EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | EQT Corporation Quote Which Way are Estimates Trending?Let’s look at the estimate revisions to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents for fourth-quarter earnings has been revised downward over the last 30 days, with one firm being bullish and five firms taking a bearish stance. The figure reflects a year-over-year decline of 12%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $886.5 million for the fourth quarter, up 133.9% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderPer the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the average daily sales volume for the current quarter is pegged at 2,860 million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfe/d), which is higher than 2,229 MMcfe/d in the preceding quarter and 2,157 MMcfe/d in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for oil sales volume per day is 295 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d), showing an improvement of 246 Mboe/d in the preceding quarter.Analysts polled by Zacks expect natural gas volumes per day of 235 mcf, increasing from 205 mcf in the preceding quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for natural gas liquids sales volume per day is 5,148 Mboe/d, up from 3,176 Mboe/d in the preceding quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in Production segment is pegged $812 million, showing an increase from $598 million in the last quarter and $318 million in the year-ago quarter.During 2017, EQT is likely to spend $1.5 billion, out of which $1.3 billion will be allocated to well developments. A total of 207 wells will be drilled comprising 119 Marcellus wells. The entire funding will be done through cash on hand and operating cash flow, reflecting the company’s strong balance sheet.However, during the first nine months of 2017, EQT’s expenses related to transportation and processing activities surged more than 61%. If the trend continues, the company’s revenues might be hurt.Moreover, EQT lacks geographical diversification as its resources are concentrated in the Appalachian Basin. This increases risk exposure of the company as any disruptions in the region will affect financials.Price Performance in Q4During the quarter, EQT has underperformed the industry. The stock has lost 12.8% against the industry's rally of 9%. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that EQT is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: EQT has an Earnings ESP of -7.32% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 20 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 22 cents.

Phillips 66 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 429.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.    Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents for the fourth quarter has seen no upward revision and one downward revision by firms in the last seven days. It reflects year-over-year growth of 443.8%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $30,705 million for the impending quarter, up 29.7% from the year-ago quarter.Factors Likely to Influence Q4 EarningsPhillips 66 is the leading player in each of its operations like refining, chemicals and midstream in terms of size, efficiency and strengths. The company is on track to enhance its potential in every business segment by streamlining its portfolio of assets and by investing in growth developments.However, the company’s free cash flow fell 97.6% sequentially during the third quarter, reflecting weak business operations. Since 2014, there has been a significant increase in long-term debt, which indicates Phillips 66’s weak balance sheet.Q4 Price PerformanceDuring the quarter, Phillips 66’s shares have underperformed the industry. The company’s shares have returned 10.4% compared with the industry’s 14.9% rally. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Phillips 66 is likely to beat on earnings this time because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients.  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is becausethe Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 87 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Phillips 66 carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating on earnings.

346,EQT,"Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 1, before the market opens.Last quarter, the leading refining player delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.37%, courtesy of higher throughput margin. Moreover, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 10.26%.Which Way Are Estimates Headed?Let’s take a look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of $1.11has been revised downward over the last 30 days, with five firms being bearish and one firm taking a bullish stance. The consensus estimate reflects year-over-year improvement of about 37%.Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $22,523 million for the fourth quarter, up 8.7% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderAmong independent refiners, Valero Energy has the most diverse refinery base. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income of VLP segment for the fourth quarter is pegged at $71 million, up from $69 million reported in the preceding quarter.The company’s strong balance sheet as reflected from the rising cash balance since 2015 is encouraging. Moreover, the overhaul of the nation’s tax code is expected to bolster the refiners. With the implementation of the law, the corporate income tax will be lowered from 35% to 21%.However, the company’s escalating debt levels over the past six quarters are a concern. From no long-term debt as of December 2015, Valero Energy’s long-term debt is currently at $8.4 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income of ethanol segment for the fourth quarter is pegged at $1 million, down from $82 million reported in the preceding quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income of refining segment for the fourth quarter is pegged at $933 million, down from $1,429 million reported in the preceding quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for throughput margin per barrel from Valero’s refining operations stands at $9, lower than $10.94 in the preceding quarter. Lower expected throughput margin will likely lead the lower projected profit for refining segment.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Valero Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

347,EQT,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a record decrease in natural gas supplies. The massive, 359 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was blamed on strong demand due to freezing temperatures over bulk of the country. The bullish report boosted the heating fuel’s price, which added around 15% for the week.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: Biggest Ever DrawStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell by Bcf for the week ended Jan 5, the largest on record and comfortably above the guidance (of 337 Bcf decline) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider. Considerably colder-than-normal weather across vast swaths of the United States’ heavily populated regions led to soaring demand and was responsible for the huge pull from storage.Moreover, the decrease was more than twice the last year’s drop of 136 Bcf and the five-year (2013-2017) average net shrinkage of 169 Bcf for the reported week. Following past week’s massive decline – eighth withdrawal of the 2017-2018 winter heating season – the current storage level now stands at 2.767 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), 382 Bcf (12.1%) under the five-year average and 415 Bcf (5.3%) below the year-ago figure. In fact, stockpiles are now at their lowest level for the concerned week since 2008.Following EIA’s latest commentary, natural gas prices jumped around 15% last week to settle at $3.20 per MMBtu on Friday -- the highest since the first half of November. Apart from the higher-than-anticipated draw, investors were also betting on the continuation of the frigid cold snap going into the end of January, leading to the heating fuel’s healthy demand.Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, the fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run, considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia-Pacific region in particular.The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow from 340 Bcf per day in 2015 to 485 Bcf per day by 2040. Countries in Asia and in the Middle East – led by China’s transition away from coal – will account for most of this increase.And it will be the world’s largest gas producer U.S., which will step up to meet this soaring demand. With domestic prices struggling to break the $3 per million Btu threshold, U.S. natural gas companies see a big opportunity in selling cheap U.S. production at higher prices to rest of the world. In fact, more than 50% of the domestic volume growth in the near future will be used for export in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG). As per Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States will vie with Australia and Qatar as the top LNG exporter by 2022.Apart from the growing use of LNG and booming exports, the replacement of coal-fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand with price eventually settling well above $3.The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Rex Energy Corporation , Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Company (SWN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy (WPX  -  Free Report), Antero Resources Corporation (AR  -  Free Report) and EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report).Want to Own a Natural Gas Stock Now?If you are looking for a near term natural gas play, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) may be a good selection.

349,EQT,"Upstream energy player, EQT Corp (EQT  -  Free Report) is expected to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 6 cents per share surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents. Notably, EQT incurred loss of 35 cents in the year-ago quarter. EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | EQT Corporation QuoteWhich Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.In the last seven days, two estimates have been raised, taking the Zacks Consensus Estimate to a loss of 2 cents for the third quarter. It reflects year-over-year improvement of about 92.3% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $650.1 million for the impending quarter was up 16.8% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderDuring 2017, EQT is expected to spend $1.5 billion, out of which $1.3 billion will be allocated toward well developments. A total of 207 wells will be drilled comprising 119 Marcellus wells. The entire funding will be done through cash on hand and operating cash flow, reflecting the company’s strong balance sheet.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the average daily sales volume for the current quarter is estimated at 2,303 million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfe/d), which is higher than 2,177 MMcfe/d in the preceding quarter and 2,131 MMcfe/d in the year-ago quarter. The figure is also higher than the company’s projection of 205–210 Bcfe.The company stands to benefit as the midstream business might rake more profits for EQT given the fact that U.S. drillers continue to bank on shale plays. With the rise in production, demand for midstream assets for gathering and transmission activities is likely to scale higher.However, during first-half 2017, EQT’s operating expenses related to transportation and processing activities surged more than 66%. If the trend continues, the company’s revenues might be hurt.Moreover, EQT lacks geographical diversification as its resources are concentrated in the Appalachian Basin. This increases risk exposure of the company as any disruptions in the region will affect financials.Price Performance in Q3During the quarter, EQT has outperformed the industry. The stock has gained 11.3% compared with the industry's growth of 5%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that EQT is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: EQT has an Earnings ESP of -163.91% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of 6 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is of a loss of 2 cents.

These have the right combination of elements to deliveran earnings beat this quarter:Noble Midstream Partners LP (NBLX  -  Free Report), headquartered in Houston, TX, has diversified energy infrastructure properties.

350,EQT,"Upstream energy player, EQT Corp (EQT  -  Free Report) has falsified investment banker JANA Partners LLC’s claims that the presentation of the combined acreage post EQT and Rice Energy Inc.  merger is deceptive and that the existence of non-contiguous acreage (enclosed within the pro-forma footprint of the combined company) cannot lead to the declared operational synergies.EQT has stated that the anticipated acquisition of Rice Energy signifies a critical planned opportunity. The company will receive an unparalleled asset position and superlative inventory, in one of the most prolific natural gas basins in the United States. EQT's Board and management strongly believe that the acquisition will add and enhance value shareholders value.EQT’s presence in the Appalachian Basin dates back to nearly 13 decades. The company has drilled over 2,500 horizontal wells. Markedly, the longest lateral in the Marcellus at 17,400 feet was also drilled by it. In fact, it is an industry practice to handle any non-contiguous acreage requirements through well path adjustments, smaller bolt-on acquisitions and tactical fill-ins. All these are part of the company’s current development plan at a projected cost of about $200 million, annually.Moreover, there are small-scale acreage trades between operators that are used to fill in gaps. These methods are regularly used by EQT and other Appalachian operators to assemble their respective development programs. Given the multitude of legacy natural gas leases across Appalachia and the historical ownership of land in the region, it is common for small acreage plots to hold multiple of legacy natural gas leases.The combined Rice Energy-EQT acreage profile was appraised comprehensively. Based on its development plan, which consists of the cost of tactical fill-ins, the company is certain it will attain identified synergies amounting to $2.5 billion. EQT has stated that JANA’s claims of deception regarding the anticipated benefits of the merger are inaccurate. The acreage acquisition strategy is a standard initiative among Appalachian operators.JANA believes that shareholders are torn between these two claims.

351,EQT,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a below-average decrease in natural gas supplies. Forecasts of an end to the harsh cold snap and the resultant dip in heating demand added to the bearish sentiment, bringing prices down sharply.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: Smaller-than-Expected DrawStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell by 206 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Dec. 29, below the guidance (of 219 Bcf decline) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.However, the decrease was significantly higher than both last year’s drop of 76 Bcf and the five-year (2012-2016) average net shrinkage of 99 Bcf for the reported week. Following past week’s decline – seventh withdrawal of the 2017-2018 winter heating season – the current storage level now stands at 3.126 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), 192 Bcf (5.8%) under the five-year average and the year-ago figure.Fundamentally speaking, total supply of natural gas averaged around 82.4 Bcf per day, down slightly (around 1%) on a weekly basis due to lower production. Meanwhile, daily natural gas consumption jumped 23.6% to 137 Bcf.The sharp increase in demand was triggered by a 39.1% surge in residential/commercial consumption on the back of cold temperatures engulfing much of the U.S. Moreover, natural gas consumption for power generation was up by 18.9% from the previous week.Futures Slump Following EIA DataFollowing EIA’s latest commentary, natural gas prices slumped around 5.4% last week to settle at $2.795 per MMBtu on Friday. Apart from the lower-than-anticipated draw, investors were spooked by forecasts for an end to the frigid cold snap going into the middle of January leading to decrease in the heating fuel’s demand.Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, the fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run, considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia-Pacific region in particular.The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow from 340 Bcf per day in 2015 to 485 Bcf per day by 2040. Countries in Asia and in the Middle East – led by China’s transition away from coal – will account for most of this increase.And it will be the world’s largest gas producer U.S., which will step up to meet this soaring demand. With domestic prices struggling to break the $3 per million Btu threshold, U.S. natural gas companies see a big opportunity in selling cheap U.S. production at higher prices to rest of the world. In fact, more than 50% of the domestic volume growth in the near future will be used for export in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG). As per Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States will vie with Australia and Qatar as the top LNG exporter by 2022.Apart from the growing use of LNG and booming exports, the replacement of coal-fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand with price eventually settling well above $3.The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Rex Energy Corp. , Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Company (SWN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy (WPX  -  Free Report), Antero Resources Corp. (AR  -  Free Report) and EQT Corp.

352,EQT,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a below-average increase in natural gas supplies following which the commodity traded up. However, worries over the fuel’s tepid demand on the back of Tropical Storm Harvey-related power outages are expected to keep natural gas prices in check.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: Below Average Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 30 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Aug 25, 2017, slightly above the guidance (of 29 Bcf gain) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.However, the increase was lower than both last year’s addition of 46 Bcf and the 5-year (2012-2016) average net injection of 67 Bcf for the reported week. This caused the current storage level – at 3.155 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – narrow its surplus to the five-year average to just 8 Bcf (0.3%), while stocks have now fallen 239 Bcf (7%) below the year-ago figure.The largely supportive data prompted natural gas prices to climb 10.1 cents (or 3.4%) to $3.04 per MMBtu on Thursday.Fundamentally speaking, supply fell 1.9% on a weekly basis to 77.2 Bcf per day, while daily natural gas consumption declined 10.4% to 67.4 Bcf. The steep decrease in demand was triggered by sharply lower power burn. Meanwhile, Mexican gas exports were down some 11.4% as Hurricane Harvey hampered pipeline shipments.Prices to Suffer Temporarily from Harvey Impact Despite yesterday’s rise in natural gas prices, the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey is expected to weigh on the commodity in the near-to-medium term due to the following reasons.Depressed power and manufacturing sector demands due to temporary electricity outages for the next several days. The big storm has also brought cool temperatures to the region, limiting air conditioning demand.  Harvey has disrupted piped U.S. natural gas exports to Mexico by shutting down/damaging infrastructure.  Finally, Hurricane Harvey-induced demand losses would translate into big storage builds over the coming weeks, extending the two-year old supply glut.The perceived short-term price weakness from the above factors might negatively impact natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Rice Energy Inc. , Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report), Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report) and EQT Corp. (EQT  -  Free Report).Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, the natural gas demand situation looks promising with warmer-than-average conditions set to prevail in most U.S. pockets over the next few days and power generators burning more gas to meet intensifying cooling demand. However, there are apprehensions that the peak summer demand will begin to recede within the next few weeks. In any case, long-term fundamentals for the commodity continue to be supportive on the back of structural imbalances. While domestic natural gas production is expected to rebound this year, the growing use of liquefied natural gas (or LNG), booming LNG and Mexican exports, replacing coal-fired power plants and higher demand from industrial projects will likely take care of the increased output.The resulting effect will ensure natural gas storage keeping pace with the five-year average in the near future, with deficits piling up later on. Over time, these secular tailwinds are likely to support natural gas sentiment and price.Want to Own a Natural Gas Stock Now?If you are still looking for a near term natural gas play, Range Resources Corp.
