Nutrien retains 20 million class B shares that it will eventually divest.Western automakers have watched uneasily as Chinese companies dominate the refining and production of critical battery materials, such as lithium, cobalt and rare earths, which are also used in consumer gadgets like Apple (AAPL) smartphones. China, the world's top auto market, aims to become the global No. 1 in electric cars and is on track to sell 1 million electric cars this year.On May 1, Moody's forecast a shortage of electric vehicle batteries that could hit Tesla production targets harder. GM and Ford (F), which are making heavy EV bets, could also suffer if scarce supplies of cobalt, lithium and nickel slow battery production.Tesla shares closed down 2.7% on the stock market today, while GM fell 1.3% and Ford slipped 1.1%.

While the U.S. still makes up the largest portion of their holdings, countries like China, Germany and South Korea represent a significant and ever-growing slice of the business.KraneShares Electric Vehicles & Future Mobility (KARS), the first to market on Jan. 18, has the highest concentration in China among the three funds, representing 22% of the $31 million in total assets. A further 15% comes from Germany; 38% is from the U.S.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

""Second, China is opening the mainland markets to foreign investors.""China is quickly becoming the leader in production, demand and sales of EVs worldwide. According to a study by McKinsey, Chinese manufacturers produced 43% of the 873,000 EVs built globally in 2016. It's now ahead of the U.S. market for the first time based on the number of EVs circulating on the road. Chinese drivers can choose among approximately 75 EV models, the most of any market.""There's a big pollution effort in China, and one element of that is automotive emissions,"" said Ahern. ""So China over the last three years has really ramped up the effort to promote electric vehicles.""That said, he adds that EVs are a global phenomenon and will not be exclusive to China. ""I'm the biggest fan of Tesla cars, but to play Tesla as your sole EV play, I think, is a big mistake,"" Ahern noted. ""Because ... it's not just one company, but it's also not one industry."" The EV ecosystem includes not just automakers but also vehicle connectivity, autonomous driving and shared mobility, as well as commodity inputs, he says — themes reflected in KARS.Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that by 2040, 54% of new-car sales and 33% of the global auto fleet will be electric. In addition, global demand for EV lithium-ion batteries is projected to skyrocket 3,750% by 2030. Copper demand for electric cars could soar ninefold by 2027, reports Reuters.KARS' automaker holdings include Bayer Motoren Werk (BMWYY), General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F), Chinese automaker BYD (Build Your Dreams) and Tesla. Companies involved in batteries and raw materials are Samsung SDI, Galaxy Resources and Albemarle (ALB). Electrical grid makers include Southern Copper (SCCO) and Antofagasta. Connectivity and autonomous-driving firms are Nvidia (NVDA), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Baidu (BIDU).Recent entrant Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles (DRIV), launched April 13, has amassed $53 million in assets. Global X's $3.9 billion suite of six thematic technology ETFs includes $2.6 billion Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence (BOTZ) and $1 billion Global X Lithium & Battery Tech (LIT). On Tuesday, the fund group added a seventh thematic tech ETF with Global X Future Analytics Tech (AIQ), which tracks the Indxx Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Index.Top countries represented in DRIV are the U.S., Japan, Germany and South Korea, with a respective 52%, 8.5%, 8% and 6.6% share of total assets. China is just 2.9%. Holdings include Intel (INTC), Samsung Electronics, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Tesla, Visteon (VC), Plug Power (PLUG) and Lithium Americas (LAC).Jay Jacobs, director of research at Global X, says that despite being in the early stages, electric and autonomous vehicles hold enormous potential. The fund seeks exposure to the whole ecosystem, including essential-materials miners in lithium, cobalt and copper; battery producers; component makers; automakers; and AV technology companies such as hardware and software developers of sensors, chips, artificial intelligence (AI) and mapping.""The disruptive nature of the theme is absolutely staggering,"" said Jacobs. ""Everything from the environmental to health to traffic to wasted-time-in-cars aspect to the reduction in cost of moving things around the country — there's so much disruptive potential behind the trend and a very clear business case.""The $2.6 million Innovation Shares NextGen Vehicles & Technology (EKAR), which launched Feb. 9, holds 42%, 13% and 9% of stocks from the U.S., Germany and China, respectively.

It also holds seven Korean stocks, which inhabit a very restricted market. ""(With) one U.S.-listed ticker (ETF), you get access to all these global markets,"" noted Markiewicz.However, ""the big issue with an EV ETF is the same as with any very narrow thematic ETF — getting pure exposure,"" notes Dave Nadig, CEO at ETF.com. ""KARS, for instance, counts GM, Google, Ford and Nvidia in its top holdings. Is the fate of that ETF going to be driven more by Bitcoin miners (Nvidia) or truck sales (GM) or search revenues (Google)?""On the flip side, Markiewicz notes: ""You can't ignore the larger players, because they're the ones who're also spending a lot on R&D and helping to evolve the industry.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:From AI To Social Media And Beyond, This ETF Pioneer DeliversThese Top Tech Stock Plays Are Trouncing The MarketAccess AI And Beat The Market With Hot Tech Stocks Like Microsoft

10,ALB,"Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM) and other lithium-related stocks traded lower Tuesday as the Chilean lithium miner gears for an arbitration hearing tied to a key lithium lease.X SQM has run into conflict with Chile's state-run development agency Corfo over royalty payments tied to its lease of a site holding some of the world's most productive lithium deposits. Talks between the two sides failed in October, Reuters reported at the time, with Corfo insisting that SQM end its lease early and return the site to the state.But Reuters reported over the weekend that the Chilean government has given Corfo the go ahead to reach a deal with SQM when the two sides meet for a scheduled arbitration hearing on Wednesday. SQM and Corfo will agree to resolve their arbitration, Reuters reportedly indicated, and SQM will be allowed to produce up to 180,000 metric tons of lithium annually, which would more than triple current production of around 50,000 metric tons.Morningstar equity analyst Seth Goldstein wrote Tuesday:""Our lithium supply-and-demand model had assumed SQM would produce slightly more than 100,000 metric tons of lithium by 2025. Given the possibility of 80,000 metric tons per year of new supply that we had not previously accounted for — equivalent to roughly 10% of our 2025 demand forecast — we are placing lithium producers SQM, Albemarle and FMC under review. We will revisit our long-term lithium forecast once the results of the arbitration hearing are final.""Our forecast had assumed a midcycle lithium price of around $10,000 per metric ton, which is the price we believed necessary to incentivize higher cost supply in order to meet 2025 demand. If SQM ramps up lithium production to 180,000 metric tons by 2025 and the majority of announced projects under development come online, then the incentive price needed for supply to meet our 2025 demand forecast of 775,000 metric tons could fall.""In another lithium supply move, Toyota Motor (TM) will invest $232 million to take a 15% stake in Australian lithium producer Orocobre, news reports said Tuesday.

Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Lithium-related stocks and ETFs have been seen as a way to play the boom in electric vehicles and electronic devices using lithium batteries. The main driver of rising global lithium demand is momentum for electric vehicles.

Shares have been trading mostly above the 50-day moving average, providing the formation with a good foundation.Long-term, it has been a laggard, trending mainly lower since it peaked in January 2011. But the ETF made a 52% run from February to early June before it settled into its current base. Week-to-week volume has swelled since late March, suggesting growing investor interest in the Global X Lithium.The fund holds 24 stocks, including some that are not traded on U.S. exchanges. Two stocks have an outsized representation, accounting for more than 30% of the portfolio: FMC (FMC) and Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM). The two companies are among the top four global producers of lithium.Shares of Sociedad Quimica broke out of a flat base Thursday, leaping past a 26.43 buy point in heavy trading. The mining company beat second-quarter profit expectations late Wednesday.

The automaker's stock has been consolidating since April and is nearly 20% off its 52-week high.Lithium — which is used in products from AA batteries to the 787 Dreamliner — remains in big demand. The aggressive expansion of Tesla's battery-powered cars has been a big reason for that.With production lagging demand, lithium prices have been firm, Bloomberg reports.

So far, their stock prices are reflecting optimism on corporate growth and earnings.In some cases, a few stocks have run up ahead of the news, then sold off on the report.What to do?

The company is executing a number of projects aimed at boosting its global lithium derivative capacity.Albemarle, in March, received approval from Chile's Economic Development Agency for an increase in its lithium quota, enabling the company to sustainably expand its lithium production in Chile to roughly 145,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent per annum through 2043. Per the company, this increase in quota will be enabled by deploying innovative technology for extracting more lithium without requiring additional brine pumping at the Salar de Atacama, giving it the opportunity to boost capacity in a highly sustainable and efficient manner.Sales from the company’s Lithium and Advanced Materials unit jumped 30% year over year to $362.4 million in the fourth quarter, supported by favorable pricing, higher sales volumes and favorable currency impacts. The results in the lithium business are expected to continue to be boosted by favorable pricing trends as well as higher volumes in battery grade products in the first quarter.Revenues from the Bromine Specialties segment rose around 13% year over year to $219.1 million in the last reported quarter driven by higher sales volumes and favorable pricing. While the division is expected to continue to gain from healthy flame retardant demand in electronics and construction markets, it faces headwinds from higher cost for raw materials, distribution and freight.Revenues from the Refining Solutions unit rose 24% year over year to $238.4 million in the fourth quarter, supported by favorable pricing, higher sales volumes and favorable currency impacts. The company expects its Catalysts unit (now includes Refining Solutions and Performance Catalyst Solutions) to benefit from higher volumes in fluid cracking catalysts and favorable product mix. However, the unit faces headwind from higher expected input costs.Albemarle Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Albemarle Corporation price-eps-surprise | Albemarle Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Albemarle is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

81,ALB,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Albemarle Corporation (ALB  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks.PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Albemarle has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.3, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.4. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Albemarle’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.However, the stock’s PE also compares unfavorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 16.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Albemarle has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 18.1, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Albemarle has a P/S ratio of about 3.25. This is somewhat lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.28 right now.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Albemarle currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes ALB a good choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for the stock is just 1.1, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1.4. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate.What About the Stock Overall?Though Albemarle might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of A. This gives ALB a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current year has seen four upward estimate revision in the past sixty days compared to two downward, while the next year estimate has also seen four upward and one downward revisions in the same time frame.As a result, the current year consensus estimate increased 0.4% in the past two months, while the next year estimate has decreased by 0.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Albemarle Corporation Price and Consensus Albemarle Corporation Price and Consensus | Albemarle Corporation QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAlbemarle’s is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its good lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, with a decent industry rank (top 21% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, over the past six months, its industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Despite the poor past performance of the industry, a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

82,ALB,"Although Wall Street had the best start to 2018 in more than three decades, things turned bitter to end the first quarter, with many sectors and stocks entering correction territory from their latest peak. With a day’s trading left, the S&P 500 is down 2.6% and on track for the worst quarter in two and a half years.A combination of factors like concerns over faster-than-expected rates hike, trade tensions, and the health of the technology sector pushed the Wall Street from deep green to red.Rate Hike FearsThe first round of brutal trading came in early February following the better-than-expected wage growth, sending major indices into correction territory. At the lower levels, the S&P 500 shed about $2.5 trillion in its value from Jan 26. Then, the Fed minutes and the new Fed chairperson Jerome Powell took away some sheen from the riskier assets.Trump TariffAgain in early March, Trump’s tariff news spooked markets, sparking threats of a trade war. President Trump imposed severe tariffs of 24% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports that could lead to retaliation from other countries thereby resulting in unforeseen consequences. Although this fear faded with Trump and other countries starting negotiations, the President’s intention to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports, targeting the technology and telecommunications sectors, led to bloodbath in the stock markets yet again.Tech RoutThen the panic was created by the social media giant Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) following the data breach report, which sparked concerns about data privacy and security, resulting in increased scrutiny and possible regulatory pressure. The news has taken a toll not only the broader technology sector but the broad U.S. market as well. This was followed by a slew of negative news that again has sent the sector into a tailspin this week, with FANG stocks being the biggest losers.In particular, the most recent tech rout has washed away about $2.34 trillion from the market cap of the S&P 500 since its peak in late January. This means that almost one-third of the Trump rally was erased during the current market pullback.The stock market had added $6.9 trillion in market cap at the peak since Trump was elected. The FAAMG stocks — Facebook, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) — were the largest contributors. Though these stocks do not shed larger in terms of percentage, the pullback in Facebook and Alphabet took out a combined $230 billion of market cap from the S&P 500 in the last two months. Both stocks were down 13.3% and 4.6%, respectively.That said, a number of stocks have crushed, piling up heavy losses during this time frame. Below, we have highlighted five such stocks from the S&P 500 index that have been hit badly in the market turmoil and might continue their rough trading in the months ahead if similar trends persist.Patterson Companies Inc. (PDCO  -  Free Report) – Down 38.3%The company distributes and sells dental and animal health products in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.

84,ALB,"The markets have been extremely volatile lately owing to a multitude of factors including rate hikes fears and risks of a potential trade war. One particular segment of the market, which has been attracting investor attention over the last few years, is the socially responsible investing segment. These ETFs allow you to invest in line with your principles and contribute to making the world a better place in your own small way (read: ETFs to be Impacted by Potential Trade War With China).Investing in separate stocks that you feel are commensurate with your principles can be difficult, while also maintaining a diversified portfolio. Here, ETFs come to the rescue, as they offer a diversified portfolio of stocks focusing on particular screens for environmental, social or governance (ESG) related issues.Gender equality has been the top trend in 2017 and 2018 so far. With increased focus on disparities in the pay of men and women, investing in companies that have a better standing with regards to gender equity has been gaining popularity. For instance, HSBC revealed a 59% gender pay gap, even though HSBC’s UK workforce comprises 54% women. Moreover, a mere 23% occupy senior roles at the bank.Another area attracting investor attention is clean energy. After President Donald Trump decided to leave the Paris Climate Accord last year, multiple critics have argued the need to shift toward cleaner energy and reduce fossil fuel consumption. There are multiple ways to gain exposure to this principle, either by investing directly in funds having a portfolio of stocks involved in clean energy, or by investing in funds having a portfolio of stocks trying to save energy and reduce carbon emissions in their day-to- day operations.The latest trend among sustainable investing enthusiasts is the need to steer clear of weapons companies. After the school shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in February and the incident in Las Vegas music festival in 2017, arguments for gun laws and imposing stricter rules regarding gun sales have panned up. Therefore, funds that refrain from investing in companies involved in weapons have caught investor attention.   In the current scenario, we believe it is prudent to discuss the following ETFs that focus on providing exposure to sustainable investing themes.  iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF (DSI  -  Free Report)This ETF offers exposure to stocks that exhibit positive ESG characteristics, refraining from investing in companies involved in weapons, tobacco or alcohol.

The fund has returned 17.0% in a year and 2.7% year to date.SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF SHEThis ETF offers exposure to companies that have a better structure in terms of women occupying senior roles when compared to its peers. This fund has AUM of $317.3 million and charges a fee of 20 basis points a year.

85,ALB,"The chemical industry has gotten its mojo back on strength across major end-markets and a resurgent world economy. The industry’s upturn is expected to continue in 2018 as the fundamental driving factors remain in place.Despite a few industry-related and macroeconomic headwinds, there are a number of reasons to be optimistic about the broader chemical industry for both the short and long haul. Let’s find out what’s supporting the bullish case for chemical stocks.Shale Bounty – Driving Force for Chemical InvestmentThe shale gas revolution in the United States has been a huge driving force behind chemical investment on plants and equipment in the country. According to the American Chemistry Council (“ACC”), the United States has emerged as an attractive investment location and petrochemical makers are now significantly expanding capacity in the country leveraging new supplies of natural gas. New methods of extraction such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) are boosting shale production, bringing down prices of ethane (derived from shale gas) in the process.The shale boom has incentivized a number of chemical companies to pump in billions of dollars for setting up facilities (crackers) in the United States to produce ethylene and propylene in a cost-effective way. Per the ACC, 320 new chemical projects have been already announced by chemical makers worth more than $185 billion that are under construction or complete. Such investments - many backed by Federal government support - are expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years.Chemical industry capital spending also continues to go up, clocking $38 billion in 2017, according to the ACC. This also accounts for one-half of overall construction spending by the manufacturing sector. The trade group expects capital spending to rise 6.3% in 2018 and 6.8% in 2019 and eventually reach $48 billion by 2022.Strong Momentum in ConstructionA rebound across housing and commercial construction - major chemical end-markets - has been another supporting factor for the chemical industry recovery. After being hit hard in the recession, the construction sector has bounced back on the back of strong housing fundamentals.The U.S. homebuilding industry performed remarkably well in 2017 and the momentum is expected to continue this year. Strong employment, rising income, increasing interest from first-time homebuyers, tight inventory of new and existing homes and high homebuilder confidence are among the factors that should support continued growth in housing demand in 2018.Moreover, 2018 has started on a positive note for the commercial construction sector. The U.S. Architecture Billings Index (ABI), an economic indicator that provides a roughly nine to 12 - month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, hit the highest level in January 2018 since 2007.Per the American Institute of Architects (AIA), the ABI score was 54.7 (a reading above 50 indicates an increase in billings) for January, an increase from 52.8 a month ago, indicating an upturn in architectural activity. The AIA also expects non-residential construction spending to go up 4% in 2018 and 3.9% in 2019.Positives such as an improving economy, an impressive job market, rising consumer confidence and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the construction sector’s performance. Moreover, President Donald Trump’s plan to double economic growth through an ambitious stimulus program featuring higher infrastructure spending, tax cuts and deregulation augur well for the sector.Demand Strength in Automotive SectorChemical makers continue to see healthy demand from the automotive sector - a major end-use market. 2017 has been another record-setting year for global light vehicle sales. IHS Markit expects another strong year for the automotive industry on a global level in 2018 and envisions global light vehicle sales to increase 1.5% year over year to 95.9 million units this year.Moreover, demand is expected to remain healthy in the United States this year. Rising demand for crossovers, sports utility vehicles and light trucks are aiding the U.S. auto industry. The National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) foresees a stable, healthy market for new vehicles in 2018 and expects new cars and light trucks sales to reach 16.7 million units.The auto industry in Asian countries, especially China, is also expected to thrive over the next several years. China is the biggest and fastest growing auto market in the world in terms of number of vehicles sold. This augurs well for chemical demand in this important end-market. Upturn in the Eurozone EconomyEurozone’s economic recovery continues apace, as evident from recent upbeat economic data. The region’s recovery is backed by a pickup in the global economy, declining unemployment, strengthening business and consumer confidence and monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank. The European chemical industry has also swung back to life on the back of a rebounding Eurozone economy.Eurozone wrapped up 2017 on a strong note with GDP rising 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 (according to Eurostat data) on a quarter-over-quarter basis, driven by strong growth across Germany and France. The bloc’s economy also expanded 2.3% in 2017, the fastest rate in more than a decade.While geopolitical risks may still remain a drag, the Eurozone economy is poised for a strong 2018. The European Commission, in its winter 2018 forecast, said that it expects the Eurozone to grow 2.3% in 2018 (up from previous estimate of 2.1%), followed by 2% in 2019.Resurgent Energy SectorA rebound in crude oil prices has led to a recovery in demand for chemicals in the energy space, an important end-use market. Oil prices have been steadily recovering from their nadir of below $30 a barrel in early 2016, currently trading above the important psychological level of $60 a barrel. Oil prices recently soared to their highest level in more than three years at $66 a barrel.The uptrend in oil prices has been supported by a decline in U.S. oil stockpiles, upbeat demand outlook and extension of oil production cuts by OPEC and other major world producers until the end of 2018.Improving fundamentals in the energy space is expected to support chemical demand moving ahead. The rebound in oil prices has also led to a favorable pricing environment for chemical products.Chemical M&A Wave ContinuesChemical makers remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify their business, enhance operational scale and shore up growth. The $130 billion mega-merger of The Dow Chemical Company and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (DuPont) to create DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report) - the biggest chemical deal ever - is a huge testimony to these strategic moves.Other major deals that have taken place in the chemical space in the recent past include China National Chemical Corporation’s $43 billion acquisition of Syngenta AG, Albemarle Corporation’s (ALB  -  Free Report) $6.2 billion buyout of Rockwood Holdings, Inc., Merck KGaA's $17 billion acquisition of Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, and the $66 billion proposed mega-merger between Monsanto Company MON and Bayer AG.Strategic Actions to Reap Margin BenefitsChemical companies continue to switch their focus on attractive, growth markets in an effort to cut their exposure on other businesses that are grappling with weak demand. Moreover, cost-cutting measures and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies are expected to deliver industry-wide margin benefits in 2018. Some chemical makers are also disposing non-core assets as they shift their focus on high-margin businesses.Moreover, a number of chemical makers are taking pricing actions (reflected by hikes in chemical prices in the recent past) in the wake of a sharp rise in raw materials costs. This is also expected to reap margin benefits moving ahead.Stocks to Bet on Right NowAs you can see from the above-mentioned factors, there are many reasons to be optimistic about the chemical industry.

86,ALB,"Albemarle Corporation (ALB  -  Free Report) received approval from Chile's Economic Development Agency for an increase in its lithium quota, enabling the company to sustainably expand its lithium production in Chile to roughly 145,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent per annum through 2043.Per the company, this increase in quota will be enabled by deploying innovative technology for extracting more lithium without requiring additional brine pumping at the Salar de Atacama, giving it the opportunity to boost capacity in a highly sustainable and efficient manner.Notably, the company’s new brine yield technology is part of its Wave 2 capacity expansion, which is expected to start commissioning after 2021. The quota increase along with new innovative technology will result in a cost and margin structure similar to Albemarle’s current production processes. Albemarle will continue to actively monitor the market and add capacity, per requirement, to address the needs of its contracted customers.Shares of Albemarle have declined 21.8% in the past three months, underperforming the industry’s 2.4% gain.Albemarle incurred a net loss of $218.4 million or $1.95 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 against a profit of $602.1 million or $5.30 per a year ago.

88,ALB,"Lithium has witnessed robust gains in the recent past, as bullish trends for electric carmakers have made investors park their money in lithium-focused investments. This is because electric cars are powered by lithium ion batteries and major carmakers across the world have been betting on the said commodity, in order to take advantage of the electric car revolution (read: ETFs in Focus on Tesla Q4 Earnings Beat, Model 3 Target).Per an Irish Times article, citing a statement by Milan Thakore, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, “I think a lot of car manufacturers are almost panicking, in the sense they want to make sure they don’t miss out on the essential materials they need for the battery.” Per a Financial Times article, citing Goldman Sachs’ estimates, a Tesla Model S uses more lithium in its batteries than 10,000 smart phones combined (read: Get Early Exposure to the Electric Car Market With This ETF).However, the recent week did not start on a positive note for lithium bulls. Morgan Stanley had a role to play in bursting the bubble for people strongly bullish about lithium’s performance in the near future. What Drove Lithium lower?The Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT  -  Free Report) plunged 3.4% on Feb 26. This plunge was attributed to a Morgan Stanley report that stated that growth in demand for electric cars will not be enough to explain the growing supply of lithium from Chile. Moreover, the report cites analysts expecting lithium prices to fall by 45% by 2021.According to the bank, new projects and expansion plans related to lithium in Chile might add 500,000 tons of the light metal per year to the global supply by 2025. “We expect these supply additions to swamp forecast demand growth,” the bank said. It expects 2018 to be the last year that’ll witness a demand-supply deficit, moving into a surplus equation 2019 onwards.Morgan Stanley cited in its research note that it expects lithium prices to first fall to $7.332 a ton from its current price of $13.375 a ton. It then expects the price to sway toward its marginal cost of production of $7,030 a ton. The report stated that electric car sales will have to make up around 31% of total sales by 2025 to account for the expected oversupply, a lot above the less than 2% market share currently held by the segment. The ratings of the two largest producers of lithium, Albemarle (ALB  -  Free Report) and Sociedad Quimica Y Minera de Chile (SQM  -  Free Report), were downgraded to underweight from equal-weight by the bank. Albemarle declined 7.3%, while SQM declined 8.0% as a result of the downgrade. This was primarily because the two firms are expected to greatly influence the supply of lithium in the near future and add around 200,000 tons a year to the global lithium market by 2025.According to another news piece, researchers from Bristol University and Surrey University claim to have developed a next-gen material for supercapacitors, which can charge cars in 10 minutes compared with the eight hours generally required by lithium ion batteries. Although this technology is still in its early stages, it might prove to be a negative for lithium ion batteries in case further developments are made in the space.“If a significant leap has been made in energy density, it would be an important achievement,” Dr Thomas Miller, an expert on supercapacitors at University College London. said to Guardian. “One major consideration that is yet to be proven is the scalability, cost and sustainability of the new technology,” he added.    Let us now discuss the Lithium ETF in detail.Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT  -  Free Report)This ETF seeks to provide exposure to companies engaged in the lithium industry. This fund has the potential to offer diversification benefits to traditional portfolios.It has AUM of $1.1 billion and charges a fee of 76 basis points a year. The fund has high exposure to Albemarle Corp, FMC Corp (FMC) and Quimica Y Minera Chil-Sp, with 16.6%, 15.8% and 7.1% exposure, respectively (as of Feb 26, 2018). It has returned 38.4% in a year but has lost 9.4% year to date.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

90,ALB,"Albemarle Corporation (ALB  -  Free Report) will release its fourth-quarter 2017 results after the bell on Feb 27. Albemarle posted strong third-quarter results with both earnings and revenues topping estimates. Adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share for the quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07. Revenues rose around 15% year over year to $754.9 million and also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $737 million.Sales in the quarter were aided by favorable impacts of pricing and higher sales volume in Lithium and Advanced Materials and Bromine segments as well as favorable currency impacts.Albemarle has an impressive earnings surprise history. It has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 4.3%.Albemarle has outperformed the industry it belongs to over a year, partly reflecting its forecast-topping earnings performance and its strategic growth initiatives. The company’s shares have rallied around 22.3% over this period, compared with roughly 16.6% gain recorded by the industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAlbemarle, in November 2017, raised its guidance for 2017. The company now sees full-year net sales of between $3 billion and $3.05 billion (compared with prior view of $2.90 billion and $3.05 billion), adjusted earnings per share of between $4.40 and $4.50 (compared with prior view of $4.20 and $4.40) and adjusted EBITDA of $860-$875 million (compared with $835-$875 million expected earlier).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for Albemarle for the to-be-reported quarter stands at $791.5 million, reflecting an increase of 13.6% from the year-ago quarter.Strength in the company’s core Lithium and Advanced Materials division boosted its third-quarter results and is expected to continue to drive its results in the December quarter.Albemarle is seeing significant momentum in its lithium business and is well placed to leverage strong expected growth in the battery-grade lithium market. The company is executing a number of projects aimed at boosting its global lithium derivative capacity.Albemarle, in September 2017, said that it has developed a novel technology that would allow it to increase annual lithium production in Chile on a sustainable basis to as much as 125,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent without requiring additional brine pumping at its facility in the Salar de Atacama.Projects currently underway are expected to raise the company’s total annual production capacity in Chile to more than 80,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent.Sales from the company’s Lithium and Advanced Materials unit jumped 43% year over year to $343.6 million in the third quarter, supported by favorable pricing, higher sales volumes and favorable currency impacts. The division’s results are expected to continue to be boosted by higher pricing and volumes in battery grade products in the fourth quarter.Revenues from the Bromine Specialties segment rose around 10% year over year to $212.9 million in the last reported quarter. Strong flame retardant demand in electronics applications is expected to support the division’s results in the to-be-reported quarter.However, revenues from the Refining Solutions unit fell around 11% year over year to $170.3 million in the third quarter, hurt by reduced sales volumes and unfavorable pricing. The company expects a strong fourth-quarter for the unit. However, some lingering impacts of Hurricane Harvey are likely to affect the division in the fourth quarter.Albemarle Corporation Price and Consensus  Albemarle Corporation Price and Consensus | Albemarle Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Albemarle is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

91,ALB,"Perhaps no company in the world polarizes investors and analysts as much as Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report). Led by the enigmatic Elon Musk, Tesla is a dominant force in the budding electric car market—but the company’s history of missing production targets produces questions about the stock’s sky-high valuation.One thing that nearly everyone can agree on is Tesla’s status as an innovator in the automotive industry. Tesla vehicles have some of the longest ranges among consumer electric cars, its “Autopilot” feature was one of the first self-driving platforms to reach the public, and management’s focus on leading the world into the future is commendable.Naturally, Tesla’s prowess has attracted many admirers. And one of the coolest parts about being an investor is that if you truly believe in the structure and vision of a publicly-traded company, you are free to buy up some of that company’s stock and secure yourself a piece of the expansion that you think will come.Wall Street has largely proven to be a believer in Tesla, and despite what some might label as hiccups in the company’s growth plan, the stock has soared more than 800% over the best five years—with plenty of investors still confident that the company is only at the beginning of its rise.If you find yourself in the crowd of investors that think there is plenty more to come from Tesla over the next few years, you might even want to add more exposure to the company’s future to your portfolio right now. Buying more TSLA is always an option, but let’s look at a few other stocks to consider if you are bullish on Tesla.Lithium PlaysIf you are confident in Tesla, that means you are likely a believer in the long-term health of the global lithium market. Tesla and its competitors power their revolutionary electric vehicles with lithium-ion batteries, and rising demand for these batteries should naturally lead to an uptick in lithium mining and production.The obvious first choice here is Albemarle Corp. (ALB  -  Free Report), the world’s largest lithium producer. Albemarle is based in the U.S. and is said to control about 35% of the world’s lithium market. Another option that lithium bulls have targeted is FMC Corp. (FMC  -  Free Report), a diversified machinery and chemicals company that is rapidly expanding its lithium capacity (also read: Beyond Tesla: 2 Lithium Stocks to Buy Now).Suppliers and PartnersTesla famously owns and operates a large portion of its supply chain, but investors have a few options for cashing in on the company’s direct business relationships. For example, Modine Manufacturing Company (MOD  -  Free Report) is a manufacturer of heat transfer equipment and has been said to be a key supplier of battery cooling units for the Model S.To what extent Modine Manufacturing fits into Tesla’s future plans is unknown, but the Model S is still a key model for the company, and Modine is a recognized expert in the heat transfer business. MOD is also currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Another stock currently holding a strong-buy ranking and doing business with Tesla is Wall Street darling Nvidia Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report). This red-hot graphics chip maker made its name in the PC gaming market but is now poised to be a top supplier for the next generation of smart vehicles.Tesla and Nvidia have been partners since the early development of the Model S, and now all Tesla vehicles are equipped with Nvidia-powered supercomputers that run on the chipmaker’s Drive PX computing platform.But no one company is as invested in Tesla’s future as Panasonic Corporation (PCRFY  -  Free Report). The Japanese tech giant agreed to shell out up to $1.6 billion to help build Tesla’s Gigafactory, where it will serve as the car company’s official partner in battery production.“If Tesla succeeds and the electric vehicle becomes mainstream, the world will be changed and we will have lots of opportunity to grow,” Panasonic’s Kazuhiro Tsuga said at the time of the deal (also read: So, What Actually Is Tesla's Gigafactory?).Longshot Gigafactory PlayBesides Panasonic, investors looking to bet on the growth of Tesla’s Gigafactory should consider Monarch Casino & Resort Inc. (MCRI  -  Free Report). This play might be considered a bit of a gamble (pun intended), but Monarch’s main property is the Atlantis Casino Resort in Reno, Nevada. Reno sits just outside of Sparks, Nevada, the home of the Gigafactory—and many MCRI investors are hoping the casino will benefit from economic growth in the area.Bottom LineAt today’s valuations, some might consider simply buying Tesla shares a risk. But others consider the stock cheap considering its future potential. For those that lean towards the latter, the above-mentioned stocks are few diversified ways to get even more exposure to Tesla over the coming years.Want more market analysis from this author?

92,ALB,"Shares of Albemarle Corporation (ALB  -  Free Report) have rallied around 25% over the past six months. The chemical maker has also outperformed its industry’s gain of roughly 16% to over the same time frame.  Albemarle, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, has a market cap of roughly $14.5 billion and average volume of shares traded in the last three months is around 1,330K. The company has an expected long-term earnings per share growth of 14.8%, higher than the industry average of 10.2%. What’s Driving ALB?Forecast-topping results in the last reported quarter, upbeat outlook for 2017 and strategic growth initiatives have contributed to a rally in Albemarle’s shares. Albemarle, last month, posted strong third-quarter results with both earnings and revenues topping estimates.Albemarle also raised its guidance for 2017. The company now sees full-year net sales of between $3 billion and $3.05 billion (compared with prior view of $2.90 billion and $3.05 billion), adjusted earnings per share of between $4.40 and $4.50 (compared with prior view of $4.20 and $4.40) and adjusted EBITDA of $860-$875 million (compared with $835-$875 million expected earlier).Albemarle is seeing significant momentum in its lithium business and is well placed to leverage strong expected growth in the battery-grade lithium market. The buyout of the lithium assets of Jiangxi Jiangli New Materials Science and Technology Co. Ltd. has allowed Albemarle to supply premium lithium salts to an expanded global customer base and accelerated the company’s ability to meet its goal of capturing 50% of the growth in the lithium industry.Albemarle is executing a number of projects that are likely to boost its global lithium derivative capacity to 165,000 metric tons by 2021. Albemarle’s Talison joint venture in Australia is expanding lithium concentrate production at its Greenbushes mine.Moreover, Albemarle, in September, said that it has developed a novel technology that would allow it to increase annual lithium production in Chile on a sustainable basis to as much as 125,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent without requiring additional brine pumping at its facility in the Salar de Atacama. The move is part of the company’s efforts to beef up efficiencies and sustainability of its Atacama operations.Projects currently underway are expected to raise the company’s total annual production capacity in Chile to more than 80,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent.Albemarle Corporation Price and Consensus  Albemarle Corporation Price and Consensus | Albemarle Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked companies in the basic materials space include Koppers Holdings Inc.

95,ALB,"The American chemical industry is riding an upswing of the major world economies with growth rate for the industry surpassing the 20-year average – according to the recently published “Year End 2017 Chemical Industry Situation and Outlook” by the American Chemistry Council (ACC).The Washington, DC-based chemical industry trade group said that chemical output continued to improve this year notwithstanding the disruptions from Hurricane Harvey with strong gains expected continue in the next two years. “Manufacturing has turned a corner, business investment is on the rise, and domestic oil and gas production is on the rebound. It all sets the stage for tremendous momentum, expansion and capital investment,” ACC chief economist Kevin Swift noted. U.S. Chemical Industry Set for Solid GrowthThe outlook for the American chemical industry paints an encouraging picture. The ACC envisions national chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) to rise 0.8% in 2017, further accelerating to a 3.7% growth in 2018 and a 3.9% growth in 2019. The growth is expected to be spurred by higher demand across light vehicles and housing markets, capital investments and improved export markets.The trade group also expects basic chemicals production to expand 4.7% in 2018 and further gain steam with a 5.2% rise in 2019 on the heels of new capacity additions. Major export markets such as Latin American and Asia are expected to play a significant role in production growth. The specialty chemicals segment is also expected to see production growth of 3% in 2017 and 2.3% in 2018, per the ACC.Surging Capital SpendingAccording to the ACC, the United States remains an attractive investment destination for chemical investment and domestic chemical makers continue to enjoy the advantage of access to abundant and cheaper feedstocks and energy. This is driving investment in chemical production projects.The trade group noted that roughly 320 chemical projects have been already announced worth more than $185 billion, 62% of which is foreign direct investment. Moreover, roughly 65% of the chemical investment announced since 2010 are complete or under construction. New capacity is expected to provide a boost to chemical production as these investments come on stream.Chemical industry capital spending also continues to go up, clocking $38 billion this year, per the ACC. This also accounts for one-half of overall construction spending by the manufacturing sector. The trade group expects capital spending to rise 6.3% in 2018 and 6.8% in 2019 and eventually reach $48 billion by 2022.Strengthening Export MarketsThe ACC expects improving export markets to contribute to solid growth of the domestic chemical industry. Strengthening export markets and increasing capital spending are driving chemical demand across key end-use markets such as light vehicles and housing.  Total chemical exports went up 4.9% to $127 billion this year while imports rose 2.8% to $96 billion, the trade group noted. Higher exports will result in the United States having a $32 billion trade surplus in chemicals (barring pharmaceuticals) in 2017. Moreover, the ACC sees two-way trade between the United States and its foreign partners to expand 4% year over year and reach $223 billion this year.5 Chemical Stocks for 2018The U.S. chemical industry’s upturn is expected to continue next year on continued demand strength across major end-markets and significant capital investment. Amid such a backdrop, it would be a prudent idea to invest in chemical stocks with compelling growth prospects if you are looking to reap solid returns from your portfolio in 2018.We highlight the following five stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) that are good options for investment right now.

98,ALB,"The global chemical industry has gotten off to a positive start in the fourth quarter with October seeing a rise in chemical production on the back of a recovery of the U.S. chemical industry from the effects of hurricanes and an upswing in the world economy, per the monthly report from the American Chemistry Council (ACC) released yesterday.Positive October ReadingsThe chemical industry trade group said that the Global Chemical Production Regional Index (CPRI) rose 0.4% in October on a monthly comparison basis. This follows a 0.1% decline in September, affected by hurricanes. The Global CPRI, which is measured using a three-month moving average, measures chemical production volumes for 33 major nations, sub-regions and regions. It is comparable to the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) production indices.Gains in production were witnessed across all regions in the reported month. The results were also favorable on a product basis in October. Gains were witnessed in all products barring pharmaceuticals and manufactured fibers.The ACC also noted that the Global CPRI went up 2.7% year over year on a three-month moving average basis. Capacity utilization for the global chemical industry also recovered in the reported month and moved up 0.2 percentage points to 80.4%, up from 80.1% in October 2016.The U.S. chemical industry also recovered from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and started the fourth quarter on a positive note with output rising in October on gains across all chemical producing regions.The ACC said that the U.S. CPRI increased 0.3% in October on a monthly comparison basis. This follows a 0.4% and 1.2% decline in August and September, respectively, hurt by the unfavorable impacts of disruptions from hurricanes.Hurricane Harvey weighed on U.S. chemical production during the third quarter. A sizable portion of total U.S. production capacity was hit by the storm. Harvey led to the shutdown of several chemical plants along the Gulf Coast – the epicenter of the U.S. specialty chemicals and petrochemicals industry. A number of major chemical producers had to shutter or cut back ethylene production, leading to reduced supply of this major chemical in the third quarter.Chemical Industry in Good HealthThe chemical industry is back on the growth path after being roiled by the global economic crisis. The industry has enjoyed a positive run this year, helped by an improving global economy and continued strength across major end-use markets.The Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry has outperformed the broader market year to date. The industry has gained around 25.5% over this period, higher than S&P 500’s corresponding return of 18.3%. Notwithstanding some lingering headwinds, the chemical industry’s momentum is expected to continue through the rest of 2017 and into 2018, supported by continued strength across key end-use markets (such as automotive and construction) and significant shale-linked capital investment.In particular, the prospects for the U.S. chemical industry looks bright. The American chemical industry is on course for strong growth this year and the next. The ACC envisions accelerated growth for the domestic chemical industry on the back of an improving global economy and a surge in shale-linked capital spending.The shale gas bounty is expected to drive investment on plants and equipment in the United States. Chemical makers are ramping up investment on shale gas-linked projects to take advantage of ample natural gas supplies.The European chemical industry is also finding traction again after staying down for a while. The business environment for the European chemical industry has improved on the back of improving global economic sentiment and a resurgent Eurozone economy.Chemical Stocks to ConsiderA few stocks that are worth considering in the chemicals space are Kronos Worldwide, Inc.

ROE for the trailing 12-months for Albemarle and FMC Corp. is 11.6% and 16.8%, respectively. While both stocks have scored above the industry’s level of 11.2%, FMC Corp. holds an edge here.Dividend YieldIn the last one-year period, the dividend yield for Albemarle has been higher than FMC Corp. While Albemarle offered a dividend yield of 0.9%, FMC Corp. had a yield of 0.7%.Earnings Surprise HistoryTaking a look at both the companies surprise history, Albemarle has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.3%. On the other hand, FMC Corp. has delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters while missed twice, delivering an average negative earnings surprise of 2.8%.Growth ExpectationsThe expected earnings per share growth rate for Albemarle for the current year currently stands at 24.5% compared with an expected decline of 6% for FMC Corp.

103,ALB,"The chemical industry is finding traction again after staying down for a while. The industry’s upturn is expected to continue on sustained momentum across major end-markets.Notwithstanding a few industry-related headwinds, weak demand in agricultural markets and sluggishness in China, there are a number of reasons to be optimistic about the broader chemical industry for both the short and long haul. Let’s find out what’s supporting the bullish case for chemical stocks.Shale Boom: Driving Force for Chemical investmentThe shale gas revolution in the United States has been a huge driving force behind chemical investment on plants and equipment in the country. According to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the United States has emerged as an attractive investment location and petrochemical makers are now significantly expanding capacity in the country leveraging new supplies of natural gas. New methods of extraction such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) are boosting shale production, bringing down prices of ethane (derived from shale gas) in the process.The shale boom has incentivized a number of chemical companies to pump in billions of dollars for setting up facilities (crackers) in the United States to produce ethylene and propylene in a cost-effective way. Per the ACC, 310 new chemical projects have been already announced by chemical makers worth around $185 billion that are under construction or planned. Such investments -- many backed by Federal government support -- are expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years.Rebound in ConstructionA recovery across housing and commercial construction -- major chemical end-markets -- has been another supporting factor for the chemical industry recovery. After being hit hard in the recession, the construction sector has bounced back on the back of strong housing fundamentals.Demand in the U.S. homebuilding industry remains strong and is expected to continue in the rest of 2017 and next year. Strong employment, rising income, increasing interest from first-time homebuyers, low inventory of new and existing homes and post-hurricane rebuilding efforts are among the factors that should support continued growth in housing demand.The renewal of long-stalled construction projects and long-awaited access to credit from lending institutions has also helped invigorate the commercial construction sector. The U.S. Architecture Billings Index (ABI), an economic indicator that provides a roughly nine to 12-month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, has been above 50 (a reading above 50 indicates an increase in billings) for most part of this year, indicating growth in architectural activity. The American Institute of Architects (AIA) expects non-residential construction spending to go up 3.8% in 2017 and 3.6% in 2018.Positives such as an improving economy, low interest rates, positive consumer confidence and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the construction sector’s performance.A Resilient Automotive SectorChemical makers continue to see healthy demand from the automotive sector -- a major end-use market. The last two years have been exceptional for the auto sector. Sales in the United States saw record highs in both years, while sales in China and Europe also gained strength.According to IHS Markit, global light vehicle sales are expected to increase 1.5% year over year to 93.5 million units in 2017. Moreover, IHS Markit sees U.S. light vehicle sales to reach 17.4 million units in 2017 -- a slight moderation from the 2016 level of 17.5 million units, but still looks poised for another strong year.Low interest rates, favorable financing and cheap oil have also backed a recovery in the European auto market. The auto industry in Asian countries, especially China, is also expected to thrive over the next several years. This augurs well for chemical demand in this important end-market.A Resurgent European EconomyEurozone’s economic recovery continues apace, as evident from recent upbeat economic data. The region’s recovery is backed by declining unemployment and strengthening business and consumer confidence. The European chemical industry has also swung back to life on the back of a rebounding Eurozone economy.The Eurozone GDP rose 0.6% in the third quarter of 2017 (according to Eurostat data) on a quarter-over-quarter basis, coming above the consensus estimate of 0.5%. The euro area unemployment rate also fell to its lowest level in almost nine years. Notably, the French economy (the bloc’s second-largest economy) grew at an annual rate of 2.2%, the strongest pace since 2011, on the back of consumer spending and business investment.While political risks may still remain a drag, the Eurozone economy is poised for a strong 2017. The European Commission, in its spring 2017 forecast, said that it expects the Eurozone to grow 1.7% in 2017 (up from previous estimate of 1.6%), followed by 1.8% in 2018.Recovery in Energy Space A rebound in crude oil prices has led to a recovery in demand for chemicals in the energy space, an important end-use market. Oil prices have been steadily recovering from their historic lows, currently trading above the important psychological level of $50 a barrel. The commodity has risen roughly 30% since sinking to a ten-month low of $42 a barrel in late June 2017 in the face of a surging U.S. oil output. Oil prices also recently soared to their highest level in more than two years.The rebound in crude prices is backed by the OPEC cartel’s compliance with its production cut agreement, slowing production in the United States as well as the prospects of extended oil production cuts by OPEC and other major global producers.Improving fundamentals in the energy space is expected to support chemical demand moving ahead. Rising crude prices also augur well for chemical prices as they essentially move in tandem with oil prices.Chemical M&A Wave Continues Chemical makers remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify and shore up growth. These companies are increasingly looking for cost synergy opportunities and enhanced operational scale through consolidations. The $130 billion mega-merger of The Dow Chemical Company and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (DuPont) to create DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report) -- the biggest chemical deal ever -- is a huge testimony to these strategic moves.Other major deals that have taken place in the chemical space in the recent past include China National Chemical Corporation’s $43 billion acquisition of Syngenta AG, Albemarle Corporation’s (ALB  -  Free Report) $6.2 billion buyout of Rockwood Holdings, Inc., Merck KGaA's $17 billion acquisition of Sigma-Aldrich Corp., and the $66 billion proposed mega-merger between Monsanto Company MON and Bayer AG.Strategic Measures to Yield Margin BenefitsChemical companies continue to shift their focus on high-growth markets (driven by megatrends) in an effort to whittle down their exposure on other businesses that are struggling with weak demand and input costs pressure. Moreover, cost-cutting measures and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies are expected to yield industry-wide margin improvements. Some chemical makers are also disposing non-core assets as they shift their focus on high-margin businesses.Moreover, a number of chemical makers are taking pricing actions (reflected by hikes in chemical prices in the recent past) in the wake of a sharp rise in raw materials costs. This is also expected to reap margin benefits moving ahead.Stocks to Bet on Right Now As you can see from the above-mentioned factors, there are many reasons to be optimistic about the chemical industry. Chemical stocks that are well placed in the current operating backdrop include Westlake Chemical Corp. (WLK  -  Free Report) and Kraton Corp. (KRA  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), as well as Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (APD  -  Free Report), Celanese Corp.

105,ALB,"Premium industrial metals & minerals company, BHP Billiton Limited (BHP  -  Free Report), recently reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Sep 30, 2017) operational results.Aggregate iron-ore output came in at 56 million tons (Mt) during the reported quarter, down 3% year over year. The downside was stemmed by weaker-than-expected production accrued from the Western Australia iron-ore mine, reduced opening of stockpile levels (following the Mt Whaleback screening plant fire in June 2017) and planned maintenance activities conducted in other mines.  However, BHP Billiton reaffirmed its iron-core productivity within the range of 239-243 Mt (estimating a year-over-year upside of 3-5%) for fiscal 2018. The company believes that the funding for South Flank project ( in June 2017) will likely augment gross output of this major steel-making metal in the quarters ahead.Notably, energy coal’s output in the reported quarter came in at 7 Mt, down 2% year over year. The fall was witnessed primarily due to lower productivity of the company’s Cerrejon mine.Nonetheless, it should be noted that in the fiscal first quarter, output volumes of petroleum dipped 8% year over year to 50 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe). However, productivity guidance for fiscal 2018 has been reaffirmed within the range of 180-190 MMboe.Notably, metallurgical coal output was 11 Mt in the reported quarter, flat year over year.In addition, aggregate copper output came in at 404 kilo tons (Kt), up 14% year over year. The uptick came on the back of sturdy productivity accrued from Escondida, Olympic Dam and Antamina copper mines.Moving AheadBHP Billiton intends to boost its near-term operational performance on the back of increased safety measures, greater capital discipline and elevated productivity. The company anticipates that the successful accomplishment of the three-major petroleum and potash projects (worth $5.1 billion) will boost its productivity.The company also stated that the primary development work of its Spence Growth Option and Mad Dog Phase 2 projects commenced during the third quarter. These projects are likely to bolster the company’s aggregate productivity in the near future.Our TakeOver the last six months, BHP Billiton’s shares yielded a return of 19.7%, outperforming 12.5% growth recorded by the industry. Notably, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock currently flaunts a VGM Score A.The company is poised to grow on the back of escalating prices of major core metals and operating cash cost improvements. Moreover, we believe the upward trend in iron-ore prices will likely benefit BHP Billiton going forward. Iron-ore prices were up 1.5% to $61.83 per ton as of Oct 17, 2017.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space are listed below:Albemarle Corporation (ALB  -  Free Report) has an average positive earnings surprise of 7.17% for the last four quarters and currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

The company has an expected long-term earnings per share growth of 12.3%.Albemarle has outperformed the industry it belongs to over a year, partly reflecting its forecast-topping earnings performance and its strategic growth initiatives. The company’s shares have rallied around 62.8% over this period, compared with roughly 24.1% gain recorded by the industry. Driving FactorsUpbeat prospects for the lithium business are driving Albemarle. The company remains committed to strengthen its lithium business and is well placed to leverage strong expected growth in the battery-grade lithium market.China is considering an eventual ban on production and sales of cars that run on diesel or gasoline, per a report from the country’s official news agency Xinhua, released on Sep 10. The move is part of Beijing’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions and pollution and is also aimed at promoting the development of electric and hybrid vehicles. The news appears to have provided a boost to Albemarle’s shares yesterday.Albemarle is seeing significant momentum in its lithium business. Sales from its Lithium and Advanced Materials unit jumped 36% year over year to $317.9 million in the last reported quarter, supported by favorable pricing and higher sales volume.  The buyout of the lithium assets of Jiangxi Jiangli New Materials Science and Technology Co. Ltd. has allowed Albemarle to supply premium lithium salts to an expanded global customer base and accelerated the company’s ability to meet its goal of capturing 50% of the growth in the lithium industry.The company’s Talison joint venture in Australia is also expanding lithium concentrate production at its Greenbushes mine. The expansion will double the lithium carbonate equivalent capacity at Greenbushes from 80,000 metric tons per year to more than 160,000 metric tons.Albemarle, in early 2017, also agreed to amend its lithium production rights agreement with the Chilean Economic Development Agency to extend the term of the deal and increase the company's authorized lithium quota at its facility in the Salar de Atacama, Chile. The amended agreement offers Albemarle with adequate lithium to make more than 80,000 metric tons of technical and battery grade lithium salts annually over the next 27 years at the company’s expanding battery grade manufacturing plants in La Negra, Antofagasta.Albemarle is also selling non-core businesses and assets to boost growth opportunities and focus on its key businesses. As part of this move, the company, last year, sold its Chemetall Surface Treatment unit to German chemical giant BASF (BASFY  -  Free Report) for around $3.2 billion. These divestments led to significant cash generation for Albemarle, allowing it to cut debt and strengthen its balance sheet.Albemarle currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Albemarle Corporation Price and Consensus  Albemarle Corporation Price and Consensus | Albemarle Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderStocks in the basic materials space worth considering include Kronos Worldwide Inc (KRO  -  Free Report) and Kraton Corporation (KRA  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The company’s shares have rallied around 45.5% over this period, compared with roughly 21.3% gain recorded by the industry.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.  Factors to ConsiderAlbemarle, in its first-quarter earnings call, said that it is more optimistic about 2017 based on a strong start in Lithium and Bromine Specialties and favorable outlook for both businesses.

It now expects net sales in the band of $2.9–$3.05 billion (up from $2.8–$2.95 billion expected earlier) and adjusted earnings per share of between $4.20 and $4.40 (up from $4.00–$4.25 per share) for 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the year is also expected to be between $835 million and $875 million, also an increase from $800–$840 million expected earlier.Albemarle remains committed to strengthen its lithium business and is well placed to leverage strong expected growth in the battery-grade lithium market. The company, earlier this year, said that its Talison joint venture in Australia has approved the expansion of lithium concentrate production at its Greenbushes mine. The expansion will double the lithium carbonate equivalent capacity at Greenbushes from 80,000 metric tons per year to more than 160,000 metric tons.The buyout of the lithium assets of Jiangxi Jiangli New Materials Science and Technology Co.

113,ALB,"We issued an updated research report on Cosan Limited (CZZ  -  Free Report) on Jul 17. Though the company has robust growth prospects in the near and long term, we believe that exposure to headwinds might restrict its growth momentum in the quarters ahead.Below we briefly discuss the company’s tailwinds and headwinds.One of the striking features of Cosan is its sugarcane crushing capacity. The company reportedly crushed approximately 59.4 million tons of sugarcane in crop year 2016/17 (Apr 2016−Mar 2017). It anticipates crushing sugarcane in the range of 59–63 million in the crop year Apr 2017–Mar 2018. Sugarcane is the main raw material used for producing sugar and ethanol. Cosan is the largest sugar and ethanol producer in Brazil as well as one of the largest in the world.Investments targeted at expanding existing facilities and development of Greenfield projects have proved beneficial for Cosan over time. Also, improvement of its services remains a priority for the company. Notably, it has been expanding its network of service stations over the past few quarters. As of Mar 31, 2017, the company operated approximately 6,043 Shell branded service stations.Business diversification has been an added advantage for Cosan. In addition to its core businesses, the company is engaged in the distribution of fuels and natural gas; lubricants, basic oils and specialties; investments and logistics businesses. Also, the company follows various organic and inorganic means for enhancing shareholders’ returns. The Rumo-ALL merger in particular, is expected to be beneficial for the company.For 2017, Cosan anticipates revenues in the range of R$45–R$48 billion for Cosan S.A. and EBITDA to be within R$4.75–R$5.25 billion.However, over the last three months, Cosan’s American Depository Receipts have lost 14.59%, underperforming the gain of 0.66% recorded by the Zacks categorized Agriculture/Products industry. We believe that the company’s poor performance in first-quarter 2017 was primarily responsible for the share price decline. In the quarter, the company’s revenues decreased 10.7% year over year and net income fell 83.8%. Gross margin in the quarter was down 410 basis points.    We believe that Cosan’s huge debt level, with long-term debt of approximately R$20.4 billion at the end of first-quarter 2017, increases its financial obligations. An unchecked rise in debts and costs will also prove detrimental to its profitability. Also, the company is exposed to risks arising from stiff competition, geo-political issues, adverse foreign exchange variation and unfavorable weather conditions. Adversities, especially drought, frost and heavy rainfall, can severely impact sugarcane production and hence, hurt the company’s crushing activities.  Also, sugar prices are significantly affected by a highly regulated market and speculation risks, while ethanol pricing is impacted by changes in supply and demand for gasoline.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderWith a 1.8 billion market capitalization, Cosan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the sector include Clearwater Paper Corporation (CLW  -  Free Report), KMG Chemicals, Inc. (KMG  -  Free Report) and Albemarle Corporation (ALB  -  Free Report). While Clearwater Paper sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both KMG Chemicals and Albemarle Corporation carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Clearwater Paper’s earnings expectations for 2017 improved over the past 60 days. Also, the company’s earnings are predicted to grow 5% in the next three to five years.  KMG Chemicals pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 12.54% over the last four quarters. Also, earnings estimate for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 improved over the past 60 days. Albemarle Corporation performed well in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 8.97%. Also, earnings estimate for 2017 and 2018 improved over the past 60 days.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.                                                                                                                                                                           And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation. See Them Free>>
