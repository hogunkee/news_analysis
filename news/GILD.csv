0,GILD,"Gilead Sciences' (GILD) hepatitis C downfall accelerated in the first quarter as sales declined by their widest margin in eight periods — prodding shares to topple in after-hours trading Tuesday.The biotech leader also reported total sales and adjusted profit that lagged Street forecasts. Further, it reiterated 2018 sales guidance that missed. In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Gilead plunged 4.9% after ending the regular session up a fraction, at 72.56.Sales of hepatitis C drugs Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa raked in $1.05 billion, declining 59%. That was the single biggest year-over-year decline in the eight quarters since Gilead started reporting sales of hepatitis C drugs separately from its other antiviral products.But hepatitis C drug sales narrowly topped the consensus model for $1.02 billion, according to a report from Mizuho analyst Salim Syed last week. Still, investors are wondering when sales of hepatitis C drugs will stabilize, he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Gilead cited increasing competition for its challenge in hepatitis C drugs. Harvoni lagged sales views by $140 million.Sales of HIV and hepatitis B drugs climbed 2% to $3.33 billion. But new HIV drug Biktarvy brought in just $35 million in U.S. sales. That missed the consensus for $47 million, according to Syed's week-ago report.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams says consensus numbers between $41 million and $51 million for Biktarvy were overly bullish. He also noted uptake of cancer treatment Yescarta — acquired with Kite Pharma last year — was strong at $40 million in sales vs. the consensus view for $17 million.""Strong Yescarta can't offset soft HIV/hepatitis C (drug sales),"" he said. ""But the rest of 2018 looks better.""Total revenue of $5.09 billion declined nearly 22%. Sales missed the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $5.42 billion. Adjusted profit of $1.48 per share lagged by 18 cents and fell nearly 34% year over year.For the year, Gilead reiterated guidance for $20 billion to $21 billion in product sales.

1,GILD,"GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) popped to an 11-month high Thursday after its two-drug HIV treatment proved non-inferior to a three-drug regimen using medicine from Gilead Sciences (GILD).On the stock market today, Glaxo shares jumped 1.9% to close at 41.94. Glaxo stock is forming a cup base with a buy point at 44.63. Gilead shares lifted 0.6% to close at 71.15.But analysts say Glaxo is unlikely to get much share from Gilead in HIV. A dual regimen looks competitive under ideal circumstances. In the real world, even very sick patients don't always take their medicine. This means they could become resistant to the drugs.""We think concerns over potential for resistance emergence with real-world use will limit the adoption of this dual regimen,"" RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to clients. ""We do not see much incentive for physicians to prescribe dual HIV cocktails and take any chances.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGlaxo and ViiV Healthcare tested a combination of their drugs Tivicay and Epivir, respectively, in a group of never-before-treated HIV patients. It compared that regimen to another using a two-drug combo from Gilead called Truvada plus its own Tivicay.Tivicay plus Epivir was not inferior to the three-drug regimen at 48 weeks. None of the patients who experienced virological failure developed treatment-related resistance, Glaxo said in a news release. Virological failure occurs when the treatment doesn't sufficiently suppress the virus.But ""key details such as the rates of virological failure, which would be important to understand how competitively this regimen behaves, were not yet disclosed,"" Abrahams said. Glaxo said to expect further data at an upcoming medical conference.From a real-world perspective, it will be important to look at patients who didn't always take their medicine, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a report.Abrahams notes it's in ViiV's best interest to push a two-drug regimen. The biotech previously tested a three-medicine combination that included abacavir. Abacavir had safety issues including hypersensitivity and the potential for cardiovascular risks.""Gilead's triple regimens, such as Biktarvy, do not share these liabilities,"" he said. ""And with the advent of (Gilead's tenofovir alafenamide), long-term renal/bone safety issues for Gilead's regimens have been mitigated.""Further, there have been questions regarding liver toxicity and birth defects tied to Glaxo's drug Tivicay.

2,GILD,"An agreement by Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) to defer drug price increases in an effort to play nice with President Donald Trump led analysts Wednesday to question what the fallout of the drug giant's action would be for the industry.Analysts wondered whether other pharmaceutical companies would follow Pfizer's example. Though, notably, Celgene (CELG) is still going ahead with 5% increases for blockbuster cancer drugs Revlimid and Pomalyst, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a report.""Pfizer's unprecedented reversal of its early July price increases marks tangible administrative influence,"" Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger said in his report to clients. He noted Pfizer is awaiting more details from a so-called blueprint to tug down drug prices in the U.S.Late Tuesday, Pfizer said Chief Executive Ian Read had an extensive discussion with Trump, leading the company to back off price increases on drugs that had been effective July 1. Earlier in the week, Trump attacked Pfizer and others for raising ""drug prices for no reason.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Pfizer shares the president's concern for patients and commitment to providing affordable access to the medicines they need,"" Read said in a written statement. He also noted Pfizer had committed $5 billion of capital to expand manufacturing in the U.S.But not everyone jived with Pfizer's and Trump's announcements.Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., called on Pfizer and the Trump administration to reveal the details of the arrangement that led Pfizer to back off drug prices increases.""Secret, sweetheart arrangements with Big Pharma companies are exactly why America's drug pricing system is broken,"" he tweeted. ""Trump and his Admin are busy trying to score cheap PR points why Pharma (companies) continue to raise prices by DOUBLE digits.""Pfizer stock dipped 0.6% at the close, to 37.21. Broadly, shares of pharmaceutical companies fell about the same amount on the stock market today.Trump renewed his pledge in May to lower the cost of prescription medicine in the U.S. At the time, analysts largely said the proposed blueprint appeared to be more rhetoric than reform.Morgan Stanley's Risinger believes Pfizer's U.S. price increase reversal could have slightly negative implications for the second-quarter earnings season. He notes Pfizer's updated guidance commentary will be key later this month.""In addition, the news could put a near-term damper on future price increase action by other pharma-bio companies,"" he said. ""But Pfizer indicated that its action is temporary since it only committed to keeping prices unchanged through the end of 2018.""Other pharmaceutical companies could also rethink their 2019 guidance, he said.""Whether manufacturers limit themselves to one price increase per year or hold off entirely on customary January increases is key swing factor to earnings which we think is underestimated by the market,"" he said.Even Celgene's price increases for Revlimid and Pomalyst remain in line with 2018 medical inflation of 5.3%, RBC's Abrahams said. They are also below historical increases. Meanwhile, Gilead Sciences (GILD) joined Pfizer and walked back on planned price increases, he noted.""We see this more reserved price increase and increased transparency as potentially tempering headline risk and public scrutiny, as has been experienced by Pfizer, and it's in line with our view that companies will self-police in price increases to a much larger degree from now on,"" he said.Also Wednesday, Pfizer announced it would split its business into three distinct units in 2019 as it contends with looming losses of exclusivity. Under the restructuring, Pfizer's Innovative Medicines division will include biosimilars, anti-infection drugs and sterile injectables. Its Established Medicines unit will include off-patent branded and generic drugs, Finally, the company's Consumer Healthcare branch will hold all over-the-counter medicines.Innovative Medicines will run all the current Innovative Health businesses as well as the new Hospital Medicines business unit. Pfizer will also incorporate its biosimilar portfolio into its Oncology, and Inflammation and Immunology units.Established Medicines will hold the majority of Pfizer's off-patent drugs. This includes Lyrica, cholesterol drug Lipitor, high blood pressure drug Norvasc and erectile dysfunction drug Viagra. The business will run globally.The unit is meant to operate ""as a true stand-alone business within Pfizer,"" the company said in a news release. It will have its own manufacturing, marketing, regulatory and, with some exceptions, enabling functions.Consumer Healthcare, on the other hand, differs from Pfizer's two prescription medicine businesses, Pfizer said. The firm confirmed it's still mulling strategic alternatives for this unit. It expects to make a decision before the end of the year.""Trends in consumerism and an increased focus on staying healthy are causing consumers to seek easily accessible health and wellness solutions,"" the firm said.

3,GILD,"The first half of 2018 has been a dichotomy between the haves and the have-nots among biotech companies, a Wall Street brokerage says.But in this case the haves aren't large-cap biotech companies like Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) — all of which have struggled with negative clinical studies or regulatory delays for key drugs. Instead, it's the small- and midcap biotech companies that are leading the pack.RBC Capital Markets analysts call it ""a tale of two biotechs.""Multiples among large-cap biotech companies have slipped and sales projections have taken a beating. Meanwhile, prices for quality assets among small- and midcap biotech companies ""have never been higher and the competition fierce.""""Generalists who are able to hold smaller-cap companies are tending to invest in the (iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (IBB)) rather than just a handful of large-caps,"" RBC wrote in a note to clients this week.

The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) toppled 3.2%, to 93.62. Biotech stocks are now ranked No. 13 out of 197 industry groups IBD tracks, up from No. 30 just eight weeks ago.The struggles in the large-cap space for biotech companies have been well documented. The Street isn't entirely hopeful for one of Biogen's potential Alzheimer's disease treatments. Biogen is developing the drug called BAN2401 with Eisai.At the same time, other potential catalysts have left biotech stocks wanting. Clinical studies from Gilead, Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Aimmune Therapeutics (AIMT) were ""anticlimactic,"" RBC analysts wrote.Celgene suffered a massive hit when the Food and Drug Administration delayed its experimental multiple sclerosis drug, ozanimod.The news is ""fueling continued questions about these companies' abilities to succeed in a second or third 'act' before their cash flows expire from patent cliffs,"" the RBC analysts said.They noted some biotech companies appear to have good launches for new drugs. They list Amgen's (AMGN) migraine prevention treatment Aimovig and Gilead's Biktarvy, an HIV medication. But even those aren't enough to offset underlying revenue issues, analysts say.Investors are seemingly taking a dim view for large-cap biotech stocks.""Our investor survey suggests worsening generalist sentiment with reticence to come back to the space, and our anecdotal feedback suggests frustration with challenges at companies like Celgene has led many to rotate out of the sector, through we sense a few may be looking to dip their toes back in,"" they wrote.However, the small- and midcap space ""could not be behaving more differently.""Innovation in gene therapy and cellular therapy resulted in the acquisitions this year. Novartis (NVS) bought AveXis and Celgene acquired Juno Therapeutics.This is helping to send other ""cutting-edge"" biotech stocks like Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) and Sage Therapeutics (SAGE). Sarepta is now flying high on data from its gene therapy in a form of muscular dystrophy. Sage is working on a number of depression drugs.""In fact, 2018 biopharma M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activity (in terms of dollars) has nearly tripled that seen up to mid-June 2017,"" the RBC analysts said. ""IPO (initial public offering) and secondary activity has remained vibrant with 23 biotech IPOs so far this year, raising $2.5 billion in aggregate.""Takeouts could occur among small- and midcap biotech companies. Analysts list Sage, Sarepta, BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN), Exelixis (EXEL), Seattle Genetics (SGEN), Tesaro (TSRO), Clovis Oncology (CLVS), Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) and Alder Pharmaceuticals (ALDR) as potential targets.But even small- and midcap biotech stocks are walking a thin line, they said.""Being on the right side of catalysts (and M&A) will likely be key in the second half of 2018,"" the analysts said.

4,GILD,"Finding the best biotech companies to invest in can be tricky as volatility often pockmarks the space. Clinical plans don't always come to fruition and sometimes biotech stocks can suffer at the hands of regulatory decisions from the Food and Drug Administration.But the best biotech companies to invest in tend to have a commonality: A strong streak of earnings growth. As of June 2018, Investor's Business Daily's MarketSmith.com has two biotech stocks among a 150-strong list of the fastest growing stocks.Near the top of the list of fastest growing stocks, Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) is ranked eighth. Over the past five years, its earnings per share have grown a massive 147%, compared to 319% for the top-earning stock, Momo (MOMO), a Chinese social media firm.Supernus has made a name for itself among biotech stocks. Though in terms of market cap it still trails bigger biotech companies like Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Biogen (BIIB) and Celgene (CELG). But Supernus lands itself on the list you might consider as the best biotech companies to invest in for strong metrics. As always, do your research before buying any stock, and be sure to check the company's stock chart to make sure it's the right time to buy.It has several years of double-digit quarterly sales growth with drugs that help disorders of the central nervous system. Among those, Supernus counts epilepsy drugs Oxtellar XR (extended-release) and Trokendi XR.Trokendi XR is also approved to prevent migraines. It rivals drugs like Botox from Allergan (AGN) and Amgen's Aimovig.Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) is unique among biotech stocks. Though IBD ranks it No. 144 out of 150 of the fastest growing stocks — which might put it on your research list for the possible best biotech companies to invest in — it doesn't market a single drug.Instead, Ligand acquires early-stage technologies necessary for drug development. It then licenses these platforms out to pharmaceutical companies like Dow Jones stocks Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE). As of June 2018, Ligand has a year of both double-digit sales and earnings growth under its belt.Ligand and Supernus both have IBD Composite Ratings of 99, meaning they perform in the top 1% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.

5,GILD,"Celgene (CELG) toppled to a four-year low Thursday after it appeared on a list from the Food and Drug Administration that tried to ""shame"" drugmakers working to block generic competition.Some pharmaceutical and biotech companies are ""gaming"" the system by limiting access to their drugs for generic rivals needing to do equivalence studies, the FDA said. Analysts, though, expect the so-called ""shame list"" to have little more than a headline impact on these companies.In total, Celgene received 31 inquiries for samples of drugs Revlimid, Pomalyst and Thalomid. All three have Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, programs to ensure the benefits of the drugs outweigh the risks. These drugs have certain distribution requirements.Celgene reportedly said any biotech companies wanting to access these drugs would need to follow specific rules.

As of now, the drug is ""gated more by (intellectual property) than regulatory questions,"" he said.Mizuho analyst Salim Syed agreed. Celgene is already working through generic litigation regarding Revlimid. Analysts expect copycat drugs in 2022.""We believe this is more modest headline risk than actual business risk,"" he said in his report.On the stock market today, Celgene shares dipped 1.7%, to close at 79.98.

The FDA will also decide the fate of a drug dubbed Venclexta in a form of leukemia.Stock market trackers also expects Celgene to unveil data from late-stage studies of Revlimid and luspatercept. Celgene partners with Acceleron Pharma (XLRN) on luspatercept in two blood diseases. Revlimid is Celgene's major cancer drug.Celgene could also reveal more about its Juno Therapeutics acquisition, through which it is moving into a class of cancer therapy known as CAR-T, short for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy.

Physicians can already use Dupixent to treat eczema. The duo also has cemiplimab, which the FDA is considering in an advanced form of skin cancer.In addition, Intra-Cellular Therapies (ITCI) is working on a drug dubbed lumateperone as a schizophrenia treatment. Analysts will focus on whether the FDA accepts the application for approval based on ""mixed Phase 3 data,"" Porges said.""Intra-Cellular will also report topline data from the ongoing Phase 3 study in bipolar depression in the second half, as they look for a second indication for lumateperone,"" he said.Porges expects Zogenix (ZGNX) to have data for a late-stage study of its drug, ZX008. Researchers are considering the drug as a treatment for a type of epilepsy called Dravet syndrome. GW Pharmaceuticals' (GWPH) drug, Epidiolex, will likely gain approval for this use in June.Additionally, Dova Pharmaceuticals (DOVA) and FibroGen (FGEN) have catalysts in chronic liver and chronic kidney diseases, respectively. Dova expects the FDA to soon decide whether to approve its drug. FibroGen expects to unveil topline data from a study of its drug in the second half of the year.The FDA is also taking a flexible stance on orphan drug development, Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said in the note.

8,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) tumbled to an 11-month low Wednesday after reporting a three-part miss — producing ""the first significant disappointment of the large-biotech earnings season,"" according to a Leerink analyst.Wall Street estimates were too bullish for total revenue, HIV drug sales and the faltering hepatitis C franchise, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. He cut his revenue forecast by 6%-8% for 2018 and 2019.""Our estimates were consistently too high as we failed to incorporate the increasingly acute reduction in both channel inventory and net price that dominated Gilead's first-quarter results and undermined reported sales,"" he said.As a result, Gilead's $5.09 billion in total revenue lagged Porges' model by 13%. Hepatitis C drug sales missed his estimate by 27%, and revenue from HIV drugs came in 8% lower than he expected.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn afternoon trading on the stock market today, Gilead shucked off 7.4%, near 67.20. The stock toppled as much as 9% in earlier trades. Meanwhile, biotech stocks collectively rose a fraction.Gilead's hepatitis C franchise has crumbled under the weight of its own success as high cure rates have led to fewer patients. Late Tuesday, Gilead reported its biggest year-over-year sales decline for hepatitis C drugs since it started reporting that unit separately.By some estimates, hepatitis C drug sales beat expectations for $1.02 billion. But Porges noted that sales were 12% below another consensus model. New patient volumes fell 12% sequentially, but Gilead kept its expectation for the business to stabilize in mid-2018.""Importantly, the company was totally frank with investors, which we appreciate, that it believes '2018 is a trough year,' "" Mizuho analyst Salim Syed wrote in a note. ""This is the first time, to our knowledge, that the company has specifically stated this.""Of the three hepatitis C drugs, Harvoni was hardest hit.

""That basically hits the low end of the range ($3.5 billion).""During the quarter, HIV drugs raked in $3.33 billion, up 2%. But that missed views on an ""exaggerated seasonal inventory effect,"" RBC analyst Brian Williams said in a note.""Encouragingly, though, volumes and share metrics remain directionally favorable, suggesting the core franchise is still healthy and should perform well the rest of the year,"" he said.Biktarvy, Gilead's newest HIV drug, brought in $35 million in the U.S., lagging the most bullish views. But Williams sees that number as indicative of a strong contribution from the drug in 2018.It's also possible Biktarvy is already taking share from other drugs. The company notes that 80% of its volume is coming from patients switching to Biktarvy. A third are switching from Gilead's own Genvoya and 20% from GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) drugs Tivicay/Triumeq.""Gilead believes Biktarvy will become the No. 1 single-tablet regimen ultimately,"" Mizuho analyst Syed said.

11,GILD,"Tiny biotech CymaBay (CBAY) launched to a high not seen in a month Wednesday after unveiling strong data for a liver disease treatment — to the detriment of Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT), which has struggled with its rival drug.On the stock market today, shares of CymaBay soared 11.4% to close at 13.44, after earlier rocketing as much as 24.3%. Meanwhile, Intercept sank 6.6% to 70.11. Biotech stocks collectively advanced 0.2%.CymaBay is testing a drug called seladelpar as a second treatment option for a liver disease known as primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC. Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz noted the results so far compare favorably with Intercept's drug, Ocaliva.""We continue to view seladelpar as an attractive agent (as a second treatment option in) PBC despite Ocaliva's advantage of earlier market entry,"" Schwartz said in a note to clients. He raised his expectations for seladelpar's success to 75% from a prior view of 60%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSeladelpar was tested in patients who had abnormally high levels of the enzyme alkaline phosphate. At 12 weeks, patients treated with 2-milligram, 5-milligram and 10-milligram doses of seladelpar saw their alkaline phosphate levels cut by 21%, 33% and 45%, respectively.At 26 weeks, patients who received 5-10 milligrams of CymaBay's drug had alkaline phosphate reductions of 43% to 45%. Overall, 29% of patients had normal alkaline phosphate levels at 26 weeks.The drug wasn't associated with any itching that sometimes can occur with PBC, CymaBay said in a news release. Patients in the 10-milligram dose group saw a 24% decrease in itching at week 26, suggesting the drug could have anti-itching activity.Importantly, the lack of liver toxicity is a ""huge plus,"" Schwartz said. That was a concern after patients taking Intercept's Ocaliva experienced liver injury or died. Intercept argued the patients were receiving inappropriately high doses of Ocaliva.CymaBay noted chronic doses of 2-10 milligrams of seladelpar didn't lead to liver toxicity. This means physicians should be able to adjust patients' doses without worry of liver injury or death, Schwartz said.""With Ocaliva's recent resolution to its FDA label, investors have grown particularly cautious on liver toxicity for PBC drugs,"" he said. ""Today's update should quell such concerns.""The firm is now on track to begin a Phase 3 study in the second half of 2018. CymaBay expects to test the 5-milligram and 10-milligram doses of seladelpar in the study. Schwartz also sees CymaBay grabbing success with seladelpar into nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a liver disease.CymaBay is now in midstage testing with seladelpar in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. Other players in the NASH drug race include Intercept, Gilead Sciences (GILD), Shire (SHPG), Allergan (AGN) and Novartis (NVS).RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

14,GILD,"Gilead Sciences' (GILD) viral franchises look strong heading into first-quarter earnings season, but fellow large caps Biogen (BIIB) and Celgene (CELG) are on shakier ground, an analyst said Wednesday.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams calls for Gilead to top expectations, with Biogen likely to miss on the bottom line. Celgene, still reeling from the sudden departure of its chief operating officer, is typically weak in the first period.But clinical studies and business development are more important in biotech, he said.""We believe clinical trial successes and increased mergers-and-acquisitions activity will be more important to help improve sentiment given renewed drug pricing, competitive and life-cycle concerns across the sector,"" he said in a note to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGilead gained 2.2% to close at 75.40, while Biogen climbed 2.2% to 272.40. Celgene jumped 4.2% to 90. 47 on a possible rebound after dropping in the wake of the sudden and unexplained departure of its chief operating officer. COO Scott Smith left late last week.Up 2.8% for the day, the biotech group was ranked first just 26 weeks ago and fifth as recently as eight weeks ago. It's now slipped to No. 11 out of 197 groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily. Shares hit a 30-month high in March but have since toppled about 12% from that point.Abrahams calls for a strong quarter for Gilead. HIV drugs are becoming more important to the firm's top line and the hepatitis C market is stabilizing.More HIV patients are using regimens that contain a drug known as tenofovir alafenamide, or TAF. Among those, Abrahams sees Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey beating expectations and taking share from its own Atripla and Stribild.Biktarvy, a three-drug treatment for HIV, is still early into its launch. It's expected to bring in $47 million in the first quarter, and ""sales look to be tracking ahead of the consensus projecting out longer term, in 2019,"" he said.Hepatitis C drugs Harvoni and Epclusa are seen beating views for $923 million. Abrahams models $1.02 billion for the two drugs. That's despite competition from AbbVie's (ABBV) new drug Mavyret, which treats a wide group of hepatitis C patients.""If the franchises perform as we expect, we could see an 8-cent bottom-line beat in the first quarter and earnings per share tracking to exceed the consensus for the year — which we believe would help drive upside as the pipeline matures and visibility increases into earnings growth in the out years,"" he said.Abrahams has an outperform rating on Gilead shares.Biogen looks ""generally solid"" for the first quarter. Abrahams expects $3.13 billion in sales to be slightly below the consensus for $3.15 billion based on prescription trends. He expects earnings per share to come in 8 cents below the consensus.Multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera is experiencing steady erosion. But Celgene's experimental drug ozanimod has been delayed in multiple sclerosis. Meanwhile, revenue from spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza is likely to be in line.""With multiple sclerosis contracts for 2018 secured, key competitor ozanimod delayed and a temporary lull in competitive spinal muscular atrophy news flow, we expect the focus of the call to be on potential out-year growth drivers,"" he said.The biotech is expected to outline plans for aducanumab, which is being tested in Alzheimer's disease. Recently, Biogen made some changes to its studies for the drug. Investors also are likely to key in on potential acquisition talk.""We expect shares to trade in-line pending more clarity on the long-term picture,"" he said. Abrahams boosted his price target to 330 from 316. He has a sector perform rating on the stock.The first quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Celgene, ""though we believe it should be solid enough to allay any concerns emerging following the departure of their president/chief operating officer,"" Abrahams said.Abrahams boosted his expectations for inflammation drug Otezla to $346 million in the first quarter and $1.63 billion for the year — in line with consensus views. Otezla sales have been a source of pain in the past, widely missing in the third period before rebounding in the fourth.But Abrahams lowered views for Pomalyst, an anti-cancer drug, ""to reflect weaker-than-expected use patterns"" and the likelihood of indirect erosion from Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Darzalex.Investor focus will be on the next steps for ozanimod after U.S. regulators rejected the drug in multiple sclerosis. Celgene could also offer up further details for Acceleron Pharma (XLRN)-partnered luspatercept in blood diseases.Abrahams cut his price target to 120 from 131.

15,GILD,"Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) is teaming up with a group of former Kite Pharma executives to take on Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in advanced cancer treatments.Early Tuesday, Pfizer said it entered into an alliance with privately held Allogene Therapeutics to develop advanced forms of chimeric antigen receptor T cell, or CAR-T, therapy. Pfizer will take a 25% stake in Allogene.These therapies represent ""a potentially transformative approach to treating cancer, and we are very excited about what the future may hold for this area of research,"" Pfizer's head of oncology research and development Robert Abraham said in a written statement.During the regular session on the stock market today, Pfizer rose 1.8% to close at 35.68. Gilead ticked up 0.8% to 73.75. Novartis advanced 0.7% to 80.12.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCAR-T therapies from Gilead and Novartis already are on the market. These drugs are created using a patient's own extracted immune cells. Scientists reprogram a patient's cells to fight cancer before returning them to the patient.Pfizer and Allogene are aiming to create an allogeneic version of the treatment, which uses healthy donor cells. If successful, allogeneic CAR-T drugs would be less costly to produce than traditional CAR-T treatments.Scientists remain split on whether the allogeneic approach will work. But that was also the case for traditional CAR-T therapies. Then, Gilead and Novartis grabbed approvals in several types of blood cancer, Allogene Chief Executive and President David Chang said.""Many believed the idea of CAR-T therapy was rooted in science fiction, but science fiction has become a reality,"" he said in a written statement.Chang was Kite's chief medical officer and headed up its research department. Gilead bought Kite last year just after U.S. regulators approved its drug, Yescarta, to treat an aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Arie Belldegrun, Kite founder and former chief executive, also moved to Allogene where he will serve as executive chairman.Pfizer will also keep its 8% stake in Cellectis (CLLS). The deal with Allogene will also allow Cellectis and Allogene to work together on allogeneic CAR-T. Cellectis is furthest along with an allogeneic approach, while Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) is working on a rival.French pharma group Servier is sponsoring two clinical tests of Pfizer and Cellectis' partnered drug, UCART19. The drug is in Phase 1 studies as a potential treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. If approved, it would be an ""off-the-shelf"" form of CAR-T.""The development of off-the-shelf, allogeneic CAR-T therapy in the field of oncology initiates a revolution that could potentially expand access of such innovative treatment to a larger number of oncologists and patients,"" Servier President Olivier Laureau said in a prepared statement.RELATED:How Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?Long-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

19,GILD,"A German biotech with the potential to rival Gilead Sciences (GILD), Novartis (NVS) and Celgene (CELG) in cancer drugs is looking to raise $150 million in a Nasdaq initial public offering, according to a recent filing.MorphoSys filed its registration statement in the U.S. on Thursday. It hasn't yet priced the IPO, but in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing said it plans to raise $150 million. That would help line its coffers as MorphoSys plows ahead with a late-stage oncology drug.The firm's late-stage treatment would rival approved drugs called CAR-T therapies, which aim to teach a patient's immune system to identify and fight cancer. Novartis and Gilead crossed the finish line last year with CAR-T treatments called Kymriah and Yescarta, respectively.Kymriah is used to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients age 25 and younger. Novartis is also seeking approval for Kymriah in a disease called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, where Gilead's Yescarta is already approved.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLike Kymriah and Yescarta, MorphoSys' drug called MOR208 targets an antigen called CD19. Unlike Kymriah and Yescarta, MOR208 isn't a CAR-T drug; it belongs to a class called monoclonal antibodies. It's being developed to treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.MorphoSys recently unveiled strong results for MOR208 in combination with lenalidomide, sold by Celgene under the brand name Revlimid, in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The trial is still ongoing, MorphoSys said in a news release earlier this month.Preliminary results show patients achieved a median progression-free survival rate of 50.4% after 12 months of treatment. Overall, 49% of patients responded to the regimen with 31% having a complete response. The regimen was also well tolerated with no unexpected toxicities.In earlier-stage testing, MorphoSys is also working on a therapy for multiple myeloma called MOR202. This could rival drugs from Celgene — via Celgene's acquisition of Juno Therapeutics. Celgene is looking at CAR-T treatments for multiple myeloma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and other blood cancers.The German biotech also has developed and licensed a drug to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) being investigated in rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, an eczema drug in development with partner Galapagos (GLPG), and another drug being looked at for its anti-tumor properties.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Next Nvidia?

20,GILD,"A dozen drugs launching in 2018 from heavy hitters like Roche (RHHBY), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are expected to reach blockbuster status by the end of 2022, an analytics firm says.Clarivate Analytics describes 2018 as ""the year of the blockbuster,"" in which these 12 drugs have either launched or are expected to launch, and eventually bring in north of $1 billion in sales over a five-year period. That's the biggest number since Clarivate began making its forecast in 2013.It's setting up ""to be an exciting year that will see valuable additions to existing treatments as well as disruptions to certain markets and first-in-class treatment options for some diseases,"" the firm said in its report, issued late Thursday.By the end of 2022, three drugs from Roche, Gilead and Novo Nordisk (NVO) are expected to top $3 billion each in annual sales with the remaining nine likely to account for $1 billion to $2 billion a year in revenue, analysts said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAmong the 12 are two diabetes drugs, a Food and Drug Administration-approved medicine derived from cannabis plants and the first in a series of drugs expected to prevent migraines in some patients. In all, these dozen drugs are projected to collectively top $22.5 billion in sales in 2022.Roche's Hemlibra, a treatment for some patients with hemophilia A, tops the list and is expected to generate north of $4 billion in sales in 2022. Though there only 350,000 hemophilia A patients in the world — with roughly 30% of them eligible for Hemlibra — the treatment costs $482,000 the first year and $448,000 every year after that.The drug was approved three months early and launched in December 2017. Sales of $496 million are forecast for 2018 with the drug set to reach blockbuster status in 2019 at a forecasted $1.46 billion.Hemlibra is expected to take share from Shire's (SHPG) Feiba and Novo Nordisk's NovoSeven.Hemlibra also will compete against Bioverativ's (BIVV) Eloctate and Shire's Advate. For 2018, Eloctate was forecast to be a blockbuster, but Advate will continue to be the market leader with an estimated $1.8 billion in sales.""However, (Advate) sales are forecast to decline further thereafter,"" the Clarivate report said.Gilead's Biktarvy grabbed approval in February and targets an estimated 37 million people globally living with HIV. Of those, 21 million are receiving antiretroviral therapy which suppresses viral replication and allows the immune system to strengthen.Biktarvy adds to Gilead's HIV franchise which has long rivaled that of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). The two have traded market share since 2006 when Gilead first entered the market with Atripla. Two of Gilead's HIV drugs were featured in Clarivate's 2016 Drugs to Watch report.In 2019, Biktarvy will become a blockbuster, generating $2.28 billion in sales before spiking to $4.3 billion in 2021 and declining to $3.72 billion in 2022, the report says. The trajectory is similar to GSK drug Triumeq, which is expected to bring in $3.68 billion this year, five years after its launch.Rounding out the top three, Novo Nordisk got approval for diabetes drug Ozempic in December. The drug helps stimulate the body's own insulin release and limit how much sugar gets into the blood from the liver, and slows down how quickly food leaves the stomach.Ozempic is expected to become a blockbuster in 2020 with $1.58 billion in revenue on its way to $3.47 billion in 2022.In 2017, immuno-oncology treatments from Novartis (NVS) and Gilead grabbed headlines for ""their ability to revolutionize the treatment of the disease,"" the report said. And more than half of all drugs on the potential blockbuster list were cancer therapies.But in 2018 just one drug on the list of expected blockbusters is a cancer treatment.Erleada, a product of Dow Jones component Johnson & Johnson, was approved in February to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer that hasn't spread across the body. J&J and fellow Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) have drugs that treat the same cancer once it's spread.""While Zytiga and Xtandi battle to expand their market share, including the market for patients with non-metastatic disease, J&J's second-generation oral anti-androgen, Erleada, became the first approved in that setting in mid-February 2018,"" Clarivate said.The drug is projected to bring in $1.2 billion in 2020 and rise to $2 billion in 2022. It also could be expanded to treat other forms of prostate cancer and in combination with J&J's Zytiga contribute to its blockbuster potential.In 2021, GSK's shingles vaccine, called Shingrix, and a rare disease drug from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) known as patisiran are expected to join the blockbuster list with $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in sales, respectively.Revenue is expected to hit a respective $1.37 billion and $1.21 billion in 2022.GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) is expected to grab approval this summer for the first cannabidiol drug derived from the cannabis plant to treat patients with two seizure disorders. In 2022, the drug, called Epidiolex, is expected to generate $1.19 billion in sales.""If approved, Epidiolex will likely encounter bureaucratic barriers to distribution and political hurdles associated with cannabis-derived medicines, particularly in the U.S., where strict guidelines for use of medicinal cannabis exist,"" the report said.But the biotech isn't alone in this market. Cara Pharmaceuticals (CARA), Insys Therapeutics (INSY) and Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (ZYNE) are also working on treatments based on the cannabis plant.A migraine drug from Amgen (AMGN) and Novartis, Aimovig, is projected to bring in $115 million in 2018 sales before spiking to $1.17 billion in 2022 sales. This drug, and others like it, seek to prevent migraines by blocking a specific peptide, or group of amino acids.If approved, Aimovig would be the first drug known as an anti-CGRP to market, ahead of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) and Eli Lilly (LLY). Allergan (AGN) also is working in this area.""A first-in-class mover advantage will be crucial for Aimovig since competition from two other subcutaneously administered monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP is not far behind,"" Clarivate said. Lilly and Teva filed for FDA approval of their drugs late last year.Meanwhile, Alder is in Phase 3 testing with its drug. Analysts are worried, though, that Alder may falter in submitting its application to the FDA after co-founder Randall Schatzman unexpectedly stepped down from his chief executive role on Tuesday.In other areas, Shire's lanadelumab, a treatment for a swelling disorder, is forecast to bring in $1.15 billion in 2022. Next is AbbVie's (ABBV) Elagolix, a treatment for painful symptoms associated with menstruation.Rounding out the list, Pfizer and Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Steglatro and Indivior's opioid dependence drug Sublocade are forecast to become blockbusters in 2022 with $1.09 billion and $1.07 billion in sales, respectively.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?How To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

Biotech stocks were up a small fraction.The deal between Alnylam and Regeneron is based on Regeneron's discovery of a variation in the HSD17B13 gene which is tied to reduced risk of, or protection from, various chronic liver diseases, the firm said in a press release.Regeneron's findings stem from a large-scale human genetics effort undertaken by the Regeneron Genetics Center. The new potential therapeutic target could be used to trim the risk of, or halt the progression of, some chronic liver diseases.Alnylam and Regeneron plan to look at potential treatments for a disease known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in which the liver suffers damage similar to that caused by alcohol. Patients are often obese or have type 2 diabetes.They plan to use Alnylam's expertise in RNA interference to target the HSD17B13 gene. RNA interference allows researchers to specifically target and silence any gene involved in the cause or pathway of human disease.Piper Jaffray's Tenthoff says the collaboration could expand into a co-development or co-commercialization deal.

But shares crumbled to a four-year low on Monday on a report its head of business development exited in April. Shares of biotech companies rose a fraction.On Wednesday, Argus analyst David Toung downgraded Celgene to hold rating from buy. But, at the same time, analysts with Sanford C. Bernstein upgraded the stock to an outperform rating from market perform, reportedly saying its valuation is too cheap to ignore.Toung, though, is concerned about the longevity of cancer drug Revlimid. Generic pharmaceutical companies like Mylan (MYL) and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) are vying to make copycats of Revlimid. Revlimid's patents extend until 2024 in the U.S. and 2027 in Europe.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

To contend, Celgene acquired Juno Therapeutics. Juno's leading drug candidate, a cancer treatment, could bring in up to $3 billion in peak-year sales, but Toung doesn't expect a commercial launch for 18 months.Celgene also put down $1.1 billion to acquire Impact Biomedicines, which has an experimental cancer drug.

It's also working with Bluebird Bio (BLUE) on a multiple myeloma treatment.""While these pipeline assets are promising, their combined potential revenue is not enough to completely replace Revlimid, in our view,"" Toung said.Toung's assessment follows a Food and Drug Administration list that attempts to ""shame"" several pharmaceutical companies for blocking generic competition for big drugs. Among large biotech companies the FDA also lists Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB).Celgene has also had a number of missteps in recent history. Last October, it scrapped studies of a drug called GED-301 as a Crohn's disease treatment. In February, the FDA said it wouldn't review a drug called ozanimod in multiple sclerosis. That drug is now delayed by at least a year.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top? Easy: Look For Heavy DistributionInvesting Basics: How To Sell A StockSell And Take Profits Or Hold?

25,GILD,"Shares of drug giant Merck (MRK) fell Tuesday after a federal judge tossed a record $2.54 billion verdict it had won against Gilead Sciences (GILD) over a hepatitis treatment.A federal jury in 2016 had said Gilead owed Merck 10% of the sales of its Sovaldi and Harvoni hepatitis C drugs. District Court Judge Leonard Stark in Wilmington, Del., agreed Friday with Gilead's argument that the Merck patent was invalid.The patent, issued in 2009, is for a compound that Merck's Idenix unit contends is the basis for all major treatments for hepatitis C, including ones made by Gilead. Merck claimed it was first to synthesize the compound, while Gilead said it didn't cover a new idea.Patent owners are required to describe inventions with enough detail to allow others to replicate them without unnecessary time and effort. In this case, Stark said, Merck's patent covered so many potential compounds that it would take ""excessive experimentation"" to narrow them down.Based on that, ""the only reasonable finding"" is that the patent is invalid, Stark said in the decision.Merck shares lost 1.3% to close at 54.98. Foster City, Calif.-based Gilead added 0.3% to 80.94. Merck, based in Kenilworth, N.J., pledged to appeal the judge's findings, saying it ""does not reflect the facts of the case.""""The patent at issue in this case facilitated significant advances in the treatment of patients with HCV infection, and achieving these advancements required many years of research and significant investment by our subsidiary and its partners,"" the company said in a written statement.""We believe strong patent protection is essential to innovation,"" Merck added. ""Given that it guarantees a firm a period of return on investment, patent protection provides the research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with an incentive to invest in research and development.""Sovaldi was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2013 and Harvoni got the regulatory go-ahead a year later. Merck's drug, Zepatier, was approved in 2016.Gilead had conceded infringement of the patent, a common legal tactic that allowed it to focus on the validity issue during trial. After rejecting Gilead's argument about the patent, the jury said that Gilead owed 10% royalties on $25.4 billion in total sales for the two drugs.In a separate part of the ruling, Stark rejected Gilead's argument that the damages amount was unfair — an issue that becomes important only if the patent is later revived on appeal.The verdict was the largest patent-infringement verdict in U.S. history, dwarfing the next biggest, a $1.67 billion verdict won by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) against Abbott Laboratories (ABT) that was later thrown out on appeal, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

26,GILD,"A couple of relatively obscure biotechs are challenging the likes of Novartis (NVS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) with a new form of treating cancer that not only could undercut their bigger rivals, it could render recently approved oncology drugs from those drug giants obsolete.X Novartis and Gilead are still in the early stages of launching their respective drugs called Kymriah and Yescarta, which are known as CAR-T drugs. But Cellectis (CLLS) and Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) — each with a tiny fraction of their rivals' market cap — already are creeping in with an off-the-shelf variation on CAR-T therapy that uses healthy donor cells to create a less expensive version of these cancer drugs.This could make treatments from Novartis and Gilead ""less attractive or obsolete,"" Instinet analyst Christopher Marai told Investor's Business Daily.""Never mind pricing. (These) could be dosed more effectively,"" Marai said.CAR-T therapy is a form of oncology treatment currently created by extracting immune cells from a patient's blood. Using an ""empty"" virus, drugmakers affix what are known as chimeric antigen receptors to the immune system T cells.These receptors, also known as CARs, are proteins that can recognize other proteins used by cancer cells to hide in the body. When these re-engineered T cells are reintroduced to the body, they are directed to seek out and destroy cancer cells carrying those proteins.But the process is complex and costly. It's also tailored to individuals, meaning these drugs can't be mass produced and often take weeks to manufacture. Some patients die while they're waiting, Crispr Chief Executive Sam Kulkarni told Investor's Business Daily.His off-the-shelf approach to CAR-T is aiming to change that.Off-the-shelf CAR-T, also known as allogeneic, uses healthy donor cells to prompt the same immune response as first-generation CAR-Ts that Novartis and Gilead are using, known as autologous. Kulkarni says the donor cells are typically healthier, allowing for a more robust response in patients.The manufacturing process is less complex and, from one run, could make hundreds of doses, Kulkarni said. And because the process is uniform, it's less costly. Cellectis has estimated its cost of goods at less than $5,000 per patient. Autologous CAR-T runs into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, experts say.Kulkarni and Marai note the benefits of allogeneic CAR-T could be huge if the theory pans out in late-stage clinical testing.Healthy donor cells could also prompt a better response than using compromised T cells from a cancer patient, they say. Patients could also potentially receive repeat doses if the benefit doesn't persist from one dose. That's difficult with the much pricier autologous CAR-T.""Overall, allogeneic is so much more powerful because it's off-the-shelf,"" Kulkarni said. ""A patient can be treated the very next day. They (allogeneic CAR-Ts) have a good chance of working better than autologous CAR-Ts and they can be accessible broadly to patients.""But this theory is still a little short in the tooth. In December, Cellectis with partners Servier and Pfizer (PFE), a Dow Jones industrial average component, unveiled the results of its first clinical trial that used donor cells to create a CAR-T treatment for a form of leukemia.Brad Loncar, who runs the biotech fund known as Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR), called the results mixed. In patients with a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the drug known as UCART19 resulted in an 83% complete remission rate across adult and pediatric patients.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

""If they have equal (effectiveness), that's a gigantic thing to say and it's far from proven. And there's reason to believe that it will never be so.""Allogeneic CAR-T could be the ""holy grail"" of oncology therapies, said Nadeem Sheikh, vice president of research and development for privately held Dendreon Pharmaceuticals. Dendreon makes an immunotherapy treatment called Provenge for advanced prostate cancer.""The entire cancer field would love something like an allogeneic approach,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""The allogeneic approach is: I could take your cells and give them to me. That's the holy grail. But we know there's a lot of problems with that approach.""Using a donor's cells could introduce the potential for a condition known as graft-versus-host disease, Sheikh said. With that disease, the donor immune cells don't recognize their surroundings and begin to indiscriminately attack everything that appears foreign.Crispr's Kulkarni thinks he has the answer. The company's gene editing process uses a technique called CRISPR in which a receptor on the donor's T cells is removed, preventing those cells from wildly attacking unintended targets.""Essentially, by using CRISPR we change the genetics of the healthy donor's T cells,"" he said. ""When we do that, they no longer will indiscriminately attack the patient's cells. They only attack the tumor within the patient.""By performing a second edit, the donor T cells are then engineered to appear as if they belong in the body so the patient's own immune cells won't try to destroy the donor cells, Kulkarni said. This allows the donor cells to persist longer in the body.""Think of CRISPR as like a blow torch,"" he said. ""You can actually cut metal and weld metal with it. Here, we can either add genes or remove genes from a cell. Essentially we take a healthy person's T cells and make the CAR-Ts by adding or subtracting genes.""Cellectis is in a class of its own in allogeneic CAR-T, Loncar said. Its Servier/Pfizer-partnered drug, UCART19, already has preliminary Phase 1 data. Its own drug, UCART123, is in testing in acute myeloid leukemia and a form of leukemia known as blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm.In February, Cellectis was granted a pair of U.S. patents to use CRISPR gene editing for the genetic engineering of T cells. Cellectis said it plans to make these patents available for licensing to other companies willing to use CRISPR technology in T cells.The theory is catching on quickly, even among the biggest first-generation CAR-T players. Gilead announced its acquisition of Kite in late August. The merger closed on Oct. 3 just before the FDA approved Kite's drug Yescarta on Oct. 18. Now Gilead is eyeing the allogeneic approach.Last month, Gilead partnered with Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) for $150 million up front to develop cellular therapies using a technique of gene editing called zinc finger nucleases. This process of gene editing is more complex and costly than the CRISPR technology used by Crispr, Editas Medicine (EDIT) and Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA).Under terms of its deal with Gilead, Sangamo is eligible for up to $3.01 billion in potential payments across 10 or more products. The two will work on autologous and allogeneic approaches to cellular therapy.Crispr, the biotech, also is working on an allogeneic CAR-T therapy called CTX101. Like Yescarta from Gilead and Kymriah from Novartis, it targets the CD19 protein, meaning it could potentially be used to treat similar blood cancers. So far, the firm has had three meetings with the FDA to discuss filing an investigational new drug application, Kulkarni said.Such an application would allow Crispr to begin a clinical trial. Kulkarni expects to file an application by the end of the year to begin clinical testing in 2019. He's bullish on Crispr's prospects, but notes it will ""take a lot of up-front time and energy.""""I think we're still in early days,"" he said. ""We have to see how the data bear out and autologous CAR-T has a head start with a number of trials. But if allogeneic starts working in one tumor type, it's a very scalable program.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

32,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) shares popped midday Wednesday after the Food and Drug Administration approved its new HIV drug — a regimen that could rival treatments from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).X The treatment, known as Biktarvy, contains drugs called bictegravir, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide. It was approved as a once-daily single-tablet to treat the HIV-1 infection, Gilead said in a news release.Biktarvy's label warns it could exacerbate hepatitis B symptoms in some patients and requires liver function monitoring in those patients.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Gilead jumped 3% to finish at 82.76, as biotech stocks collectively lifted a fraction of a percentage point. Glaxo rose a fraction to 36.03.At one time, Gilead called bictegravir its ""Mount Everest."" That came as its hepatitis C drug franchise began dwindling amid high cure rates in the U.S. and Europe. Biktarvy will be added to Gilead's HIV/hepatitis B drug unit, which grew 8.8% to $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech franchises like Gilead's hepatitis C unit have been under pressure in recent quarters as smaller and newer drugs start to take share. Visit IBD Industry Themes to see why some analysts say no large franchise will be safe this year.Earlier Wednesday, Glaxo said it's focusing on new therapies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV and shingles as it faces mounting competition against its asthma blockbuster, Advair.Dow's Merck (MRK), too, is working on a treatment for HIV-1. In January, the FDA accepted two new applications from Merck for its regimen containing a drug called doravirine in HIV-1.

33,GILD,"Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) rocketed to an 18-year high Thursday after landing a deal with Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Kite division to collaborate on cancer treatments.X Kite will use Sangamo's platform to modify genes for use in cellular therapy. Sangamo uses a version of gene editing called zinc finger nuclease. Kite makes CAR-T therapies which teach the immune system to fight cancer.The technology will be used to develop autologous and allogeneic CAR-T therapies. Autologous uses immune cells extracted from the sick patient. Allogeneic uses healthy donor cells or renewable stem cells, which could cut down on costs and time for treatment.Gilead Chief Executive John Milligan praised the collaboration in a written statement.""The emergence of gene editing as a tool to edit immune cells holds promise in the development of therapies with potentially improved safety, (effectiveness) and efficiency,"" he said. ""We believe Sangamo's zinc finger nuclease provides the optimal gene editing platform.""Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportUnder terms of the deal, Sangamo will receive an upfront payment of $150 million and is eligible for up to $3.01 billion in potential payments across 10 or more products. Sangamo would also receive tiered royalty payments on sales of potential future products.Kite will be responsible for all development, manufacturing and commercialization of products resulting from the collaboration. Kite will also pay all agreed upon expenses incurred by Sangamo.On the stock market today, Sangamo jumped 14.4% to 25.40, touching levels last seen in November 2000. Gilead lost 1.6% to 79.40.Zinc finger nuclease is far from the only gene-editing platform in testing. Bluebird Bio (BLUE) is working on treatments using a system called TALENs. Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP), Editas Medicine (EDIT) and Intellia (NTLA) use a version of gene editing called CRISPR.Allogeneic CAR-T is in early days but could rival already approved autologous treatments from Gilead and Novartis (NVS). By using donor cells, these companies are aiming to create a less expensive, ""off-the-shelf"" version of CAR-T, Crispr Chief Executive Sam Kulkarni told Investor's Business Daily.""From one manufacturing run, you can create hundreds of doses,"" he said.

"
34,GILD,"This year is shaping up to be boisterous for biotech acquisitions after Celgene (CELG) and Sanofi (SNY), in a matter of days, announced plans to spend north of $25 billion to take over three companies, analysts say.X Celgene and Sanofi, in particular, are facing challenges in areas where insurance companies are pushing back on payments in rheumatology and diabetes. That also leaves the likes of Novo Novartis (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) in trouble, said Brad Loncar, who manages an immunotherapy-based fund.""These companies have to buy growth,"" Loncar told Investor's Business Daily. ""They've been growing their revenue doing artificial things whether that's drug price increases, tax inversions or some kind of other type of financial engineering. Those things are going away.""In all of 2017, there was $50 billion spent in biotech deals, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD. This year, so far Celgene has said it would spend $9 billion to buy the remainder of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it doesn't already own. Sanofi is spending $11.6 billion and $4.8 billion to acquire Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ablynx (ABLX).""For companies who haven't bought anything, it's just a matter of opportunity,"" Syed said.The buying spree kicked off in August when Gilead Sciences (GILD) announced its plan to acquire cancer play Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion. Gilead has been suffering from a major slowdown in hepatitis C drug sales amid high cure rates and saturation in the U.S. and Europe.Celgene and Sanofi announced their plans to acquire Juno and Bioverativ on the same day in January. Days later, Sanofi said it would buy rare disease drugmaker Ablynx.For Celgene, the acquisition followed a disappointing third quarter in which sales of psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis drug Otezla widely missed expectations. The biotech also cut its 2020 guidance on Otezla's shortfall and after terminating several trials in Crohn's disease.Loncar described Celgene's long-term growth prospects at the time as a ""bleak picture."" It's also facing a patent cliff in the mid-2020s for its cancer drug Revlimid.IBD'S TAKE: It's challenging holding on to a stock amid a market correction as it declines. But that could help shares form a new potential base. Is it still possible to capture a big gain? Head to the Investor's Corner for four tips on how to make gains during a correction.""So they really couldn't afford to wait,"" he said.Sanofi, on the other hand, was skunked twice in 2016 and 2017 as it tried to acquire Medivation and Actelion Pharma. Dow component Pfizer (PFE) beat out Sanofi for Medivation and Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) was able to acquire Actelion out from under Sanofi.Roy Behren, a fund manager for Westchester Capital Management, says Sanofi committed a faux pas in both acquisitions — it made a hostile bid for Medivation and went back on an initially higher bid for Actelion, filings show.""Hostile approaches are generally unsuccessful in this space because of the fact the scientists are such an important part of the value equation,"" he told IBD. ""In the case of Sanofi and Medivation, they couldn't arrive at a price unless it was friendly. It was very difficult to complete the acquisition.""Among the high profile acquisitions in late 2017 and early 2018, the acquirers have suffered from pressure on sales of key moneymakers. That, along with tax reform allowing companies to pay less in corporate taxes and repatriate cash at a lower rate, could prime the pump for acquisitions.""I'm a strong believer this is going to be a huge year for acquisitions,"" Loncar said. ""No. 1, for larger companies, their growth is slowing, and No. 2, this tax reform deal adds fuel to that fire. It makes it easier for them to do these deals.""Novo Nordisk lost out on Ablynx to Sanofi. Now, Loncar expects Novo Nordisk to go after other assets to contend with its deep exposure to the diabetes market. Lilly, too, is seeing challenges in diabetes. Meanwhile, Amgen's (AMGN) older drugs are facing new competition.""All big companies really need to do this,"" he said.But there are outliers, Mizuho analyst Syed said. Biogen (BIIB), for instance, guided to flat 2018 sales for its multiple sclerosis unit, including the impact of a royalty it will get on revenue from Roche's (RHHBY) new drug Ocrevus.""There's this perception that the franchises are dwindling,"" he said. ""That's the argument that investors make for a lot of these guys like Biogen, like Amgen — that their base business is going away. That's not necessarily the case. Biogen is stable for 2018.""Still, flat sales won't be enough to pique investor interest. Biogen's aducanumab, a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease, is a ""carrot"" for investors until clinical trial data is available toward the end of 2019 or early 2020.""But as long as that carrot is out there, it becomes really difficult for the hedge fund community to short the stock,"" he said. ""Aducanumab can produce returns — if it works — that large-cap biotechs typically don't see.""Westchester's Behren notes biotechs seem to be fairly interested in immunotherapies and oncology. That includes Gilead's acquisition of Kite and Celgene's plan to acquire Juno. Both are working on drugs known as CAR-T therapies, which teach the immune system to identify and fight cancer.""There has been a lot of activity in the oncology space in terms of immunotherapies,"" he said. ""The larger companies are trying to gobble up any promising technology they can while it's still affordable. We are also seeing quite a few testing companies being acquired.""Celgene's acquisition of Juno followed a common storyline, Behren said. Celgene invested in Juno in 2015 to create immunotherapies in cancer and autoimmune diseases. The duo is furthest along with JCAR017, a potential treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.When Celgene pulled the trigger on Juno on Jan. 22, it made sense that it was at a 28% premium to Juno's closing price on the prior trading day.""Biotechs — even more than high tech — tend to come at significant premiums to trading prices,"" he said. ""That's because they're somewhat risky, but could be a huge payoff in the event they're successful.""Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) could be amid a similar plot. In September 2016, the duo paired up to test Nektar's drug called NKTR-214 with Bristol's Opdivo in patients with melanoma, kidney cancer and lung cancer. In November, Nektar presented strong early data from the combos.Loncar pegged Nektar as a potential takeover target in 2018, calling NKTR-214 ""revolutionary."" Days later, Bristol announced it would pay Nektar $1.85 billion upfront — comprised of $1 billion in cash and the purchase of 2.28 million shares — to test NKTR-214 with Opdivo and Opdivo plus Yervoy.The deal allows Bristol to remain the leader in immuno-oncology/immuno-oncology combinations without risking a $16 billion bid on Nektar, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a Feb. 14 note to clients.""I have no doubt (Nektar's) phone has been ringing off the hook since (November) because their data was so interesting,"" Loncar said. ""If someone is bold enough to buy them, it could put the acquirer into a class of their own in immuno-oncology.""Drugs called PARP inhibitors also look interesting, Loncar said. Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Tesaro (TSRO) both have drugs approved in this class and are small enough to acquire. AstraZeneca (AZN) also works in that space.Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT), Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) and BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) have also had successful launches recently.""If a company wants revenue growth, buy a rare-disease drug,"" he said. ""They have the best sales ramps. I think those types of companies are really interesting right now. I wouldn't be surprised if some of them get bought out.""RELATED:Biotech Investors Flee In Droves As Market Correction Rocks The GroupThese Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: AnalystWhy These 3 Biotech Stocks Could Outperform Their Peers In 2018

35,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) broke out Monday on competitor AbbVie's (ABBV) strong fourth-quarter hepatitis C drug sales — reinforcing recent commentary from Gilead that the market is stabilizing.X By the closing bell on the stock market today, Gilead popped 3.9% to close at 88.80, breaking out of a cup base at an 86.36 buy point. Shares jumped 5.3% on Friday after AbbVie's fourth-quarter earnings report, but closed at 85.46.For the quarter, AbbVie reported $510 million in sales of hepatitis C drugs, which includes its Viekira products and Mavyret/Maviret. Analysts have suggested the latter could take share from Gilead as it treats all genotypes of hepatitis C patients.AbbVie said the lion's share of its success in hepatitis C stemmed from Maviret sales outside the U.S. The drug sells as Mavyret in the U.S. and Maviret outside the U.S. International hepatitis C drug sales were $296 million in the period, in line with expectations.But U.S. sales of $214 million missed RBC analyst Brian Abrahams' estimate for $263 million. AbbVie estimates its $510 million in fourth-quarter hepatitis C drug sales represents about 32% of the market, Abrahams said in a note to clients.""We believe this is a positive for Gilead going into earnings, as it reinforces their prior commentary of market stabilization and downplays the potential impact of U.S. competition,"" he said in a note Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead is set to report earnings after the close on Feb. 6. Analysts list it as likely to top expectations. But uncertainties in payer dynamics, competition and U.S. drug access could hinder some companies' guidance. Head to IBD Industry Themes for other predictions ahead of the earnings season.Abrahams expects patient flows and pricing in hepatitis C drugs to be more predictable going forward after AbbVie's disruptive launch of Mavyret/Maviret. AbbVie echoed Gilead's commentary regarding stabilization on its earnings conference call, he said.Abrahams models Gilead pulling in $1.6 billion in fourth-quarter hepatitis C drug sales. He expects Gilead to guide to $5.2 billion in 2018 revenue. Buy-side expectations are likely closer to $4 billion for 2018, he noted.RELATED:Will 2018 Biopharma Merger Activity Become An AbbVie Story?Celgene Reverses In Fourth Quarter As Otezla Sales ReboundBiogen Revenue Tops As Spinraza, MS Drugs Deliver Upside

36,GILD,"Celgene (CELG) reversed its third-quarter ""fallout"" Thursday, reporting key inflammation drug Otezla tacked on nearly 22% growth in the fourth quarter, topping the consensus by 10%.X The report contained ""no surprises this time,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. It follows the third quarter in which Celgene stock tanked after Otezla sales broadly missed expectations.For the fourth quarter, though, psoriatic arthritis drug Otezla brought in $371 million in sales, growing 21.6% vs. the year-earlier period. U.S. sales of $303 million grew 13.1% and $68 million in international sales advanced 83.8%. Porges credited the Otezla rebound — up 20.5% quarter over quarter — to volume gains in the U.S.He said the gains ""should be viewed positively after a very disappointing third-quarter result that made many investors question the long-term potential of this product.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, Celgene stock gained 1.2% to close at 104.39.Total sales came in at $3.48 billion, growing 16.9% and topping the consensus for $3.46 billion. Adjusted profit increased 24.2% to $2 a share and beat expectations for adjusted income of $1.93 per share.In cancer, Revlimid sales of $2.19 billion beat the consensus by 1%, Porges said. U.S. sales beat by 5%, but outside the U.S. Revlimid sales lagged by 7%. Pomalyst sales were in line at $442 million. Abraxane, though, brought in $251 million and missed by 5%.Celgene guided to $14.4 billion to $14.8 billion in total sales for 2018, lagging the Street view for $14.98 billion. The biotech sees Revlimid, Pomalyst and Otezla growing 15%, 18% and 17%, respectively, vs. the prior year.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen and Celgene kicked off the biotech earnings season on Thursday, but others are expected to provide even more upside. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at which biotechs are expected to outperform third-quarter expectations.Adjusted earnings are expected to rise 18% at the midpoint to $8.70-$8.90 per share. The consensus had modeled $8.78. The guidance doesn't include Celgene's planned merger with Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), which is expected to have a 50-cent dilutive impact on earnings.The lead drug from Juno, JCAR017, is expected to be the third in a class known as CAR-T therapies, to hit the market. Novartis (NVS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) were first. Still, Celgene's plan to acquire long-term partner Juno has been lauded on Wall Street.""In our view, the deal Celgene announced on Monday to acquire Juno was relatively straightforward and made a lot of sense since Celgene already had made significant investment into the CAR-T space,"" Porges said.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a report acquiring Juno will help Celgene diversify from its biggest moneymaker Revlimid. Revlimid is expected to begin losing exclusivity in 2022 as key patents expire.He expects ""sentiment in Celgene to shift back positively as fourth-quarter (earnings) and 2018 guidance reaffirms potential for strong near-term growth/execution,"" he said.

37,GILD,"AbbVie (ABBV) could follow in the footsteps of Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG), an analyst suggested Monday after AbbVie guided to an unexpectedly low 9% tax rate in 2018.X ""We expect the narrative for this stock in the coming months to develop into a 'who will it buy?' story, similar to Gilead in 2016 and Celgene more recently,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients.The acquisition narrative follows AbbVie's fourth-quarter earnings. On Friday, the biopharma giant topped quarterly expectations and beat 2018 guidance predictions. It also guided to a 9% tax rate in 2018 and a tax rate around 13% in the near-term.It also follows announcements last week that Celgene would acquire Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Sanofi (SNY) would acquire Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV). Today, Sanofi also said it will buy Ablynx (ABLX).If AbbVie does seek an acquisition, it will likely be in neuroscience, early-stage immuno-oncology or solid tumor medicine, Porges said. AbbVie could seek deals to build onto or complement its early-stage Alzheimer's disease pipeline ahead of a key readout in 2019.So far, though, AbbVie is playing its cards close to its vest. The firm doesn't seem inclined to make ""large or disruptive"" transactions, Porges said. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan noted the firm is constantly looking at assets but believes it already has a strong pipeline.Further, ""they do not have a burning platform where they need to acquire an asset,"" he said. ""If there isn't a compelling need and the company is dealing with many other things, it probably is not the best time to do mergers and acquisitions.""IBD'S TAKE: Celgene and AbbVie have already reported their fourth-quarter earnings, but a slew of biopharmas are still slated to issue their reports. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at what analysts expect from the biotech and drugs groups.That puts AbbVie in a slightly different boat from Gilead and Celgene. Gilead acquired Kite Pharma in 2017 amid slowing hepatitis C drug sales. Last week, Celgene said it would buy Juno four years before it begins losing exclusivity on cancer drug Revlimid.Divan's comments follow a conversation with AbbVie's management post fourth-quarter earnings. Analysts suggested the lower-than-expected 9% tax rate means AbbVie will have extra cash on hand with which it could engage in mergers and acquisitions. AbbVie says it's looking at earlier-stage and single assets to build out its pipeline.""If they find anything in the 2019 or 2020 timeframe, even before the (neuroscience) readouts, they would not necessarily feel the need to wait,"" Divan said in a note to clients.Divan boosted his price target on AbbVie to 135 from 98 and kept his neutral rating. Porges also upped his price target to 127 from 105, though he downgraded AbbVie to a market perform rating from outperform.""At current valuations, we prefer Celgene to AbbVie among the larger cap names in our coverage,"" he said. ""Growth names such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) continue to offer more upside, in our view, than AbbVie.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, AbbVie dipped a fraction to 122.31.RELATED:Celgene Reverses In Fourth Quarter As Otezla Sales ReboundCould Sanofi's Ablynx Deal Spur A Biopharma Buying Spree?Will Biotech's Merger 'Spigot' Turn On After Juno, Bioverativ?

Many leveraged funds have generated even higher returns for those who don't mind taking on extra potential risk.Leveraged funds designed to outperform on the way up often aim for double or triple a particular benchmark index's performance. Likewise, those designed to act inverse to the index can snare big gains when the index sinks, but drop if the index rallies. These high-octane plays aren't for the fainthearted.Three emerging markets plays topped the list of leveraged ETFs with biggest year-to-date gains through Jan. 24, according to Morningstar Direct. Direxion Daily FTSE China Bull 3X (YINN) has surged 53.1%, far out in front of the S&P 500's 6.2% advance. It had a big 2017 too, racking up a 129.8% gain. YINN's average annual return for the past three years is 8.6%, trailing the S&P 500's 13.8% for the same period.Direxion Daily MSCI Brazil Bull 3X (BRZU) came in second with a 47.3% YTD gain. A 30.8% gain last year outpaced the S&P 500, but its three-year performance is -12%. Direxion Daily Russia Bull 3X (RUSL), in third, is up 38.9% this year. It ended 2017 with a 1% gain; its three-year average annual return is 20.3%.Given such relatively inconsistent long-term performance, most traders generally view leveraged funds as a short-term investment. Another point to keep in mind: Leverage plays tend to have higher costs. YINN, BRZU and RUSL carry expense ratios of 1.3%, 1.1% and 1.1%, respectively, compared with iShares MSCI Brazil's (EWZ) 0.6%.All of the ETFs in the accompanying table are currently extended from buy points. But if you find such leveraged plays appealing, watch for a new consolidation or a pullback to the 50-day moving average.Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X (SOXL) is extended from a 167.60 entry of a cup with handle. But declines Wednesday and Thursday have brought it closer to buy range. The $678.1 million fund was featured in this ETF column on Jan. 18, a day after its breakout. It rose as much as 12% from the breakout to its Jan. 23 peak. SOXL surged 50%-plus from a prior breakout in September to a Nov. 22 intraday high.The ETF, which aims to deliver 300% of the daily performance of the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index, will mark its eighth anniversary in March.

Analysts had seen earnings of 36 cents a share on sales of $10.42 billion, respectively, according to Reuters.During 2017, adjusted profit grew 4% on a constant-currency basis. This year, a generic copy of asthma inhaler Advair could chip away at earnings. Mylan (MYL) is expected to launch a generic in 2018. Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) launched its authorized generic in early 2017.If a generic emerges midyear, Glaxo expects adjusted earnings to be flat to down 3% on a constant-currency basis. Without a generic emerging, adjusted profit could grow 4%-7% regardless exchange rates.""Looking ahead, in 2018 we could see a potential generic version of Advair in the U.S. and our 2018 guidance reflects this,"" Chief Executive Emma Walmsley said in a written statement.IBD'S TAKE: The bull market is a great time to review your stock-selling smarts. First up: Establish sell rules for your strongest stocks that way if the bottom falls out, you're prepared. For more, head to the Investor's Corner.Glaxo ticked up 4 cents to close at 36.03 on the stock market today.Glaxo's HIV unit is also facing mounting competition from Gilead Sciences (GILD), which said Tuesday its combined HIV and hepatitis B drug sales grew 8.8% to $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Gilead is also working on a new regimen using a drug called bictegravir.Still, Walmsley says Glaxo could deliver mid- to high-single-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share from 2016-2020 on a 2015 constant-currency basis. She's focusing on new launches including an inhaler called Trelegy Ellipta, HIV drug Juluca and shingles medication Shingrix.RELATED:Allergan Pops On Consensus-Topping Quarter, Strong Migraine TrialGilead Beats Quarterly Views, But Topples On Soft 2018 GuidanceThese Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: Analyst

40,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) plunged late Tuesday after reporting fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that topped Wall Street expectations, but that declined for the seventh consecutive period amid challenged hepatitis C drug sales.X In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Gilead sank as much as 3%, though it was down 1.6% in more recent action. During the regular session, Gilead popped 2.6%, to 80.38. Biotech stocks rallied to pare earlier losses and close up 1.9%.For the fourth quarter, Gilead reported adjusted profit of $1.78 per share on $5.95 billion in sales, declining 34.1% and 18.7%, respectively. Both metrics topped the consensus for adjusted income of $1.70 a share on $5.78 billion in sales.Total product sales fell 19.1% to $5.84 billion. Gilead felt the most pain outside the U.S. and Europe where product revenues declined 36.4%. In Europe, sales of products declined 21.4%, leading a 16.3% dip in U.S. product sales.Sales of HIV and hepatitis B drugs increased 8.8% year over year to $3.7 billion.IBD'S TAKE: The bull market is now a nine-year affair, though pundits have been calling for its downfall since the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Is it time to review your stock-selling rules? Head to the Investor's Corner.But hepatitis C drug sales toppled 53.1% with declines across all major markets, Gilead said. Blockbusters Harvoni and Sovaldi have both been in decline since the third quarter of 2016 amid high cure rates and market maturation.Epclusa was approved in June 2016 and had grown year-over-year for two quarters, but fell for the first time in the fourth period of 2017.Harvoni, the biggest of the three, saw its sales decline 60.7% to $644 million. Epclusa, now the second most important of the trio, fell 46.1% to $565 million. Sovaldi brought in $117 million in revenue, down 78.4%.For 2018, Gilead guided to $20 billion to $21 billion in product sales. The consensus had forecast $21.58 billion in revenue. RBC analyst Brian Abrahams noted competitive dynamics are expected to shrink the hepatitis C market to $3.5 billion to $4 billion.The product sales guidance was lower than expected while the operational expenses outlook came in higher, Abrahams said in a note to clients. Still, he remained bullish on Gilead's other programs.""Overall with the Street beginning to look beyond hepatitis C and expectations coming down, we believe the stage remains set for a near-term earnings nadir and visibility towards growth driven by HIV, CAR-T and pipeline,"" he said.In October, Gilead closed its $11.9 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma. Investors had long pushed for Gilead to make an acquisition amid dwindling hepatitis C drug sales. Days later, Gilead/Kite got approval for a CAR-T drug called Yescarta to treat a blood cancer. CAR-T drugs are a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells are changed in the laboratory to attack cancer.During the fourth quarter, Yescarta brought in $7 million in sales, beating the consensus by $1 million, Abrahams said.The CAR-T landscape now includes two other major players including Celgene (CELG) after its plan to acquire Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Novartis (NVS), the latter of which was the first to gain approval of a CAR-T drug, Kymriah.RELATED:These Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: AnalystAllergan Pops On Consensus-Topping Quarter, Strong Migraine TrialThese Biotech Stocks Each Dives More Than 20% — Is The Sell-Off Overdone?

41,GILD,"Biotech investors collectively pulled $1.2 billion out of the sector this week — but analysts said Friday that's the byproduct of a broader market correction, not malaise in health care-tied stocks.X For the week ended Feb. 7, health care and biotech funds saw $1.21 billion in net outflows, representing a 1.95% decrease in assets, Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond wrote in a note to clients. At the same time, all equities posted a 0.33% dip in assets.The reason: Biotech stocks tend to experience the worst of a market correction, said Brad Loncar, a portfolio manager who runs a cancer immunotherapy-based fund. Biotech stocks hit a multiyear high in late January but have since lost nearly 13%.""I believe this is totally normal and I think that biotech is just doing so terrible this week because it's a volatile sector and when the entire stock market has a bad week like this, biotechs are likely to do a little bit worse,"" he told Investor's Business Daily.Most pundits say the market correction is overdue. In general, the market experienced a very mild 2017 with gradual rising and few interruptions. Now, it's heading into a ""risk-off"" scenario as investors seek lower-risk positions, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat told IBD in an email.By the close on the stock market today, the biotech group eked out a small gain, paring earlier losses when it fell as much as 4.6%. For the week, the group was down nearly 5.5%.Among those hardest hit this week was Corcept Therapeutics (CORT), which lopped off 38% on a coming rivalry from Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) for a treatment for Cushing's syndrome, which affects the pituitary gland. Prothena (PRTA) dove 28% after its chief medical officer announced her departure.Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG) and Biogen (BIIB) all lost north of 8%. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) topped fourth-quarter views, but plunged nearly 5%. Gilead Sciences (GILD) toppled more than 4% as guidance missed.But among large-caps, fourth-quarter metrics and 2018 guidance was largely in line with expectations, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young told IBD. She described the fourth quarter as a ""decent showing"" with ""no fires,"" unlike the strained third quarter.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average toppled 4.1% lower on Thursday while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 tumbled 3.9% and 3.8%, respectively. Are bears taking a bite out of the bull market? Head to The Big Picture for more.""Hopefully that trend continues,"" she said. ""But this is biotech, it's a risky space and things happen.""Young and Loncar agree that the market correction isn't indicative of the outlook for the biotech group. Both say the fundamentals look strong and the group is poised for buying spree, which began late last year with Gilead's acquisition of Kite Pharma.In January, Celgene said it would buy Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Sanofi (SNY) announced acquisitions of Biogen spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) and Belgium's Ablynx (ABLX). Sanofi beat out Novo Nordisk (NVO) for Ablynx.Smart companies will go after assets when valuations go down, Loncar said. Many of the bigger players are facing payer scrutiny in saturated areas like rheumatology and diabetes. For Gilead, declining hepatitis C drug sales led to its Kite purchase. Celgene is facing competition in inflammation drugs.""No. 1, the larger companies have slowing growth so they need to buy growth and they need to buy innovation,"" he said. ""And No. 2, this tax reform deal that just passed kind of adds fuel to the fire and makes it much more easy for them to do these deals.""RELATED:Gilead Pops After FDA Approves Glaxo-Rivaling HIV DrugThese Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: AnalystAlexion Tops Quarterly Views But Guidance Lags; Alnylam Dips On Losses

42,GILD,"Some top international stock funds seek out companies that fit a specific growth trajectory. Others among the best foreign funds for 2018 want to find industry leaders that allocate capital smartly to provide both sustainable growth in earnings and a hefty return to shareholders. And still others take a blanket approach toward a single country, such as Japan.The very best foreign funds recognized in the IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards drummed up unique strategies to stay atop the heap in 2017. They also pose this critical question to the individual investor:""What type of investing style suits me best when trying to build solid long-term gains?""Answering the question may help an investor sit tight when markets get volatile, especially ones overseas. While the names of the best foreign funds may change, the importance of patience and the ability to sell shares near market tops, not at market bottoms, does not change.The MSCI EAFE index rose 25% in 2017. Scores of country-specific or region-focused mutual funds in IBD's annual survey soundly beat this benchmark.But Oppenheimer Global Opportunities (OPGIX), Matthews Asia Dividend Investor (MAPIX), DFA Japanese Small Company (DFJSX) and Wasatch World Innovations Investor (WAGTX) receive a standing ovation for delivering outstanding long-term compounded returns.The MSCI EAFE's average annual return from Jan. 1, 2008, to Dec. 31, 2017, was understandably poor at 1.94%. The Wall Street subprime loan crisis and bankruptcy of Lehman Bros., real estate crashes in Ireland and Spain, the solvency scare of Greece, and three separate bear market declines in mainland China equities — repeat, three — all clawed at equity prices around the globe.Yet $8.4 billion Oppenheimer Global scored an 11.64% annualized gain over that 10-year period through Dec. 31. Matthews Asia achieved a 9.03% gain, DFA Japanese Small Company 8.56%, and Wasatch World Innovations 8.5%.Hennessy Japan Small Cap Investor (HJPSX) took the top rung with a 12.01% average annual return. (See Lawrence Carrell's story for more on the fund.) Morgan Stanley Institutional Global Franchise (MSFAX), Oppenheimer International Small-Mid Company (OSMAX) and Franklin International Small Cap Growth (FKSCX) also hit annualized gains of 8% or more.Oppenheimer Global Opportunities parked more than 40% of its money in U.S. companies, as of Jan. 31. But look at the next seven countries and that group, including the U.K., Germany, Japan, France, Denmark, Italy and Sweden, makes up a slightly greater share of the entire fund's assets at 42.3%.""I'm trying to buy companies that are young in their life cycle, not old value traps,"" portfolio manager Frank Jennings said in an Oppenheimer-produced video. ""Very often there're three or four people running this little business. Altogether they don't know what they're doing, there's certainly no sophisticated management systems. They succeed, it achieves some scale, but it still has that entrepreneurial juice, and that's the powerful phase I am trying to capture before it becomes a saturated bureaucracy.""The average market cap of the holdings stands just below $14 billion, or in midcap range based on IBD's perspective. (IBD Big Cap 20 requires a company's market value to top $15 billion.) The fund's median market cap is even less at $7.8 billion. Global Opportunities tends to own companies with price-to-earnings ratios that exceed the S&P 500.Oppenheimer takes big bets on individual companies. San Francisco-based Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) is the biggest holding, at 11.7% of the entire fund. Even after breaking out of a seven-month base at 25.88 in big volume on Nov. 6 and quadrupling in price, the market value of the developer of treatments that are commercialized by its Big Pharma and biotech partners is $17 billion, a far cry from the megacaps such as Amgen (AMGN) ($136 billion market cap) or Gilead Sciences (GILD) ($106 billion).Other large holdings that perhaps carry this ""lean yet mean"" corporate flavor include industrial laser maker Coherent (COHR), social media giant Twitter (TWTR), household carbonated beverage systems pioneer SodaStream (SODA) and 3-D computer-aided design software firm PTC (PTC).Matthews Asia Dividend benefited from what it called a ""Goldilocks scenario"" in Asian equities thanks to improving inflationary conditions and ""moderate monetary policy from Asia's central banks,"" the fund's managers wrote in a semiannual commentary to shareholders. ""Concerns over potential systemic risks also subsided, most evident in the stabilizing Chinese economy. Reflecting the improving macroeconomic environment, Asian currencies mostly strengthened against the U.S. dollar in another tailwind for Asian equities.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Financials rank 3rd at 18.3%, information technology 4th at 9.5%.As of Feb. 28, Matthews Asia Dividend showed five of the top 10 holdings hailing from either mainland China or Hong Kong, including Minth Group, China Construction Bank and Ping An Insurance. South Korea's Hyundai Motors and semiconductor expert Rohm of Japan also make the top 10.DFA Japanese Small Company Portfolio holds companies that barely make the radar screens of most foreign stock funds.

43,GILD,"Analysts and investors were more bullish Tuesday on Celgene (CELG) following its announcement Monday that it would acquire Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) — a diversification move four years before key patents begin to expire on Celgene's key multiple myeloma drug, Revlimid.X It will take some time before investors fully get behind Celgene's $3 billion revenue forecast for Juno's lead asset, JCAR017, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said. Celgene expects to get approval in 2019 in the U.S. for JCAR017 to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.Porges called the revenue guide the ""most controversial part of Celgene's announcement."" JCAR017 is what's known as a CAR-T therapy. In this treatment, patients' own immune cells are extracted and reprogrammed to fight cancer before being reintroduced to the patient.But Celgene will be third to the market in CAR-T behind Novartis (NVS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), which acquired Kite Pharma in October for its CAR-T platform. JCAR017 would treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Gilead's drug is already approved for that use and Novartis has filed for approval.Celgene's guidance was ""significantly above consensus and our Leerink forecast,"" Porges said in a note to clients. ""Specifically, Celgene believes that the unique characteristics of JCAR017 will allow it to be deployed in many more centers than the existing CAR-T approaches.""Celgene shares bounded up 1.6% to close at 104.55 on the stock market today. On Monday, following the announcement of its $9 billion acquisition plan, Celgene dipped as much as 2.6% before reversing to close up a fraction.JCAR017 is less toxic and more tolerable than rival drugs. Studies show a 1% rate of moderate to serious cytokine-release syndrome in JCAR017 patients vs. 13% for Gilead's Yescarta and 23% for Novartis' Kymriah, Canaccord analyst John Newman wrote in a note to clients.Porges sees a 65% chance of success for JCAR017 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a 35% chance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and no chance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He forecasts JCAR017 bringing in no more than $1.2 billion by 2023 and $1.56 billion by 2025.IBD'S TAKE: The fourth-quarter earnings season is underway with Celgene and Biogen on deck to report earnings early Thursday. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at analysts' expectations for the season and which stocks might surprise to the upside.Celgene also is working on another CAR-T treatment. In this case, JCAR017, Yescarta and Kymriah interact with a protein known as cluster of differentiation, or CD19. But another drug target, known as B-cell maturation antigen or BCMA, is showing promise.In the latter version of CAR-T, Celgene is working with Juno on JCARH125 and partner Bluebird Bio (BLUE) on a drug known as bb2121. Porges gives Celgene a 65% chance of success for bb2121 as a third treatment in multiple myeloma. Celgene owns half the rights to that drug.Porges expects bb2121 to reach the market in 2020 and forecasts $335 million that year growing to $1.34 billion in 2023 and $1.77 billion in 2025. By 2025, he expects five participants to be on the market using CAR-T drugs to treat multiple myeloma, but sees Celgene/Bluebird as having the biggest piece.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams says the Juno deal makes good strategic sense. After the American Society of Hematology meeting, it was apparent that CAR-T would emerge as the next wave in treating blood cancer despite initial growing pains related to logistics and reimbursement.Celgene currently leads the space, but Revlimid is set to face generic competition in 2022. Acquiring the 90% of Juno it didn't already own gives Celgene worldwide rights to a platform and the ability to invest deeper as the technology evolves, Abrahams said.He models $3.4 billion in peak annual sales.RELATED:Will Biotech's Merger 'Spigot' Turn On After Juno, Bioverativ?Dow's J&J Topples After Judge Tosses Patent On Blockbuster DrugWhy These 3 Biotech Stocks Could Outperform Their Peers in 2018

44,GILD,"Beleaguered biotech investors likely will have to wait until 2018 to get some relief, though trial data and drug approvals could help stoke the embers of the formerly red-hot group.X That's the take from analysts, who say there may be some relief on the horizon. But don't expect anything earth shattering, they say.""The next quarter and a half is likely to feature significant disclosures for a number of companies in our coverage, but is unlikely to be a period of strongly stock-moving events,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a recent note to clients.Porges' view follows a third quarter in which large caps struggled as their historic moneymakers caught the double whammy of increasing competition and pricing concerns. Meanwhile, smaller caps crushed expectations.As a result, IBD's 462-company Biotech industry group, ranked first just a month ago, is now listed as No. 37 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks. Shares touched a 22-month high in October, but have since lost nearly 6%.""However, the flow of events is set to accelerate in early 2018, and the first quarter offers more opportunities for meaningful value inflection across biopharmaceutical companies and stocks,"" Leerink analysts wrote in a recent note.Despite frustration depressing biotech stocks, the group has posted an impressive number of new approvals this year, JMP Securities analyst Mike King said. According to the Food and Drug Administration, 140 original applications for drugs and biologics have been approved this year.""You need product approvals,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""Even the most jaded observer of the sector would have to say the sector as a whole has produced very satisfactory results when it comes to major trial readouts. I don't see any change in that regard.""Tacking on drug approvals and successful data readouts will be key for companies like Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), a pair of large biotech leaders facing a growing field of competitors for their moneymakers Revlimid and hepatitis C drugs, respectively.Celgene is set to have two readouts in a type of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and could have CAR-T developments from partners Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). CAR-T drugs treat cancer using a patient's own re-engineered immune cells.Both are important for Celgene, which has long enjoyed revenue gains from chemotherapy Revlimid. Analysts had been expecting generic competition from Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) in 2020. Recently, though, Dr. Reddy's missed a key deadline to file its generic.Still, it's less than ideal for Celgene to rely so heavily on one stream of revenue, FBB Partners analyst Mike Bailey said. Celgene had been preparing to replace some of its patent-challenged Revlimid sales with a Crohn's disease drug. But the firm said in October it won't initiate Phase 3 trials of that drug.""The bull case on Celgene previously was that they had these new drugs to limit the risk for Revlimid,"" he told IBD. ""If you take away the risk management piece, all of the focus is on this one drug which is going to go generic at some point.""Similarly, Gilead has an HIV combination using its drug bictegravir set to gain potential approval in February. This could accelerate HIV sales starting in the second quarter, Porges said. At the same time, ARK Invest analyst Manisha Samy says Gilead will likely get further into CAR-T in 2018. Gilead also announced Thursday its $567 million acquisition of Cell Design Labs, a privately held CAR-T player.In October, Gilead acquired Kite Pharma for nearly $12 billion. This followed the FDA's approval of Kite's drug, dubbed Yescarta, to treat large B-cell lymphoma in adults. Due to their individualized nature, CAR-T drugs aren't likely to rake in the same sales as Gilead's now faltering hepatitis C drugs.""But two or three years down the line, that could be a huge revenue maker,"" she told IBD.IBD'S TAKE: Big-caps struggled in the third quarter which isn't surprising considering a patent cliff over the next 10 years is set to hit some $17 billion in annual sales for blockbuster drugs, says one analyst. Head to the Industry Snapshot for more on how biotechs fared in the period.Yescarta won't replace Gilead's hepatitis C franchise at its peak, but it will grow steadily, Bailey said.""My guess is hepatitis C is going to shrink really quickly,"" he said. ""At some point I would expect CAR-T to replace hepatitis C sales, but no way at the peak. That was once-ever in terms of what Gilead did. It will never be that big.""In the next several months, Leerink's Porges looks for AbbVie (ABBV) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) to disclose pivotal trial or regulatory events, while Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) will report more ""value-confirming events.""AbbVie will have data for an anti-inflammatory treatment known as upadacitinib, he said. Those results could add more detail to the evolving landscape of what are known as JAK inhibitors that treat psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, among a number of conditions.Regeneron is on deck to file the results of its drug Dupixent in asthma. The drug is already approved to treat eczema. The firm could also report data for its eye drug, Eylea, and for its immuno-oncology drug, cemiplimab, in a type of skin cancer.Also, look for Vertex to provide Phase 2 data for two of its triple-pill combinations to treat cystic fibrosis. In total, Vertex is testing four potential regimens to bring into Phase 3 trials. The firm is also likely to gain approval for a two-drug combination in February.In the Big Pharma world, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says there are few significant stock-moving catalysts left in 2017, but the first half of 2018 will be busy.Dow's Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) all have immuno-oncology combo results in lung cancer, while Bristol and Merck/Incyte (INCY) are set to deliver results from their regimens in melanoma.Bristol could also offer interim data from a trial of its immuno-oncology drugs Opdivo and Yervoy as a first treatment for lung cancer.Outside those, ""major immuno-oncology catalysts should (thankfully!) be limited,"" he said. There's a high bar on Bristol's interim data, which require nothing short of stopping the study early on extreme effectiveness. That's unlikely, so expectations are probably low, he said.""Nonetheless, an early stop would be a major validation of Bristol's strategy — likely driving the stock up 15% in our view,"" he said. ""Continuation of the study would likely increase concerns over Bristol's strategy and the ultimate success of the study at the final analysis, possibly pushing the stock down 5%-10%.""PARP inhibitors, yet another class of cancer drugs, are set to have trial results as well. AstraZeneca will have results for its drug, Lynparza, as a first maintenance treatment in ovarian cancer.""I think the PARP space will be quite large,"" JMP's King said. ""It's hard to tell in the real world if doctors will see these drugs as better so they can start producing some satisfactory sales figures.""RELATED:Biotechs Sell Off In Droves — Are Investors Seeking Mergers?This Biotech Just Neared A 17-Year High On Strong Cancer RegimenThis Cancer Biotech Is Falling On Its $1.55 Billion Bayer Deal
"
45,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) caught an upgrade Thursday following its Kite Pharma buyout and the likelihood its new CAR-T cancer medications will allow it to diversify away from its maturing hepatitis C franchise.X Maxim Group analyst Jason McCarthy upgraded Gilead to a buy rating from hold. He has a 94 price target on the stock which, by the closing bell on the stock market today, advanced 1.5% to finish at 74.78.CAR-T drugs are made using a patient's own extracted immune system cells. They are reprogrammed to seek and destroy cancer cells before being reintroduced to the patient. Due to their nature, it can take weeks to manufacture these drugs.But a visit to a Kite manufacturing facility in China left McCarthy impressed. The entire process takes 16-18 days for Gilead/Kite's CAR-T drugs. Kite's facility in El Segundo, Calif., can handle 4,000 patient treatments per year.A program called Kite Konnect gives healthcare providers, patients and Gilead access to real-time tracking of the CAR-T process. Production is now semi-automated. Gilead has plans to automate production in the future to increase capacity and decrease costs.""We were impressed and left clear with the notion that Gilead (and Kite) can overcome manufacturing challenges to commercialize in the U.S. and globally, especially China, this new innovative therapy,"" he said in a note to clients.Now's the time to buy Gilead, McCarthy said. Investors get access to the recently-bought CAR-T drugs for free plus Gilead's hepatitis C franchise. Gilead's hepatitis C drugs set records for being among the strongest drug launches in history.IBD'S TAKE: Novartis was first to cross the finish line with its CAR-T therapy, but others are on its tail. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown on the growing CAR-T market and which competitors are set to turn that market on its head.In more recent years, though, the hepatitis C unit has struggled as the market matures amid high cure rates. Now, the market is entering its fourth year and comparisons are getting easier, McCarthy said.""What's important is not to lose sight of the fact that Gilead had $2.7 billion in free cash flow last quarter,"" he said.Buying into CAR-T helps diversify Gilead. Gilead finished acquiring Kite in October, just before the Food and Drug Administration approved Kite's drug known as Yescarta, for some adults with some large B-cell lymphomas. Approvals are also expected in Europe, China and Japan.McCarthy expects Gilead to generate more than $5 billion in the coming years with a global presence in late-stage B-cell cancer. Further, CAR-T therapies are now being integrated with other forms of cancer treatment.""Kite could be the first that keeps on giving,"" he said.But Gilead isn't alone with its CAR-T offering. Novartis (NVS) was first to gain approval with a drug called Kymriah, approved to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in some patients up to age 25.Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) are also partnered with Celgene (CELG) to develop their own CAR-T therapies.RELATED:Why Amgen Could Have An Edge Over These Rivals In Preventing MigrainesHow Celgene, Gilead's Pricing Woes Continue To Haunt Biotech StocksDow Stock Merck Topples After Withdrawing Keytruda Application In Europe

46,GILD,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) Chief Executive Jeffrey Leiden calls 2017 a ""transformational year"" for the biotechnology company, which looks likely to end the year with about $2 billion on its balance sheet and a rapidly approaching approval for a key cystic fibrosis treatment.X The company's stock price reflects its successes in the year. Shares have almost doubled year to date, rising 96% to outperform Investor's Business Daily's 460-company Biotech industry group, which has climbed more than 24% since January.As the year began, Leiden told IBD he laid out a three-part strategy beginning in 2017. Among his goals: Expand the number of eligible patients for Vertex's cystic fibrosis, or CF drugs, expand the pipeline outside of the lung disease sector and strengthen its financial stance.Leiden says some of those goals came to fruition in 2017. He expects to continue on the same trajectory as Vertex sends potential triple-pill regimens to treat cystic fibrosis into pivotal trials next year and dives deeper into treating other diseases with Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) and Moderna Therapeutics.""So, when you really look at where we started the year, approved for a bit less than half of all patients with (cystic fibrosis) and we ended the year with medicines we believe will be able to get us up to 90% of patients,"" he said. ""You know, that's a very significant expansion of the patient population we think we can treat.""Here's what Leiden had to say about Vertex's plans, examining the company's strategy for both inside and outside of cystic fibrosis medications:IBD: What major accomplishments did Vertex have in 2017?Leiden: In expanding medicines for cystic fibrosis, I'd say (we had) four very important accomplishments. One, the (U.S. Food and Drug Administration's) approval for Kalydeco (for patients with) residual function mutations (which had previously been declined by the FDA). So that's 1,500 more patients in the U.S. Very importantly, it was a breakthrough with respect to regulatory science. This was, I think, the first approval ever of a medicine for new patient populations based just on in-vitro data, cellular data. It's really a testament, I think, to us working with the FDA to get them to appreciate and trust the strength of our cell-based assay that can predict (effectiveness).In Europe, we successfully obtained reimbursement for Orkambi, in particular, but also Kalydeco in a number of countries, particularly Ireland and Italy, also the Netherlands. That expanded the number of patients who are now reimbursed for our medicines there.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex was near a crisis point in 2014 when it pulled a blockbuster hepatitis C drug from the market amid mounting competition from Gilead Sciences (GILD). See how the pivot to cystic fibrosis transformed the company by visiting The New America.The third one was obviously the positive Phase 3 data for tezacaftor/ivacaftor (to treat cystic fibrosis) and that data was highly positive in two different trials. We were able to very quickly submit regulatory applications for both to the FDA and the (European Medicines Agency). And we expect approval of that medicine in the first quarter of next year in the U.S. and in the first half of third quarter in Europe. And that's going to pick up a large number of patients who, today, are not taking a CFTR corrector (which targets certain gene mutations), particularly those patients who had difficulty tolerating Orkambi. So we're talking about thousands of additional patients that would be eligible for tezacaftor/ivacaftor next year.The final one and, in a way, the most important one for the long run was, we announced Phase 1 and Phase 2 data for three of our different triple-regimens, so called next-generation regimens. That data told us that we're going to be able to reach up to 90% of all patients with CF with a single triple-combination medicine. And the data was strong enough we're confident we'll be able to start the pivotal trials, the final trials, for those medicines in the first half of next year.Expanding the pipeline beyond CF is something we haven't talked about as much, yet. But you'll be hearing a lot more in 2018. These new programs are in very serious disorders like sickle cell disease and alpha-1 antitrypsin disease (an inherited disorder that may cause lung and liver ailments) and are moving forward really nicely, thankfully faster than we expected. We hope to get at least one and maybe two of those medicines in the clinic next year and we'll start to talk more about them. But they're medicines that are very much like our CF medicines. They treat the underlying cause of the disease, they're transformational and we're really excited we're able to move those forward because we ultimately want to be a serious diseases company, not just a CF company.In terms of the financial strength of the company, we will likely end the year with close to or more than $2 billion on our balance sheet based upon the increased number of patients we can treat with CF. And that's really important to us, not because we want to build a big balance sheet, but because it gives us the financial wherewithal to both invest in our internal research programs to make more new medicines, but also to go out and do some business development deals that will allow us to enhance our pipeline even further.IBD: What can we expect to see in 2018 from Vertex?Leiden: We look at the same goals: Expand access to CF medicines, develop the pipeline beyond CF and produce more financial strength. I think the things you should look for in 2018 from us are, first, the tezacaftor/ivacaftor approval in the U.S. and Europe. That's very, very important because that will allow those patients to get access to the medicine. Second, expanding access even further for Orkambi, particularly in Europe.There's a couple of countries where we're still negotiating: France and the U.K. And we want to try to finish those negotiations for reimbursement in Europe next year. The start of the pivotal trials for either one or two triple regimens in the first half of next year. That's a very important milestone for the company and for patients. And the final one is watching for those first programs to get into the clinic outside of CF. The two that seem to be furthest along now are in sickle cell disease and alpha-1 antitrypsin disease.IBD: Can you make any predictions for the broader biotech group?Leiden: I think it's really the most exciting time in biotech in the 30 to 40 years I've been doing this. For two reasons. One, some of the new therapeutics technologies like gene editing, gene therapy that are really coming to maturity now, cell-based therapies. We're going to see all of those become viable therapies in the next five years and that's unbelievably exciting.We're seeing it already with immunotherapy with CAR-T cells, you'll see it soon with gene editing and gene therapies. So there are lots of new therapeutic modalities that allow us and others to attack diseases that were hard to attack. That's one side of the equation. The other side of the equation is we're just now getting a much better understanding of the biology in some of these diseases, meaning we're getting better at picking the targets.Most drug failures today are because you can't make a drug that targets your target; it's because you picked the wrong target. So the better we understand the biology — and we as an industry are understanding the biology much better — the higher probability of success. So I think when you take those two advances together, we're going to see a pretty significant kind of acceleration in breakthrough therapies.RELATED:Galapagos Pops To Vertex's Detriment — But Can It Compete?Vertex Pops As Analyst Questions Whether Rival Has 'Viable Drug'Three Biotech Firms Top Third-Quarter Views — But Only One Pops
"
47,GILD,"Invest in the disruptors.That's the advice from Wall Street, as giant biotech companies and the incumbents of Big Pharma are bracing to get crushed by more innovative — and cheaper — new drugs.X What started in 2017 will continue in 2018, analysts say. Generic drug approvals are rising and interesting new medicines are starting to take market share from the legacy makers of medications that consumers use frequently, including both Big Pharma and biotech companies.Blockbuster drugs representing an estimated $17 billion in annual sales are set to lose patent protection over the next decade, analysts say. Disruption will come as generic drugs and innovative new biologic alternatives come on the market.""It will be brutal,"" JMP Securities analyst Mike King told Investor's Business Daily. ""It will be a knife fight.""In the market for cholesterol-lowering drugs, King expects Amgen (AMGN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) to feel the heat from the likes of Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR), The Medicines Co. (MDCO) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY).Meanwhile, in anti-inflammatory treatments, Celgene's (CELG) Otezla, which gained blockbuster status in 2016, missed sales forecasts by a wide cut in the third quarter. Analysts say newly approved drugs to treat the same conditions from Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS) are taking market share.Gilead Sciences (GILD) is still feeling the pain from the maturing of its hepatitis C drug unit in the U.S. and Europe. The rapid pace of Gilead's hepatitis C sales decline is expected to slow down somewhat, but newer medicines like AbbVie's (ABBV) Mavyret are likely to swipe some of its sales.Big Pharma isn't getting any help from regulators either. Food and Drug Administration head Scott Gottlieb will continue to increase approvals for copycat drugs, stoking competition for both branded and generic drugs facing new rivals as firms try to undercut one another in price.Among the Big Pharma companies, Pfizer (PFE) will be at the forefront feeling the sting of generics taking sales. Earlier this month, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) was allowed to launch a generic copy of the blockbuster erectile dysfunction drug Viagra.Generic drugs tend to be cheaper than their branded counterparts and Viagra is a pricey drug at about $70 per tablet, according to AccessRX. In 2013, after Pfizer lost exclusivity for Viagra in Canada and Europe, worldwide sales fell 8% to $1.88 billion.Today, generics in Europe have slashed the price of drugs containing the same active ingredient as Viagra by about 90%. Generic versions of Viagra cost about a third of the price in Canada. U.S. Viagra prices could also fall if the trend repeats itself with a generic on the market.Teva, meanwhile, is struggling with $34.7 billion in debt as of the end of the third quarter. On Thursday, Teva announced a plan to cut its workforce by more than a quarter, close several manufacturing facilities and suspend its dividend on ordinary shares.The firm is also planning to review its generic drug portfolio, most specifically in the U.S., to change prices or discontinue products.IBD'S TAKE: See how giant biotechs fared vs. smaller players in the third quarter by visiting the Industry Snapshot. Hint: The quarter was classified as ""alarming"" for one large-cap biotech which could be in trouble as they see more competition for their traditional moneymakers.Across the board, spending on prescription drugs in 2016 increased by just 3.8% per person, according to a report from Express Scripts (ESRX). That's down from a 5.2% rise in 2015, representing a 27% drop in the growth rate.That trend is likely to continue in 2018, FBB Capital Partners analyst Mike Bailey told IBD. He credits Gottlieb for the decline in generic prices. Gottlieb is running the FDA like a business, which allows for a cycle of more approvals, more competition and lower prices.Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could use their tools to influence pricing, it's unlikely President Trump will use his executive powers to enact sweeping drug-pricing reform such as allowing Medicare to negotiate prices or enacting outright pricing controls, Bailey says.""I wouldn't expect any major changes out of the Trump administration in pricing,"" he said. ""I think mechanically and politically it's difficult to get pricing law through the system. It's politically more acceptable to just get more generic drug approvals. It's a win-win.""JMP's King counts drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis as among those in the ""crowded areas."" In 2016, drugs in this class cost an average $3,588 per prescription and benefited from increases in utilization and unit cost, according to Express Scripts.But in the third quarter of 2017, things began to look dour for the likes of Celgene, which missed expectations for its inflammation drug Otezla by 26%. In the U.S., the lag was even sharper at 28%. One analyst suggested Celgene was forced to take a price concession.Celgene also cut its guidance for 2020 after terminating trials of a drug to treat Crohn's disease, a condition that results from chronic inflammation in the digestive tract. It now sees inflammation and immunology drugs bringing in a combined $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion in 2020, down from the $4 billion outlook it issued in 2015.Biotech companies and Big Pharma will need to ""get realistic"" on their pricing in these competitive arenas, King says. The same could be said for companies making treatments for hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis and high cholesterol. All are highly saturated markets.To the latter point, he expects prices for drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors like Repatha from Amgen and Praluent from Regeneron and Sanofi to be under the microscope. These drugs lower bad LDL cholesterol in the blood. Evidence shows they also have a benefit on some cardiovascular outcomes.Repatha is listed at $14,100 per year, while Praluent costs $14,600. But rivals are closing in. Medicines Co. and Alnylam are working on another cholesterol drug, known as inclisiran. Meanwhile, analysts expect bempedoic acid from Esperion to be cheaper.Some of these Big Pharma and biotech companies ""are probably going to get their arms twisted a lot,"" King said. ""The pricing umbrella has created opportunities for new companies to come in and scale market share. Be careful if you own incumbents. Invest in the disruptors.""Other areas are seemingly immune to pricing pressure, analysts say.In 2016, the price of multiple sclerosis drugs rose an average 7.4%. That's a continuing trend, FBB's Bailey said. The price increases have been so egregious that House Democrats launched an investigation in August, noting that many of these drugs carry price tags north of $85,000 per year.The investigation was launched by Reps. Elijah Cummings and Peter Welch and centers on Bayer (BAYRY), Biogen (BIIB), EMD Sereno, Novartis, Roche (RHHBY), Sanofi and Teva.Among those pharmaceutical and biotech companies, Teva's 20-milligram dose of Copaxone has increased the most, rising 1,002% since its approval in 1996 to an annual price of $91,401 today, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Novartis' Gilenya, approved in 2010, is the highest priced at $91,836.The investigation is ""10 years too late,"" he said. ""It's more difficult to push price control for specialty markets. Multiple sclerosis is a massive market now, but stakeholders view it as a specialty market.""Rare disease and innovative cancer therapies also seem immune to pricing controls, analysts say. For example, earlier this year Novartis and Gilead — via its acquisition of Kite Pharma — gained approval for CAR-T drugs known as Kymriah and Yescarta, respectively.CAR-T drugs are developed using a patient's own immune system cells. They are trained to seek out and destroy cancer cells. Kymriah goes for $475,000 per year and Yescarta is listed at $373,000, ARK Invest analyst Manisha Samy wrote in a recent post.""While gene therapies are beginning to cure cancer, they come at a price that can cause sticker stock,"" she said. ""That said, compared to traditional therapies that suppress, but do not cure cancer, the cost benefit analysis of gene therapy is compelling.""Pricing shock tends to tamp down on excitement for really compelling drugs, Bailey says. The prime example is Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals' (IONS) Spinraza, the first spinal muscular atrophy drug approved. It costs $750,000 in its first year and $375,000 in subsequent years.But sentiment for the biotech companies' shares is already down, he said. So drug pricing concerns shouldn't be a big stock killer in 2018.""In the past when biotech stocks go up quickly, they get new drugs and people are excited, a lot of times someone will throw in a grenade: 'What about drug pricing?'"" Bailey said. ""But sentiment is already down. Even if there's a concern about drug pricing, I see a little less downside.""IBD's 462-company Biotech industry group is now ranked No. 34 out of 197 groups tracked, and has fallen from first just two months ago. Shares collectively neared a two-year high in October, but have since shucked almost 7% from that point.Over that same time, Amgen and Celgene — among the biggest biotechs — have seen their share prices dive 9% and 26%, respectively. Regeneron has taken a 19% hit and Gilead has tumbled 14%.Meanwhile, Alnylam and Esperion, which look likely to rival PSCK9 inhibitor drugmakers like Amgen and Regeneron, have lifted 7% and 5%, respectively. AbbVie, which recently launched a rival to Gilead's hepatitis C franchise, is up 5%.But Novartis and Lilly, which are competing against Celgene to treat inflammatory conditions, have seen their shares retreat, though to a smaller degree. Respectively, their share prices are down 1% and 2%, matching a 1% dip in IBD's 42-company Ethical Drugs industry group.Generic drug stocks, ranked No. 105 out of 197 groups, have actually broadly risen 2% since mid-October. But that's against respective 8% and 5% dips for Teva and Mylan (MYL), its two biggest names.RELATED:Teva's Restructuring Plan: Another Case Of Been Here, Done That?Generic Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don'tTop 6 Biotech Companies In Innovation Earn Recognition In New Awards

49,GILD,"GlycoMimetics (GLYC) defied a hematology biotech pitfall Tuesday, breaking out on strong cancer-drug data as shares of Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) and Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) trended in the opposite direction.X On the stock market today, GlycoMimetics rocketed as much as 27.4% as it rushed past a buy point at 17.04 out of a consolidation. Shares ended the day up nearly 15% to 16.45 following a presentation at a key blood disease conference.But others tumbled on their presentations at the American Society of Hematology conference in Atlanta. Global Blood plummeted 14.2% to close at 38.40, as shares of Spark continued a two-day tumble, falling 6.2% to finish at 44.76.Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) toppled nearly 9% to 45.75, as Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO) lost 8.7% to 56.08, and Seattle Genetics (SGEN) slid 1.2%, near 54.61.Early Tuesday, GlycoMimetics unveiled results of its drug known as GMI-1271 in two groups of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal white blood cells, red blood cells or platelets.IBD'S TAKE: Several biotech stocks made impressive gains Monday following presentations at the American Society of Hematology. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at which stocks popped and which toppled.In patients whose cancer either relapsed or hadn't responded to other therapies, treatment with GMI-1271 resulted in a 43% remission rate. Median overall survival was 9.4 months vs. 5.4 months for historical treatments. Median duration of remission was 11.1 months.For older patients with newly diagnosed disease, the clinical remission rate was 68%. Median overall survival was 15.8 months vs. 12 months for chemotherapy alone, the traditional therapy. Median duration of remission was 14.8 months.Across both groups of patients, GMI-1271 was well-tolerated with no obvious incremental toxicity observed.Late Monday, Global Blood unveiled data from studies of its drug voxelotor in patients with severe sickle cell disease. Hospitalizations for pain associated with the disease fell by 67% during 24 weeks of voxelotor treatment vs. the 24 weeks before therapy.The number of transfusions decreased by 60% during 24 weeks of treatment compared with the 24 weeks before beginning voxelotor. Of six patients who received transfusions before voxelotor therapy, two received no transfusions after treatment.Of the seven patients in the study, two died. Both had co-morbidities and advanced organ injury before treatment with voxelotor. Treating physicians don't believe voxelotor contributed to their deaths.Nomura analyst Christopher Marai noted the drug was well-tolerated and compliance was high because symptoms returned after short periods of discontinuation. He expects voxelotor to fill an unmet need to elderly sickle cell disease patients.Patient deaths underscore the severity of sickle cell disease, he said in a note to clients.""The patients previously responded well to therapy with reduction in transfusions, hospitalization and substantial quality-of-life improvements derived from the drug,"" he said.Spark continued a two-day plunge after closing down 35% on Monday after presenting data from its hemophilia A gene therapy. The drug showed a major reduction in bleeding rates, but showed smaller-than-expected increases of a key clotting protein.Investors compared Spark's drug, known as SPK-8011, to a rival therapy from BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN). SPK-8011 reduced bleeding in the first four hemophilia A patients treated, but demonstrated mixed Factor VIII levels.Factor VIII is the clotting protein missing in hemophilia patients. BioMarin's drug reduced bleeding events. Patients on one dose of BioMarin's drug reached normal Factor VIII levels at 78 weeks. Another group of patients were either in or near that threshold at 48 weeks.But in Spark's trial, one patient had an unexplained spike in Factor VIII levels at 24 weeks. Two patients on a high dose of SPK-8011 both required steroids and had lower Factor VIII levels. A fourth patient on a lower dose continued to have low Factor VIII levels.Juno and Celgene (CELG) presented strong results from a drug known as JCAR017 in patients with an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The drug is a CAR-T therapy in which a patient's own immune cells are reprogrammed to fight cancer cells.In a Phase 1 trial called Transcend, 74% of patients responded to treatment and all signs of cancer disappeared in 68% of patients at three months. Cancer disappeared completely in half of a core group of patients at six months, Juno said in a press release.Across doses, 80% of core group patients achieved a complete response at three months and stayed there at six months. In that group, 92% still in response at six months remained there as of the data cutoff.Only one of 67 patients experienced an adverse event known as cytokine release syndrome, characterized by flulike symptoms, and 10 experienced neurotoxicity. Both are common side effects associated with CAR-T therapy.Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said in a report that Juno presented data showing responses across a variety of patients, ""refuting the notion that the strong (effectiveness) achieved in Transcend could have been the result of cherry-picking 'easy patients.' ""Juno, though, is trailing Novartis (NVS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), both of which already have CAR-T therapies approved in the U.S.RELATED:Does Gilead's Kite Acquisition Offer A New Buying Opportunity?Biotech Industry: Small Innovators Outflank Big Caps As Blockbuster Drug Patent Cliff LoomsNeurocrine, Exelixis, Juno Stocks Rocket After Crushing Views

Investor's Business Daily does the work for you. Check out Leaderboard, where our markets team curates and analyzes a list of top-notch names. Take a free trial of Leaderboard.Take-Two Interactive rose as high as 122.21, clearing a 120.28 cup-with-handle buy point from a consolidation that's been taking shape since early November. But shares reversed to close down 0.1% at 119.29. The gaming software company's stock had been somewhat rangebound over the past few weeks, trading between the 50-day line and the buy point.Meanwhile, Vertex Pharmaceuticals broke out past a 167.95 entry late into Friday's trading session, rising 1.8% to 169.21, as the markets surged to more new highs. Volume was 2% below normal. You'd like to see volume rise at least 40%-50% above average on a breakout.On Monday, Vertex reversed lower, losing 1.2% to 167.14, back below the entry. Volume was modestly above normal .The action comes ahead of earnings on Wednesday. Vertex had been consolidating since last July, and the biotech has been on a steady rise since December.Wellness services software company Mindbody sank 0.6% to 34.95 on Monday, working on a consolidation forming since November, the shortest base of the group. Though Mindbody lost support at the 50-day line several times while building the base, it has been able to quickly recover. The stock has now formed a handle, lowering the buy point slightly to 36.05.It is important to note that as the major indexes have continued to surge higher, each of these four base-building technology and health care stocks has a Relative Strength line that is lagging. The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. that of the S&P 500. When a stock breaks out, you want to see the RS line hitting a short-term high, if not an all-time high. Vertex's RS line has risen above a very short-term level.

52,GILD,"Stocks came off lows in afternoon trading Monday, although some industry groups were under added pressure.X Losses were well-contained, with the main indexes trading inside Friday's price ranges and declines at less than 0.3%.The Nasdaq composite was off 0.1%, the S&P 500 0.2% and Dow Jones industrial average 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000, which has been lagging the major indexes for about a week, fell 0.2%.Volume was higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq compared with the same time Friday. Although the key indexes pared losses, breadth was poor. Losers led winners by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE and by 3-to-2 on the Nasdaq.Energy, chip equipment, homebuilding and solar industry groups were some of the weakest in today's market.Signs of stress are growing in the homebuilding group. LGI Homes (LGIH), William Lyon Homes (WLH), Toll Bros. (TOL) and D.R. Horton (DHI) have moved below their 50-day moving averages for the first time since September, when those stocks were basing. A few other builders had already slid below the 50-day line.Myriad Genetics (MYGN) gapped down in heavy trading after Goldman Sachs initiated the stock with a sell rating today. The genetic testing company erased all gains from a breakout past a 37.40 buy point, which results in a sell signal.But Gilead Sciences (GILD) soared above the 86.37 buy point of a cup without handle. Volume was more than triple its usual pace. But the relative strength line is well short of a new high, which may hamper the stock's move to new highs.The biotech is following up Friday's 5.3% surge, which came after Jefferies upgraded Gilead to buy from hold and raised its price target to 95 from 87.Fibria (FBR) broke out of a cup without handle, clearing the 17.31 buy point in heavy volume. Reports quoted by Reuters say Netherlands-based Paper Excellence is considering acquiring the Brazil-based forestry company. The relative strength line is trending higher but has not made a new high.Universal Display (OLED) fell 6% and continues to struggle below the 50-day moving average. The maker of organic light-emitting diode technology has been weakening on reports of flagging demand for Apple's iPhone X, which uses an OLED display. On Monday, Japan's Nikkei reported that lackluster sales of the iPhone X may delay Apple's plans to introduce OLED screens in other models.Dow component Caterpillar (CAT) was down nearly 3% in heavy trading. The stock had been rallying from its Nov. 30 breakout past a tightly wound flat base at 140.54 and had climbed more than 20% until it started to stall the past couple of weeks.Despite strong earnings Thursday, the stock has come under selling since then.

53,GILD,"AbbVie (ABBV) surged to a record high Friday after issuing a beat-and-raise earnings report that included guidance for a 9% tax rate in 2018, prompting one analyst to suggest ""yet another industry behemoth"" could become acquisitive.X For its fourth quarter, AbbVie reported adjusted income of $1.48 per share on $7.74 billion in sales, rising 23% and 14%, respectively. Both metrics topped the consensus of analysts for adjusted profit of $1.44 a share on $7.59 billion in sales.By the closing bell on the stock market today, AbbVie soared by 13.8% to close at 123.21, helping drug stocks to rise a collective 1.9%.Guidance for a lower 2018 tax rate should have been expected, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients. In December, the White House approved legislation that lowered the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%.""With this tax rate, and the company's revenue growth and margin performance, we expect a significant increase in free cash flow in 2018, with attendant de-leveraging, thus setting the stage for more active business development activity from yet another industry behemoth,"" he said. Investors had previously expected AbbVie to guide to a 20% tax rate, Porges said.Mergers activity has been heating recently in the biopharma group. This week, Celgene (CELG) said it would buy the remainder of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it didn't already own for $9 billion. In 2017, Gilead Sciences (GILD) spent nearly $12 billion to acquire Kite Pharma.AbbVie expects its effective tax rate to increase to 13% over the next five years due to increased domestic income and investment, Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said in his note to clients.As for AbbVie's results, sales of Humira — which treats several forms of arthritis, Crohn's disease and plaque psoriasis — increased 14% to $4.89 billion in sales. Humira is AbbVie's most important drug. Sales beat the consensus for $4.82 billion, Raymond said.IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie leads its group with an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a best-possible 99, making it a leader among all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. For more on how drug stocks rank, visit IBD Stock Checkup.Cancer drug Imbruvica brought in $708 million in revenue, growing nearly 39%. That was $1 million ahead of analysts' collective view, Raymond said.Worldwide sales of AbbVie's hepatitis C drugs Viekira and Mavyret advanced more than 63% vs. the year-earlier period to $510 million, beating the consensus by 89%, said Porges.The lower tax rate also boosted other 2018 guidance. For the year, AbbVie calls for adjusted income of $7.33-$7.43 per share, up from $6.45-$6.55 and topping the consensus for $6.57.

54,GILD,"Retail investors turned more leery in a volatile February — yet they used the stock market pullback as an opportunity to buy Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and General Electric (GE) rather than flee.X Customers at online brokerage TD Ameritrade (AMTD) were net buyers of those stocks in a month that saw each of the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite fall more than 10% below recent highs. Worries about rising bond yields and inflation sparked a sharp sell-off in stocks, leading to a brief market correction. Stocks bottomed on Feb. 9, when the S&P 500 index rebounded from its 200-day moving average. The major averages did fall in February, breaking long monthly winning streaks.Meanwhile, volatility of the S&P 500, as measured by the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, spiked during the period. As the VIX rose above 50 for the first time since August 2015, it decreased the relative volatility of many widely held stocks, including GE, Apple and Facebook (FB), according to a new TD Ameritrade report. That led investors to ""significantly limit their volatility risk in the market, changing their game plan from less speculative to more of a low beta weighted one,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, noting the rocky start to 2018 came after a tame 2017.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

Start NowThe brokerage firm, which recently ranked as one of IBD's Best Online Brokers, shared additional insights on how clients traded for the month:General Electric and Ford Motor (F) both neared multiyear lows, and were net buys.Apple and Amazon.com (AMZN) both reported better-than-expected earnings during the period, but traded lower following market volatility, and were also net buys.Boeing (BA), which traded higher following better-than-expected earnings and a stronger demand outlook for its planes, was also a net buy.Microsoft (MSFT) was a net buy as its earnings beat proved its cloud computing and software-as-a-service initiatives are a success.Alibaba Group (BABA), which was down almost 20% from recent highs during this volatile period, was also a net buy.Nvidia (NVDA), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and Netflix (NFLX) counted among other popular names that investors bought in February.Gilead Sciences (GILD) was net sold after reaching a 52-week high and receiving approval from the FDA for a new HIV treatment.Facebook (FB) reached an all-time high Feb. 1 on better-than-expected earnings, but was also net sold.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) hit an 18-month high following an analyst upgrade on immuno-oncology growth prospects, and was net sold.Snap (SNAP), which reported a revenue increase leading to a stock spike, was also net sold.Target (TGT) was net sold following an analyst upgrade and increased price estimate.ConocoPhillips (COP), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bioverativ (BIVV) were also dumped. Celgene (CELG) agreed to acquire Juno while France's Sanofi (SNY) is buying Bioverativ.Apple shares closed down 0.1% at 176.67 on the stock market today, close to a buy point. Amazon rose 0.9% Tuesday for a fresh all-time high, while General Electric continued to rally following a bullish analyst report, adding 1.5%. GE tumbled last week to its worst level since July 2010. GE and Apple are members of the Dow Jones industrial average. So are Boeing and Microsoft.Investors lessened their exposure to the equity markets in February, TD Ameritrade said.The Investor Movement Index, a proprietary measure of client behavior at the brokerage, fell 23% to 5.95 — a level not seen since January 2017 — in the four weeks ended Feb. 23. It was the second monthly decline in a row, after the index made record highs above 8.0 in the fall of 2017.An increase in the score tends to mean that investors are getting more bullish. A decrease can mean that investors are becoming bearish or less bullish.

56,GILD,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are likely to beat fourth-quarter earnings estimates, an analyst predicted, but biotech guidance will be cautious despite the windfall of tax reform.X The fourth-quarter earnings reporting season kicks off next week with Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Novartis (NVS) weighing in Tuesday and Wednesday on the pharma side. Celgene (CELG) and Biogen (BIIB) are on deck early Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV) trailing on Friday.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges expects cautious predictions at the beginning of 2018, noting the example of Celgene's pre-announcement earlier this month. Uncertainties in payer dynamics, competition and U.S. drug access are likely to play into forecasts.""All these factors, along with an imminent return to a more challenging political environment, suggest that management teams will be more than typically cautious in the guidance that they first provide to the financial community on their earnings calls,"" he said in a note to clients.For the fourth quarter, Porges calls for Vertex's cystic fibrosis drugs Orkambi and Kalydeco, Gilead's hepatitis C and HIV drugs, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN) Eylea and Dupixent — the latter two eye disease and eczema treatments, respectively — to surprise to the upside.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs suffered in the third quarter as high profile drugs missed expectations and smaller players took headlines by beating views. Head to the Industry Snapshot for more on what happened in the prior quarter and whether history is expected to repeat itself.But he sees older drugs from Amgen (AMGN), including psoriasis and arthritis med Enbrel, as at risk of disappointing investors. Biogen's multiple sclerosis drugs Avonex and Plegridy, and AbbVie's cancer med Imbruvica could also disappoint, he said.Needham analyst Alan Carr sees investors focusing on mergers on the fourth-quarter calls and throughout 2018. This week, rumors emerged that Celgene could be considering a takeover of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), and Biogen could be considering putting in a bid on Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR).""We continue to believe pharma has a bias towards de-risked assets that are on the market or in some cases still under regulatory review,"" he wrote in a note to clients.In the first half of 2018, he expects the Food and Drug Administration to approve Vertex's cystic fibrosis regimen of Kalydeco and tezacaftor as well as an HIV combination from Gilead. AbbVie and Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) could also get the OK for a drug to treat severe menstrual pain.Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) is also likely to grab approval for patisiran, a drug to treat a condition in which abnormal protein deposits throughout the body can cause systemic problems.

58,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) topped sales and adjusted profits views in the third quarter, but shares dropped late Thursday after its hepatitis C drug franchise declined again and narrowly missed consensus expectations.XIn after-hours trading on the stock market today, Gilead fell 4.1% to 74.70. Shares closed down 2.5%, at 77.88, as biotech stocks widely sold off before the closing bell Thursday following Celgene's (CELG) sales miss and guidance cut.Total sales of $6.51 billion declined 13.2% but topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $6.33 billion. Adjusted profit came in at $2.27 a share, down 17.5%, but beat expectations for adjusted earnings of $2.03 per share.Sales of HIV and hepatitis B drugs climbed nearly 3% to $3.6 billion. Flagship HIV drug Genvoya posted a yearly gain of 114% to $988 million and beat the consensus for $934 million, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a note to clients.Gilead's hepatitis C drugs, meanwhile, continued to struggle, falling by a third to $2.2 billion and missing analyst views for $2.3 billion, Loncar Investments Chief Executive Brad Loncar said in a note. This follows the entry of AbbVie's (ABBV) Mavyret which can treat all six genotypes of hepatitis C.RBC's Abrahams noted hepatitis C drug Harvoni came in ""considerably lighter than expectations"" at $973 million vs. the consensus at $1.1 billion. Epclusa also missed, posting $882 million, which was below the consensus for $958 million.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead currently has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 66 out of a best-possible 99. Earlier this month, its RS Rating rose as high as 73. Visit IBD Data Stories for more on what goes into rating a stock.""Even without explicit 2018 guidance, we believe this directionally should help bring down Street hepatitis C numbers for next year, a welcome reduction that would lessen an overhang on shares,"" Abrahams said.Other product sales — which includes drugs to treat high blood pressure in the lungs, angina and fungal infections — declined about 1% to $559 million.Gilead increased the low-end of its 2017 net product sales guidance to $24.5 billion to $25.5 billion. It sees non-hepatitis C drug sales comprising $16 billion to $16.5 billion. The firm also lowered the top-end of its hepatitis C guidance to reflect $8.5 billion to $9 billion in sales.RELATED:Biotechs Amgen, Sarepta, Vertex Top Third-Quarter ExpectationsBoston Scientific Dives As Abbott Rivalry Hits Pacemaker SalesCelgene Crashes On Sales Miss; Alexion, Bristol Results Mixed

59,GILD,"Biotech stocks toppled last week following disappointing third-quarter results from the likes of Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), an analyst said Monday, noting that ""competition and pricing concerns started taking a toll.""XThe arrival of new competition in the form of AbbVie's (ABBV) Mavyret forced Gilead's hepatitis C drug franchise to lose share in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Celgene notes that its Otezla — which treats psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis — is in an ""increasingly competitive market.""Gilead topped total sales views, but revenue from hepatitis C drugs declined by a third and narrowly missed analyst forecasts. Celgene's ""alarming"" results were driven by a major miss in sales of Otezla, leading total sales to lag and guidance cuts.Instinet analyst Christopher Marai says the competitive and pricing concerns took a hit on the broad biotech market. The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index finished down 4.4%, though the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both wrapped the week at less than 1% higher.Meanwhile, IBD's 454-company Biotech industry group lost nearly 3% and slipped to third out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. Over the last two weeks it had been ranked first and then second.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene cut many elements of its 2020 guidance, including in inflammation and immunology drugs. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on what Celgene's results could mean for the broader group.Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and AveXis (AVXS) are more exposed to competitive concerns, Marai said in a note to clients. Alnylam is working on a drug called patisiran to treat a rare disease caused by the buildup of abnormal materials and will rival Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) and Prothena (PRTA).AveXis is working on therapy for spinal muscular atrophy. There, it rivals Biogen (BIIB) and Ionis, which sell Spinraza to treat the same condition. Marai lists Spinraza alongside Sarepta Therapeutics' (SRPT) Exondys 51 for Duchenne muscular dystrophy as ""fundamentally strong launches.""""We continue to look at strength in select names as an opportunity to take profits in biotech and reinvest in less macro-exposed names that are rich in potential (stock) catalysts over the next 12 months,"" he said. ""We could avoid priced-for-perfection names including Alnylam and AveXis.""Over the next year, Marai sees Prothena, Deciphera Pharmaceuticals (DCPH), Cellectis (CLLS) and MacroGenics (MGNX) as having a slew of potential catalysts.RELATED:Dow's Merck Plunges To 17-Month Low On Growing Keytruda WorriesGilead Beats Third-Quarter Sales, Earnings ViewsThree Biotech Firms Top Third-Quarter Views — But Only One Pops

60,GILD,"Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) released preliminary data early Wednesday in, respectively, sickle cell disease and aggressive lymphoma — sending their stocks skyward.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Bluebird initially surged more than 10%, but settled back for a gain of 2.8% to finish at 142.95. Juno popped 7.6% to end the regular trading day at 48.31, well above a 47.13 buy point out of a flat base that began forming in late September.The duo released preliminary data ahead of the American Society of Hematology annual meeting in December. Bluebird's stock movement came despite the fact the biotech reported third-quarter sales and adjusted losses per share that lagged Wall Street.Preliminary data show Bluebird was able to boost the number of gene-corrected bone marrow cells in patients with sickle cell disease using an updated version of its therapy called LentiGlobin. This means patients could produce healthier red blood cells.Bluebird said it also plans to present updated data from a study of its drug, called bb2121, in patients with advanced multiple myeloma, a blood cancer. Bluebird is working on the drug and its follow-up, bb21217, with Celgene (CELG).IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs have largely offered a mixed quarter, though Celgene's third-quarter sales were called ""alarming."" Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at which firms have reported thus far.Quarterly results, though, lagged the consensus. Bluebird reported adjusted losses of $1.73 per share on $7.71 billion in sales, vs. analysts' call for an adjusted loss of $1.64 a share and $9 million in sales.Juno, which is set to report its quarterly results after the close, released early data from a study of its drug, dubbed JCAR017, in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a blood cancer.In the study, 80% of patients responded to a specific dose of JCAR017 and all signs of cancer disappeared in 73% of patients in the core group at three months. Across both doses in the core group, the best overall response rate was 84% and the best complete response rate was 61%.JCAR017 belongs to a class known as CAR-T drugs where Novartis (NVS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) — by virtue of its acquisition of Kite Pharma — already have drugs approved.Gilead's Yescarta is already approved to treat large B-cell lymphoma, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.Novartis' drug, Kymriah, is approved to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25. On Tuesday, Novartis said it's aiming to have Kymriah approved to treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.RELATED:How Celgene, Gilead's Pricing Woes Continue To Haunt Biotech StocksGilead Tops Sales, Profit Views But Misses On Hep C; Shares FallDow Stock Merck Topples After Withdrawing Keytruda Application In Europe

61,GILD,"Celgene (CELG) could comfortably spend $11 billion to acquire Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), an analyst said Wednesday as Juno shares soared on rumors the two biotechs could be in merger talks.X Analysts applauded the potential deal which would make strategic sense for both firms. Juno needs Celgene's size to compete against bigger rivals in treating blood cancers, and Celgene is facing a patent cliff for its blood cancer drug Revlimid, they say.""While we are rarely fans of high premium takeovers, this deal probably makes sense for Celgene, and won't surprise the company's shareholders,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients.In midday trading on the stock market today, Juno shares raced to a record high of 70 before ending the day at 69.25, up nearly 52%. Celgene, though, sank 2.7% to finish at 102.02.Juno and Celgene already partner on a CAR-T program. CAR-T therapies use patients' immune cells to fight against cancer. Under this 2015 deal, Celgene owns 10% of Juno stock, pays some development costs and owns some commercialization rights.But the duo is facing stiff competition in the CAR-T arena, following Gilead Sciences' (GILD) nearly $12 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma in October. Now, Gilead and Novartis (NVS) both have CAR-T drugs approved, meaning Juno is trailing with a potential approval this year.IBD'S TAKE: Juno has an IBD Composite Rating of 51 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms 51% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated biotech stocks.Leerink's Porges compared Juno and Kite. Both are CAR-T players working to develop therapies that target the CD19 protein in some tumors. Each claims to have proprietary elements to their constructs and manufacturing processes that will give them an edge.""They will commercialize similar products for similar indications within 18 months of each other and with approximately similar clinical results,"" he said. ""This suggests to us that they are much more similar than any other two biopharma companies could be.""But Juno faced a setback in March 2017 after five patients died while receiving a CAR-T therapy. Juno has since scrapped that particular therapy and is working on another, but Kite — with Gilead — got to the market first.Porges suggests Celgene and Juno could settle on a price similar to Gilead's $11.9 billion acquisition of Kite. Juno sees its technology as best-in-class and will argue for a premium. Celgene will argue for a discount, noting Gilead has a first-to-market advantage.As of Tuesday's close and before acquisition rumors cropped up, Juno had a market cap just north of $5 billion. With Wednesday's stock movement, Juno's market cap rose close to $7.7 billion.""In the end, Juno will recognize that they are now competing with Novartis and Gilead, and probably need the resources of at least a Celgene to be successful in the market,"" he said. Neither seems inclined to let the deal fail over ""price hubris,"" he added.Juno — like Gilead and Novartis — isn't going to stop at its first CAR-T approval. CAR-T therapies have shown promise in blood cancers, though a number of biopharmas also are looking at their potential use in solid tumors.Juno looks likely to gain approval later this year for its therapy, JCAR017, to treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Gilead already has a therapy approved there. Novartis is also seeking an approval for this use.After, Juno will look at other possible uses, including other leukemias and lymphomas, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said in a note to clients. In total, he estimates $1.7 billion in U.S. peak sales in 2025, assuming a best-case scenario.Schmidt expects Juno to capture a third of the market in CAR-T drugs that target the CD19 protein in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.In the latter indication, Novartis already has an approval. Schmidt also sees Juno getting 17% of the market in multiple myeloma where fellow Celgene partner Bluebird Bio (BLUE) is working.RELATED:How Blood-Disease Data Sent These 2 Biotech Stocks FlyingDoes Gilead Now Have A New Multi-Billion-Dollar Franchise?How Novartis' FDA Win In Cancer Also Could Be A Boon For Its Rivals

62,GILD,"Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) surged 46% in late trading Tuesday on a report that Celgene (CELG) is in talks to acquire it.X According to the Wall Street Journal, unnamed sources say Celgene is in talks to buy Juno. The two have long-partnered on cancer treatments including CAR-T drugs that teach the immune system to identify and fight cancer.The talks could pan out in a deal in the coming weeks, sources say. The potential deal to acquire Juno would come on the heels of Gilead Sciences' (GILD) nearly $12 billion purchase of CAR-T drugmaker Kite Pharma late last year.Now, Gilead and Novartis (NVS) have the only approved CAR-T drugs on market. Juno could follow with a CAR-T drug approval later this year, the company has said. So far, CAR-T drugs look best poised to treat blood cancers. Firms are also looking into using these therapies in solid tumors.For Gilead, buying Kite helps stem the gap from declining hepatitis C drug sales. For Celgene, buying its longtime partner Juno could give it a leg up as it prepares to lose patient protection for Revlimid, which treats a blood cancer known as multiple myeloma.IBD'S TAKE: Some hematology focused biotechs have piqued investor interest of late. See what these firms are working on by visiting IBD Industry Themes.A representative of Juno declined to comment to Investor's Business Daily. Representatives of Celgene didn't immediately return requests for comment.In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Juno rocketed 46% to 66.35 after closing down 6.5% at 45.60. Celgene sank 1.7% after ending the regular session down 1.1%, at 104.82. Bluebird Bio (BLUE), a CAR-T company that also partners with Celgene, saw its stock pop 7.3% after hours.RELATED:This Biotech Stock Seen As Cheapest Among Rivals In Cancer DrugsWhy This Biotech Stock Is Defying A Hematology-Related PitfallDoes Gilead's Kite Acquisition Offer A New Buying Opportunity?

64,GILD,"Dynavax (DVAX) crossed the finish line in early November with the first new hepatitis B vaccine in 25 years, a two-dose regimen that Chief Executive Eddie Gray expects to foster better compliance in adults.X But shares crashed 3.8% the day of the announcement and tacked on another 9.4% pitfall two days later as investors awaited an acquisition or partnership to help the small-cap biotech launch the drug it named Heplisav-B.""I think people were hoping Dynavax would announce a buyout or a large partnership because they're not capable of commercializing on their own,"" said Brad Loncar, portfolio manager for Loncar Investments. ""They probably will find a deal like that.""""But people expected a big pop and ran for the exits when it didn't happen,"" Loncar said.Gray told Investor's Business Daily the company will talk to anyone with an offer that ""knocks our socks off,"" but until then the first priority is moving forward to launch the drug, expected sometime this quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Investing in exchange-traded funds can get you closer to high-fliers like Nektar Therapeutics, which launched on strong data stemming from a combination of its immuno-oncology drug with Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo. Head to IBD's ETFs page for a closer look at key biotech ETFs.Meanwhile, Dynavax also has an asthma drug in Phase 2 testing and three potential drugs for cancer in its pipeline. Among those, it has a checkpoint inhibitor with a mechanism similar to treatments from Dow component Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).Gray talked with IBD about Dynavax's approved hepatitis B vaccine and what it could mean for hepatitis B treatments from the likes of Gilead Sciences (GILD).IBD: What makes Heplisav-B unique?Gray: The first product to get to approval is an adult vaccine for hepatitis B. Traditionally, there have been vaccines around for 25 years and they work well in children but they don't work so well in adults. What we've been able to do is bring to the market a new vaccine which has significantly higher protective levels so more adults reach protection than do so on the traditional vaccines. We're also able to do that just using two doses. With Heplisav-B, the new product, you would have a vaccination today and you'd have your second dose one month from now. In the older vaccines, it's a three-dose schedule, which would be today, one month and then six months. One of the key problems in the adult market is adults are extremely poor at coming back and getting that third dose. What that means is it's a contributing factor to why so many adults are not adequately protected.IBD: What does this mean for the hepatitis B market?Gray: It is the only two-dose vaccine. Our timing is important from the point of view of public health because the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) released the latest data on hepatitis B infection rates among the adult population in the United States. What those have shown is for the first time in 20-25 years, we're seeing an increase in the number of infections of hepatitis B among adults in the United States. The data show us essentially a 20% increase across the nation. In some parts of the country, it's higher than that. It is thought that the current opioid crisis — because obviously it involves needle use — might be contributing in some areas to that increased rate.We do have a pretty uniform picture across the country of an emerging increase in hepatitis B infection. The fact that the traditional three-dose vaccines do not work as well in adults — they're simply not as protected as they need to be — and the fact the three-dose vaccine is a difficult schedule for people to follow, means the availability of a vaccine which inherently provides higher levels of protection specifically demonstrated in the trials. (It) does so on a two-dose schedule — which is a simpler regimen for people to follow — (and) we think it will be an important contributor to public health. Our expectation is it will become the dominant vaccine for adults in the market.IBD: How are you positioned competitively?Gray: We think we're extremely well positioned. I think not only is this the first prophylactic vaccine for 25 years, because of its profile it will also be the last. There isn't going to be another competitor. The larger companies, you mentioned Gilead, what they're concentrating on is can they find treatments for people who are already infected. We are vaccinating people who are not yet infected to stop them from becoming infected. So actually, Gilead should be more worried about me because I'm stopping people from getting hepatitis B infection. That's the split. It's important to keep those two apart. So I don't have any concerns about larger companies working on hepatitis B because if you've already got hepatitis B then it's too late for a vaccine anyway.IBD: How big is the market?Gray: At the moment the number of adults who get vaccinated every year is about 2 million. But what's happened, a couple of years ago, is that the CDC who manages all of these schedules also recommended that adults who have diabetes should also be vaccinated to protect them against hepatitis B. The number of people with diabetes in the United States is obviously very large. The number of people newly diagnosed every year is about 1.5 million, so just the newly diagnosed alone almost doubles the market opportunity. And that's not counting the bolus of people who are already diagnosed as diabetic and have not been vaccinated. We certainly see the potential for this vaccine growing to be in the $500 million-$600 million per year range.IBD: Can you comment on the market reaction following Heplisav-B's approval?Gray: We've seen market reactions to this sort of good news before. There's this sort of idea that there's a portion of the market which isn't terribly interested actually in the approval itself. It operates on the idea of sell on the news regardless of what the future picture looks like. I think it's fairly clear that we experienced some of that. But I think we're very encouraged by our conversations with large and long-holding investors and I think everybody sort of used this as a temporary phenomenon and we can expect the appropriate value for this type of approval to come back into the stock over time.We have taken a position of not publicly commenting on where we are in any partnership discussions or debates. But I think we've been very clear in what we have said, which is when we look at the profile of this vaccine and we look at how that profile has been translated into the label and we recognize that the adult vaccine market is a very contained, well understood marketplace that's easily accessible, then we do believe that there's a strong story and commitment here to high levels of delivery to stockholders by Dynavax launching Heplisav-B and that's what we intend to do. Now, if somebody comes to us with an offer that recognizes all of that potential and sort of knocks our socks off with that offer, then of course we'll talk to them. But until such an event happens, we're putting together all of our plans to launch Heplisav-B.RELATED:Why This Biotech Could Prosper On Back Of Roche Cancer TrialMedtronic Surges After Topping Quarterly Earnings ViewsBiotech Spikes After Settling Debate Over Its Seizure Medicine

66,GILD,"Dow component Merck (MRK) slid 6% Friday and kept tumbling after hours on disappointing third-quarter sales and the withdrawal of its application in Europe for an advanced lung cancer treatment.XIn after-hours trading on the stock market today, Merck fell an additional 3.3%, near 56.40, after shares closed down 6.1%, at 58.24. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), which makes rival drug Opdivo, lifted 1.8% late Friday after closing down 1.7%, at 59.94.AbbVie (ABBV), which also missed third-quarter sales expectations but beat profit views, advanced 2.7%, to 91.93, before the closing bell.Late Friday, Merck said its decision to withdraw its European application was based on data from a study dubbed Keynote-021, Cohort G. But it didn't offer specifics regarding its findings. The regimen is already approved in the U.S. as a first treatment for advanced lung cancer.""Merck is confident in the clinical data from this rigorously conducted trial, which demonstrated specific improvements in overall response rate and progression-free survival for the Keytruda combination regimen compared to chemotherapy alone,"" the firm said in a news release. Immuno-oncology drug Keytruda is combined with chemotherapy to treat lung cancer.Earlier in the day, Merck reported adjusted income of $1.11 per share, up 4%, and beating the view of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $1.03 a share. But sales of $10.33 billion declined 2% and lagged the $10.51 billion analyst model.Investors have zeroed in on Keytruda for Merck ""given the increasingly challenging hepatitis C environment,"" Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said. On Thursday, Gilead Sciences (GILD) reported its hepatitis C drug sales fell by a third.""We expect questions to focus almost entirely on the evolution of Keytruda uptake (as a first treatment) in non-small cell lung cancer,"" and timing on the readout of another study, called Keynote-189, confirming Keytruda plus chemotherapy in advanced lung cancer, Fernandez said in a note to clients.Still, for Merck hepatitis C was a bright spot in the quarter. Sales of Zepatier posted a yearly sales gain of 185% to $468 million. Its growth only paled in comparison to cancer drug Keytruda, which brought in $1.05 billion, up 194%.IBD'S TAKE:  Merck shares began to form a flat base with a buy point at 66.90 in early March. A flat base is one of several ways of identifying potential breakout stocks. Head to the Investor's Corner for more on how to read this pattern.Merck's biggest product, a diabetes drug called Januvia/Janumet, declined 2% to $1.53 billion. Other big declines included a 51% dip in sales of cholesterol drug Zetia/Vytorin, and a 22% slide in revenue from human papillomavirus drug Gardasil/Gardasil 9.Sales were reduced by about $240 million due to changes in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stockpile for the Gardasil vaccine after a cyberattack hit Merck in the quarter. Revenue also took a $135 million hit from lost sales in some markets after the cyberattack.The firm raised and narrowed its full-year guidance. It sees adjusted earnings of $3.91-$3.97, up from its prior target of $3.76-$3.88 and analyst views for $3.87. It also forecast $40 billion to $40.5 billion in sales, above its earlier view for $39.4 billion to $40.4 billion. The consensus saw $40.43 billion.AbbVie's quarter was ""just OK,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. It earned $1.41 a share excluding various items, up 16.5% and topping the consensus for $1.39. Its $6.995 billion in sales lagged the consensus for $7.04 billion, though grew from $6.43 billion in the year-ago period.More importantly, AbbVie outlined its ambitions through 2025 for current products and its late-stage pipeline, Porges said.The firm sees Humira — which treats rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, spinal arthritis, Crohn's disease and plaque psoriasis — approaching $21 billion in sales by 2020, up from its prior target for $18 billion, Porges said.For the year, AbbVie now expects adjusted profit of $5.53-$5.55 a share, touching the low-end of the consensus forecast for $5.53. AbbVie guided to adjusted income of $6.37-$6.57 per share in 2018, lagging analysts' view for $6.62.Humira is AbbVie's biggest drug. During the quarter, sales grew 15.8% to $4.7 billion and were above the consensus for $4.6 billion, Porges said. Cancer drug Imbruvica posted a yearly sales gain of 37.3% to $688 million. In the U.S., Imbruvica sales of $574 million beat analysts' views by 1%, Porges said.And though Gilead struggled with its hepatitis C drug franchise, AbbVie's hepatitis C unit beat analysts' average by 24%, though sales declined by 26.8%. This followed the U.S. approval in August of Mavyret, which can treat all six genotypes of hepatitis C.RELATED:Celgene Results Called 'Alarming,' As Alexion, Bristol MixedBoston Scientific Dives As Abbott Rivalry Hits Pacemaker SalesThree Biotech Firms Top Third-Quarter Views — But Only One Pops

67,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) toppled to a month low Thursday after a report emerged that an appellate court revived a whistleblower case alleging that the biotech giant lied about ingredient sourcing for a trio of its HIV drugs.XShares dove more than 5% at one point before ending the trading day down 3.5% to 80.91 on the stock market today. The biotech group collectively rose 1% to a 20-month high. Gilead's pitfall followed a report from Forbes late Tuesday noting the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had revived the 2015 court case. The case was revived July 7.The case alleges that Gilead violated the False Claims Act by telling the Food and Drug Administration it would source an active ingredient, commonly known as FTC, used in HIV drugs Emtriva, Truvada and Atripla from facilities in Canada, Germany, the U.S. and South Korea.Two former employees claim Gilead instead contracted with an unauthorized Chinese firm to manufacture unapproved FTC at unregistered facilities over the course of 16 months beginning in December 2007.Gilead allegedly did so to ""save money and trigger price reduction clauses in contracts with other FTC suppliers,"" according to the 2015 lawsuit. Eventually, it gained approval for use of that supplier's FTC in 2010, but had already been using its ingredients in its finished products for two years.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead has an IBD Composite Rating of 88 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs better than nearly nine in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other biotech leaders.Contamination issues, including two recalls of contaminated products, led Gilead to stop using that supplier in 2014. But Gilead never acknowledged or notified the FDA about bad test results or contamination issues, according to the lawsuit.To conceal its use of illicit FTC, Gilead allegedly imported the ingredients through its Canadian facilities and used fraudulent labeling, the whistleblowers say. Labels and paperwork were allegedly obscured or augmented, and registered manufacturers were credited for supplying the FTC.One of the whistleblowers was terminated in 2009. The duo brought an initial suit in January 2015 and an amended suit in June 2015. Both prior cases were dismissed. Gilead didn't immediately return a request for comment from Investor's Business Daily.RELATED:Novartis Could Acquire This Biotech — Why A Deal Is 'Very Logical'Biotech Stocks To Watch And Pharma Industry NewsFDA Chief Gottlieb Addresses Opioids, Cancer, New Therapies

68,GILD,"Nothing adds more sparkle to your portfolio than capturing the enormous gains of a truly innovative new company through timely investing in recent IPO stocks.XThink of Google, now known as Alphabet (GOOGL) and up more than 2,300% from its 2004 initial public offering. Or Microsoft (MSFT), which ran up 67,282% from a post-IPO trading low in March 1986 to a peak nearly 14 years later. Not to mention Cisco Systems (CSCO), the greatest stock of the 1990s bull market, which shot up 118,741% in less than a decade.In comparison, the pickings may seem slim in today's IPO market. Although the number of initial public offerings year-to-date has increased from 2016's meager pace, it's low on a historical basis.Yet sharp-eyed investors can still find jewels among new IPO stocks. There's no guarantee that these companies will match the long-term gains of Alphabet or Microsoft. Yet some are off to an impressive start and could add some shine to your portfolio.Consider: Among companies that debuted in the past 24 months, at least 23 stocks that currently trade at 25 or higher are up 40% or more this year, based on Investor's Business Daily research. That's hearty outperformance in a year when the Nasdaq is excelling, rising around 26%, and the S&P 500 has rallied 15%.This elite group includes Ichor (ICHR), Square (SQ), Atlassian (TEAM) and Argentine lender Grupo Supervielle (SUPV). (A list of top-performing IPOs to watch is provided at the bottom of this article.)Though new to the stock market, these companies have shown strong fundamentals, giving investors confidence in their business strategy. All four are highly profitable. The combined trailing 12-month revenue for this quartet of new market maestros? A stately $4.6 billion.NYSE-traded Square, whose software lets small businesses and mobile merchants take credit-card payments via a tabletop device or a smartphone, came public at 9 a share in November 2015. Today, its stock is trading near 41, up 355%. Atlassian, which sells project management and collaboration software, trades near 53 and has jogged more than 150% higher since holding its initial public offering at 21 in December 2015.In addition to the 20 or more stocks up 40%-plus in 2017, at least 25 more companies that went public this year already have risen 20% or more. Eight of these stocks hold an IBD Earnings Per Share Rating of 80 or higher. They range from retailer Floor & Decor (FND) and auto shopping site CarGurus (CARG) to Warrior Met Coal (HCC), a coal miner, and Gardner Denver (GDI), an industrial equipment maker.Greg Eisen, senior research analyst and market strategist at Los Angeles-based Singular Research, notes that roughly half of recent IPOs hail from the speculative biotech sector.""Pharmaceuticals and biotech is still one of the largest areas of innovation,"" he said. But note: Many of the newly public companies are working on new medicines and treatments that don't have any significant sales, much less profits.That's true of at least two top IPO stocks this year: Pulse Biosciences (PLSE) and BeiGene (BGNE). Pulse, which is working on devices that use a proprietary ""Nano-Pulse Stimulation"" technology  to attack solid tumors, has no sales. BeiGene, a biopharmaceutical firm registered in the Cayman Islands with operations in Cambridge, Mass., and China, posted just $1.1 million revenue in 2016.So-called clinical- or development-stage companies are risky and demand greater scrutiny, yet they too should be closely watched. One sign to look for: Do top-performing mutual funds own shares of the stock? Better yet, are they showing confidence by adding to their holdings over time? Funds have deeper research and expertise than individual investors. You can judge a fund's performance by its IBD rating; those rated A have performed in the top 15% over the past 36 months and are listed in the IBD Weekly newspaper. (Information on fund ownership of specific stocks can be found on IBD's MarketSmith service.)More IPOs are hitting the market, presenting new opportunities for investors. The first two weeks of November combined for 18 new issues, the most in any two-week period this year and raising nearly $4 billion in proceeds, according to Dealogic.On Nov. 9, Chinese internet content play Sogou (SOGO) had a positive debut, finishing the session at 13.50, up 23% from its IPO price of 11 and raising nearly $500 million before bankers' fees. The company, which has Sohu.com (SOHU) as its controlling stakeholder, notched a 60% jump in third-quarter profit to 8 cents a share on a 55% revenue gain to $257.4 million. Watch to see if it can form an initial base.The same day, Apellis Pharmaceuticals (APLS) priced 10.7 million shares at 14 each. The stock is trading near that IPO price.Year to date through Nov. 13, IPOs listed on U.S. exchanges have totaled 166 companies, together raising $45.5 billion, according to Dealogic. In all of 2016, 111 companies raised a total $24.3 billion in capital. This year's total is also higher than the $36.2 billion raised by 174 firms in 2015, but it's likely to fall well short of the $96 billion raised by 292 companies in 2014.As of Nov. 10, the number of new issues within the past 12 months as a ratio of total companies listed on the NYSE had hit a 12-month peak of 6.1%.But that's well off the five-year high of 11% seen in August 2014. (Track this statistic by going to the Psychological Indicators & Volume link in the Stocks section of the IBD Data Tables.)IBD's TAKE: Using stock charts correctly can help you time your purchases in leading stocks so that you can maximize your gains and minimize losses within a relatively short period of time. Watching for breakouts from key chart patterns during earnings season is especially helpful. In addition to the flat base and the saucer base, the cup with handle stands out as one of the most critical patterns of human psychology; it visualizes investor fear and greed, hope and denial. Learn more about the cup with handle so you can gain an extra edge.Robert Maltbie, president and founder of Singular Research, thinks optimism over new issues is not yet at a boiling point and thus good for the future of U.S. equities.In 2018, ""We could have a snowball effect in an inverse sort of way, in that as the market goes higher, it would extend into the small caps. Plus, if a tax cut occurs, that would only accelerate the issuance of IPOs,"" Maltbie said. The reason? U.S. corporations stand to benefit from Congress' plan to lower taxes sharply to 20%.Singular Research notes that the pipeline for the rest of the year is decent at around 80 potential IPOs. Both Maltbie and Eisen, however, expect upcoming market debutantes to fall within the small-cap range, unlike bigger offerings such as Snap (SNAP), which quickly hit $35 billion in market cap after its March 2 debut but is now valued at $15 billion.Despite the market's strong rebound on Thursday following passage of a massive U.S. tax reform bill in the House of Representatives, some companies have decided to wait before going public.Argentine food producer Molino Canuealas (ticker MOLC, target range of $14 to $17)  filed for registration of American depositary receipt shares on Oct. 27. On Thursday, Renaissance Capital reported that the flour, oil and biscuits giant is postponing its IPO that would offer 19.5 million shares, potentially raising up to $331 million before fees.Specialty silicone and chemical additives play MPM Holdings is also delaying a potential $350 million IPO. The Waterford, N.Y.-based company posted $2.3 billion in 12-month sales through Sept. 30.Late on Thursday, SailPoint Technologies (SAIL) priced its offering of 20 million shares at 12 apiece, raising $240 million. On Friday the Morgan Stanley, Citi and Jefferies-led new issue finished the day at 13.Investors will have a higher likelihood of picking winners if they focus on companies with large year-over-year increases in earnings and sales. Look for companies that have the best pretax and after-tax profit margins in their field.Occasionally, a company with zero earnings can still become a giant winner, particularly if revenue is growing rapidly. It may have other positive attributes, including a well-regarded management team and a Wall Street banker with a proven track record of backing highly successful new stocks. Over the past two decades, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs have successfully brought numerous outstanding companies public.Business software firm Workday (WDAY), a 2012 IPO, comes to mind. In the year the Pleasanton, Calif., firm went public, it racked up $274 million in revenue for fiscal 2013 (ended in January that year) but also lost 56 cents a share.Yet the stock climbed 143% in 14 months. Investors knew Workday founder David Duffy as the man who built PeopleSoft, a former software giant and stock market leader that eventually got acquired. Workday continued to post fast growth, with revenue soaring to $1.57 billion in fiscal 2017. The company also bagged its first net profit, earning 12 cents a share. Wall Street expects earnings to jump 592% to 83 cents in the current fiscal ending in January.Companies with that kind of growth are rare, even in the case of biotechs. Only the best companies have outstanding earnings and sales and show the potential to become as big as an Amgen (AMGN) or Gilead Sciences (GILD).While it may be tempting to buy shares of a promising new company on the first day of trading, it's usually best to wait for the stock to establish a trading range. That can take weeks, but it's time well spent. Why? An investor can, with the help of charts, get a sense of the supply-demand balance.Does the stock peak at, say 20, but seem to find a floor near 16? Such information is useful, especially when an investor uses a chart. If the stock has strong demand, it shouldn't fall below 16. And when the stock rises past 20, an investor can buy shares on the breakout to new highs. That strength suggests institutional investors such as mutual funds, banks, pensions and hedge funds are backing up the truck and desiring large amounts of shares.Technical analysis of IPO stocks is a bit different than for established stocks. IPO-style bases, or stock chart patterns, can form in just three or four weeks. That's much shorter than common bases for established stocks, such as the flat base, which must be a minimum of five weeks in length, or the cup with handle, which must be at least seven weeks long. Look for a proper entry price, which is typically 10 cents above the narrow IPO base's left-side peak, in higher volume, and buy within 5% of that buy point.When luxury goods retailer Michael Kors (KORS) debuted in December 2011 at 20, shares raced higher in less than two weeks to as high as 27.58, then pulled back gently. Over the course of just 11 sessions, Kors dropped to 25.50, pulling back just 7.5% and building a narrow new IPO base.On Jan. 17, 2012, the maker of stylish handbags, watches, sunglasses and high-end apparel shot out of that narrow base, rising nearly 6% and clearing the 27.68 buy point in the fifth-heaviest volume in a single session. That breakout spurred an 83% gain in less than two months. Kors produced another new base, then broke out again near 50 in August the same year. Shares eventually reached as high as 101 in February 2014 before peaking.Patience and chart analysis can keep you from being swept into the euphoria over IPOs in supposedly hot businesses.Money-losing social network Snap is the latest example. The company got plenty of media coverage when it debuted on the NYSE on March 2 at 17 a share.Snap rose with fury in its first two days. But it's mostly fallen since then. On Nov. 8, shares plunged 15% after the Venice, Calif., company reported disappointing third-quarter revenue growth of 62%, far smaller than its than year-over gains of 406%, 286%, 153% and 666% in the prior four quarters.Blue Apron (APRN), a web-based meal kit delivery service that is bleeding red ink despite having $795 million in sales last year, has done even worse. The stock peaked at 11 its first day of trading and now trades around 3.""The quality of IPOs, generally, has declined since the heydays of the '80s and '90s, when small companies viewed going public as a rite of passage — giving them access to the public market and the recognition that being public brought to their company and their brand,"" Bryan Anderson, executive VP and market strategist at Austin-based Beck Capital Management, told IBD. Anderson once worked as a portfolio manager for William O'Neil + Co.""Based on how many of the highly touted IPOs have performed in recent years, it is clear to us that these companies are increasingly going public primarily to provide an exit strategy for their founders and venture-capital backers — leaving crumbs for the public investors,"" Anderson added.

69,GILD,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials rose slightly Tuesday morning after the major averages closed near session lows Monday.XThe top-rated Medical-Biomed/Biotech group fell again. Several leading biotech stocks tested key levels as Biogen (BIIB), Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) are all on tap with earnings this week.S&P 500 futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value. Dow futures climbed 0.3%. Nasdaq 100 futures edged up a fraction.The Nasdaq composite led Monday's retreat, losing 0.6%, while the S&P 500 index fell 0.4% and Dow industrials 0.2%. The Medical-Biomed/Biotech group fell 1.1%, its ninth straight decline after hitting a 22-month high on Oct. 11. Even so, it's still rated No. 1 out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks.Biogen reported better-than-expected earnings Tuesday morning. Amgen and Vertex follow on Wednesday, while Celgene, Alexion and Gilead Sciences report Thursday.In addition to Biogen, a slew of big earnings report Tuesday, including McDonald's (MCD), United Technologies (UTX), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and General Motors (GM) before the open.Biogen earnings rose nearly 21% to $6.31 a share as sales climbed 4% to $3.08 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of $5.70 and revenue of $3.04 billion. Biogen is a leader in multiple sclerosis drugs and it has a new hit with Spinraza, the only spinal muscular atrophy drug on the market. But investors are also bullish on the prospects for aducanumab, which has indicated in early testing that it can reduce cognitive decline in early Alzheimer's patients.Biogen shares rose 1% before the market open on Tuesday. On Monday, the stock fell 2.8% to 328.55 in Monday's stock market trading, their third straight decline, and closed just above the 5% buy zone from a 312.50 entry initially cleared at the end of August.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Amgen, Vertex and Gilead Sciences fell below their 50-day moving averages on Monday. Amgen closed below an old 182.70 buy point for the first time since its Sept. 11 breakout. Amgen, Vertex and Gilead are in new flat bases.Vertex busted out in July on promising data on a new cystic fibrosis drug. Gilead Sciences is best known for its HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C drugs, but last week won FDA approval for its CAR-T drug to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The drug, Yescarta, comes from Gilead's recent acquisition of Kite Pharma.Gilead earnings are expected to fall 24% to $2.08, as hepatitis C drug sales tumble. Amgen EPS is seen up 2% to $3.09. Vertex earnings are expected to go vertical, surging 131% to 37 cents.Celgene shares rose 0.9% on Monday, but that's after tumbling 10.8% on Friday. Celgene scrapped late-stage trials on a Crohn's disease treatment. Wall Street forecasts a 19% EPS gain to $1.88.Alexion retreated 2.75% on Monday, undercutting the low of its short flat base. Alexion dropped below its 50-day moving average on Friday.Alexion earnings are expected to rise 8% to $1.33.One popular way to avoid stock-specific risks in biotech is via ETFs. The iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) fell 1.2% to 327.74, dropping below their 50-day moving average and a 330 buy point cleared at the end of August.RELATED:2 Stocks In Buy Zones With Earnings Due: Investing Action PlanThe Big Picture: Nasdaq Adds 3rd Distribution Day In 4 SessionsBiogen Biomarkers Mark Way To Alzheimer's, Parkinson's TreatmentsCelgene Abandons Crohn's Drug; Could Others Take Its Spot?Does Gilead Now Have A New Multibillion-Dollar Franchise?6 Top Biotech Companies In Innovation Earn Recognition In New Awards

70,GILD,"Celgene (CELG), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Incyte (INCY) are worth watching amid a broader market correction that saw biotech stocks lose a collective 8% over the previous five days, an analyst said Tuesday.X Biotech stocks rebounded 1.9% on the stock market today, after diving 3.5% on Monday.BMO Capital Markets analyst Brian Belski said in a note to clients that investors are reaping what they sowed.""For all intents and purposes, the majority of clients, market pundits and especially an increasingly boisterous set of naysayers, have been predicting the bull market's imminent demise since the day after the 2016 U.S. presidential election,"" he said.But that doesn't mean the bull market is dead, Belski said. RBC analyst Brian Abrahams agreed — and sees some ""opportune entry points"" for certain biotechs stocks with data and/or approvals expected in 2018.Things are looking up for Celgene after a few missteps in the second half of 2017 — including a major miss in sales of psoriatic arthritis drug Otezla in the third quarter, Abrahams said. Sales of that drug rebounded in the fourth quarter.""We believe the market cap reduction more than reflected that, and we believe their fourth-quarter numbers and 2018 guidance point to reassuring stabilization of key U.S. Revlimid and Otezla sales,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: A bull market is a good time review your stock-selling smarts because once it begins to stall out of an uptrend, it's too late to catch up. Head to the Investor's Corner to brush up on stock-selling rules.Cancer drug Revlimid is Celgene's biggest drug. Analysts have worried about generic rivals taking sales starting in 2022. To contend with that, Celgene recently announced its plan to acquire the remainder of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it didn't already own.Adding Juno to its coffers puts Celgene in the CAR-T space where it will compete against Novartis (NVS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) — the latter via its acquisition of Kite Pharma. CAR-T therapies teach the immune system to identify and fight cancer.But even without Juno, Celgene looks poised to generate enough cash flow to buy back virtually its entire enterprise value before Revlimid goes completely generic in 2026, Abrahams said.Outside that, Abrahams sees a number of 2018 catalysts including additional data for Revlimid in treating lymphoma and late-stage data for drug luspatercept, with partner Acceleron Pharma (XLRN), in blood disorders.Celgene rose 2.7% to 96.25 on Tuesday.Abrahams says Vertex was ""a victim of bad timing."" Vertex recently reported strong data for its triple-combination regimens in cystic fibrosis. But the data came out just as the broader markets were beginning to turn and the stock fell hard the past two days. But Vertex rebounded Tuesday, rising 2.7% to 159.27.Strong effectiveness from drugs known as VX-659 and VX-445 in two triple regimens heading into Phase 3 studies support the likelihood that Vertex can expand into a tough-to-treat population of cystic fibrosis patients, he said.It also enables ""multiple additional shots on goal and sets a bar that will be difficult to match or beat — and with significant lead time — likely rendering mid-year competitive data from Galapagos (GLPG) (an overhang on Vertex shares) much less impactful.""He raised his price target on Vertex to 200. The macro weakness is masking improved fundamentals, Abrahams argued.Incyte is set to read out data from a Phase 3 trial known as Echo-301 in the first half of 2018. The study combined Incyte's immuno-oncology drug epacadostat with Dow stock Merck's (MRK) Keytruda in late-stage melanoma.Both drugs belong to a class known as immuno-oncology treatments. Epacadostat works to block interactions involving the IDO enzyme in the immune system. Keytruda is called a PD-1 inhibitor, which has a similar interaction with the PD-L1 protein.Instinet analyst Christopher Marai expects the trial will read out positively and could be similar to a regimen of Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) drugs Opdivo and Yervoy. Bristol is also combining these drugs to treat other cancers, including advanced lung cancer.If so, ""epacadostat could become part of the standard of care in metastatic melanoma with broad adoption augmenting current anti-PD-1 use,"" he said in a note to clients. That could lead to peak worldwide sales north of $1 billion in melanoma alone for epacadostat.But RBC's Abrahams says eventually nearly all the value for epacadostat will soon be gone from Incyte's shares. He sees $65 per share for Jakafi, which treats a bone marrow disorder, and $8 per share for Olumiant, a rheumatoid arthritis drug co-developed with Eli Lilly (LLY).This ""suggests downside if upcoming epacadostat data are negative is now likely only about $10 per share, with fundamental upside now potentially more than 50%,"" he said. This ""makes the upside/downside at these levels that much more interesting.""Incyte advanced 3.3% to 88.11 on Tuesday.RELATED:Allergan Pops On Consensus-Topping Quarter, Strong Migraine TrialThese Biotech Stocks Each Dived More Than 20% — Is The Sell-Off Overdone?Can CRISPR And These 3 Small Biotechs Cure 10,000 Diseases?

71,GILD,"Stocks fell hard Tuesday, then swung into a quick rebound as buyers stepped in to lend chipmakers and other tech stocks a surge of early strength.X The Dow Jones industrial average opened down 2.2%, but showed a 0.3% gain 20 minutes after the open.The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.4% out of the starting gate, then climbed to a 0.4% gain as Apple (AAPL) surged 2% and all of the FANG stock tech leaders reversed early losses into gains.The S&P 500 quickly tightened its opening loss, then rose 0.3%, as chipmakers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Micron Technology (MU) posted powerful early advances.IBD'S TAKE: Don't try to guess where the market is headed next. Read The Big Picture every day to understand the action of the major averages and leading stocks.The global feedback loop of investor confidence darkened abruptly this week, with last week's late losses in the U.S. reverberating through Asia and Europe on Monday, then slamming back into U.S. stocks as investors also factored in the probability of the Federal Reserve rolling out an accelerated rate hike schedule and news of strict sanctions imposed on one of the largest U.S. banks.The result sent all three major U.S. indexes below support at their 50-day moving averages, and the Dow to a record point loss for the day. The loss Monday was the Dow's  worst one-day percentage decline since August 2011.On Tuesday, Japanese investors kept up the selling as Tokyo's Nikkei 225 plunged 4.7%, its worst single-day performance since November 2016. The index had cut below its 50-day moving average in heavy trade Monday. China's markets also took their licks, as Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index buckled 5.1% in its deepest decline since July 2015. The Shanghai Composite's 3.4% tumble was its widest loss since February 2016.The Hang Seng ended 8.6% below its Jan. 29 peak and still holding a 2.3% gain so far this year. The Nikkei closed 10% below its Jan. 23 record, putting it down 5% year-to-date.In Europe, the leading benchmarks in Paris, Frankfurt and London all remained down more than 2% in afternoon trade.Nothing on the economic calendar, which includes the trade balance and the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey from the Labor Department, is likely to put much of a dent in the day's market action. Given the role of the Fed in current market concerns, investors may pay close attention to an 8:50 a.m. ET speech from St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard.Caterpillar (CAT) rose 2.5%, jumping out to an early lead among Dow Jones stocks. Apple and Chevron (CVX) were also up more than 2%.Among IBD 50 stocks, SVB Financial Group (SIVB) shook off its deep premarket declines and rose 1.5% at the start of trade. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based bank dropped below its 10-week line in a weak-volume, 5% loss Monday.Among China-based names, TAL Education (TAL) and Sina (SINA) also shed their premarket slides and rose 0.6% and 2.5%, respectively. TAL has held up well so far versus the volatile market, keeping above its 10-week line of support and within a three-month base pattern. Sina had pulled back more than 8% below a 119.30 cup-base buy point, tripping the automatic sell rule.Chip names were sharply mixed. Skyworks slugged out a 12% opening gain after reporting better-than-forecast fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue. Q2 guidance was below analysts targets, but management announced a $1 billion share buyback initiative. The early jump hauled shares back above support at both the 10-week and 40-week moving averages.Cirrus Logic (CRUS) sloughed off a steep oremarket advance and gained 0.8%, as at least one analyst lowered the stock's price target following a broad fiscal third-quarter revenue and earnings miss. Cirrus is working on its fourth straight weekly decline, ending Monday at its lowest level since July 2016.Electronic components manufacturer Fabrinet (FN) rallied 24% at the open, after its fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue narrowly topped consensus views, although third-quarter guidance was mixed.A busy after hour reporting session is set to include quarterly results from Walt Disney (DIS), Beazer Homes (BZH), Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Akamai Technologies (AKAM), among others.RELATED:Stock Futures Point To Sharp Losses At Tuesday's OpenThe Big Picture: Stocks Slaughtered; More Downside Ahead?

72,GILD,"Generalists are still hanging out on the biotech sidelines, an analyst said Wednesday, but specialist investors are willing to look for ""ideas that could work"" amid coming tax reform.X Biotech stocks ended 2017 up 32%, though sentiment had weakened after approaching a two-year high earlier in the year. IBD's 464-company Biotech industry group is now ranked No. 30 out of 197 groups tracked, but that's down from first 13 weeks ago.""We think investors have yet to digest the potential positive impacts from tax reform on the biotech space,"" Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said in a note to clients. ""Repatriation is a focus, but timing of when this plays out with consolidation leads to caution.""President Donald Trump ended the year by passing sweeping tax reform that includes a cut to the corporate tax rate down to 21% from 35%. The legislation also puts into place new rules allowing companies to bring cash stored overseas back to the U.S. at a cheaper tax rate.""Many companies in our coverage who have low foreign earnings will certainly benefit from taxes on their bottom line,"" Young said.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech chief executives are less experienced today than they were 10 years ago, an analyst said in a recent report, citing that as the reason 2018 won't be a big year for mergers and acquisitions in the space. Head to IBD Industry Themes for the breakdown on why.Among those, she counts Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Biogen (BIIB), Bioverativ (BIVV) and United Therapeutics (UTHR).Outside tax reform, investors are also focused on small- and midsize biotechs as potential takeover targets, Young said. But she noted investors seem to ""remain cautious around playing small and mid-caps as a (mergers and acquisitions) theme.""RELATED:Why These 2 Biotechs Could Outperform Amid 'Hyper-Competition'Does Regeneron Pharma Have A Potential Blockbuster In 2018?Biotech Dives After Analyst Slashes Expectations For Cancer Drug

73,GILD,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) popped Tuesday after it and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) were listed as top biotech stock picks for 2018 amid ""hyper-competition, pricing pressure and uncertain (merger) activity"" likely to dominate the year.X Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges pegs Vertex and Alexion as leaders in 2018 as their rivals struggle with mounting competition and rely on pricing hikes to sustain top-line growth. Both have strong management teams and attractive franchises that could garner takeover interest.""Our analysis leads us to believe that the best performing stocks in the foreseeable future will be those participating in categories with high barriers to entry, that rely on volume growth rather than positive price contribution,"" he said in a note to clients.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Alexion climbed 3.7% to finish at 124.05. Vertex rose 2% to finish at 152.90. Vertex shares ended 2017 up 103% with Alexion down 2%. Meanwhile, the broader biotech group wrapped the year up 32%.Vertex was the second best performer of the top 10 biotechs by market cap, easily leading Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG) which ended the year up a respective 19%, flat and down 10%. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) led the top 10, rocketing 239%.Vertex has monopolized the cystic fibrosis category with drugs known as Kalydeco and Orkambi, Porges said. Its nearest competitor, Galapagos (GLPG), is at a time disadvantage and its products haven't shown the same effectiveness as Vertex's.""Despite the lucrative commercial opportunity that cystic fibrosis presents, the high barriers to entry in this therapeutic indication have precluded the emergence of a clear, viable threat to Vertex's cystic fibrosis franchise,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: The median tenure of chief executives at large-cap biotechs fell to just one year in 2017, plunging from 11 years in 2007. That could have an impact on mergers and acquisitions in 2018, an analyst said last week. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.In the first quarter, Vertex is likely to gain approval for a combination of drugs known as tezacaftor and ivacaftor to treat some cystic fibrosis patients. This should gain traction among patients who discontinued treatment with Orkambi due to tolerability.This year will also be key for Vertex's triple-pill regimen to treat cystic fibrosis, he said. Vertex is planning to begin pivotal trials in the first half of 2018. Most analysts expect a triple-pill to gain approval in 2019-'20.Alexion, meanwhile, has seen 20% revenue growth for a drug known as Soliris over the past two years as a treatment for a pair of blood disorders. This increase in sales was mostly due to volume increases with little price contribution, Porges said.In October, the Food and Drug Administration approved Soliris to treat a muscle disease, which should help continue the sales trend, he said. Alexion is also working on a follow-on drug known as ALXN1210 with a favorable dosing schedule and potentially better effectiveness.Porges expect ALXN1210 to prove superior to Soliris in treating a blood disease known as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in Phase 3 testing. That should result in high conversion rates to ALXN1210 from Soliris when it's likely approved in 2019.""This catalyst should also extend the terminal cash flow horizon for Alexion's key franchise from mid-2020s to the mid-2030s, when patents for ALXN1210 expire,"" he said.Further, Alexion said late Tuesday its board of directors agreed to work with activist investor Elliott Management to identify a new board member. In November, Alexion said it had a search underway to fill an open board seat and is looking for candidates from a range of backgrounds, skills and expertise.RELATED:Q&A: Vertex Chief Talks About Company's 'Transformational Year'Why Biotech Stocks May Wait A While Before Feeling The LoveWhy This Biotech Could See 30% Upside In The Second Quarter

76,GILD,"Loxo Oncology's (LOXO) deal with Bayer (BAYRY) had a bigger impact on the biotech sector than you'd expect, an industry observer told Investor's Business Daily on Tuesday as key exchange traded funds fell out of flat bases.XEarly Tuesday, Loxo announced a deal with Bayer to co-develop two of its cancer drugs in an agreement that could pay Loxo up to $1.55 billion. Under the terms of the deal, Loxo and Bayer will split profits equally on drugs known as larotrectinib and LOXO-195 in the U.S.But the sector was hoping for an outright buyout, said Brad Loncar, portfolio manager for Loncar Investments, in an interview with IBD. The Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR) toppled alongside its fellow ETF peers, falling 3.4% to 23.30.""(Loxo) has been one of, if not the, most successful small biotech companies this year,"" he said. ""Some people were hoping for an outright buyout, and even if they weren't hoping for a buyout they gave pretty clear guidance they were going to hold on to those rights.""Loxo stock was up 159% for the year as of Monday's close, easily outperforming IBD's 458-company biotech industry group, which has climbed 25% year to date. On the stock market today, Loxo toppled 4.1% to close at 79.84, though shares were down as much as 12.8% earlier in the day.Collectively, the biotech group dove 2.6% and neared a three-month low after hitting its highest point since December 2015 in October. But the third-quarter earnings season was rough for a number of players like Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), which weighed heavily on the group.Biotech-centric ETFs also took pitfalls. The S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) fell out of its flat base with a buy point at 89.08, diving 2%. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) had been forming a flat base with an entry at 342.60, but fell 1.6%. ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (BIB) dove 3.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Loxo has an IBD Composite Rating of 51 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs in the middle of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated players in the biotech group.Loncar says mergers and acquisitions could really help the biotech group.""If (Loxo) had been bought out today, everybody would be saying, 'What's the next smaller company that's going to be bought out?' and they would probably be bidding up all of the stocks,"" he said.The fact Loxo was willing to give away 50% of its profits on these two drugs, both of which work to target gene fusions in cancer, suggests the biotech's negotiating was a bit weaker than expected, Loncar said. This ""revaluation"" is hurting the sector.He puts Tesaro (TSRO) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) into the same bucket. Both have approved drugs, known as PARP inhibitors, that target ovarian cancer. Loxo's larotrectinib isn't yet approved.Big pharmas, which struggled in the quarter, need to buy revenue growth, Loncar says. But it's possible ""the market (has) pushed their valuations so high that an outright buyout doesn't make sense"" for the likes of Loxo, Tesaro and Clovis, he added.The biotech industry group is now ranked No. 19 out of 197 groups tracked by IBD, down from first just a month ago. Gilead's acquisition of Kite Pharma — announced in August and completed in October — helped spike the group to a nearly two-year high.Since then, the group has pulled back. Investors either reacted harshly or surprisingly to news out of the group, Loncar said. Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX) dove nearly 41% on Nov. 7 after unveiling the abstracts for its immuno-oncology combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) for pancreatic cancer.Overall, 13% of patients responded to the combination of Five Prime's cabiralizumab and Bristol's Opdivo. Pancreatic cancer is particularly hard to treat. Typically, doctors would have expected no response from the combination. Now, the duo has time to refine its treatment regimen.""We Wall Street people demand instant gratification and instant success out of drugs,"" Loncar said. ""It would be disappointing if this was a big Phase 3 trial at the end of the road. But this is literally the first in-human trial.""Dynavax Technologies (DVAX) also has suffered following the Food and Drug Administration's approval of its drug dubbed Heplisav-B to treat hepatitis B. The stock fell 9.4% on Monday. Loncar says investors are looking for Dynavax to either be bought or find a partner.""I think they probably will find a deal like that,"" he said. ""But you can't expect it literally the day after the approval. So between now and the first quarter when they're actually launching the drug, I think there's a chance for some good news there.""He added: ""A lot of investors expected a big pop, and as soon as there wasn't they ran for the exits. I don't think that's reflective of the quality of the company.""RELATED:This Biotech Just Neared A 17-Year High On Strong Cancer RegimenWhy Tesaro's $2 Million Cancer-Drug Miss Prompted Its Rivals To ToppleThis Biotech Just Rose By A Third On Its Earnings — But Is It In Trouble?

77,GILD,"Biotech stocks collectively inched down Monday after President Donald Trump reiterated his concerns that U.S. drug prices are ""out of control"" during a Cabinet meeting, according to a number of reports.XThe president wants to bring U.S. drug prices in line with those in other countries, which tend to be lower, Bloomberg reported.""The same exact drug by the same exact company, made in the same exact box and sold someplace else, sometimes it's a fraction of what we pay in this country,"" he said. ""Meaning, as usual, the world is taking advantage of the United States.""Trump's comments come amid the rising likelihood he will enact an executive order to tug down drug prices in the U.S., Needham analysts Kevin Caliendo and Alan Carr wrote in a report Monday. They cited commentary from a Washington, D.C.-area health care policy watcher.The expert, cited by Needham, says an executive order regarding drug prices could come ""any day."" A proposed order was released in May but never signed and remains the blueprint, the analysts wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Medical tech stocks have been a safe haven in 2017 as investors keep their distance from pharma, analysts say. The group is trending near record highs as the economy improves, allowing patients to get ""pseudo-deferrable"" procedures. Head to the Industry Snapshot for more on what that means for the group.Lower drug prices would benefit customers, but cut into profits for drugmakers and biotechs. Drugs treating rarer diseases tend to cost more as companies aim to recoup the costs associated with lengthy and numerous clinical trials.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, biotech stocks dipped 0.4%. Top biotechs Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) fell 1% and 1.6%, respectively. Amgen (AMGN) dipped less than 1%. Biogen remains extended from a buy point. Gilead is trying to find support at its 50-day moving average while Amgen undercut a buy point.Trump has been outspoken on bringing down drug prices since before he was sworn in as president. In December he said he doesn't ""like what has happened with drug prices.""Following his inauguration, Trump called the drug industry ""disastrous"" and accused firms of ""getting away with murder"" based on how they price medicines.

78,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) jumped early Thursday after the Food and Drug Administration approved what is known as a CAR-T drug, dubbed Yescarta, to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.XThe late Wednesday approval follows two weeks after Gilead closed its acquisition of Kite Pharma, which developed the drug, and after Novartis' (NVS) CAR-T drug was approved in late August, making it the first of its class to win approval.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Gilead climbed 2% to close at 81.59. Shares are currently forming a flat base with an 86.36 entry.CAR-T drugs are made using a patient's own immune cells. The cells are extracted, reprogrammed to fight cancer and are then reintroduced to the patient's body. Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) are also working on CAR-T drugs in partnerships with Celgene (CELG).Gilead's drug is approved to treat adult patients with what's known as large B-cell lymphoma after two or more previous treatments.

Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown.There are an estimated 7,500 patients with hard-to-treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma eligible for CAR-T therapy, Gilead says. The FDA estimates that of 72,000 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed each year, roughly 25,000 are new cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.Yescarta is ""a new option for patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma who have run out of treatment options and face a dire prognosis,"" said Louis DeGennaro, chief executive of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, in a statement.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams says Gilead is at the beginning of what could be a ""potential multibillion-dollar franchise."" The approval came a month ahead of expectations, demonstrating the high unmet need in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, he said in a note to clients.Gilead is pricing Yescarta at $373,000, which is below the $475,000 price tag for Novartis' drug, Kymriah. Kymriah was approved in late August to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients age 25 and younger.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges, though, notes that Novartis is taking an outcome-based approach to pricing with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in which the firm will only be paid for patients who respond within one month of treatment with Kymriah.""Based on the 83% response rate in their pivotal trial, we estimate the real list price to be less than $394,000 per treatment, placing Yescarta at a less than 5% discount to Novartis' drug on a net price basis,"" he wrote in a note to clients.RBC's Abrahams estimates that Gilead will pull in $90 million in 2018 on a gradual launch. He expects Yescarta sales to grow to at least $1 billion by 2026 solely as a third treatment in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. But CAR-T drugs are being investigated to treat a myriad of blood cancers.""If we increase pricing and assumed approval in all indications (second treatment diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, pediatric and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia), in our current model, we could see $2.7 billion in peak revenue potential,"" he said.Leerink's Porges is less bullish on Gilead. Yescarta's list price is higher than he expected, but Gilead's core business is still facing competitive challenges and patent expiries. He kept his market perform rating on the stock.Getting the most out of its Kite acquisition will require expanding Yescarta's use, Porges said.""The announcement does not provide the justification for the premium Gilead paid for Kite's cellular therapy platform,"" he said. ""Gilead is depending on broadening to earlier lines of treatment, expanding to other indications and development of additional products to generate an adequate return on the acquisition.""The label for Yescarta warns of cytokine release syndrome and neurological toxicities. The former is associated with flulike symptoms including fever. Cytokine release syndrome was seen in 94% of patients in clinical trials, with more-severe cases in 13% of patients.In comparison, the label for Novartis' Kymriah notes that the more-severe cytokine release syndrome occurred in 49% of patients, Porges said.Due to the potential for cytokine release syndrome and neurological toxicities, Yescarta is available only through a restricted program called a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy. This means facilities administering the drug must be certified and abide by specific rules for administration.The program requires that two doses of an immunosuppressive drug be available prior to Yescarta infusion. Patients must be monitored at a facility for a week following treatment for signs of cytokine release syndrome. Follow-up monitoring is required for four weeks after infusion.Ultimately, Gilead plans to have 70 to 90 U.S. medical centers capable of administering Yescarta. The drug has a median turnaround time of 17 days and a 99% manufacturing-success rate from a facility in El Segundo, Calif, Gilead said.RELATED:6 Top Biotech Companies In Innovation Earn Recognition In New AwardsHow Novartis' Cancer Approval Validates Gilead's $11.9 Billion Kite DealAnalysts Mixed On Gilead-Kite, But One Key Rival Stands To Benefit

79,GILD,"Despite the sell-off in health stocks Tuesday, a joint venture by Amazon.com (AMZN), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to wring out cost savings from the health care system appears very unlikely to impact industry earnings over the next couple of years, according to analysts.X Figuring out how to rein in health costs without the participation of big health care players looks like a near-impossible task, Needham analyst Kevin Caliendo said. ""We note that the cost to implement systems, adjudicate patient data, and partner with hospitals, doctors, pharmacies on a national basis is onerous.""Caliendo adds that the scale of the big three new partners wouldn't be big enough to squeeze discounts out of providers by steering patients their way, compared to the purchasing power of UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS)-Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM). ""The new company will have to align itself with all these other providers in some way to provide the best care for its employees,"" Caliendo concludes.In fact, Caliendo gave CVS a big vote of confidence earlier Tuesday, saying its planned combination with Aetna positions it to create savings for the government and private employers. Needham raised its rating on CVS to strong buy with a 100 target.Caliendo does think that ""profits in the industry, especially at the underwriting level, are excessive,"" and there are improvements to the current care delivery model that can be made. He sees that as a prime reason behind the CVS-Aetna deal.CVS is looking to shift more health care services to the lowest-cost location: its in-store clinics. That's a different take on UnitedHealth's playbook of expanding into urgent care and other outpatient locales to drive savings for customers.But no such path forward was evident in the announcement from Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire. The plan to establish an independent company ""is in its early planning stages,"" according to a statement by the trio.""Our group does not come to this problem with answers,"" acknowledged Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett.""Success is going to require talented experts, a beginner's mind, and a long-term orientation,"" said Amazon's Jeff Bezos. Yet it's unclear at this point who any of those talented experts will be.As Wall Street weighed the long-term nature of the effort and the dearth of substantive details, the initial shock wave that rippled across Wall Street subsided. Shares of Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth, the nation's largest insurer, sank 4.35% to 236.65 on the stock market today, after diving as much as 6.2% earlier. CVS Health, which is in the process of buying Aetna, pared losses to a 4.1% drop.Drug distributors Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK) were down 1.8% and 2.6%, respectively. Prescription benefit management firm Express Scripts (ESRX) sank 3.2%, but had tumbled 11.4% earlier. Both CVS and UnitedHealth also operate PBMs, which manage the prescription side of health insurance contracts.Pharmaceuticals and biotech stocks also lost ground, though the hit didn't look much worse than the broader market downdraft on Tuesday. Merck (MRK) shed 1.6%, Allergan (AGN) 1.6% and Gilead Sciences (GILD) 1.7% Pfizer (PFE) lost 3.1% despite topping earnings views and offering bullish guidance.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth is ranked No. 2 by IBD in the Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see the leaders in each category. Insurers have been solid performers, ranked No. 43 out of 197 groups. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks in leading groups that break above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.The knee-jerk reaction among investors is surely a reflection of the unsustainably high cost of health care in the U.S., and the fact that Amazon, which has been itching to disrupt the retail prescription business, is attached to the effort.Traditionally, the fear among health care investors has been that government — not the private sector — will impose cost controls to get a handle on runaway budget deficits, thinning out industry profits in the process. Medicare negotiating drug costs is one such fear, but industry experts say that the government is unlikely to produce much in the way of savings unless it is willing to deny patients access to certain drugs, which could create a political backlash.But Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire aren't the first big employers to join forces to attack health costs. Leerink analyst Ana Gupte noted on Tuesday that the Health Transformation Alliance, a group of 46 large self-insured employers that launched last year, also hopes to find savings and improve employee satisfaction, though it's working with CVS and UnitedHealth to achieve its aims. Initial reports indicated that alliance members expected to save a combined $600 million in prescription costs over three years.Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire say their initial focus will be on ""technology solutions that will provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost."" The new corporate entity, they say, will be ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints.""Just what form those technology solutions would take is far from clear. Caliendo supposes that ""Berkshire might bring some underwriting skills (although they've never underwritten healthcare) and AMZN might make pharmacy and medical procurement contributions and provide IT expertise.""Leerkink's Gupte says she's unclear whether Amazon wading deeper into solving the health care mess will accelerate its move into the supply chain of the prescription industry.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why Trump's State Of The Union Might Move Markets Up — Or DownStocks Fall As Market Shows 3 Signs It May Be Ready For A BreakGrubhub, Redhat Lead These Three IBD 50 Stocks In Buy RangeHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

Netflix (NFLX) skyrocketed on blowout subscriber growth and a bullish outlook. Celgene (CELG) will buy Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). Intel (INTC) surged on its earnings and outlook, while Texas Instruments (TXN) and some other top chips failed to impress with their quarterly financials, but Apple (AAPL) continued to lag amid a growing chorus of concerns regarding iPhone X sales and production. Airline stocks plunged as United Airlines (UAL) said it would expand rapidly, setting the stage for a renewed price war.X The S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq all rallied solidly to hit fresh record highs as earnings season heated up. The falling dollar, which has acted as a tailwind for U.S. multinationals' stocks and profits, rebounded from three-year lows Thursday as President Trump said he expects a stronger greenback. Netflix (NFLX) was a big earnings winner. Intel (INTC) also did while after Texas Instruments (TXN) and Lam Research (LRCX) were among several leading chip stocks to struggle on earnings. Airline stocks plunged on United Airlines (UAL) while Apple (AAPL) and iPhone-related stocks sold off as several analysts cited evidence of weaker iPhone X demand.Shares rocketed to record highs as Netflix (NFLX) added 8.33 million streaming subscribers worldwide, crushing its fourth-quarter target of 6.3 million. The Internet TV streaming giant ended 2017 with 117.58 million total streaming subscribers, with one analyst predicting 200 million Netflix subscribers in 2020. The gains came despite Netflix implementing price hikes to its service plans in the U.S. and Europe. Netflix credited hit original content such as TV series ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" and movies like ""Bright"" for its subscriber gains in the period. For the March quarter, Netflix is predicting it will add 6.35 million net new subscribers.Chipmakers Intel (INTC), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) beat their December-quarter targets, but got mixed reviews from investors. Texas Instruments (TXN) posted in-line results and its shares were punished. The sector continues to wrestle with concerns that the chip cycle has ebbed. Top chip-gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) beat views, but sold off on the news. Meanwhile, Xilinx joined Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) in benefiting from the sale of high-performance chips for mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.RELATED:Intel Beats Fourth-Quarter Targets, Offers Cheery 2018 OutlookBiotech mergers heated up with Celgene (CELG) agreeing to pay $9 billion for the 90% of CAR-T drug developer Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it didn't already own while Sanofi (SNY) reached a deal with Biogen (BIIB) hemophilia spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) for $11.6 billion. Celgene's acquisition comes as it prepares to lose exclusivity for cancer drug Revlimid in 2022. Juno rivals Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in making CAR-T drugs to treat blood cancers. Sanofi's deal follows two failed mergers in 2016 and 2017.Early Wednesday, Novartis (NVS) reported core earnings of $1.21 per share on $12.92 billion in sales, up a respective 6% and 2% on a constant-currency basis, and easily beating the consensus. On Thursday, Biogen (BIIB) reported sales grew 15% to $3.31 billion and topped the consensus. Adjusted earnings grew 4% but were short. Also Thursday, Celgene beat lowered analyst views. AbbVie (ABBV), on Friday, topped expectations with adjusted profit up 23% and sales climbing 14% to $7.74 billion in sales.United Airlines (UAL) sent airline stocks into a tailspin after the carrier told analysts that it planned to expand flight coverage through 2020. Investors fear the move, done in part to regain relevance in the smaller cities United once abandoned, risks more competition and cheaper fares, helping passengers but threatening profits. American Airlines (AAL), during its Q4 earnings call, signaled that it wouldn't change its profit and growth targets based on United's ambitions — for now. Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK) also reported.General Electric (GE) missed on earnings and disclosed an SEC probe, though core units did well and GE kept its 2018 outlook. Three industrial members of the Dow industrials, Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX), reported strong earnings and guidance. Insurer Travelers (TRV) and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also beat on earnings views. Verizon (VZ) missed on EPS but topped on revenue. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) topped views, but fell on a patent ruling vs. its blockbuster arthritis fighter Remicade.President Trump slapped tariffs of up to 50% on imported large washing machines and parts, and up to 30% on solar panels. The tax on washing machines decreases and then expires after three years, while the duty on solar cells and modules phases out after four years. Solar technology providers Suniva and SolarWorld charged that China was providing unfair subsidies and financing to its solar producers. Whirlpool (WHR) complained that Korean makers were dumping washing machines in the U.S. at excessively low prices.Whirlpool, which also reported quarterly earnings, rallied 11%.

But shares fell nearly 6% as markets priced in the possibility that GE would fully spin off the business.Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped Q4 profit forecasts, though Raytheon and General Dynamics missed on revenue. Northrop gave strong 2018 guidance and lifted its dividend. Raytheon and GD said orders and backlog were strong. All three defense firms surged to record highs. Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) report next week.Steel Dynamics (STLD) earnings rose 26%, topping views modestly, as sales climbed 22% to $2.34 billion. The No. 1-ranked company in IBD's Steel-Producers industry group said 2018 is shaping up to be a good year, thanks to more moderate inventory levels, improvement in global demand and pricing, and incremental investment driven by tax cuts. Specialty steel producer Allegheny Technologies (ATI) nearly doubled profit estimates. Revenue grew 14% to $910 million, fueled by its high-performance materials for jet engines. Freeport McMoRan (FCX) benefited from higher copper prices, boosting Q4 earnings by 104%, ahead of estimates. Revenue grew 15% to $5.0 billion. Negotiations with Indonesia about ownership of its massive Grasberg mine are progressing but haven't erased uncertainty about the company's outlook.Casino operators Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) both put up Q4 results that beat on the top and bottom line, helped by the rebound in Macau, the world's largest gaming market. Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson cited an acceleration in the mass gaming market in the Chinese administrative region, the only area of the nation where gambling is legal. But Wynn shares plunged Friday, erasing nearly all its weekly gains, on a report of allegations of serious sexual misconduct by CEO Steve Wynn.Ford Motor (F) saw EPS climb 30% to 39 cents as revenue grew 15% to $41.3 billion.

84,GILD,"Kite Pharma is edging closer to approval for a cutting-edge cancer treatment that fights the disease by rebuilding a patient's own cells — a technology that could benefit thousands of people and pave the way for blockbuster drugs.XKite's ultracustomized treatment is a key entry in an area of great promise in cancer research and has attracted about a dozen drugmakers, including Bluebird Bio (BLUE), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), Celgene (CELG) and Novartis (NVS). The latter got a major FDA approval in August, giving Novartis the lead in this emerging field.Those firms and others are developing their own cancer-fighting systems that harness the same underlying process used by Kite, which is now a unit of Gilead Sciences (GILD). The approach, called CAR-T therapy, uses bioengineering to retrain a patient's infection-fighting white blood cells to seek out and destroy cancer cells.Analysts say Kite's manufacturing process stands out in the CAR-T field for its shorter turnaround time to treatment and success rate.For Kite's groundbreaking work, Investor's Business Daily named the company an IBD Biotech Innovator in the inaugural edition of the awards.How IBD Chose The Biotech Innovator Award Winners: IBD asked equity analysts, ETF and mutual fund managers and university professors to identify the top biotech companies based on their innovative research. We asked them to focus on companies with pioneering drugs likely to launch in the next several years and reach blockbuster, or near-blockbuster, sales of $1 billion or more a year. The award winners selected by IBD editors are the six most-cited companies. To find profiles of all the award winners and details of their work, go to our full Biotech Innovators special report.)David Chang, Kite's chief medical officer, told IBD that current cell therapies are ""just the beginning … . This is an area that's really set up to undergo big changes over the next few years.And Kite has recently enlisted a powerful ally.In late August, Gilead of Foster City, Calif., agreed to acquire Santa Monica, Calif.-based Kite for $180 a share in an all-cash deal valued at $11.9 billion. The deal closed Oct. 3. Kite already was trading at all-time highs, near 140, since the start of summer, after going public at $17 a share in mid-2014. Gilead stock rose above 86 from about 75 after the companies announced their merger, but closed Friday at 81.17.The alliance brings Kite an established partner with financial heft and industry breadth just as the biotech ingenue prepares to beef up production and distribution of its flagship drug.That treatment — axi-cel, short for axicabtagene ciloleucel — is designed to fight an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer affecting the immune system that is the sixth most common cancer in the U.S. Kite is expected to get drug approval this year.Gilead is hitching its star to Kite with expectations of gaining a string of successful cancer-fighting products at a time when Gilead's strongest portfolio of medications, for treating hepatitis C, is losing steam.Kite expects the manufacturing process it honed to develop axi-cel will serve as the foundation for future treatments, including those to destroy solid cancer tumors and cancers of the cervix, head and neck.Pharmaceutical companies typically look to fill out their product pipelines by acquiring companies with a technology they don't have. That's where Gilead's purchase of Kite comes in.""It wasn't just a 'one and done' kind of an acquisition. … It was more of a long-term play with multiple product opportunities, and we could see this playing out for decades to come,"" Gilead CEO John Milligan said on a conference call with analysts following the purchase announcement.Even with sales of its hepatitis C products crimped, revenue is growing from Gilead's HIV/AIDS drugs. The company is expected to end the year with revenue of $24 billion to $25.5 billion, down from $30.4 billion last year.Gilead is the No. 3 company by market cap among the 453 companies in IBD's biotechnology industry group, trailing leader Amgen (AMGN) and just behind Celgene.Gilead has ""a substantial balance sheet where they could help fund the launch (of Kite products) in Europe, help expand Kite's manufacturing capacity beyond its facility in El Segundo (Calif.) and help propel other early-stage projects forward,"" Jefferies analyst Biren Amin told IBD.In return, Amin said, Gilead gets ""an early- to midstage oncology pipeline, which they didn't have. Kite allows them to diversify away from hepatitis C longer term.""Kite isn't saying how much it will charge for its treatment until the product is approved, but Amin said analysts estimate costs will range from $250,000 to $300,000 for one person's full course of the therapy. The company has built the capacity to produce between 4,000 and 5,000 patient therapies a year, Kite spokeswoman Christine Cassiano said.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to make a decision on Kite's axi-cel drug by Nov. 29. Kite hasn't disclosed a brand name for the drug.If that timeline holds, Kite's drug could reach blockbuster status — annual sales of $1 billion or more — in 2020, according to Amin.Kite won't be the first biotech company to receive FDA approval for a CAR-T drug. Novartis got the green light from the FDA on Aug. 30 for its therapy for certain types of leukemia in children and young adults.If Kite's axi-cel drug is approved by the FDA, it will become the first therapy of its kind to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients with advanced cases of the disease. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of blood cancer that originates in the immune system.The therapy involves extracting and filtering a patient's blood to remove key components of the immune system called T cells, and engineering those cells in the lab so they express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that is programmed to escort intruder-destroying T cells directly to proteins found on the surface of cancer cells. These modified T cells are infused back into the patient, where they multiply and become the body's cancer fighters.Researchers affiliated with the National Institutes of Health developed the early science that underpins the process and, in 2012, licensed it to Kite. Kite is one of about a dozen biotech firms that have received permission to use the agency's version of the technology, according to Amin.Kite's study found that about eight months after a single infusion of their treatment was administered, 39% of patients with advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma for whom chemotherapy no longer worked were in complete remission, with no sign of malignancy.""There's no rocket science there,"" said Kite's Chang about the company's multistep manufacturing process, which he said takes 17 days ""vein to vein."" That, he says, is the shortest turnaround time among companies trying to develop their own versions of a CAR-T drug.There is an art to the manufacturing process, and observers say Kite's deft approach and high success rate in its clinical trials has set the company apart.""One thing we paid a lot of attention to was making sure that every manufacturing was as successful so that there is a cell product to be given back to the patient,"" Chang said. ""We were able to treat everybody who enrolled in our clinical study, with the exception of a single patient. That's one out of 111 patients — or less than 1% — who was not able to be treated.""Kite aims to automate more of the drug development process as part of a collaboration with General Electric (GE) offshoot GE Global Research. The initiative could help Kite reduce manufacturing costs, speed up processing time and minimize variability in the results. Kite also is researching ways to change how the cells are manipulated with growth factors to make the supercharged cells more effective once they are returned to the patient, Chang said.The company is investigating how to equip a person's cells so they are able to ""go after"" more than just one type of cancer, he said. Kite is even looking to develop an ""off the shelf"" CAR-T product that could be used by any patient, he says.""When we talk about innovation, it's about execution as well as making the right choices, hopefully, to guide on your programs,"" said analyst Amin. ""They're doing that.""RELATED:Besides Kite Pharma, Which Companies Rose To IBD Biotech Innovators Status?Get The Details On All 6 Biotech Innovator Award-Winning Companies And Their WorkBluebird Is Among The Biotech Stocks Near New HighsWhy Biotech Stocks Had A Catch-Up RallyWill Novartis Acquire This Company?

87,GILD,"Cure is a strong word when it comes to treating cancer and other deadly diseases, but Brad Loncar is among the biotech stock analysts and investors ready to employ the term.X""For the first time, biotech companies are not thinking about these technologies incrementally,"" said Loncar, portfolio manager of a biotech-focused ETF. ""They're not thinking about alleviating the symptoms of the disease, they're thinking about fixing the genetic mutations that cause the disease.""Loncar was speaking of cancer, but those comments could apply to other terrible diseases that claim thousands of lives, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Lou Gehrig's disease, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy.Thirty-five years after the first FDA-approved biotech drug, the biotech industry is rolling out innovations at a breakneck pace. The new-drug pipeline is bursting with treatments in clinical trials, the industry is growing by leaps and bounds, and many biotech stocks are scoring superior returns for investors.To recognize the biotechnology industry's contributions to science and to patients' health, Investor's Business Daily has created the IBD Biotech Innovator Awards. In this inaugural edition, we name six award-winning U.S. biotech companies, chosen for their groundbreaking treatments recently introduced to the market or well along in the new-product pipeline.The six companies are Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Kite Pharma, Incyte (INCY) and Loxo Oncology (LOXO). The winners aren't ranked in any way; only companies with U.S.-traded shares were considered.All but Biogen have their sights firmly on curing cancer, among other intractable diseases. Biogen is targeting the likes of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and MS.How IBD Chose The Biotech Innovator Award Winners: IBD asked equity analysts, ETF and mutual fund managers and university professors to identify the top biotech companies based on their innovative research. We asked them to focus on companies with pioneering drugs likely to launch in the next several years and reach blockbuster, or near-blockbuster, sales of $1 billion or more a year. The award winners selected by IBD editors are the six most-cited companies. To find profiles of all the award winners and details of their work, go to our full Biotech Innovators special report.)The six companies are just a few of the players in a huge field closely tracked by investors. IBD counts 453 publicly traded companies in its biotech industry group, which doesn't include the many other companies with biotech operations that aren't their main focus. The 453 have a combined market cap of nearly $900 billion and sales for the most recent 12 months of more than $100 billion.Thanks to the biotech industry, the pipeline of new drugs of all kinds has exploded. Clinicaltrials.org counts more than 1,480 drugs filed for Phase 3, or late-stage, trials with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this year, and the FDA has more than 32,000 late-stage studies registered.IBD's biotech industry stock group has climbed 33% this year, shucking off the pains of the politically charged election season in 2016 and concerns that President Trump will work to lower drug prices. The group on Wednesday hit a 22-month high of 3,128 but is down from its all-time high near 3,900 in July 2015. It currently ranks No. 1 of the 197 groups tracked by IBD in terms of performance in the past six months.Boosting the group's performance are Celgene and Loxo, which recently hit new highs. Incyte touched a record high this year, while Biogen touched a 27-month high on Friday and Regeneron this year touched a nearly two-year high.The biotech-focused fund that Brad Loncar heads up is Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR), which tracks 30 biotechs working in immunotherapy. The exchange traded fund is nearing its two-year anniversary and is up 26% this year. His comments to IBD came amid a series of regulatory approvals and acquisitions in cancer treatment, including Gilead Sciences' (GILD) foray into cellular therapy with its August agreement to acquire Kite for nearly $12 billion. (The Kite purchase was completed Oct. 3 and Kite now operates as a wholly owned Gilead unit.)Count Loncar among the bullish. Today, drugs can teach the immune system to identify, fight and precisely target cancerous cells. Technology can turn off or edit genes to correct genetic conditions.Some trial data are ""jaw-dropping,"" he said. One example is CAR-T technology, in which Kite is among the leaders. The field is young, but biotech companies ""are taking patients who have weeks or months to live and, in some cases, are seeing complete remissions,"" Loncar said. ""I've never seen anything like that.""Loncar likens chemotherapy to a bomb — it kills the enemy and everything else in sight. Loxo is using smart bombs. Its precision medicine targets gene fusions in cancer, JMP Securities analyst Mike King explains.In cancer, some genes are called passengers and others drivers, King told IBD. When a driver becomes fused to a normal cell, that normal cell transforms into a cancerous one. Loxo identifies and targets those fusions.At the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in June, Loxo showed the impact of its work with a photo of a sarcoma protruding from a child's chest, King says. By targeting what's called the TRK fusion, Loxo was able to treat the cancer.The tumor ""shrunk away to nothing without surgery or radiation or any other therapy contributing to it,"" he said. ""It was remarkable. It was pretty staggering even for people in the audience who are kind of used to seeing these kind of things.""Among 50 patients, the drug dubbed larotrectinib was able to partly shrink tumors in 64% of them, with all signs of cancer disappearing in 12% of patients. The drug has breakthrough, rare pediatric disease and orphan drug designations with the FDA.Also grabbing headlines is immuno-oncology work from Dow component Merck (MRK) as well as Incyte, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Roche (RHHBY) and AstraZeneca (AZN). Besides Kite, CAR-T therapy is getting its due from the likes of Novartis (NVS), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE).Immuno-oncology and CAR-T are both methods of teaching the immune system to fight cancer. Immuno-oncology drugs do so by blocking specific interactions that would otherwise prevent an immune response. CAR-T drugs individualize that process by reprogramming a patient's own extracted immune cells.IBD'S TAKE: CAR-T drugs are snagging major attention after Gilead announced its plan to acquire Kite and Novartis got a major drug approval, opening up the sector for commercialization. Head to the IBD's Industry Snapshot feature for a closer look at the emerging CAR-T sector.Results have impressed, and immuno-oncology drugmakers are taking it a step further by combining their compounds in the hopes of seeing more robust responses. Merck has had success with its drug Keytruda, which has won approval as a first treatment with chemo in lung cancer.Incyte drug epacadostat is particularly intriguing, analysts say. It prevents some interactions involving the IDO enzyme. Merck and Bristol are pairing their drugs Keytruda and Opdivo — both belong to a class of drugs known as PD-1 inhibitors — with Incyte's epacadostat.Regeneron, too, is working on a PD-1 inhibitor, with its REGN2810. It's developing this in partnership with Sanofi (SNY). In June, Regeneron and Sanofi said 46.2% of patients with a form of skin cancer responded to treatment with REGN2810 in a Phase 1 trial.On the CAR-T side, Novartis gained FDA approval in late August for a drug to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25. Its approval helped spike Gilead, which just two days before had announced its deal to acquire Kite.Kite is nearing approval for a CAR-T drug to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Juno is just behind with its drug called JCAR017, which would treat the same cancer as Kite's drug. Bluebird is working on a multiple myeloma drug.Juno and Bluebird both have partnered with Celgene on their programs. JMP's King calls it a ""best-in-breed"" approach, where Celgene will put its money on the line for potential innovation.Such partnerships are where Celgene excels, Wedbush analyst David Nierengarten told IBD.  ""They've had these innovative deals across sectors, from small molecules to cell therapy,"" he said. ""They're innovative, and they cast the net widely for new technologies and potential therapies.""Others are reaping the benefits of a decades-old project that mapped the human genome. The first human genome map cost $2.7 billion in 1997 dollars and took almost 15 years to complete. Today, it costs closer to $1,000 to map an individual's entire genetic makeup.Gene therapies and editing are having a ""renaissance,"" JMP's King said. Analysts point to Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP), which made its IPO a year ago, as a leader in this field.Crispr is also the name of the technology. Crispr Therapeutics, Audentes Therapeutics (BOLD) and Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA) also are making waves in the sector. The technology makes it much easier to edit genes, Needham analyst Alan Carr told IBD.BTIG analyst Dane Leone sees some of those companies entering the clinic in 2018.""This technology uses an enzyme that is actually from a bacterial organism to target areas of the genome or your DNA, where you want to make changes to the DNA,"" he said. ""What you can do using this enzyme complex is give it direction in terms of target, and insert it into a cell.""In the end, the enzyme complex attaches to DNA, where it can make alterations, he told IBD.JMP analyst King described Crispr technology as having the ability to ""repair broken genes, cut out and replace defective genes and insert functional genes where they're desired.""On the other side of the gene spectrum, RNA interference and antisense are responsible for cutting-edge drugs from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and Biogen partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS). Biogen and Ionis in December won FDA approval for Spinraza, the first drug of its type approved to treat spinal muscular atrophy.Needham's Carr likened RNA interference as a way of ""turning off"" a gene. This has the potential to be more robust than gene therapy, which must alter all or most of the cells in the body to be effective.In September, Alnylam stock spiked 52% in one day after its drug, patisiran, proved effective in treating a rare disease known as hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. The disease results in the buildup of abnormal protein causing systemic problems. Patisiran uses RNA interference. Analysts call the late-stage data from Alnylam a ""big win"" for the concept.Bluebird is working in gene therapy to treat blood disorders.The list of innovations goes on and on in this era of biotech, but today's gains have been decades in the making.""It's usually a steady build and then you have these waves of innovation that kind of collide or emerge at similar points in time,"" JMP's King said. ""It's not like the traditional tech, where things can happen overnight.""RELATED:Get The Details On All 6 Award-Winning Biotech Innovators And Their WorkGilead-Kite Deal Boosts Biotech ETF As It Clears Buy PointHow Novartis' Cancer Approval Validates Gilead's $11.9 Billion Kite DealThe Cure For Cancer?

88,GILD,"Biogen (BIIB), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) will build on momentum in the biotech sphere to beat Wall Street expectations for the third quarter, an analyst predicted Friday.X""Large-cap biotech stocks have been strong as we head into the third-quarter reporting period,"" Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young wrote in a note to clients. She is focused on Biogen's Spinraza, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN) Dupixent and Gilead's hepatitis C drugs.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Investor's Business Daily's 453-company Biotech industry group dipped a collective 0.8%. But the group is ranked first out of 197 groups tracked by IBD and hit a 22-month high earlier in the week.That momentum will likely continue into the third quarter for most large-caps, Young said. She calls for Biogen, Gilead, Sarepta and possibly United Therapeutics (UTHR) to beat on the top line.Biogen is set to report its quarterly results early on Oct. 24. Young calls for Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy drug developed with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), to beat the consensus view for $250 million. She forecasts $356 million in sales.The Cure SMA website reports that an estimated 2,000 U.S. patients have been dosed with Spinraza as of the third quarter, 450 of whom were in trials or expanded-access programs, Young wrote. That suggests that there were about 1,550 commercial U.S. patients as of the period. She sees 1,400 U.S. patients on Spinraza in the third quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks have trended north over the past several weeks amid a healthy dose of good news for several key players. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at which stocks helped send the group to a 22-month high.""We do think at some point Spinraza could surprise to the downside as patients switch to the much less expensive maintenance dose vs. the loading dose,"" she said. ""However, we think this quarter Spinraza will very much still be in its launch phase.""On the top line, Young models Biogen reporting $3.11 billion in sales and adjusted income of $6.08 per share. Both metrics top the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $3.03 billion and $5.68, respectively.The multiple sclerosis franchise is likely to face more headwinds, though. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. Tecfidera's total prescriptions fell 4% in the third quarter with no price increases. As a result, Young's model for Tecfidera is $35 million below the consensus view.Young forecasts Gilead beating third-quarter expectations on strong sales of drugs to treat hepatitis C and HIV — helping the biotech shuck off quarters of hepatitis C malaise. Still, AbbVie's (ABBV) new hepatitis C regimen could have an impact. Gilead is set to report late on Oct. 26.AbbVie's Mavyret gained approved in August to treat all genotypes of hepatitis C patients. It's typically dosed over eight weeks — a shorter duration than rival drugs — and is priced at roughly half the price of its competitors, on a wholesale basis.For that reason, Young dropped her 2018 forecast for Gilead's hepatitis C drug sales to $6.4 billion from $7.8 billion to factor in risk from AbbVie. But she remains bullish on the third quarter, where she models $6.57 billion in total sales, above consensus views for $6.37 billion.Her forecast is driven by consensus-topping views for $1.18 billion in sales of Harvoni and $1.12 billion in sales of Epclusa. But HIV estimates are largely in line with consensus views. She models a miss on HIV drug Truvada, with an estimate that's $125 million below the consensus due to the entry of generics outside the U.S.On the bottom line, Young calls for adjusted profit of $2.26 per share vs. the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks for $2.07.Young calls for Regeneron and Sarepta to narrowly beat Wall Street forecasts, benefiting from eczema drug Dupixent and Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug Exondys 51, respectively.Regeneron, which is set to report its earnings early on Nov. 8, could deliver a slight beat vs. the consensus for its Sanofi (SNY)-partnered eczema drug. Young models $86 million in sales of Dupixent, down from her earlier view for $111 million, but above the Street's $73 million.Dupixent's weekly total prescriptions are up an average 153% in the third quarter vs. the prior period. Dupixent ended the third quarter with 2,398 outstanding total prescriptions, Young wrote. She forecasts 155% quarter-over-quarter growth for the drug.But her third-quarter model for Eylea, approved to treat a number of eye conditions, is $920 million, which trails the consensus for $936 million.Sarepta could, again, surprise to the upside with Exondys 51. In the second quarter, Sarepta crushed expectations by $13 million. For the third quarter, Young calls for $43 million in Exondys 51 sales, above the consensus for $40 million.Further full-year guidance for $125 million to $130 million in sales is likely conservative, Young said, noting that ""management sounds upbeat about launch trends.""RELATED:AbbVie's New Hepatitis C Drug Chipping Away At Gilead's ShareThis Biotech Broke Out To An 11-Month High — Can It Keep Going?Why Regeneron's Patent Win Is Worse For Amgen Than You Think

89,GILD,"Biotech mergers heated Monday after Celgene (CELG) announced it would acquire Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) for $9 billion and French pharma Sanofi (SNY) said it would spend $11.6 billion to tack on Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV).X Analysts lauded Celgene's Juno buy, noting it will help fill a hole after Celgene's blood disease drug Revlimid begins losing exclusivity in 2022. But the Street was more split on Sanofi's purchase as the hematology market is expected to soon face disruption from gene therapies.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Juno surged 26.8% to 86. Celgene ticked up 0.3% to 102.91. Bioverativ rocketed 61.9% to 103.79, but Sanofi dived 3.1% to close at 43.20. The broader biotech group popped 3.7%.Credit Suisse analyst Martin Auster suggested in a report the group could see a mad scramble in mergers and acquisitions after Sanofi announced its plan to buy Bioverativ. He lists Biomarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN), Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) and AveXis (AVXS) as his top takeover picks.""This deal could be a sign that the (merger) spigot has finally turned on as other large pharma companies may feel pressured to move to make full-value bids to grab what is a fairly scarce selection of commercial and commercial-ready assets among the small and midcap biotech spaces,"" he said.Celgene said Monday it would spend $87 per share to acquire Juno — a 93% premium to the stock's closing price —  before rumors sent Juno flying last week. Celgene already owned 9.7% of Juno from a 2015 deal to collaborate on cancer and autoimmune drugs. The merger is expected to close this quarter.Juno is among those working on CAR-T therapies, which engineer a patient's own immune cells to identify and fight cancer cells. Celgene pegs its lead drug, known as JCAR017, as getting approval in the U.S. in 2019 and bringing in a potential peak of $3 billion in sales beyond 2020.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene was particularly hurt in the third quarter when its bigger drugs Revlimid and Otezla missed expectations. And it's not the only one facing a patent cliff in the mid-2020s. See who else is at risk by visiting the Industry Snapshot.Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond suggested that guidance could be overly bullish.Celgene is ""setting a relatively high bar for an asset that likely won't be alone in its class,"" he said in a note. ""However, if this guidance is achievable, this could be an important source of revenue in the mid- to long-term as Celgene looks to plug a Revlimid hole once its goes generic starting in 2022.""But competition is looking stiff. Gilead Sciences (GILD) spent nearly $12 billion to acquire Kite Pharma last year. About that time, Gilead-Kite gained approval for a CAR-T therapy, following Novartis (NVS), which was first out of the gate with an approval in August.Celgene expects JCAR017 to get approval to treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Gilead's drug, Yescarta, is approved to treat that population and Novartis is looking to get its drug, Kymriah, approved for that use as well.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges views the deal positively as it ""consolidates and streamlines"" Celgene's efforts in CAR-T. Celgene also partners with Bluebird Bio (BLUE), working on a multiple myeloma drug known as bb2121, which targets an antigen known as BCMA.""Owning Juno allows Celgene to focus its BCMA efforts initially on Bluebird's bb2121 and to make Juno the vehicle for all development of (drugs that target the CD19 protein), and for the exploration of other targets as opportunities,"" he said in a note to clients.Mizuho analyst Salim Syed noted there can be no cross-pollination in the manufacturing of Juno and Bluebird drugs, but there will be knowledge-based synergies. It's unsure whether Celgene could even look to acquire Bluebird without triggering antitrust concerns, he said.Early Monday, Sanofi said it would buy hemophilia player Bioverativ for $105 per share. The deal is a 64% premium to Bioverativ's closing price Friday, Piper Jaffray's Raymond wrote in another note.""We're not shocked one bit,"" he said. ""With a $1 billion topline and revenue growth of more than 31% last year, yet trading at just five times fiscal year 2018 revenue estimates, we have long viewed Bioverativ as a potential takeout target.""The deal comes after Sanofi twice failed in 2016 and 2017 to make big acquisitions. In 2016, Dow's Pfizer (PFE) beat out Sanofi in a battle for cancer player Medivation. Last year, Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) acquired rare disease biotech Actelion Pharma out from under Sanofi.Sanofi is facing mounting competition for its diabetes drugs. But the trick will be convincing investors that the hemophilia market won't be disrupted by gene therapy and product launches like Roche's (RHHBY) drug Hemlibra, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a note.""At a minimum, after a number of speculated successful bids, including Medivation and Actelion, Sanofi investors now have a deal to digest that is immediately accretive to 2018 earnings and estimated to be 'up to 5% accretive in 2019,' "" he said.RBC analyst Kennen MacKay called the bid strong given upcoming competition from Roche, but noted it's likely Sanofi is building on ""lessons learned in the Medivation and Actelion processes where Sanofi led with low offers and was later bested by competitive bidders.""But investors weren't as sure of the merger. Biogen spun out its hemophilia business into Bioverativ a year ago.Bioverativ has two approved drugs, Eloctate in hemophilia A and Alprolix in hemophilia B. Last year, Bioverativ acquired True North Therapeutics.Credit Suisse's Martin called True North ""one of the stronger acquisitions of 2017."" Under it, Bioverativ gained access to a drug now known as BIVV009 to treat a rare autoimmune disease. He models $19 per share for that drug alone.RELATED:Which Biotechs Could Surprise To The Upside On Earnings?This Biotech Stock Rocketed 15% On Rumors Biogen Could Buy ItHow Hospitals Plan To Put Pressure On Generic-Drug Makers

91,GILD,"Clovis Oncology (CLVS), Sage Therapeutics (SAGE) and Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) could stoke acquisitive appetites in 2018 as large-cap biotechs struggle with slowing growth and major patent cliffs, analysts said Tuesday.X Deal-making has slowed since hitting a record high in 2015, RBC analysts said in a note to clients. The number of deals valued above $1 billion hit 17 two years ago. This year, there have been six of those mergers, including Gilead Sciences' (GILD) $11.9 billion takeover of Kite Pharma.Investors had expected Gilead's major buy to stoke more acquisitions. When that didn't come to fruition, biotech stocks suffered. But ""pent-up demand"" could prompt mergers and acquisitions to play out next year, analysts say.""Many large-cap companies generate a disproportionate share of overall revenues from a handful of blockbuster drugs — many of which are facing impending patent cliffs in the coming years,"" RBC's note said. ""The need to make up for lost sources of revenue and stimulate growth may encourage future M&A.""Gilead bought Kite after suffering major declines in its hepatitis C drug unit. But its HIV drug, tenofovir alafenamide, is likely to lose patent protection in 2025. Celgene's (CELG) cancer drug Revlimid is facing patent cliffs in 2024-26. Amgen's (AMGN) anti-inflammatory Enbrel is likely to lose protection in 2019.These three also had the most cash on hand as of their recent updates. Amgen reported $41.35 billion, Celgene had $11.76 billion and Gilead noted $29.07 billion. The remainder of large-caps in the biotech realm had under $4 billion each.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts said Monday that large-cap biotech franchises will feel the pain of competition in 2018 amid a speeding number of rival branded and generic drug approvals. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on what this could mean for the likes of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Gilead and Amgen.Overall, cash positions are nearing a five-year high, analysts say. Tax reform could help. Under the most recent proposal, companies can repatriate earnings at as a 15.5% tax rate. Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) have an excess of 90% of their cash currently overseas.""However, we think it's unlikely that the majority of overseas cash would be repatriated immediately upon institution of tax reform,"" RBC analysts said. Celgene, for instance, has suggested a chunk of its foreign earnings are expected to be reinvested permanently outside the U.S.Analysts also note the average projected revenue for the next seven years for mid-cap biotechs is likely to do little to offset the losses from patent cliffs. Performance of acquirers over the past two years has been poor. Industry checks also indicate large deals are on the outs — Gilead/Kite being the exception.Still, expectations are high for mergers and acquisitions, analysts say. In a recent survey, investors cited M&A as the biggest tailwind for the group. Drug pricing is expected to be the biggest headwind in 2018. RBC analysts are slightly bullish on M&A and slightly bearish on drug pricing.""With expectations high for M&A as a major tailwind for the sector, if it does not materialize in the first half of 2018, we could see broad downside,"" RBC said.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan, too, notes M&A will be important for the Big Pharma group and that it will likely come as a result of changes in tax rates for repatriation. His top pick for 2018 is J&J, though he also expects Dow's Merck (MRK) and Allergan (AGN) to rebound.""Additional funds for dividend growth and share repurchases should also boost the overall outlook for the sector from an investor perspective,"" he said. ""We see the regulatory environment remaining generally favorable and providing more rapid paths to market for products that bring real innovation.""RELATED:Beware: Price Wars For Big Pharma, Biotech Companies On HorizonThis Biotech Stock Seen As Cheapest Among Rivals In Cancer DrugsGeneric Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don't

92,GILD,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages rallied at record highs during the week. ASML (ASML), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and other chip plays surged on earnings. Apple will pay $38 billion in taxes, pay employee bonuses and step up its manufacturing investment fund as it repatriates massive overseas cash holdings. General Motors (GM) was upbeat about the future while Ford Motor (F) was not. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) kicked off health insurance earnings, and led many insurers' stocks to record highs. Cancer drug trial data and M&A buzz moved drug stocks. But General Electric (GE) crashed to a fresh six-year lows amid a huge new charge and speculation that the conglomerate may break up.X The Dow and Nasdaq rose 1% for the week while the S&P 500 climbed 0.9%, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hitting record highs on Friday. Chip-gear makers led the way, fueled by ASML (ASML) and others. Health insurers also were big winners as UnitedHealth (UNH) triggered a group rally. Energy stocks pulled back while lithium plays also sold off.Apple (AAPL) is expected to bring home $245 billion in foreign profits banked overseas to help pay for domestic projects, thanks to recently enacted U.S. corporate tax reforms. Apple pledged to contribute more than $350 billion to the U.S. economy over the next five years. That includes creating 20,000 new jobs, funding a new campus and more data centers, and forging deals with U.S. component manufacturers. Analysts say Apple likely will use some of the foreign cash for tuck-in acquisitions and to increase stock buybacks and dividends.The semiconductor equipment group led all industries for the week. ASML Holding (ASML), Ichor Holdings (ICHR) and Electro Scientific Industries (ESIO) rallied on upbeat financial reports. ASML reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and Ichor and Electro Scientific each announced preliminary December-quarter sales that topped views. Chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) added to the party by delivering better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and guiding to strong sales growth in 2018.General Electric (GE) CEO John Flannery said he's mulling a breakup into separate businesses, after the industrial giant announced it will take a $6.2 billion charge in the fourth quarter on its legacy insurance business — double earlier guidance. The charge relates to an old long-term-care portfolio.

93,GILD,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) continued its two-day upswing Friday after announcing the launch of a generic version of a drug from Gilead Sciences (GILD), a day after the drugmaker unveiled a massive cost-cutting plan.X In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Teva lifted 6.2%, near 18.40. Earlier, the stock popped as much as 8.1%. Shares closed up 10.2% on Thursday, the day Teva said it would cut $3 billion by the end of 2019 to deal with its debt.Gilead's drug, Viread, is approved to treat HIV and hepatitis B in some patients. Teva is launching a generic version of Viread 300-milligram tablets in the U.S. in the hopes of taking a chunk of the $762 million in annual U.S. sales Viread garnered as of October.There are an estimated 1.1 million and 850,000 people living in the U.S. with HIV and chronic hepatitis B, respectively, who could benefit from Viread, Teva said in a news release. The launch adds to Teva's generic portfolio of nearly 600 medications.On Monday, Teva also announced its launch of a generic version of Viagra, which is branded by Dow stock Pfizer (PFE). As of August, the erectile dysfunction drug had annual sales of $1.4 billion in the U.S., Teva said in a news release.Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin praised Teva for its plans to cut $3 billion in costs over the next two years. The cuts will come in the form of layoffs, closing manufacturing facilities and suspending its dividends on ordinary shares.IBD'S TAKE: Teva has an IBD Composite Rating of 14 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it underperforms the lion's share of stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But other generic drug stocks have stronger ratings like Ani Pharmaceuticals, which comes in at 97. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other strong players in the generic-drug landscape.Rubin had initially expected Teva to announce a plan to cut $1 billion to $2 billion in costs by 2020. She expects New Chief Executive Kare Schultz to deliver on his promises based on a background at Lundbeck where he ""repeatedly understated and overdelivered.""""We acknowledge there is investor skepticism around the health of the base business, but note this is the first time in a while where we have seen a concrete strategy towards de-levering the company, which is a top priority,"" she said in a note to clients.The conference call on Thursday suggests a weaker base for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, but this will be more than offset by cost contribution, Rubin said.As part of the restructuring, Teva is combining its generics and specialty units, and will focus its efforts in the U.S., Europe and emerging markets. Rubin sees drugs in migraines and involuntary movements tied to Huntington's disease as leading Teva's specialty unit.Rubin acknowledges this could create additional downside risk to Teva's top line, but sees the exit from unprofitable businesses as a potential mark for the bottoming of U.S. generic pricing.""We are not calling the bottom yet, however, but will closely monitor the rate and magnitude of rationalization efforts as important sign posts,"" she said.She boosted her price target on Teva to 20 from 15 and upgraded the stock to a buy rating from neutral.RELATED:Teva Pharma Announces Layoffs, Suspends Dividends To Tackle DebtWhy Amgen Could Have An Edge Over These Rivals In Preventing MigrainesTeva's Restructuring Plan: Another Case Of Been Here, Done That?

94,GILD,"A new HIV drug from Gilead Sciences (GILD) has the potential to become the ""greatest of all time,""  an analyst said Wednesday.X Investor expectations are high for Gilead's $13 billion to $15 billion HIV drug franchise, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young wrote in a note to clients. In the third quarter, its seven branded HIV drugs pulled in $2.6 billion in sales.Its next treatment, bictegravir, is expected to launch in February. It's a two-drug combination of tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine to treat HIV-1 and offers better bone and kidney safety.""We remain confident in bictegravir being the next blockbuster HIV drug for Gilead when it launches Feb. 12, 2018,"" Young said. ""From our fireside chat with (Chief Executive) John Milligan at our conference, he noted that bictegravir should grow into one of the most important products in the HIV space and will keep them in front of the competition.""Young estimates peak bictegravir sales of $4 billion in 2023, just five years after its launch. Bictegravir is a clear focus for Gilead as its hepatitis C drug franchise slows down and matures amid high cure rates.IBD'S TAKE: Small biotech names crowded headline space in the third quarter after easily quashing analyst expectations. At the same time, larger players struggled as legacy products face competition. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at the third-quarter breakdown in biotech.Meanwhile, Gilead's legacy HIV drugs are facing exclusivity loss in 2021. Young sees growth for those drugs decelerating by 33% each year from 2018-23. But she models Gilead's new tenofovir alafenamide franchise driving 11% annualized growth over the same time period.""Bictegravir is the notable positive drug which we expect to grow 45% on an annualized basis over the next five years,"" she said.The drug should also help Gilead pull back some share from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) which makes Tivicay and Triumeq. During the third quarter, GSK's HIV drug sales increased 13% year over year at a constant exchange rate to about $1.97 billion.About 40%-45% of Tivicay prescriptions are used in combination with Gilead's drug Descovy, a tenofovir alafenamide backbone. Bictegravir could help Gilead gain back 10% share of the HIV space.""Therefore, when bictegravir launches, we expect that the company can gain some share lost,"" she said. ""Our sense after speaking to Gilead is that they lost about 20% share but then gained back 10% after tenofovir alafenamide launches.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, Gilead was unchanged at 73.29. GSK dipped 0.6% to 34.66.In other matters, documents filed with the Federal Trade Commission suggest Gilead may have acquired a privately held CAR-T company known as Cell Design Labs. This would dovetail well with its acquisition in October of Kite Pharma.According to the documents, the FTC granted antitrust clearance for a transaction between Gilead and Cell Design, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a note to clients.Gilead is listed as the ""acquiring party"" and Cell Design is listed as the ""acquired company."" It's possible, though not as likely, that clearance could have been granted for Gilead to make a sizable investment in Cell Design.The potential deal, which hasn't been confirmed by either company, fits well with Gilead's stated strategy and helps lifts a cloud that has been hanging over Gilead for two years as its hepatitis C drug sales dwindle.""Seeing Gilead both communicate a clear growth strategy and execute on its intensions could provide additional reassurance to investors,"" Abrahams said.RELATED:Goes Gilead's Kite Acquisition Offer A New Buying Opportunity?How Blood-Disease Data Sent These 2 Biotech Stocks FlyingHow Celgene, Gilead's Pricing Woes Continue To Haunt Biotech Stocks

95,GILD,"Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) toppled Friday on a report outlining a 25% dip in prescriptions of liver disease-drug Ocaliva the week the Food and Drug Administration warned doctors of overdose-related deaths.XIntercept plunged as much as 10.2% before climbing back for a loss of 3.9% to close at 69.92 on the stock market today. The broader biotech industry was down a fraction, but continued to trade near a 21-month high.Ocaliva prescriptions sank by 25% week over week after the FDA, on Sept. 21, issued a letter warning physicians against overdosing some patients on Ocaliva. The drug is approved to treat primary biliary cholangitis, a liver condition.But some patients with liver cirrhosis were injured or died after physicians prescribed Ocaliva at 5 milligrams per day which is seven times higher than the recommended weekly dose in those patients, Intercept has said.The FDA further suggested, ""Ocaliva may also be associated with liver injury in some patients with mild disease who are receiving the correct dose.""Ocaliva prescriptions hit an record the week before the FDA's warning letter, even after the firm itself issued a similar warning against overdosing patients with more severe cirrhosis of the liver on the drug.""The downtick suggests re-education of physicians on proper dosing will continue to be important for Intercept,"" RBC analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechnology companies are now ranked first out of 197 groups tracked by IBD and a big dose of healthy news sent the stocks to a 21-month high recently. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at which stocks look strong heading into the end of the year.In the same week, prescriptions of Gilead Sciences' (GILD) hepatitis C drug Harvoni and Biogen's (BIIB) multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera declined 8%-10%, he said. Overall, the drugs Abrahams tracks saw prescriptions decline 2% week over week.""However, ursodeoxycholic acid (also approved to treat primary biliary cholangitis) looked flat week over week and the magnitude of decline for Ocaliva looks higher than the rest of the group, suggesting it is more likely to represent real prescribing patterns rather than overall volatility in data capture,"" he said.New prescriptions of Ocaliva looked to be down harder, declining 35% that week. This suggests ""the decline may be attributed to a slowdown in new patient starts as physicians digest and understand the new safety communications,"" Abrahams said.RELATED:They These Biotechs Are Leading The Group Near A 21-Month HighIntercept Responds To Drug-Tied Deaths, Stock Tries To ReboundIntercept Plunges On FDA's Warning Of Drug-Related Deaths

On the plus side, analysts say all four carriers, including No. 1 Verizon (VZ), have been restrained in promotions for the soon-to-be released high-end Apple (AAPL) iPhone X, which could improve margins for the December quarter.Cable TV firms Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter (CHTR) reported higher video subscriber losses and lower broadband customer additions. Comcast had lowered guidance in early September, sending its stock down 10% ahead of Q3 earnings. Charter stock fell after it disclosed similar trends.

Charter acquired Time Warner Cable last year. Comcast added 182,000 broadband customers in Q3 vs. 288,000 a year earlier.Baidu (BIDU) crushed third-quarter earnings estimates, but the Chinese search engine giant gave weak Q4 guidance. Shares plunged 8.15% on Friday.Cisco Systems (CSCO) acquired BroadSoft (BSFT), a maker of communications software for telecom companies, for $1.9 billion including debt, or $55 a share.

Shares of the online brokerage rose 4.6% to a record high.ServiceNow (NOW) reported Q3 earnings and revenue that topped expectations but billings growth disappointed. Shares in the enterprise software provider fell after its earnings release but closed the week slightly higher.

99,GILD,"Major indexes still held near the break-even line in late-afternoon trading Thursday, a day after details on President Trump's tax cut plan failed to gather praise from congressional Democrats. Bipartisan support is likely necessary for Trump to follow through on his pledges to reinvigorate the economy.XMeanwhile, Q2 U.S. GDP growth was revised slightly up to an annualized rate of 3.1%, up from 3%. August durable goods orders jumped 1.7% on a month-to-month basis, shocking the Street. Ex-transportation equipment, orders still rose a respectable 0.2% while core capital goods orders rose 0.9%.""Healthy readings for these indicators suggest continued upbeat momentum in the industrial sector despite downside risk from the recent hurricanes,"" Lewis Alexander, North American economist at Nomura, wrote in a recent note.The Building-Residential/Commercial industry group ranks 13th out of 197 IBD industry groups for six-month relative price performance. Energy-Solar, Machine-Material Handling/Automation and Aerospace/Defense industry groups are also in the top 20.At 3:30 pm ET, the Nasdaq composite edged 0.1% lower, taking a 0.6% drop in dull trading by Apple (AAPL) shares in stride. Apple had rebounded as much as 3.4% in the past two sessions after hitting a short-term low of 149.16.At 153.10, the iPhone giant remains modestly below the 156.75 buy point in a second-stage flat base, a key chart pattern seen in many top growth stocks.The Nasdaq 100-tracking PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF was off 0.2% and is finding support at its 50-day moving average. But the Dow Jones industrial average edged up less than 0.2% and the S&P 500 less than 2 points, or less than 0.1%.Volume is running lower on both main exchanges vs. the same time on Wednesday.Returning to Apple, the megacap tech is still up more than 29% since clearing a first-stage bottoming base pattern on Jan. 6-9, when it broke out of a three-month cup with handle at 118.12. In a bottoming base, a stock typically declines 50% or more from its all-time high, but then bottoms out and forms a new base that can set up a potential breakout to 52-week highs.Selling a stock once it's risen 20% to 25% past a proper buy point in a cup base, double bottom or other pattern is one of the most important offense-type sell signals for individual investors.Those who have more conviction can decide to hold longer but then must be on the lookout for signs that the tide is turning from that of heavy demand to heavy supply. That's where sell signals, such as a sharp break through the 50-day moving average and failure to rebound quickly, the biggest single-session point loss in heavy turnover, or a failed breakout from a late-stage base, come in.Among top-ranked industry groups, biotech, chip equipment and plastics firms led the upside with gains of 0.8% or more. However, former big winner Gilead Sciences (GILD) fell nearly 5% in fast turnover to 79.82, giving back a lot of the gains made over the past month.The pioneer in HIV treatments cleared a first-stage bottoming base pattern with a 76.59 buy point four weeks ago.Watch to see if the stock can stay above its rising 10-week moving average, which is drawn in red on an IBD weekly chart.The Dow Jones transports rallied 0.4%. At 9880, the index has now risen 9.7% from its Aug. 24 low.Autohome (ATHM) helped spark a sell-off in some names in the Chinese internet space. The online provider of car information and ads at one point slid more than 9% to an intraday low of 57.70 before rebounding. Volume continued to run more than triple usual pace. At one point, the stock got as low as 57.70, below its rising 50-day moving average.When a stock posts its biggest single-day point drop in heavy volume since a proper breakout, it usually means it's a great time to take at least some gains and lighten up on the position.In the case of Autohome, it is also the first time for the stock to pierce its 50-day moving average since an early-May breakout past a 36.11 entry in an eight-week cup. Autohome rose as much as 87% before its current correction. A further drop below the 50-day line, especially in heavy turnover, would warrant selling shares and locking in profits.Autohome fell on news of an abrupt resignation of both President Yan Kang and CFO Julian Wang. The company also named Jun Zou, former chief financial officer at iDreamSky, to replace Wang.The company announced that the resignations ""were not due to any disagreement with the Company regarding its business, finance, accounting and/or any other affairs.""A more serious concern for shareholders may lay in whether Autohome will be able to maintain high growth in its fundamentals.Earnings grew 39% to 71 cents a share in the second quarter, matching the highest increase over the past six quarters. The increase also was an acceleration from a 15% rise in Q1. However, Q2 sales grew 11% to $230.4 million, slowly sharply from gains of 56%, 74% and 16% in the prior three periods.In the year-ago quarter, revenue jumped 49%.Analysts see revenue growth to slow further, to 3% in Q3 to $227 million, then fall 11% to $257.6 million in Q4 vs. a year ago.Despite the slower growth in the top line the past two quarters, Autohome was able to grow earnings by 39% in Q2 to 71 cents a share on the back of improving margins. In Q2, gross margin rose to 81.4% vs. 65.9% in the year-ago quarter.Net margin rose by a surprising 750 basis points to 36.2%, the highest in eight quarters, according to research by William O'Neil + Co.Autohome went public in December 2013.IBD's TAKE: Do you want to quickly check the quality of a new stock prospect in terms of its fundamentals, technical action and level of institutional sponsorship? The Stock Checkup is your answer. Notice how the doctor's facial expression changes based on the quality of its rank across five major categories, such as relative strength, earnings per share growth, and SMR (Sales Growth + Margins + ROE).

100,GILD,"Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAAP) launched to a record high Thursday on rumors Swiss drug giant Novartis (NVS) could attempt to take it over — a potential deal one analyst called ""very logical.""XAdvanced Accelerator gapped up as much as 12.7% to an all-time high of 67.37, before settling back to 65.10 for a gain of 8.9% at the close. Novartis lifted a fraction, to finish at 84.75.The potential deal would fit well with Novartis' existing franchise including Sandostatin, approved to treat symptoms associated with some tumors, and Afinitor, approved to treat some cancers affecting the breast, kidneys, hormones and nervous system, Canaccord analyst Mark Massaro said.Advanced Accelerator is working to gain approval for a drug called Lutathera to treat some tumors in the gastrointestinal tract. In December, Lutathera was delayed at the Food and Drug Administration. Approval in the U.S. is now expected in January.""We expect final European Medicines Agency approval for Lutathera within the coming days, and FDA approval (scheduled for) Jan. 26, 2018, both of which should push shares higher,"" Massaro wrote in a note to clients. An expanded access program should help the U.S. launch.IBD'S TAKE: Cellular therapy, also known as CAR-T therapy, is getting some legs on Wall Street after Novartis gained the first approval earlier this year. Kite Pharma could be next. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at how these medicines are made.Massaro expects Lutathera to offer a ""long tail"" for revenue considering the limited supply of materials that go into it and the drug's extreme efficiency. He models $407 million in peak U.S. sales by 2024 and $133 million in peak European sales by 2023.""But we model conservative pricing in line with current therapies despite Lutathera's significant efficacy advantage,"" he said. Massaro kept his buy rating and 60 price target on Advanced Accelerator.For Novartis, gaining access to Lutathera would be ""very logical,"" he said. Cancer drugs are a staple in Novartis' pipeline. Advanced Accelerator also has drugs to treat neuroendocrine, prostate, breast and gastrointestinal cancers in its pipeline.Novartis just gained approval of a drug called Kymriah, a cellular therapy to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25. But competition is coming. Gilead Sciences (GILD) is working to acquire Kite Pharma (KITE), which is closing in on approval of a similar drug.Behind Gilead/Kite, Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) are each working with Celgene (CELG) to develop similar cellular therapies to treat blood cancers.RELATED:Biotechs Beating The Market, But Are They In Buy Range?Galapagos Pops After Eczema Drug Shows Promise Vs.

Rival investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS) also beat, but some analysts raised concerns that its results were helped by its more volatile and capital intensive lines of business. Goldman's trading results continued to struggle; Morgan's outperformed the other big banks. Morgan Stanley rose 4.9%, retaking a buy point. Goldman Sachs climbed 2.6%, near a breakout.Dow component Johnson & Johnson topped Wall Street's views by reporting adjusted earnings of $1.90 per share on $19.7 billion in sales.

103,GILD,"No franchise is safe in 2018 among large-cap biotechs, which are feeling pressure as the Food and Drug Administration speeds approvals for rival branded and generic medicines, analysts said Monday.X The theme is a continuation from 2017, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients.""Despite the near-record number of drug approvals, the large-cap biopharmaceutical sector fell out of a favor with investors, with no names more punished than those with concentrated product portfolios and looming branded or generic competitors,"" he said.Heading into 2018, management confidence is low as revenue trajectories for high-profile products face a slowdown courtesy of payers and competitive pressures. Porges doesn't see the uncertainty lifting in 2018 — and ""possibly not ever.""In 2017, competitive pressures slugged the likes of Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD). Celgene is feeling the pain in its inflammation unit amid mounting competition from Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS), as Gilead sees a rival for its hepatitis C drug sales in AbbVie (ABBV).Early next year, Porges expects guidance from the lion's share of large-cap biotechs to be conservative. The most stock-moving guidance will come from Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Gilead, he predicted.Alexion is working on a drug dubbed ALXN1210 to treat a pair of rare blood diseases. It's also undergoing a restructuring. Meanwhile, Gilead's hepatitis C franchise will again come under the microscope even as it attempts to pivot further into HIV with its drug bictegravir.""We believe there is $16 per share of value in Gilead's stock for hepatitis C, and the stock price could move up or down 5% if hepatitis C revenue guidance meaningfully differs from the consensus $5.5 billion to $6 billion estimate,"" Porges said.IBD'S TAKE: Small-cap biotechs performed well in the third quarter, but large-caps suffered mounting competitive concerns. See how that translated in the stock prices by visiting the Industry Snapshot.He noted AbbVie's plans for hepatitis C products are likely to hurt Gilead stock. AbbVie recently launched Mavyret to treat all six genotypes of hepatitis C. AbbVie will likely provide guidance on its fourth-quarter call ahead of Gilead.Porges expects 2018 sales outlooks from Celgene, Alexion, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Gilead, Amgen (AMGN) and AbbVie to miss analyst estimates. Biogen (BIIB) could provide an outlook that encompasses analyst views, he said.Later in the year, the large-cap universe will face political pressure, Porges predicted.""By midyear the congressional midterm elections will be underway, and these campaigns are likely to renew the focus on pharmaceutical companies and their pricing policies,"" he said. ""We continue to favor stocks of companies that are structural demand growth stories, with products protected by commercial, scientific, clinical or legal barriers to entry.""For 2018, his top picks are Vertex and Alexion.Another Leerink analyst, Michael Schmidt, pegs Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) as his top picks among small- and midsize biotechs focused on treating cancer.This group of stocks has outperformed the broader biotech market by 52% thus far in 2017, Schmidt wrote in a note to clients. This dynamic is set to continue in 2018 in a ""favorable regulatory environment"" and as large caps expand their portfolios via acquisitions.In 2018, Incyte (INCY), Seattle Generics (SGEN), Exelixis (EXEL), Clovis, Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO), Puma and Array Biopharma (ARRY) are set to launch key products. He counts nine in the group set to unveil pivotal trial results and pending regulatory decisions for a total of seven firms.Emerging technologies remain of interest. CAR-T therapy, which trains a patient's immune cells to fight cancer, and precision oncology had a strong 2017. But success in immuno-oncology combinations, cancer vaccines and certain antibodies has only been modest.""We think next-generation antibody-drug conjugates could be an underappreciated re-emerging area of interest in 2018, representing a clinically validated category but with significant room for upside,"" Schmidt said.Antibody-drug conjugates are antibodies linked to cell-killing agents. The antibody binds to specific marks at the surface of a cancer cell. ImmunoGen (IMGN), Mersana Therapeutics (MRSN) and Seattle are working in this area with the latter the furthest along, he said.RELATED:Why Big Pharma And Biotech Companies Are Girding For A Pricing 'Knife Fight'Teva's Restructuring Plan: Another Case Of Been Here, Done That?Generic Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don't

The 18-year-old fund, which counts Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet as its top five holdings, has amassed nearly $70 billion in assets.Third place went to iShares Russell 2000 Top 200 Growth (IWY), which has gathered $975.2 million in assets since its September 2009 launch. While IWY held the same top five names as QQQ, it was less top-heavy. The top five accounted for 28% of IWY's total assets vs. 39% for QQQ.All three ETFs have low expense ratios: 0.15% for MTUM, 0.20% for QQQ and IWY. They also earn five-star ratings from Morningstar, which indicates how well a fund's returns have compensated investors for the amount of risk it incurs. The ratings range from one to five stars with the best performers, based on risk-adjusted return relative to similar funds, receiving five stars.The three funds are trading at all-time highs and are extended from ideal buy points. In fact, the other ETFs in the accompanying table are also at record highs — not too surprising given we're now in the ninth year of a bull market.IBD'S TAKE: Making money catching ETF uptrends requires knowledge about how to read charts. You can learn how at IBD University.So, let's take a look at an ETF that's not on this list nor in the big-cap category, but may be setting up a new base: iShares Nasdaq Biotech. The fund is shaping the right side of a shallow cup-with-handle base with a potential buy point at 111.47. Shares advanced 13% from a June breakout from another shallow base to their Oct. 6 intraday high.The $10.3 billion fund, which tracks the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, will mark its 17th anniversary next month. Biotech represented the biggest sector weight at 82% of assets, pharmaceuticals 11%, life sciences tools and services 6%, with smaller health care-related positions making up the rest.Its top five holdings as of Jan. 11 were Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN). The top five stocks accounted for nearly 37% of total assets. Most have outperformed the broader market so far this year: Gilead, Amgen and Biogen have gained 10%, 6% and 5%, respectively vs. the S&P 500's 4% return.IBB's one-year return of 20.4% slightly lags the S&P 500's 24.1% gain. The ETF's average annual return over the past three years lags the benchmark index but leads the S&P 500 during the past five, 10 and 15 years. IBB carries a 0.47% expense ratio.Friday's pick, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV), remains in a buy zone from a Jan. 3 rebound off the 50-day line.RELATED:Apple, Microsoft Fuel Dow To Record; Will Bitcoin Rebound Last?Apple Rises While Bitcoin Dives; Time To Buy Nvidia, AI Stocks?China Hits Stocks; Buffett Vs.

105,GILD,"Novo Nordisk (NVO) is shedding its restraint and embracing acquisitions after all.The Danish drugmaker, which has traditionally eschewed deals and looked inward to develop new treatments, signaled a desire to seek growth from outside its own labs as it disclosed a $3.1 billion takeover offer for Ablynx (ABLX).Novo CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who walked in his predecessor's footsteps in his first year at the helm, is now attempting to clinch Novo's biggest deal ever — despite Ablynx spurning two offers in less than a month. The strategy extends beyond Ablynx: Novo said it's reviewing other potential takeovers and, after years of relying mostly on in-house research, is keen to look elsewhere for new medicines.""It marks a higher risk willingness and a willingness to obtain innovation from outside Novo Nordisk compared to what we historically have done,"" Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard said in an interview with Bloomberg.Novo has sat out a recent wave of industry deals in which a handful of giants snapped up promising biotechnology companies. The company has spent less than $500 million on mergers and acquisitions over the past decade, according to data disclosed by Novo.Swiss rival Roche Holding (RHHBY), by contrast, committed three times as much just last month when it agreed to buy U.S. biotech firm Ignyta (RXDX). Other pharmaceutical transactions last year include Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) $30 billion purchase of Swiss biotech Actelion Ltd. and Gilead Sciences' (GILD) $11.9 billion takeover of Kite Pharma.The 51-year-old Jorgensen may find he's not the only one interested in Ablynx. Novo isn't aware of other suitors, Brandgaard told reporters on a conference call, but some may emerge now that Novo's interest is out in the open. Ablynx shares surged more than 49% to close at 38.62. Novo shares ticked down 5 cents to 54.69.Belgium-based Ablynx said late Monday that Chairman Peter Fellner has resigned from the board. Fellner, 74, had served as chairman since 2013 and had been slated to step down later this year. Ablynx gave no reason for the departure.Fellner has had numerous corporate board appointments, and was a member of the advisory group to Novo A/S, an investing arm of the Novo Nordisk Foundation, until January 2016. He'll be replaced as chairman by Bo Jesper Hansen, a non-executive director, the company said in a statement.Jorgensen is working to beef up a unit that has traditionally had a low profile. The business of selling treatments for rare blood disorders makes up only a fifth of its sales and is overshadowed by the company's diabetes operations.Unless the unit gets split off it needs to grow, said Kim Nielsen, a fund manager at C Worldwide Asset Management in Copenhagen.""Otherwise you risk it being too small or too uninteresting,"" said Nielsen, who holds Novo shares. ""Overall I feel confident they should do something like that.""Novo went public after Ablynx rejected a proposal that includes an upfront cash offer of 28 euros a share and additional cash payments known as contingent value rights of up to 2.50 euros per share tied to the success of two experimental medicines. The maximum payment is 44% more than the stock's closing price on Friday in Brussels.The choice of target isn't a shot in the dark: The two companies have been involved in a research collaboration since 2015.Ablynx's most advanced drug, caplacizumab, addresses a rare disorder called acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, in which blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body. The illness can block the flow of blood to the body's organs, according to the U.S. National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.Jorgensen, who grew up on a family farm in Denmark and joined Novo in 1991 as an economist, replaced its retiring leader at the start of last year. He joined just as Novo's traditional diabetes business came under pressure from insurers and payers, who demanded lower prices in the U.S., Novo's largest market.Ablynx ""holds great potential and has highly competent employees,"" Brandgaard said. ""This is a natural first asset for us to pursue.""

107,GILD,"In his first run with the Food and Drug Administration, gene and cell therapy were early-stage, theoretical concepts, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said Tuesday.XBut last month, the FDA approved its first cellular therapy, a drug called Kymriah from Novartis (NVS) to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients age 25 and younger. Kite Pharma (KITE), soon to be acquired by Gilead Sciences (GILD), is expected to grab a similar approval in November.In 2005, gene/cell therapy and drugs that biologically copy an existing product — known as biosimilars — didn't exist, Gottlieb told the MedTech Conference in San Jose, Calif.""Now we have products we're reviewing and approving,"" he said.Gottlieb is nearly five months into his stint as FDA commissioner. He was among the first appointments by President Donald Trump and took office in May. He first served as an FDA deputy commissioner in 2005-07.Gottlieb's background has him uniquely prepared to head up what is now a much bigger FDA, said Scott Whitaker, Chief Executive of AdvaMed, the world's largest medical technology association. Gottlieb was diagnosed with a type of lymphoma when he was younger.""It was the kind of tumor only a hypochondriac doctor would have found on himself,"" Gottlieb told the audience at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center. As a doctor, Gottlieb researched the type of treatment he wanted, knowing he had a very good chance of survival.IBD'S TAKE: Medtech stocks have been riding out drug-pricing fears that have hurt the pharma and biotech sectors, analysts say. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at winners and losers in the political discourse.He acknowledged not every patient fits into that bucket.""I was a very different patient from the patient who is told, 'You have a 20% chance of survival,'"" he said. ""They're looking for something experimental; something that might not be approved yet. There's a lot of different cancer patients.""Part of his challenge, Gottlieb says, is ensuring the FDA has policies that help all patients.""It's difficult to simultaneously serve both types of patients because by serving one patient you could potentially impact another patient,"" he said.Today, the FDA has its hands in a number of areas. Gottlieb says most people would be surprised to find he spends most of his time working on the tobacco side. What won't surprise the public, though, is that the FDA is working closely on ameliorating the opioid crisis.Last month, Trump declared the opioid crisis a national emergency. To cope, companies like Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Medtronic (MDT) are working on therapies called neuromodulation, which use electricity to conceal pain from the brain.Gottlieb notes medical products could step in as alternatives to addictive opioids. A medical device ""could deliver localized therapy or a patch to treat localized pain vs. drugs that have a systemic approach and are very addictive,"" he said.The FDA is also working on a framework for quicker review and certification of software programs. Rather than go through the longer products review, these software programs can be reviewed with less information.Apple (APPL), FitBit (FIT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Pear Therapeutics, Phosphorus, Roche (RHHBY), Samsung, Tidepool and Verily will be involved in the pilot program which seeks to identify the information companies will need to provide for the quicker review process, Gottlieb said.""We need to modernize our regulatory framework so that it matches the kind of innovation we're being asked to evaluate, and foster beneficial technology while ensuring that consumers have access to high-quality, safe and effective digital health devices,"" he said.RELATED:This Biotech Craters 70% On Late-Stage Alzheimer's Drug Failure

108,GILD,"Among the biotech companies chasing next-generation cancer treatments that work with patients' own immune systems, Incyte (INCY) stands out with a treatment analysts say could prove to be a blockbuster.XThe Wilmington, Del.-based company is a leader in developing immunotherapies to bolster cancer survival rates. It stands among drug giants such as Novartis (NVS) and Merck (MRK), with which it has both partnered and competed, as this emerging field of medications rapidly expands.The nonprofit Cancer Research Institute, which funds immunotherapy studies, estimates that some 1,400 drugs using immunotherapies to target cancer were on the market or in the pipeline as of August. That figure more than doubled from just two years earlier.""It's exploded,"" said institute spokesman Brian Brewer. ""The number of drugs and combination of drugs out there now is off the charts."" Among the successes are improved survival rates for patients fighting skin and lung cancers.In the coming decade, analysts say Incyte will be among the companies leading the charge to bring new immunotherapies to market with its still-experimental drug epacadostat, which works in combination with other medications. Recognizing the potential for new epacadostat regimens, along with already robust sales of the company's current flagship cancer-fighting drug Jakafi, Investor's Business Daily named Incyte one of six IBD Biotech Innovator award winners.How IBD Chose The Biotech Innovator Award Winners: IBD asked equity analysts, ETF and mutual fund managers and university professors to identify the top biotech companies based on their innovative research. We asked them to focus on companies with pioneering drugs likely to launch in the next several years and reach blockbuster, or near-blockbuster, sales of $1 billion or more a year. The award winners selected by IBD editors are the six most-cited companies. To find profiles of all the award winners and details of their work, go to our full Biotech Innovators special report.)Morningstar analyst Kelsey Tsai says epacadostat ""showed encouraging early results"" in concert with Bristol-Myers' (BMY) Yervoy to fight melanoma. Incyte's drug is under evaluation with other immunotherapies on this front, including a late-stage study with Merck's Keytruda that also targets melanoma. And additional studies are underway for epacadostat in combination with Keytruda and drugs to treat other oncological diseases.Epacadostat ""has very high potential,"" Tsai told IBD. (Incyte declined to make an executive available to be interviewed for this story.)""Pivotal results"" for the drug in combination with Keytruda are expected in the first half of 2018, Tsai says. And data on early testing for the same regime targeting multiple cancers are expected as soon as this fall.Incyte researchers used past university studies to help develop epacadostat. Key findings showed that cells in tumors take advantage of an enzyme called IDO1 to prevent a person's immune system from killing them off.Epacadostat was designed to target and block this enzyme on and near cancerous cells to enable a patient's immune system to attack and reduce tumors. Analysts say this process is safer than chemotherapy and other treatments because it involves the human body fighting diseases naturally.Credit Suisse sees lofty sales of epacadostat, estimating that annual revenue from the drug could exceed $3 billion as soon as 2025, assuming it wins regulatory approval.Tsai says Morningstar projections assume pricing of $100,000 annually for use of the drug regimens. She said her firm gives epacadostat a 60% chance of gaining approval as a treatment for certain skin- and lung-cancer treatments. Other types of cancers will be targeted later.IBD'S TAKE: It's always best to focus on stocks with Relative Strength Ratings above 90, where Incyte has been among the hierarchy.That promising outlook is on top of already strong oncological drug sales for Incyte. The company's drug for a bone marrow disorder and blood cancer, Jakafi, helped the company generate revenue of $1.1 billion in 2016, five years after the drug gained FDA approval. Incyte posted second-quarter revenue of $326.4 million, up 33% from the year-earlier quarter, on strong Jakafi sales.Tsai said the blend of Jakafi as its foundation and epacadostat as its future puts Incyte ""in a plum spot.""Incyte's stock touched a six-month high above 140 on Aug. 31, but closed Friday at 114.29. In March, the stock set a record high that had dated to 2000, surpassing 153. Revenue jumped by at least 44% a year from 2014 through 2016, and is expected to rise more than 30% this year to near $1.47 billion. The company finally broke into the black in 2015.Its market capitalization tops $23 billion, roughly double its value at the start of 2015.For all the positives, observers note that drug-trial setbacks wouldn't be a shock, and regulatory approval is never a sure thing. Competition is strong and intensifying from a range of companies.""As an investor, unless you are really digging in with your homework in biotech, it can be hard to really know what is going on with drug trials and what kind of timeline things are on,"" Mike Matousek, a trader at investment house U.S. Global Investors (GROW), told IBD.But he and others say Incyte boasts some unique positives.Herve Hoppenot took over as CEO in 2014. He had been Novartis' president of oncology, and he brought cancer-drug experience and several key scientists with him to Incyte.And while competition is heated, the need for cancer treatments is so vast that analysts say there is plenty of room for multiple strong players in this field.Also notable: Analysts say Incyte is the largest of the midsize companies in the oncology arena. As such, analysts say Incyte remains an attractive acquisition target for larger drug companies looking to pick up talent and bolster their drug pipeline. In March, reports surfaced saying Gilead Sciences (GILD) could be eyeing Incyte, though no Incyte takeover rumors have come to light lately. Instead, Gilead on Aug. 28 announced an agreement to acquire Kite Pharma (KITE) for nearly $12 billion.Incyte, though, will likely remain a subject of speculation, analysts say.""The possibility of M&A almost always gives investors added reason to give extra attention to a stock,"" Matousek said.RELATED:Get The Details On All 6 Biotech Innovator Award-Winning Companies And Their WorkIncyte Battles In A $25 Billion MarketPhase 3 Trial Results Boosted This Biotech Stock

110,GILD,"Jeffrey Leiden's office shelves are plastered with all the accoutrements you'd expect from the chief executive of a $39 billion biotech. But from the awards, letters of accommodation and inevitable family photos, emerges a theme.Gratitude.Leiden's Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) currently aims to treat 31,000 cystic fibrosis patients across the globe. Cystic fibrosis is a progressive, genetic lung condition and those who survive into adulthood generally don't live past the age of 38, according to most estimates.XIn 2012, Vertex set out to change that and the success it's seen with two medicines — soon to be three — on the market have generated the 50 to 100 pieces of mail plastered to Leiden's shelves. They're letters of thanks from graduates and newlyweds.""We get about 50 (letters and emails) a week from patients and families thanking us for what we do,"" Leiden told Investor's Business Daily. ""We know all these patients. Most of them are kids and teenagers and we watch them grow up. It's like being part of a family. Not a company.""Vertex wasn't always a cystic fibrosis play. In earlier days, it was focused on treating hepatitis C and launched a drug known as Incivek in 2011. Then Gilead Sciences (GILD) launched its drug, Sovaldi. That launch was one of the most successful in history. It also nearly put Vertex out of business.Though Incivek became a blockbuster drug shortly after its launch, Vertex pulled it from the market in 2014 as demand withered. Leiden describes that time as one of ""crisis"" for the company.""We were in the middle of a crisis,"" he said. ""We had gone from being a hepatitis C company with a billion-dollar drug for literally one year to essentially zero revenue. And there are very few companies that can, frankly, survive that kind of crisis simply because it's so hard to pivot to a new area or drug.""But for 13 years, a division of the company in San Diego had been quietly working in the cystic fibrosis arena. The indication fit in with Leiden's strategy: investing in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for serious diseases with large unmet medical needs in specialty areas.Vertex's specialty focus allows it to keep its sales and marketing forces slim which, in turn, allows it to reinvest nearly nine in 10 dollars of its revenue back into research and development. It sells cystic fibrosis drugs in the U.S. with a sales force of fewer than 20, Leiden said.Fast forward to 2017. Vertex has two drugs on the market — Kalydeco and Orkambi. In the second quarter, sales of Kalydeco, its first approved cystic fibrosis drug, grew 5% year over year to $190 million and Orkambi rocketed 32% to $324 million.Year to date, Vertex stock has more than doubled, rising 108%. Shares began forming a cup with handle and a 163.74 buy point in late July. Meanwhile, the broader biotech industry group has risen 28% and is ranked eighth out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 20 just 13 weeks ago.Shares of Vertex dipped 0.5% to close at 151.26 on Friday.Vertex is a rarity among biotechs, in a way. Its pipeline is almost solely in cystic fibrosis. Of 13 drugs in its pipeline not already licensed out to bigger pharmaceuticals, 11 are in cystic fibrosis. Leiden acknowledges the risk from a portfolio standpoint.But some products simply don't make sense for Vertex, he said. Vertex has farmed out drugs in flu and cancer to Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Merck KGaA because the enormous sales contingent it would take to sell drugs in those indications would take away from reinvesting in science.Reinvesting in science has allowed Vertex to do something else unique. Whereas medicines from other firms target the symptoms of cystic fibrosis, Vertex is working to correct the genetic underlying causes of the disease to, eventually, prevent infants diagnosed with it from ever fully developing it.The underlying science focuses on about 200 genetic mutations that can be divided into four ""buckets,"" Leiden said. Kalydeco can treat 10% of patients. Orkambi, a combination of Kalydeco and a drug known as lumacaftor, can treat another 50%. Eventually, though, Vertex plans to treat 90% of patients.Getting to that third ""bucket"" of patients, though, will require a three-pronged treatment strategy. Already, the ""backbone"" for that triple is being considered for approval in the U.S. and Europe: A combination of Kalydeco and a drug called tezacaftor. That looks likely to be approved in February 2018.On top of Kalydeco/tezacaftor, Vertex is adding a ""next-generation corrector,"" a drug that can fix other abnormalities in genes to treat another 30% of patients. Vertex has strong Phase 1 data for three next-generation correctors in combination with Kalydeco/tezacaftor, and a fourth ready to read out soon.The eventual goal is to decide which of the four possible triple-pill combinations will provide the most efficient treatment with few to no side effects. After that, Vertex plans to use gene editing to treat the last 10% of cystic fibrosis patients for whom traditional small molecule medicines won't work.Leiden won't comment on when he expect a triple-pill to get approval. He sees pivotal trials beginning next year. Most analysts take that to mean the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could approve a triple-pill from Vertex in 2019-20.Vertex's goal with the triple is to prevent infants, less than 1 year of age, from developing cystic fibrosis as it's known today. In adults who already have lung damage, Kalydeco has been shown to improve lung function within two weeks and, over time, slow the rate of decline in lung function.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex is among several leaders nearing a buy zone. Head to IBD's list, Stocks Near A Buy Zone, for other near-term opportunities including an entertainment stock and a financial services play.""Rather than declining at 1%-2% per year, they decline at 0.75% per year in lung function,"" Leiden said. ""And while that may not sound that significant, it's sort of like compounded interest. Take that over a lifetime and it makes an enormous difference in both their survival and their quality of life.""The quality of life improvement is huge, Leiden said.""They used to go to the hospital four to five times per year. Now it's zero to one time per year,"" he said. ""They used to be on a transplant list. Now they're not a transplant list. They used to be able to walk one block. Now they can walk miles. It's not just their longevity but their quality of life.""Galapagos (GLPG) and AbbVie (ABBV) have teamed up to follow in Vertex's steps, but both Leiden and JMP Securities analyst Liisa Bayko are doubtful the duo can catch up. To get FDA approval for a triple-pill combo, they must show strong data for each component first.Bayko estimates Galapagos is several years behind and even if it does make it to market, its triple-pill would have to have outstanding efficiency to persuade Vertex's patients to switch to a new medicine.""Vertex has done a good job at continually improving on its meds,"" she told IBD. ""They keep moving the bar higher. They make it challenging for people to want to go on a drug that will be just as good as Vertex's. Why would you want to do that if you can just get on Vertex's drug?""Some are more bearish, though. Jefferies analyst Michael Yee sees Galapagos eventually getting 20% of the cystic fibrosis market. Still, he notes Vertex has created a strong setup for itself with making barriers to entering the market high and delivering strong medicines.He, like others, questions what Vertex will do after its cystic fibrosis well runs dry. Leiden acknowledges the cystic fibrosis journey is nearing an end but says Vertex has plans to shift into other rare diseases like sickle cell, a genetic lung/liver condition and a deadly nerve disorder.""Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (a lung/liver condition) looks a lot like cystic fibrosis,"" Leiden said. ""We have the technology and we know how to go after it.""And as to the bears skeptical about Vertex's cystic fibrosis pipeline?""There's a group of analysts or investors out there that say, 'Well, it's really great they want to do that but we'll see if they're able to, I'm skeptical,'"" he said. ""The reason that's weird to me is we've already done it. We've proven we can do it and we've proven the model.""""I don't think it's a question anymore. I think we've demonstrated it works.""RELATED:Why The Biotech 'Catch-Up Rally' Could Add Another 15%-20%Celgene Breaks Out; These 2 Biotech Giants Close On Buy PointsTop Biotech Stock Near Buy Zone After FDA Drug Approval

111,GILD,"AbbVie's (ABBV) newly launched hepatitis C drug Mavyret has already grabbed 7% of total new prescriptions, further chipping away at Gilead Sciences' (GILD) struggling hepatitis C franchise, an analyst said Friday.XAs a result, Wall Street sees Gilead's 2018 hepatitis C drug sales declining 28% vs. the year-earlier period, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a note to clients. The drop will be sharper in the U.S. at a 31% plunge. In 2019, sales are expected to fall another 19%.On a wholesale basis, Mavyret is priced at roughly half its competitors at $13,200 per month vs. $24,920, $28,000 and $31,500 for Gilead's Epclusa, Sovaldi and Harvoni, respectively. Dow stock Merck's (MRK) Zepatier and AbbVie's Viekira Pak cost a respective $18,200 and $27,773 monthly.But Gilead contends that after discounts and rebates, Mavyret is priced similarly to Harvoni. They differ, though, in treatment duration. Of the wide array of hepatitis C drugs, Mavyret can treat every genotype and has the shortest treatment duration at eight weeks for most patients.IBD'S TAKE: Novartis was first to the finish line with a CAR-T drug. What does it mean for Gilead's plan to acquire Kite? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a deeper dive on the segment.To contend with the likelihood of further erosion in its hepatitis C franchise, Gilead is pivoting into cellular therapy with the $11.9 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma (KITE). Though Kite doesn't have an approved drug, the merger was announced days before a rival drug from Novartis (NVS) gained approval.Novartis' drug is approved to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25. Analysts now expect a similar drug from Kite, a treatment for an aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, to grab approval later this year.Behind them, Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) are each partnered with Celgene (CELG) to work on similar treatments, known as CAR-T therapies. To create these drugs, immune cells are extracted from patients and reprogrammed to fight cancer cells before being reintroduced.RELATED:How AbbVie's 'Gauntlet' Could Squeeze Gilead's Drugs In Hepatitis CThe Cure For Cancer?

Biotech stocks broadly rose 1% and touched a high last seen in January 2016. The group is now ranked second out of 197 groups tracked.Crispr rallied 2.9% to end the regular trading session at 18.39, while Editas popped 2.3% to close at 24.56 on Bluebird's downgrade. All three are working on therapies to treat sickle cell disease, a group of inherited blood disorders. Therapies from Crispr and Editas are showing promise, says Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison.Investors don't appreciate the risks that Bluebird faces in December when it's set to unveil further data from its drug, LentiGlobin, in treating sickle cell disease, Harrison said. Meanwhile, therapies from Crispr and Editas use different mechanisms with ""less variability"" than Bluebird's.""We do not believe the (American Society of Hematology) data (from Bluebird) will demonstrate the significant improvement in hemoglobin production necessary to increase investor confidence in sickle cell gene therapy,"" Harrison wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex Pharmaceuticals is partnered with Crispr, working on solutions to genetic diseases using gene editing, including sickle cell disease. Head to The New America for a closer look at what Vertex has planned after its cystic fibrosis journey comes to an end.Harrison downgraded Bluebird to an underweight rating, though kept his 105 price target. He is more bullish on Bluebird's chances in treating multiple myeloma using a drug known as bb2121, in partnership with Celgene (CELG).Bluebird is in a crowded field in CAR-T therapy, which aims to teach the immune system to identify and kill cancer cells. Novartis (NVS) just gained approval for its drug, Kymriah. Gilead Sciences (GILD) is acquiring Kite Pharma (KITE) for its drug. Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) is also working with Celgene.Still, ""Bluebird has a significant lead with a partner in Celgene that is the clear leader in the myeloma space,"" Harrison said. ""Importantly, we would expect bb2121 to be granted breakthrough designation in the near-term which could cause Bluebird to rally.""RELATED:Bluebird Hits High On Bullish Report Highlighting Blood DrugsWhy Amgen's Drug Win Sent AbbVie Stock Into The StratosphereNovartis Could Acquire This Biotech — Why A Deal Is 'Very Logical'

121,GILD,"A ""catch-up rally"" in the biotech sector could tack on another 15%-20% to some stocks with Celgene (CELG), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) leading the charge, an analyst said this week.XYear-to-date, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) is up 26%. Over the same time, the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) is up 43%. Both are currently in buy zones. Despite this strong performance, biotech multiples are only just above their historical all-time troughs, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says.But a recovery could be underway. Large-cap biotech stocks are up 15%-20% since April 1 and beat the market ""handily"" in the second quarter.Still, biotechs continue trading at a significant discount to their pharma and medtech brethren, Porges said in a note to clients. Since 2014, the 35% and 15% premiums biotechs have enjoyed on pharma and medtech, respectively, have eroded and reversed.Porges is banking on a return on sentiment to the biotech sector.""Compared to where the revenue multiple for the group was in 2015, there is still an additional 15%-20% upside, should sentiment about the sector return to prior levels,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: One industry observer says September could be a ""make or break"" month for the biotech sector based on a number of upcoming investor and health care conferences as well as expectations for nearly a dozen trial readouts. Who could excel — or be facing a pitfall? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.Recovery is already underway. In late August, Gilead Sciences (GILD) said it would pay $11.9 billion to acquire cancer play Kite Pharma (KITE). Days later, rival Novartis won approval for a key treatment, setting the stage for a key drug from Kite to be approved in November.Since that announcement, IBD's 446-company Biotech industry group has climbed 8.3% on what Porges calls a ""catch-up rally.""""To a significant extend, this is the rally that investors had been hoping and looking for, and it followed a surprisingly tepid July for the group, despite strong (second-quarter) operating results,"" Porges said.Consensus expectations in the third quarter are picking up, Porges said. Revenue views are modest, calling for an average 2%-3% growth in 2017 and 2018. And earnings per share forecasts are trending up for the first time this year.Porges is more bullish than the consensus. His top picks are outperform-rated Alexion, Celgene, Regeneron and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX). Since January, even slow-growing large caps have delivered 10%-12% outperformance. Standouts among those include Regeneron, up 36%, and Vertex, up 116%.""Celgene has more pipeline optionality and has not appreciated as much lately as Alexion,"" he said. ""We are also recommending Regeneron and Vertex, although at their current valuations we see less upside in these names than for Celgene and Alexion.""RELATED:Alnylam Topples But Celgene, AstraZeneca Rise On Drug SetbacksTop Biotech Stock Near Buy Zone After FDA Drug ApprovalHow AbbVie Could Chip Away At Regeneron's Potential Blockbuster

122,GILD,"It sure helps an ETF when its largest holding gets a rich buyout offer that sends the stock soaring.XSPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) had precisely that good fortune last Monday, when Kite Pharma (KITE) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) agreed to a deal that valued Kite at nearly $12 billion.Kite — the largest holding of the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF with nearly 4% of the portfolio's weighting — vaulted 28% on the news. Gilead rose about 1% Monday, but surged Wednesday to the highest price since September.It was Wednesday when the FDA approved a drug from Novartis (NVS) called Kymriah that's the first to use CAR-T therapy, in which immune cells are extracted from a patient and reprogrammed to fight cancer. Kite Pharma is making progress on its own CAR-T treatment, which explains why Gilead rallied on the Novartis approval and why some other biotechs rallied.Gilead Sciences is the 10th largest component of the ETF, with more than 2% of the portfolio.Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), another company working on CAR-T drugs, surged Tuesday as the FDA decision stoked sentiment for all biotechs working on gene-reprogramming treatments. Juno, the ETF's second-largest holding, gapped out of a base the previous day.Among other major components, Exelixis (EXEL) is trying to break out to new highs and Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) could soon break out of a cup-with-handle base.In all, SPDR Biotech has nearly 100 stocks and is the most heavily traded biotech ETF, with an average daily volume of 4.2 million shares.The favorable charts of these and other holdings are filtering to the ETF itself. SPDR Biotech on Thursday broke out past a buy point at 82.48 from a flat base. It is the latest pattern in a recovery that the ETF has been making from a low in February 2016. The relative strength line is at new highs also, which is a good sign for the breakout.SPDR Biotech had one of its worst periods from July 2015 to the February 2016 low. Despite that, the ETF has good long-term performance. Its three-year annualized gain was 17.7% and five-year gain 21.7% through the end of July. SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) generated average annual gains of 9.23% and 14.18% in those periods.Just as drug approvals can send biotech stocks soaring, a rejected drug can spark huge sell-offs. That's one of the risks of owning the industry. Another is the lingering risk that lawmakers will revive a push to cut prices of exorbitantly priced medicines.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

124,GILD,"September will be a ""make or break"" month for a number of biotechs, including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY), Axovant Sciences (AXON) and Versartis (VSAR), which are expected to present Phase 3 data in the upcoming weeks.XBiotech stocks could be poised for another run, says Loncar Investments Chief Executive Brad Loncar. Year to date, they've risen 28% and hit a 20-month high on Sept. 1. Shares have risen following Gilead Sciences' (GILD) announcement that it would acquire Kite Pharma (KITE).All of that comes before an incredibly newsworthy September that will feature at least five major medical conferences, at least 10 big investor conferences and nearly a dozen Phase 3 trials expected to read out, Loncar told Investor's Business Daily.""This might be the most newsworthy month in biotech history,"" he said. ""What's so amazing this September is there are a ton of Phase 3 trials that are scheduled to read out. The company itself is either going to succeed or fail because of these trial readouts.""""I count seven of them that are make or break for the companies,"" Loncar said.Loncar counts 11 key trial readouts in September. But principal among them, he notes, is Alnylam, which is expected to unveil the results of a trial of a drug dubbed patisiran for a rare disease that causes the buildup of abnormal material called amyloid throughout the body.Success could be a major catalyst for the technologies known as RNA interference and antisense, which essentially turn off malfunctioning genes, Leerink analyst Paul Matteis wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Novartis' IBD Relative Strength Rating was boosted Friday to 71 from 65 out of a best-possible 99. The grade shows how the stock's price moved over the past 52 weeks against all other stocks in our database. Head to IBD Data Stories to see how Novartis stacks up against its rivals.Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) is also working on a Phase 3 drug, known as inotersen, to treat the disease called TTR amyloidosis.Matteis calls for an upside of 5%-15% depending on the magnitude of success and safety, and a downside of 15%-20% if the drug proves effective but mixed on safety. He sees downside of 70% if Alnylam's drug fails completely in the trial.According to Loncar, ""Most people are convinced it's going to succeed."" He cited a note that saw the range of failure to success putting Alnylam's stock price at 25 to 105 per share. It closed at 86.80 on Tuesday.""For that company, that's a $7 billion window,"" he said. ""This is a bellwether biotech company. Everyone is counting on this one to succeed, and it probably will. But if that one trial fails, the stock will crash.""Behind Alnylam, Loncar notes that Axovant is expected to announce the results of its drug dubbed intepirdine in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Recently, Biogen (BIIB) stock broke out on strong Phase 1b data from an Alzheimer's trial.Axovant is working on a different theory of treating Alzheimer's. Intepirdine is known as a serotonin receptor antagonist, which has potential cognition, memory and learning-enhancing side effects. It was originally developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) but sold to Axovant.So far, nothing has worked in Alzheimer's, so there's always some excitement — and trepidation — around trial readouts for the disease, Loncar said. Last December, Eli Lilly (LLY) toppled when its drug, solanezumab, failed in a Phase 3 trial of Alzheimer's.""If Axovant does succeed, we could see a stock go from 20 to 100 in one day,"" he said. Axovant closed at 20.35 on Tuesday. ""That's extreme. But that's the kind of euphoria Alzheimer's can create.""He also notes trials from Versartis and Zogenix (ZGNX) in growth hormone deficiency and a form of epilepsy known as Dravet syndrome, respectively.But it won't just be September that's chock full of catalysts, Leerink analysts wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. After ""a solid year for returns of biopharma stocks"" there are still a number of catalysts in the back half of the year.Among large-caps, Leerink's Geoffrey Porges notes that AbbVie (ABBV) will have data from trials for anti-inflammatory and cancer drugs, and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) is expected to grab another approval for its drug Soliris to treat a disease in which the immune system attacks healthy cells.Amgen (AMGN) could update its label for LDL cholesterol-lowering drug, Repatha, to include its added benefit on cardiovascular outcomes. Meanwhile, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) are appealing a court decision vs. Amgen for their rival drug, Praluent.Celgene (CELG) will have readouts in ulcerative colitis and a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. FibroGen (FGEN) is expected to have data for fibrosis and anemia drugs. Analysts expect Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) to provide an update with data from its cystic fibrosis trials.Gilead-Kite's CAR-T drug will likely be approved to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in November. This would follow the approval of Novartis' (NVS) Kymriah, a CAR-T drug that treats a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25.""We expect CAR-T to remain one of the most closely followed emerging areas in biotech in the second half of 2017,"" Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt wrote in a note. The launch of Kymriah should read through to drugs from Bluebird Bio (BLUE), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Adaptimmune Therapeutics (ADAP).RELATED:Biogen's Alzheimer's Drug Shows Promise — Could It Break Out?How This J&J Partnership Bit The Dust On Gilead-Kite CompetitionCelgene Breaks Out; These 2 Biotech Giants Close On Buy PointsHow Novartis' Cancer Approval Validates Gilead's $11.9 Billion Kite DealGilead-Kite Deal Boosts Biotech ETF As It Clears Buy Point

125,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) ""might end up doing nothing in oncology"" if the right takeover deal doesn't present itself, Chief Executive John Milligan reportedly told an analyst Wednesday.XThe third-largest biotech by market cap, Gilead has struggled with declining sales of hepatitis C drugs for several quarters. In the first quarter, Gilead hinted that it could be looking to buy an oncology player. But Gilead remained mum on a potential merger in the recent second quarter.It appears Gilead is looking for a ""transformative"" acquisition, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients after meeting with the biotech's management Wednesday. The firm is struggling to identify such an opportunity.""As CEO John Milligan explained it, he didn't think it made much sense to buy something small today in the hope it might grow into something large,"" Porges said. Instead, Milligan is looking for a company with ""substantial data, value and scale.""Analysts have suggested Gilead could look to acquire companies like Tesaro (TSRO), Incyte (INCY), Clovis Oncology (CLVS) or Kite Pharma (KITE) in cancer, or Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) in cystic fibrosis. Recently, United Therapeutics (UTHR) spiked on the potential that Gilead could take it over.IBD'S TAKE: The biotech industry is awaiting mergers and acquisitions to spike higher, says one industry observer. How does Gilead fit in? Visit IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.Gilead also noted that it's still interested in fibrosis programs. In 2015-16, it bought two firms with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) programs: Phenex Pharmaceuticals and Nimbus Therapeutics. NASH is a liver disease.In the meantime, Gilead is calling for declines in its hepatitis C unit, despite beating views in the second quarter. Porges sees revenue from hepatitis C drugs falling 30% in 2017 and then dipping 15%-25% annually through 2020.""This decline is likely to accelerate in 2017 and beyond as better competitive hepatitis C regimens come to market,"" he wrote. ""Our outlook for the company's HIV business remains positive, but this is not sufficient to offset the dynamics of the hepatitis C business.""Among those competitive regimens, AbbVie's (ABBV) Mavyret gained approval earlier this month to treat all genotypes of hepatitis C. Gilead acknowledged that AbbVie's biggest advantage is in the treatment of genotypes 2-6, rivaling Gilead's Epclusa and Sovaldi.Chief Operating Officer Kevin Young says the contracting cycle is now in full swing, but that doesn't mean every payer will defer to AbbVie's Mavyret over Gilead's drugs. Mavyret is being priced at a discount to Gilead's Harvoni and Epclusa, Porges said in a note last week.In its HIV unit, Gilead remains bullish on its chances of fending off GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which is working on two drug combinations. Recently, concerns have emerged regarding the safety of Glaxo's double-drug for HIV and questions of the infection's ability to adapt to treatment.Gilead stock closed down 1.6%, at 72.70, on the stock market today.RELATED:Gilead Could Be Making An Acquisition — But It's Not What You ThinkHow AbbVie's 'Gauntlet' Could Squeeze Gilead's Drugs In Hepatitis CGilead's Hepatitis C Franchise Topples Again, But Shares Up On Beat

126,GILD,"U.S. stock indexes were mixed midday Monday, as small caps, RV and biotech stocks logged gains.XThe Nasdaq rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 was flat. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average retreated 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 tacked on 0.1%. Volume in the stock market today was running lower on the NYSE and higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Friday.Midcap Thor Industries (THO) broke out in strong volume, clearing a 110.01 buy point. The stock leapt 7% in the first hour of trade but then eased to just under the buy point. Volume was torrid. Most of Thor's business revolves around towable RVs. The company's big jump Monday is probably related to Harvey, the category 4 storm that has flooded Houston and other parts of Texas. Other RV and manufactured housing stocks also rose.The last storm that came with nearly equal force was Irene, which was category 3. Irene hit on Aug. 28, 2011, and RV stocks rose 10% in the three sessions after Irene hit. Choppy action followed for the next two months but the RV group rose 28% from the storm's initial hit. Thor gained 40% in the overall move but action also was choppy, making the stock hard to hold.Meanwhile, quality stocks in the biotech space rose nicely midday Monday. Of the 13 stocks in the group with a Composite Rating of 90 or higher and a price of 15 or higher, 10 advanced 1% or more.Gilead Sciences (GILD) announced it would buy Kite Pharmaceuticals (KITE). Gilead rose 2% on the news and Kite jumped 28%. Both stocks have Composite Ratings just under 80, going into Monday's market.The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 90 means the stock is in the top 10% among all stocks in IBD's database.Blue chips were mixed. In the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average, Apple (AAPL) scored the best gain, up 1.2% in volume about 35% above average. Speculation swirled around Apple. Reports said Apple would unveil a new phone and Apple TV Sept. 12. The company would not confirm the reports.In foreign markets, Brazil's Bovespa hit another new high.

The stock has been searching for strong support at that level for several weeks now.Among China-based leaders, Alibaba's (BABA) losing streak looked to extend to third day, falling over 2% in the stock market today. Shares are still well-extended from their 50-day line, where they found support on Aug. 11.Meanwhile, retail competitor JD.com (JD) and Chinese internet giant Baidu (BIDU) declined 2.8% and 2.4%, respectively. JD has given up its 50-day line in recent week as it builds a new base, while Baidu is still holding tight around its highs — about 14% above a 193.84 cup-shaped base entry.Among other leading stocks, Tesla (TSLA) dropped 1.5% as it continues to add a handle to its cup-base formation. The electric automaker's buy point would be 370.10, but the stock is struggling at its 50-day line.Among companies reporting earnings, Best Buy (BBY) moved up 0.4% ahead of its Q2 earnings before the market open Tuesday. The consumer electronics retailer is trading solidly in the 5% buy range from a 59.79 double-bottom buy point.

It's beaten the S&P 500 this year with a 15.5% vs. 10.4% return, according to Morningstar Inc., and has also outperformed the benchmark index over the past three, five, and 10 years.

129,GILD,"United Therapeutics (UTHR) surged to an 18-week high Friday on reports Gilead Sciences (GILD), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Novartis (NVS) could be considering taking over the U.S. biotech.XGilead is thought to be the front-runner in what could be an auction process, the Evening Standard reported, citing anonymous sources said. Glaxo and Novartis also are said to be potential contenders.United Therapeutics said it has no comment on the report.The rumored deal could be a boon for Gilead, which has been under the gun to make an acquisition amid slowing growth in its hepatitis C franchise. In the second quarter, sales in that unit declined 27.5% year-over-year to $2.9 billion.But United is a new name in the rumor mill. In the first quarter, Gilead said it was interested in making an acquisition in the cancer space, which puts Tesaro (TSRO), Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Kite Pharma (KITE) in the running, according to analysts.United is a rare disease player. It makes drugs to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, a condition characterized by high blood pressure in the lungs. It can lead to heart failure if left untreated.IBD'S TAKE: The potential for tax reform is holding some biotechs and drug firms back from making acquisitions in the near-term. But M&A activity would really help boost the sector, says one industry analyst. And Gilead could be the center of it all. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.The sources are looking for United to fetch $200 per share, valuing the company at $8.7 billion.Gilead, Glaxo and United didn't immediately return requests for comment.

130,GILD,"Biotechs, led by Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), outperformed their pharmaceutical brethren in the June quarter, an analyst says as earnings season nears a close.XLeerink analyst Geoffrey Porges  estimates that, of the large-cap biotechs, sales topped Wall Street expectations by an average 5% — with the most impressive beats coming from Alexion, Gilead, Vertex and Biogen (BIIB).Alexion's $912 million in sales topped the consensus by 8%. Gilead's hepatitis C unit fell again in the quarter, but total revenue of $7.14 billion topped by 13%. Vertex reported $544.14 million in sales, beating by 12%. Biogen topped by 10% with $3.1 billion in sales.""By comparison pharma company results were more tepid with Eli Lilly (LLY) and Merck (MRK) delivering significant revenue surprises, but otherwise fairly tepid results consisting of modest beat, in-line results and modest misses,"" Porges said in a note to clients last week.Dow-component Merck and Lilly topped the consensus by 4% and 2%, respectively. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Roche (RHHBY) delivered modest beats; Novartis (NVS), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) were in line. Sanofi (SNY), Pfizer (PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) missed.On the earnings side, ""performance was even more robust in biotech,"" Porges said. Large-cap biotechs beat by an average 9.8%, relative to the consensus. Bigger pharmas delivered earnings that topped the consensus by an average 4.8%.Revenue growth vs. the year-earlier quarter was 10.5% for biotechs and 2.4% for drug firms, on average, Porges said. Across the board, companies reported improved patient-access to drugs, as well as positive demand, inventory and currency effects.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech fever looked chilly in late July.

131,GILD,"In the quarter, rare-disease players on the biotech side did particularly well, Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments, told Investor's Business Daily. Biogen, Vertex and Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) all positively surprised the market.Spinraza, a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy from Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), nearly tripled consensus models. The drug brought in $203 million, obliterating views for $70 million, an analyst said.Sarepta absolutely crushed analyst expectations and rose to an eight-month high in July. Its key drug, Exondys 51, treats Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and brought in $13 million more than analysts had expected. Sarepta also cut loss-expectations by half.""I think that's one category of drugs where investors have been expecting payer pushback,"" Loncar said. ""And so far that hasn't shown up. If there was ever a group of companies that was going to boom more, it's rare-disease companies.""But sentiment has soured since the biotech sector hit an 18-month high in late July. Loncar cited political uncertainty, noting that the lion's share of biotechs and drugmakers with revenue-earning products beat expectations and raised guidance.""The fact they're not trading up (indicates that) investors have already reset their expectations for the year, so maybe it just hasn't been quite as impressive in that context,"" he said. ""We had a big run coming into earnings season, and that played a factor as well.""Uncertainty over tax reform is keeping most major players from looking to make big deals, Porges said. The Trump administration has yet to offer further details on its plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 15%, which would make corporate inversions less desirable.Though Gilead has been under the gun to buy something in the wake of slowing hepatitis C sales, it didn't comment on M&A on its second-quarter call. Dow's Pfizer says it's putting deals on pause while awaiting more on the tax situation out of Washington.Loncar noted Pfizer's call was the one that really ""crystalized"" this theme for the broader medtech sector. He had previously said a big deal in biotech could really send the stocks higher. But that looks unlikely in the near term.""Mega-deals might be on pause until that happens, or if that happens,"" he said. ""That's pretty disappointing. It shouldn't really affect what we call bolt-on deals. For the mega-deals, that seems to be holding things up.""RELATED:Gilead's Hepatitis C Franchise Topples Again, But Shares Are Up On BeatWill Pfizer's Cancer Drugs Help It Grow Without A Merger?This Biotech Just Blew Past Its Buy Point On A $13 Million Sales BeatAstraZeneca Beat, But Stock Dives On Drug Failure; 4 More ReportVertex Sings Late Despite Crushing Sales, Profit Expectations

Gasoline futures spiked as refineries were shut, with consumers expected to see bigger increases in coming weeks. Biotech stocks broke out on the Gilead Sciences (GILD)-Kite Pharma (KITE) takeover deal and a historic FDA approval. The U.S. economy added fewer jobs than expected in August.The Nasdaq composite rose 2.7% for the week, closing a fraction below an all-time record high The S&P 500 index and Dow industrials also rallied to within 1% of all-time levels. A North Korea missile test spooked investors briefly, but they quickly shrugged off the latest provocation. FANG internet giants were strong while Biogen (BIIB) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) were among the notable biotech breakouts. Construction materials and other stocks seen as benefiting from post-Harvey rebuilding and purchases rebounded.Over 3 million barrels per day of refining capacity, or 16% of total U.S. capacity, was offline due to Hurricane Harvey, according to S&P Global Platts, sending gasoline futures soaring to two-year highs. Refineries could be shut for several weeks. Gas Buddy said the national gasoline average jumped by over 11 cents per gallon from the prior week with more price hikes on the way. U.S. crude futures fell as fewer refiners were available to convert oil to gasoline and other products. U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.4 million barrels in the latest week with gasoline supplies flat, the Energy Information Administration reported, but that doesn't reflect Harvey's impact. Domestic production was essentially flat at 9.53 million barrels a day, still near the record high of 9.61 million reached in June 2015.Two days after Gilead Sciences (GILD) said it would pay $11.9 billion, or $180 a share, for Kite Pharma (KITE) and pivot to cellular therapies, Novartis (NVS) was the first to grab FDA approval for a CAR-T treatment. Kymriah was OK'd to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25. But Kite's drug is expected to be approved this fall to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Gilead soared 13.5% to a one-year high as Novartis' CAR-T approval appeared to validate its plan to acquire Kite, which shot up 28%. Drug giant Novartis climbed 0.3%. Other CAR-T players include Bluebird Bio (BLUE), which rose 34% to clear a buy point, and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), which popped 36%. Both are partnered with Celgene (CELG), which gained 7.5% to edge past its own buy point.RELATED:Why Investors Are Mute On Gilead's Acquisition Of Kite PharmaAnalysts Mixed On Gilead-Kite, But One Key Rival Stands To BenefitNovartis' CAR-T Drug Win Helps Gilead To Spike Post Kite DealThe U.S. added just 159,000 jobs in August, fewer than expected, while June and July payroll growth was revised down. The jobless rate ticked up to 4.4%, vs. views for a steady 4.3%. But the ISM manufacturing index jumped to its best level in more than six years. Meanwhile, Q2 GDP growth was revised up to a 3% annual rate, the best in more than two years.RELATED:U.S. Adds Just 156,000 Jobs; August Jobless Rate Rises To 4.4%The takeover is complete. To mark Day One of its ownership of Whole Foods, the e-commerce titan discounted a number of produce, dairy and meat offerings at the upscale grocer, bringing down the prices of bananas, eggs, butter, several varieties of milk, fish and ground beef, among other things. Amazon Echos were also displayed prominently in Whole Foods stores. Amazon.com (AMZN) shares climbed 3.5%.General Motors (GM) reported a bigger-than-expected U.S. sales gain while Ford (F) sales fell less than expected, even though Hurricane Harvey likely cut Texas sales. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) sales fell sharply, while Toyota (TM) missed views. With Harvey destroying some 300,000 to 1 million vehicles, auto sales and pricing may get a boost. Shares of automakers generally rallied, with GM breaking out past a buy point Friday.Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) topped fiscal second-quarter estimates and guided higher for the current quarter and full year. Q2 same-store sales rose 5.4% vs. views for 2.2%. But Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly cautioned them not to expect recent gains to be the ""new normal."" Best Buy has gained business recently from struggling Sears (SHLD) and bankrupt HHGregg, but is likely to face tougher competition from Amazon.com (AMZN) in the holiday quarter. Best Buy crashed nearly 12%, tumbling below its buy point.Ciena (CIEN) topped views for fiscal third-quarter sales and earnings. But for its fiscal fourth quarter, the fiber-optic network supplier expects adjusted earnings to rise 14% to 50 cents a share, on a sales increase of 3% to $735 million, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street was modeling for 58 cents and $770 million. The soft guidance was a shocker, given Ciena's previously bullish stance, Nomura Instinet said. Ciena tumbled 11% on Thursday.Workday (WDAY) reported second-quarter earnings of 24 cents a share, trouncing the estimate for 15 cents. Revenue rose 41% to $525.3 million, ahead of the consensus estimate of $506.9 million. The cloud-based human resources and finance software firm raised its full-year subscription revenue forecast.Workday shares rose 5.1% to their best levels since early 2014.Box reported second-quarter earnings that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 28% to $122.9 million, beating the consensus estimate of $122 million. Adjusted earnings of an 11-cent loss beat the consensus estimate of a 13-cent loss. Box shares fell 2.7% for the week.RELATED:Box Second-Quarter Revenue And Earnings Top ViewsNew CEO Dara Khosrowshahi promised changes to take the ride-sharing pioneer to the next level and set an IPO timeline of 18 to 36 months.

Uber's board took more than two months to settle on a new chief, following the exit of co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick amid accusations of discrimination, sexual harassment and mismanagement.Finish Line (FINL) crashed nearly 17%, hitting an 8-year low during the week, after the sporting goods retailer slashed its full-year profit and same-store sales outlook, saying that the athletic footwear business ""became much more promotional"" over the second quarter. The forecast followed weak quarterly showings from Foot Locker (FL), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Hibbett Sports (HIBB). The news follows the retail sector's struggles with online shopping and this summer's agreement between Amazon and Nike (NKE), in which the shoemaker would test out the sale of some products directly on Amazon. Nike and Under Armour (UAA) shares fell sharply.The teen-centric discount retailer's second-quarter results beat estimates, with Five Below (FIVE) citing a continued ""notable contribution from the spinner trend,"" and it hiked its full-year outlook. Value retailer Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) also beat Q2 estimates and raised its outlook. Dollar General (DG) revenue and same-store sales beat, but its Q2 EPS and higher full-year profit outlook missed expectations.

135,GILD,"MacroGenics (MGNX) toppled Friday after Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) terminated an agreement to develop a cancer treatment that would have rivaled drugs from Gilead Sciences (GILD)/Kite Pharma (KITE) and Novartis (NVS).XIn midday trading on the stock market today, MacroGenics dove as much as 11.5% to a six-week low, but was down 1.8% to close at 18.57. Johnson & Johnson fell 1% to finish at 131.03.J&J cited increasing competition in the space as well as neurotoxicity associated with the drug, duvortuxizumab, for its decision to bail out of the pact. Duvortuxizumab showed anti-cancer activity in a Phase 1 trial, J&J noted.Duvortuxizumab belongs to a class of drugs, known as bispecific antibodies, which stimulate an immune cell and direct it to a targeted antigen. The drug is being investigated as a potential treatment for several lymphomas and leukemias.""While bispecific antibodies hold tremendous promise, we think this news highlights some of the remaining development challenges for these agents, in particular in the context of the recent emergence of highly effective CAR-T cell therapies,"" Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said.IBD'S TAKE: Novartis was first to gain approval for a CAR-T therapy, but others are just on its tail. Get the scoop on how the major players break down by visiting IBD Industry Themes.CAR-T drugs are created by extracting immune cells from a patient, and then reprogramming them to fight cancer before reintroducing them to the patient. In some cases, bispecific antibodies and CAR-T drugs have the same targets, Schmidt said in a note to clients.Earlier this week, Novartis (NVS) was the first to gain approval for a CAR-T treatment. Kite, which is being acquired by Gilead, is expected to be next. Celgene (CELG) is also partnered separately with Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) on CAR-T drugs.""How various bispecific antibody platforms currently in development differentiate clinically remains unknown,"" Schmidt said.MacroGenics has a total of seven bispecific antibody programs which have entered Phase 1 trials in recent years. It's possible bispecific antibodies could be more potent in treating solid tumors, an area that remains challenging for CAR-T drugs, Schmidt said.Schmidt reiterated his outperform rating on MacroGenics. He doesn't expect MacroGenics to continue developing duvortuxizumab in the wake of competition from CAR-T drugs and other therapies in cancers that affect what are known as B cells.RELATED:Celgene Flirts With A Breakout; Could These 2 Giants Soon Join It?Gilead-Kite Deal Boosts Biotech ETF As It Clears A Buy PointAnalysts Mixed On Gilead-Kite, But One Key Rival Stands To BenefitThese 4 Biotechs Just Moved Into Buy Zones; Is This Giant Next?How Novartis' Cancer Approval Validates Gilead's $11.9 Billion Kite Deal
"
136,GILD,"Novartis' (NVS) approval and $475,000 price tag for a key cancer treatment had the unusual effect of helping Gilead Sciences (GILD) ride high Thursday amid continued support for Gilead's $11.9 billion acquisition of rival Kite Pharma (KITE), which is developing a similar drug.Novartis' approval came just two days after Gilead said it would pay $180 per share to acquire Kite and pivot to similar cancer drugs in the wake of struggling hepatitis C drug sales. Novartis was first to get approval for what's known as a CAR-T cancer treatment, but the approval also validates Gilead's deal for Kite, which is also developing a CAR-T drug.Also Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved a drug from Roche's (RHHBY) Genentech to treat cytokine-release syndrome, a common side effect of CAR-T therapy presenting with a fever that can sometimes be fatal.Cytokine-release syndrome is caused by an overactive immune system, Genentech explained. It can happen after CAR-T therapy in which a patient's own immune cells are extracted and reprogrammed to seek out and destroy cancer.""Until today, there has never been an FDA-approved treatment to manage severe cytokine-release syndrome associated with CAR-T cell therapy, which is marked by a rapid onset and can cause life-threatening complications,"" Genentech Chief Medical Officer Sandra Horning said in a release.IBD'S TAKE: Novartis was the first to gain approval for a CAR-T drug, but other players are on the horizon. Head to IBD Industry Themes for how the battle might break down as Kite/Gilead, Juno and Bluebird each aim for approvals in the emerging sector.All told, it creates a perfect storm for Gilead and other CAR-T drug players, according to Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments. Kite's drug is expected to get approval later this fall with various drugs from Celgene (CELG) and partners Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) just behind.""With new technology for certain diseases, it's not a stretch to start using the word cure,"" Loncar told Investor's Business Daily. ""They're not thinking about alleviating the symptoms of these diseases, they're thinking about fixing the genetic mutations that cause the disease.""The technology looks promising in several different blood cancers today. Novartis will charge $475,000 for its one-time CAR-T treatment for a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25. Kite's drug is being reviewed as a treatment for an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.Gilead, though, sees cell therapy like CAR-T as becoming ""the cornerstone of treating cancer."" That's a big claim, Loncar says. And this is just the first iteration of CAR-T therapies.""The results so far in these initial cancers are truly amazing,"" he said. ""They're taking patients who have weeks or months to live and, in some cases, are reaching complete remissions. I've never seen anything like that before.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, Gilead lifted 3% 83.71. Novartis, meanwhile, rose 1.9%, near 84.29. Kite ticked up 9 cents to close at 177.99.Biotech stocks have broadly risen 4.3% this week as of Wednesday's close and were up 1.3% in early trading, fulfilling predictions that an acquisition by Gilead could help spike the sector.

137,GILD,"Stocks opened higher Monday as markets registered only mild initial financial effects of the ongoing flooding that has shut down much of the Texas coast.XThe Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each opened 0.2% higher. The Nasdaq composite also climbed 0.2%.Hurricane Harvey swept in as a category 4 storm late Friday to cause wind damage along the south Texas coast, followed by historical levels of rain-induced flooding of cities north to Houston — the U.S. energy capital and fourth-largest city. The storm was downgraded to tropical storm status, relieving the threat of wind damage, but is projected to continue to deluge the already saturated Houston area with record levels of rainfall.Oil prices dropped almost 1% and gasoline futures surged nearly 4% as refinery operators inspected for possible damage after shutdowns ahead of the storm. About 10 refineries representing an estimated 2.2 million barrels a day of capacity shut down in response to the storm, including flagship facilities owned by Exxon Mobil (XOM) , Valero Energo (VLO)  and Phillips 66 (PSX), according to S&P Platts.All three stocks traded higher at the open. A number of pipelines in the region halted operations, and ports in Corpus Christi and Houston appeared to remain closed to inbound and outbound traffic Monday.

139,GILD,"AbbVie (ABBV) threw ""the gauntlet down"" to Gilead Sciences (GILD) with the approval of a hepatitis C drug that could further hammer Gilead's multibillion-dollar franchise, an analyst said Friday.XLate Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration approved AbbVie's drug dubbed Mavyret with a coveted eight-week label for all genotypes of hepatitis C patients — most hepatitis C drugs are taken over a 12-week period. AbbVie is pricing the treatment at $26,400 for eight weeks, at a deeper discount than two prominent drugs now being prescribed for the condition: Gilead's Harvoni and Epclusa.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges estimates Mavyret will be offered at a 14% discount to what Gilead sees in revenue for a prescribed course of Harvoni and at a 63% discount to Epclusa.""This competitive dynamic, now solidified by the FDA, agrees with our forecasted market share and price erosion for Gilead, and our modeled rebound of AbbVie's hepatitis C revenue beginning in 2018,"" Porges wrote in a note to clients.Porges called for Gilead to remain competitive in the 75% of patients where Harvoni can be given for eight weeks, but it will still lose some share there based on contracts with payers. Two populations of patients treated with Mavyret will undergo treatment for 12-16 weeks.Other patients will likely migrate to Mavyret based on the convenience of the eight-week regimen, he predicted. Gilead's drugs Epclusa and Vosevi are dosed over 12 weeks. Harvoni is prescribed 12-24 weeks, but some patients can be treated in eight weeks.IBD'S TAKE: Whether Gilead makes an acquisition could be the linchpin in sending the biotech sector higher, one industry observer says. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at which companies Gilead might be considering.Mavyret's broad label gives AbbVie access to the vast majority of hepatitis C patients, with the exception of those who've failed on some drugs from Dow components Merck (MRK) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and a drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).The FDA is not requiring genotype testing ""which is a big advantage over Gilead and other participants in the market,"" he wrote. But Mavyret does have a black box warning on its label for the risk of hepatitis B reactivation in patients with both infections.Patients will undergo pretreatment testing for hepatitis B infection and then monitoring if they are found to have both hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Porges says this isn't a significant burden as most hepatitis C patients will have already been screened for hepatitis B.AbbVie will likely focus early efforts on the government segment where Mavyret's wholesale price is in line with Harvoni but undercuts Epclusa.""Conversely, for AbbVie, this pricing means that the revenue contribution from Mavyret is likely to be limited, and largely consistent with our existing forecast,"" he said.On the stock market today, AbbVie closed flat at 70.99. Gilead fell 1.6% to 73.16.RELATED:Gilead Could Be Making An Acquisition — But It's Not What You ThinkGilead's Hepatitis C Franchise Topples Again, But Shares Up On BeatHow AbbVie Could Hammer Gilead's Hepatitis C Franchise

140,GILD,"GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) stock dipped near a two-week low Monday after Gilead Sciences (GILD) said its HIV drug combination proved to be on par with Glaxo's in a late-stage, head-to-head trial.The trials tested Gilead's HIV drug, known as bictegravir, in combination with two other drugs against regimens containing Glaxo's dolutegravir in patients with HIV-1 who had never undergone treatment. Bictegravir-containing treatments proved to be virtually the same in effectiveness statistics to regimens using dolutegravir by week 48, Gilead said in a news release. The bictegravir combo was successful in 92.4% of patients, just behind the 93% of patients who saw success on one of the dolutegravir regimens.""These results suggest that the combination of bictegravir with FTC/TAF has the potential to be appropriate for a broad range of HIV patients, including those with mild to moderate renal impairment, said Dr. Paul Sax, lead author of the study, in a statement.In a second study, the bictegravir combo was successful in 89.4% of patients at week 48 vs. success for 92.9% of patients treated with dolutegravir plus FTC/TAF. But, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat noted, neither result was statistically significant.Gilead is looking to HIV drugs as its next franchise in the face of dwindling hepatitis C drug sales. The firm has referred to bictegravir as its ""Mount Everest."" On the stock market today, Glaxo shares fell 1% to close at 42.24, nearing a low last seen July 11. Meanwhile, Gilead lifted 0.9% to finish at 74.39.IBD'S TAKE: Attitudes in Washington, D.C., are proving more biotech-friendly in addition to a number of strong clinical trial results lately. But mergers and acquisitions could send the biotech industry into the stratosphere, says one industry observer. Could Gilead be the linchpin? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at who Gilead might buy and why.No patients taking either treatment developed a resistance to any of the drugs, which is important, Raffat said in a note to clients. The ""single most important takeaway is that bictegravir's Phase 3 data positions it in the same realm of high barrier to resistance as dolutegravir,"" he said.Patients treated with the bictegravir regimen experienced a statistically significant reduction in nausea vs. the dolutegravir regime. Just 10% of bictegravir patients report nausea vs. 23% for dolutegravir patients.Says Raffat: ""Overall, data are in-line and bictegravir will be the foundation of Gilead's HIV franchise in the 2020s.""RELATED:How AbbVie Could Hammer Gilead's Hepatitis C FranchiseVertex Hits Record High On Results Of Cystic Fibrosis TrialCould This Biotech Stir Takeover Interest After Cancer Drug Approval

142,GILD,"AbbVie (ABBV) is likely to swipe significant hepatitis C drug share from Gilead Sciences (GILD) with an eight-week regimen — four weeks shorter than a triple-pill treatment from Gilead, an analyst said Wednesday.The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved Gilead's combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir as a 12-week regimen for patients of all genotypes. The combo has been recommended for approval as an eight-week course in Europe. It is approved in the U.S. for patients who've already tried one drug.Meanwhile, AbbVie's combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir looks likely to gain approval as an eight-week regimen in all genotypes of hepatitis C and in patients who've never undergone treatment. Gilead's Harvoni is approved as an eight-week regimen, but only in one subset of patients.""This label places Gilead at a competitive disadvantage to their rival AbbVie, since AbbVie is likely to get approval for all genotypes for an eight-week course,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. Approval of one genotype is uncertain, he noted.Gilead is pricing its triple-pill, which will be branded as Vosevi, at $24,920 per bottle. At one bottle per month, that runs up to a 12-week price of about $75,000. That is less costly than Gilead's Harvoni and Sovaldi, but more expensive than Zepatier from Dow component Merck (MRK).IBD'S TAKE: As its Hepatitis C drug franchise declines, Gilead has said it would be open to an acquisition in the cancer space. But another biotech buy could be a better purchase, says one analyst. Visit IBD's Technology page for a closer look at what Gilead might buy and why.Most patients will take Vosevi after failing to respond to Harvoni, Zepatier or AbbVie's two-drug combination. AbbVie's drug, on the other hand, is likely to grab approval as a regimen for patients who have never undergone treatment.Porges expects AbbVie to price its two-pill drug like its Viekira Pak, another hepatitis C combination that goes for about $28,000 per month. AbbVie will aggressively market the two-drug combo against Gilead's Harvoni and Epclusa, he said.""This strategy is likely to result in significant market share for AbbVie, given the convenience and excellent efficacy of their two-drug combination,"" he said in a note to clients.Porges forecasts $140 million in U.S. sales for Vosevi for the second half of 2017 and $300 million per year until 2020, when he expects to see a gradual decline. Outside the U.S., he expects Vosevi to pull in $600 million to $700 million annually from 2018-21.At the same time, Porges models Gilead's Harvoni and Epclusa as losing market share to AbbVie. He calls for Gilead's hepatitis C drug franchise to represent just 12% of total sales by 2021, falling from half of all sales in 2016.On the stock market today, Gilead shares climbed 1.45 to close at 72.72. AbbVie popped 0.8% to finish at 72.77.RELATED:Vertex Hits Record High On Results Of Cystic Fibrosis TrialCould This Biotech Stir Takeover Interest After Cancer Drug Approval?'Stars Align' For These Biotechs To Crush Earnings Consensus
"
143,GILD,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) stock blasted to a record high Wednesday on Phase 1 and 2 trial data for triple-pill regimens that should have cystic fibrosis patients ""breathing easy,"" according to one analyst.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Vertex had catapulted 20.8% to 159.69, after earlier running up more than 26% in heavy volume. Shares hit an all-time high, helping biotech stocks gap up a collective 1.1%.The stock launch followed Vertex's announcement late Tuesday of better-than-expected results in three trials testing drugs known as VX-152, VX-440 and VX-659 combined with two other cystic fibrosis drugs. Patients treated with the combinations were better able to forcefully expel air, on average.Vertex is likely to advance one triple-pill regimen into Phase 3 trials in 2018. Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young suggested Vertex could gain accelerated approval for the triple-pill in 2018 with Phase 3 trials acting as confirmatory studies.""In terms of accelerated approval, we think the question will come down to the size of the safety database since the next-generation correctors are a novel mechanism of action,"" she wrote in a note to clients. Vertex is looking at four possible combinations.The triple-pill regimen aims to treat underlying genetic mutations associated with cystic fibrosis, a lung condition. Analysts broadly expect shorter trials in a population of 24,000 patients with a specific mutation for whom there are limited treatment options.Vertex is now about 1.5 years ahead of prior estimates and 2.5 years ahead of potential competition, says Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay. Fellow biotech Galapagos (GLPG) is also working on a triple-pill regimen for cystic fibrosis.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex's big move up landed the biotech on IBD's Leaderboard on Wednesday. The company now holds an IBD Composite Rating of 98, meaning it outranks 98% of other stocks on the market.""Clearly there are outstanding questions on which of the four compounds advance into the pivotal program, but this is a high-class problem to have based on the efficacy and tolerability profile thus far,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Chattopadhyay calls for the triple-pill combination to add $4 billion to the company's sales by 2025 and sees Vertex's cystic fibrosis franchise approaching peak sales of $7.5 billion, expanding at a compound annual growth rate of 19%.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges boosted his price target on Vertex stock to 188 from 132 and sees Vertex as 100% likely to succeed in two types of cystic fibrosis patients with specific genetic mutations, up from 80% previously.Porges forecasts Vertex launching a triple-pill in 2020 vs. earlier views for 2021. He models $1.9 billion in 2021 sales growing to $6.5 billion longer term. Overall sales of cystic fibrosis drugs are expected to reach $8.65 billion in 2025.Vertex will have to be cautious on how it prices the triple-pill, Porges said. He expects the regimen to cost about $164,000 in the U.S., which is lower than the $217,000 price for Vertex's Orkambi, a two-pill cystic fibrosis treatment.""Given the outcry concerning the existing prices of Vertex's combinations, and the larger addressable market for these products, we believe it is most prudent to forecast the company's revenue growth based on increases in patient adoption and treatment persistence, rather than by forecasting product price upgrades,"" he said.Credit Suisse's Young and Janney's Chattopadhyay see Vertex as a potential takeover candidate in the wake of the strong cystic fibrosis trial data Tuesday. Chattopadhyay calls Vertex ""the most logical large-cap (merger) target.""Young sees $220-$240 per share, at a total price of $55 billion to $60 billion, as a fair value to buy Vertex. Vertex has a market cap of $40.3 billion. Gilead Sciences (GILD) has been suggested as a potential acquirer.RELATED:Vertex Catapults 24% On Strong Trial For Cystic Fibrosis DrugGilead Could Acquire This Biotech — But Vertex Is Still Better: AnalystEven An Upgrade Couldn't Save Vertex From The Biotech Deluge

144,GILD,"Novartis (NVS) was the first drugmaker to cross the finish line in developing cancer treatments known as CAR-T drugs Wednesday after the Food and Drug Administration approved its drug, Kymriah, for children and adults with a type of bone marrow cancer.XKymriah, a cell-based gene therapy, was approved to treat patients up to age 25 with what's called B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Its approval is likely to set the stage for the FDA to approve a slew of CAR-T drugs over the next several years.""We're entering a new frontier in medical innovation with the ability to reprogram a patient's own cells to attack a deadly cancer,"" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a news release following the approval. ""New technologies such as gene and cell therapies hold out the potential to transform medicine and create an inflection point in our ability to treat and even cure many intractable illnesses.""The approval comes days after Gilead Sciences (GILD) announced its $11.9 billion plan to acquire Kite Pharma (KITE), which is also closing in on approval of a CAR-T therapy. In this treatment, immune cells are extracted from a patient and reprogrammed to fight cancer.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks broadly dipped in mid-August, but have since rallied to be up 2.3% this month. Could this be an inflection point needed to top an earlier chill outlined in IBD Industry Themes?Analysts expect Kite's drug to grab approval to treat an aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma later this year. Analysts see Juno Therapeutics' (JUNO) drug getting approval next year, followed closely by Celgene (CELG) partner Bluebird Bio (BLUE).But by the closing bell on the stock market today, Novartis dropped 1.1% to 82.74, while Gilead spiked 7.3% to close at 81.23. Kite was at a relative standstill, down marginally to 177.90.

145,GILD,"BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) hit a three-week high Wednesday in the wake of the Food and Drug Administration's decision to review the biotech company's application for a rare-disease drug.XThe FDA said late Tuesday it would accept the application, also granting BioMarin priority review for its drug known as pegvaliase. Pegvaliase is a treatment for a rare disorder in which a missing enzyme leads to the buildup of an amino acid in the blood. This can result in a variety of mental, behavioral, neurological and physical problems, BioMarin says.""Investors have been cautious on pegvaliase (effectiveness) and safety profile thus far, but we believe tonight's news (Tuesday) may begin to thaw investor sentiment particularly aided by the FDA's decision to grant priority review,"" Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said.The potential approval date of Feb. 28 is likely to get pushed back to May, however, as the FDA requested additional information regarding chemistry, manufacturing and controls, he wrote in a note to clients.Phase 3 data for pegvaliase showed a meaningful reduction in the specific amino acid, but BioMarin has noted injection site reactions associated with the treatment, he said. This could prompt the FDA to run a panel to determine the risk/benefit of the drug.""At this point, we will have to wait and see if the agency gives further pushback,"" Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs stocks are up more than 2% this month after Gilead Sciences' announcement this week that it would acquire Kite Pharma. An industry observer said in July an acquisition by Gilead could spike the sector Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on how this theory could pan out.Leerink's Schwartz sees a 60% probability of success for pegvaliase and assumes $530 million in peak sales in 2029, though that ""may be conservative."" He expects BioMarin to enter the market in 2018 with a respective 1,600 and 1,500 patients in the U.S. and Europe.By the closing bell on the stock market today, BioMarin had popped 5.6% to finish at 87.65, after earlier rising as much as 7.2% to its highest point in three weeks. Broadly, biotech shares hit their highest mark since July 25, up 1.5%.Another riser included Bluebird Bio (BLUE), which jumped 9.9% to close at 112.50 after Novartis (NVS) gained approval for a CAR-T drug. This will likely help Gilead Sciences (GILD)/KitePharma (KITE), and Celgene (CELG) partners Bluebird and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) to gain similar approvals in the future.RELATED:Novartis' CAR-T Drug Win Helps Gilead To Spike Post Kite DealBiotech Nears Zero On Dizzying Plunge After Failed Vertigo TrialThis Biotech Got A Price Hike, But Seesawed After A Three-Day Run

146,GILD,"Analysts were mixed Tuesday on Gilead Sciences' (GILD) $11.9 billion takeout of Kite Pharma (KITE), but one thing is certain, they said — rivals Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) stand to benefit from the headlines.XNovartis (NVS) and Kite are expected to gain Food and Drug Administration approval this fall for blood cancer drugs known as CAR-T treatments. But Celgene (CELG) partners Juno and Bluebird are just behind, Wedbush analyst David Nierengarten wrote in a note to clients.""We believe Juno and Bluebird, the two leading independent CAR-T developers, are obvious (acquisition) plays following Kite's takeout,"" he said. Other earlier-stage potential targets include Intellia (NTLA), Fate Therapeutics (FATE) and Tesaro (TSRO).Juno stock rushed to a 14-month high midday on the stock market today, popping 20.1% to 43.81, reaching a high last seen in June 2016. Bluebird, though, sank 3.7% to end the trading session at 102.40. Gilead climbed 1.4% to 75.74 while Kite slipped 0.1% to 177.95. Novartis lifted 0.4% to 83.62.All are working on treatments in which a patient's own immune cells are reprogrammed to seek out and destroy cancer. Novartis's CAR-T treatment looks likely to gain approval to treat a bone marrow cancer, followed closely by Kite with a treatment for an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.IBD'S TAKE: The biotech sector closed up 2.5% on Monday, helped by news of Gilead's deal for Kite. Head to The Big Picture for more on how Gilead-Kite boosted the sector and what other sectors rode up Monday.Nierengarten boosted his price target on Juno to 42 from 24 and upgraded the stock to an outperform rating from neutral. Juno closely rivals Kite with a CAR-T drug known as JCAR017. Gilead's entry into the space will likely help boost the adoption rate for JCAR017, he said.He expects Juno's JCAR017 to grab FDA approval before year's end in 2018 and doesn't see a lasting disadvantage to being later to market. The initial launch of Gilead/Kite's drug, known as axicabtagene ciloleucel, will be hung up on investments in transplant centers and reimbursement talks.""We believe Juno could capitalize on Gilead's and Novartis' efforts with its later arrival,"" he said. ""We see JCAR017's profile as sufficiently differentiated in both efficacy and safety to enable for broader adoption relative to axicabtagene ciloleucel.""Nierengarten forecasts peak $2 billion in U.S. sales for Juno's CAR-T drugs in blood cancers, exceeding his expectations for peak U.S. sales of Gilead/Kite's drugs in blood cancers. He sees Juno's drugs as being the preferred choice over Novartis' and Gilead/Kite's.But ""any way you cut it, the Kite deal is expensive,"" Nierengarten said. The deal values Kite at seven times peak sales expectations of $1.7 billion for axicabtagene ciloleucel. This compares to the typical four-times-sales takeout for biotech.""We do not believe another buyer will emerge for Kite, as (the) price point indicates Gilead is not dealing from a position of strength,"" he wrote. The long-term rationale assumes Kite's drug will be able to expand into other cancers.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges classified the deal as ""hardly a surprise, hardly a triumph and hardly transformative."" He kept his market perform rating on Gilead but cut his price target to 82 from 83.""While this pivot may represent a new look for Gilead, and perhaps Kite is well positioned in the CAR-T space, we do not believe this changes the underlying fundamentals that have plagued Gilead's stock over the past two years,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Gilead has been under pressure to buy something as its hepatitis C drug franchise has begun declining amid high cure rates. Still, the drivers for Gilead's outlook remain hepatitis C and HIV treatments, Porges said.Kite will do little to fend off expected revenue declines of $27 billion and $24 billion in 2017 and by 2019, respectively, for Gilead. Axicabtagene ciloleucel and related products are only expected to add a respective $500 million, $1 billion and $2.5 billion in 2019, 2021 and 2026 to Gilead's top line.""With inevitable stumbles and logistical snafus, and the ultimately uncertain dynamics of single treatment markets, it is hard to see axicabtagene ciloleucel providing much revenue to offset this erosion,"" he said.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young, though, likes the Kite deal. She reiterated her outperform rating on Gilead stock and boosted her price target to 85 from 79.""We think this deal marks the beginning of a new chapter,"" she wrote in a note to clients. ""At a minimum it lifts an overhand around the question, 'What is Gilead going to do?'""RELATED:Why Investors Are Mute On Gilead's Acquisition Of Kite PharmaGilead Sciences Will Buy Kite Pharma For $11.9 BillionHow Novartis' FDA Win In Cancer Also Could Be A Boon For Its RivalsThe Cure For Cancer?

147,GILD,"Kite Pharma (KITE) won't be Gilead Sciences' (GILD) next Pharmasset, an analyst said Monday after Gilead announced the $11.9 billion merger — sending Kite stock into the stratosphere.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Kite rocketed 28% to finish at near 178.05, hitting a record high about three years after it filed its initial public offering. But Gilead stock was less enthusiastic, rising 1.2% to close at 74.69.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat says there's no guarantee acquiring Kite will be as transformative for Gilead as its $11 billion bet on Pharmasset in 2011. The Pharmasset deal gave Gilead access to a key drug that kicked off its blockbuster hepatitis C franchise.""Both deals are generally comparable in size, and the enormous commercial success of Pharmasset deal is still very fresh in investors' eyes,"" Raffat wrote in a note to clients.But Pharmasset was the clear leader in its class, whereas Kite is just one in a pack of companies working on what are known as CAR-T therapies, which harnesses the body's own immune system to fight cancer. Novartis (NVS), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE)/Celgene (CELG) are also working in this arena.Further, the logistics are different. Hepatitis C drugs are pills taken once daily. In CAR-T therapies, a patient's blood is drawn into a vial and then the immune system cells are reprogrammed to fight cancer before being reintroduced to the body. That requires a specific infrastructure, Raffat noted.And there's no proof of concept in the ""blue sky scenario."" Kite is trailing Novartis in CAR-T therapies with both expected to gain approvals in blood cancers later this year. But the firms have yet to prove a similar concept in solid tumors called T-cell receptor technology.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks have slowed down from a July spike as long-term views on several players look dim. Could Gilead's acquisition of Kite help them recover? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.Still, ""the true inflection points in the Kite story are yet to come,"" he said. Kite is closing in on approval of its drug, axicabtagene ciloleucel, to treat an aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It will have first-mover advantage in that setting.The deal is set to close in the fourth quarter, Gilead said in a news release. This means ""2018 will now become a very important year,"" Raffat said. The ""Street will be very focused on validating this purchase.""Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says the consensus is calling for Kite's drug to reach $1.6 billion in peak sales by 2022. He sees three initial approvals in blood and bone marrow cancers, and notes trials are ongoing in three other blood cancers.""The transaction is not a complete surprise"" given earlier commentary, he wrote in a note to clients. The 30% premium on Kite's stock after shares have risen 210% year to date ""is bracing and suggests that Gilead is expecting revenue of $2 billion to $3 billion from Kite's CAR-T platform.""Kite was already on the short-list as a potential acquisition for Gilead. In the first quarter, Gilead had said it wanted to do a deal in cancer, and analysts suggested Kite, Incyte (INCY), Tesaro (TSRO) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) could be on the list.But as recently as several weeks ago, Kite Chief Executive John Milligan reportedly said the firm ""might end up doing nothing in oncology"" if the right deal doesn't present itself. The Street has been pushing Gilead to make a deal as its hepatitis C drug sales have begun to decline.Gilead's key strategy going forward will be ""cell therapy."" The firm has suggested it could seek to buy assets to enhance CAR-T engineering or immuno-oncology drugs to augment its drugs in different combinations.RELATED:Gilead Sciences Will Buy Kite Pharma For $11.9 BillionWhy Gilead Might Do 'Nothing In Oncology' As Key Drugs ToppleHow Novartis' FDA Win In Cancer Also Could Be A Boon For Its Rivals

It tracks the Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index, which comprises companies with an 'economic moat,' or sustainable competitive advantage. Morningstar Inc. defines an economic moat as ""how likely a company is to keep competitors at bay for an extended period."" The fund researcher looks for traits such as intangible assets, cost advantage and efficient scale.The biggest sector weightings in MOAT as of Aug. 4 included health care at about 34%, consumer cyclical at 22% and financial services at 15%.

150,GILD,"These are salad days for the biotech sector, as a number of industry leaders are hitting new highs and the group as a whole is near the top of its game in terms of stock performance.XStock inflows hit $1.6 billion over the last four weeks, and there have been a number of clinical trial successes and a new industry-friendly Food and Drug Administration regime is in place.As a result, Investors Business Daily's 439-company Biotech industry group has clawed its way to No. 4 out of 197 groups tracked by IBD from sixth just last week. Shares look likely to close at an 18-month high on the stock market today. And that's before a slew of earnings next week.""Just about everything that could be going right for biotech lately has been going right,"" Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments, told IBD on Friday. The onslaught of biotech earnings next week could really give investors some fodder, he said.But there's one thing missing, says Loncar: mergers and acquisitions.""If that last piece fits into the puzzle, then the biotech sector could really be cooking with gas,"" he said.Gilead Sciences (GILD) is the likely linchpin. Loncar calls Gilead the ""poster child"" for a large biotech that needs to do a deal. In 2016, Gilead's multibillion-dollar hepatitis C drug franchise toppled for the first time. Now, Gilead says it's interested in a deal in the cancer space.Though some analysts have keyed in on Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) as a smart acquisition, Loncar sees Gilead as more likely to buy an early cancer asset — something it can develop and commercialize, rather than putting its money to work on buying a developed revenue stream.Vertex is already a hugely successful biotech in its own right, he said. Earlier this year, Vertex delivered the best news this year in the space, he pointed out. It had ""exceptional results"" in Phase 1 and 2 trials looking at a triple-pill to treat cystic fibrosis. The stock gapped up nearly 21% on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Rare disease and cancer plays have been front and center in the biotech sector as of late. Could these cutting-edge firms keep the rally going? Head to the Industry Snapshot for a deeper dive.""That's a multibillion-dollar stock,"" Loncar said. ""When a company like Vertex goes up 20%, that's something everybody in the stock market notices.""Gilead is set to report its second-quarter earnings Wednesday. But it will be sandwiched among a slew of strong contenders in the biotech space including Celgene (CELG), Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN).No. 1 biotech Celgene is slated to report its second-quarter earnings before the open Thursday. The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 99, leading its 438 peers and is sitting at a high last seen in July 2015.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says Celgene and Alexion will be bellwethers for the group this time, in the same way Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is often seen as a proxy for the pharmaceutical group. He calls for Celgene to beat and raise, and for Alexion to rise by topping low views.Alexion is slated for Thursday. On Tuesday, Amgen could overtake a four-month high and jump to a record high if its second-quarter earnings report proves strong. Shares broke out of a cup-with-handle on July 13 at a 175.55 buy point and still remain in a buy zone.This trio could help catapult the sector, analysts say. Meanwhile, on the pharma side, investors will key in to AstraZeneca (AZN) early Thursday. In recent weeks rumors have emerged that Chief Executive Pascal Soriot could jump ship for Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA).Loncar notes that the timing of those rumors were bad for AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca is set ""any day now"" to report the results of an immuno-oncology combination trial in lung cancer. Lung cancer treatment is a huge commercial opportunity and AstraZeneca is taking on players like Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).""Regardless of these rumors and controversy, I do think it's not an overstatement to say Pascal Soriot's job is on the line with (the trial) because this is make or break for AstraZeneca,"" he said. ""This study is the most important thing for AstraZeneca in the last 10 years.""Though biotech stocks are up 22.5% for the year, there's still room to run, CFRA Research analyst Jeffrey Loo told Investor's Business Daily. Valuations hit historic lows in 2016 amid the presidential election, and are still below both the S&P 500 and the overall health care sector.""Relative to historical valuations, the biotech sector is still attractively priced,"" he said.In late June, the sector got a massive push after President Donald Trump released a draft proposal on drug pricing. The initiative didn't include much to really tug down on drug prices, Loo said. He didn't credit the entire gain to the proposal, but it certainly helped, Loo said.Clinical trials, near-term FDA approvals and strong launch trends have also helped prod the sector this year including the cystic fibrosis news from Vertex, a gene therapy from Novartis (NVS) and a Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug from Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT).On the latter development, Loncar says Sarepta's $13 million second-quarter sales beat for Exondys 51 could bode well for the broader sector. Sarepta also raised guidance for the year which most analysts have called conservative.""Everybody was watching that for a sign as to how drug launches are going and how payors are pushing back on things,"" he said. ""The fact the launch (of Exondys 51) is going well is a good sign not just for Sarepta, but for all biotech companies.""RELATED:Biotechs Find Strength In Numbers In Treating Multiple SclerosisToo Late To Catch Biotech Rally As Trump Fears Subside?Biotech Rally Gets Second Wind As This Small Cap Nears Break OutWhy The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% Upside

151,GILD,"Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) stock rocketed to a 22-month high Tuesday on takeover speculation after the Food and Drug Administration approved the firm's breast cancer drug, Nerlynx.XOn the stock market today, Puma stock jumped 8.5% to close at 93.45 after earlier rising as much as 13% and touching a high last seen in September 2015. That ran counter to the biotech sector, which lost nearly 1% as a group.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young sees Puma generating interest in a takeover, after the approval of Nerlynx to treat early stage breast cancer in patients who tumors respond to certain hormones. Nerlynx would follow trastuzumab-based treatment. Trastuzumab sells under the brand name Herceptin, a chemotherapy from Roche (RHHBY).""We think that (an acquisition) remains the likely outcome from here,"" Young wrote in a note to clients. She boosted her price target on Puma stock to 118 from 90, though kept her outperform rating.The approval removes an overhang for Puma, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said in a research report. FDA approval came ahead of its scheduled July 21 date and includes a broad label, meaning Puma can treat more patients than expected.Prescribing information also contains detailed information about using an anti-diarrhea medication to treat the most common side effect of Nerlynx. The label doesn't include a black box warning, which could have weakened its launch, Schmidt noted.Schmidt models $1.3 billion in peak U.S. sales of Nerlynx and sees the consensus view for $215 million in 2018 sales as easily achievable. Like Young, he noted the potential for a takeover, which could help boost Puma stock.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs are looking likely to crush the consensus in the second quarter. Head to IBD's Technology page for a breakdown of which stocks look strong heading into earnings season.He has an outperform rating on Puma stock.RBC analyst Matthew Eckler is slightly more bullish. He views 2027 sales hitting a peak of $1.7 billion worldwide. Puma expects a decision regarding its marketing application in Europe in the third quarter.But Eckler has a sector-perform rating on Puma stock. The requirement for anti-diarrhea medicine could ""temper uptake in less motivated/lower risk patients,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Like Schmidt and Young, he noted the significant potential for a takeover as a ""single-asset oncology company with an FDA-approved drug.""

152,GILD,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are most likely to beat Wall Street views for June quarter sales and profits, an analyst said Monday.XLeerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says the ""stars align for widespread beats in Q2 biopharma results."" Among large caps, he also sees AbbVie (ABBV), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead as most likely to top revenue expectations.Quarter over quarter, though, sales from AbbVie, Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Biogen and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are likely to be slow, he said.""Both AbbVie and Biogen are facing competition and pricing pressures, while Alexion and Vertex are still high-growth companies with temporary slowing in their revenue growth trajectory pending new indications, formulations or products,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Health tracker IMS sees AbbVie's leukemia drug Imbruvica and testosterone gel AndroGel as likely to come in materially north of the consensus, with immunosuppressant Humira landing about 0.6% above Street views. But other major projects are expected to miss.IMS data suggest Biogen's multiple-sclerosis drugs Tysabri and Tecfidera could beat Porges' estimates by 18.2% and 1.8%, respectively. Tecfidera, however, is expected to miss the Street by 1.3% and MS drugs Plegridy and Avonex are forecast to be light.This comes amid growing competition in the MS field from the likes of Roche (RHHBY), Novartis (NVS) and Sanofi (SNY). Roche's drug, Ocrevus, was approved earlier this year to treat both relapsing-remitting as well as primary progressive MS — a first for the industry.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks are ranked No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, as sentiment ticks up ahead of the second-quarter earnings season. Make sure to bookmark IBD's Biotech Stocks To Watch And Pharma Industry News for the latest on the sector.Major drugs from Celgene are expected to top the consensus by 4.9% with chemotherapy Revlimid likely to come in 5.1% above the consensus, Porges wrote. Pomalyst, a drug to treat a blood cancer, is expected to be 5.8% higher than the consensus.Gilead is likely to be the biggest second-quarter surprise. Per IMS data, Gilead's sales could top by 10%, ""though this is largely dependent upon the reliability of recent hepatitis C data, which have been unreliable in the past."" Hepatitis C drug sales toppled in 2016 amid high cure rates.Without accounting for highly variable sales of hepatitis C drugs, Gilead's total sales would miss Porges' forecast by 0.1% and the analyst consensus target by 1.7%. At the same time, Gilead's Genvoya, an HIV drug, could beat the consensus by 7%-9%, Porges wrote in a note to clients.Amgen (AMGN) is most likely to match or slightly underperform the consensus, Porges said. Rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel is expected to be in line with consensus views, though it could top Porges' view by as much as 1.9%, per IMS data.Bone health drug Prolia and bone marrow stimulating Aranesp are projected to beat by 6%-7%, which could help offset expected sales misses by bone health drug Xgeva and other bone marrow stimulant drugs, Porges said.""However, the changing price dynamic for many of Amgen's products makes the IMS adjustment factors less reliable,"" Porges wrote. He calls for Amgen to hike some of its prices in July after bumping the price of cancer drug Kyprolis by 3.9% in April.On the adjusted profits per share side, Gilead has a chance to beat consensus views by 11.1%, Porges said. Regeneron and Vertex could also top expectations by 8.1% and 7%, respectively.But Biogen could miss earnings views by 10.6% due to a one-time research-and-development expense not fully recognized across analysts' estimates, Porges said. AbbVie, too, is likely to miss adjusted earnings per share by 3.2%, he said.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech group was down fractionally.RELATED:Could Q2 Surprise Spike This Beleaguered Biotech's Stock?Gilead Could Acquire This Biotech — But Vertex Is Still Better: AnalystWhy This Biotech Could Be Poised For A Run After Toppling 52% In June

154,GILD,"Theravance Biopharma (TBPH) and Exelixis (EXEL) tick off most of the acquisition boxes for Big Pharma in an overview of the biotech merger picture, an analyst said Friday.X""Acquisition of biotech companies by pharma is an important theme for the space,"" Needham analyst Alan Carr said in a note to clients. ""We believe late development-stage and commercial-stage biotech companies are particularly attractive acquisition targets, in part due to reduced risk.""Of the companies Carr covers, Theravance could attract big pharmas like Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA). In total, Carr counts 21 companies that could be interested in buying Theravance based on research areas, business development interest and past acquisitions.Theravance has one approved drug, an antibiotic for hard-to-treat infections. Beyond that, Exelixis, Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO), Bavarian Nordic, Biohaven Pharmaceutical (BHVN) and Progenics Pharmaceuticals (PGNX) may be attracting the interest of 18 pharmaceuticals apiece.AbbVie, AstraZeneca (AZN), Novartis (NVS), Roche (RHHBY) and Dow stocks Pfizer (PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) could be the most acquisitive, based on Carr's criteria. Each has at least 20 potential targets.But some biotechs may stand a better chance of being acquired vs. others, Carr said. Since January 2014, there have been 37 acquisitions of public biotech companies involving a payment of more than $250 million upfront.More than half already had an approved drug and 78% had at least some Phase 3 data, Carr wrote. Oncology was a key target for U.S. and Japanese pharmas, while rare-disease plays are likely to be acquired at later stages.IBD'S TAKE: Last month, one of these potential acquisition targets jumped to an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 92 out of a best-possible 99. Today, it still has a rating of 90. Head to IBD Data Stories for a closer look at the stock and its catalysts.Rare diseases tend to be of interest to mid-specialty pharmas and biotechs, as traditional drugmakers are likely to avoid the drug-pricing controversy. Since January 2014, the only rare-disease firm snatched up was Actelion Pharmaceuticals by J&J.U.S. and European pharma acquired more later-stage biotechs vs. the less risk-adverse Japanese pharmas and Allergan (AGN). Big areas of interest included central nervous system, rare diseases and oncology which accounted for 22%, 19% and 16% of acquisitions, respectively.Since January 2011, there have been 235 new chemical entry approvals by the Food and Drug Administration. Of the 65 small-to-midsize biotechs which gained this type of approval, 20 (31%) have been acquired. All of them already had a drug on the market at the time of the acquisition.""Many oncology companies, but few rare disease companies were acquired,"" he said.Gilead Sciences' (GILD) acquisition of Kite Pharma (KITE) could break that approval rule. Gilead announced its plan to spend $11.9 billion to buy Kite months ahead of the expected approval date of its first drug in a blood cancer. Novartis' rival treatment was approved days later.RELATED:This Small Biotech Launched To A 9-Month High Today — Here's WhyExelixis Recovers From Bristol-Inspired Pitfall In Kidney CancerBristol Dives But 'Still Has A Chance' In Kidney Cancer: Analyst

155,GILD,"Celgene (CELG) and AbbVie (ABBV) are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries of the inflammatory bowel disease market which is expanding at a rapid 20% clip, an analyst said Wednesday.XThe biologics market for these gastrointestinal diseases generated $9.2 billion in sales in 2016, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients. AbbVie's Humira and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Remicade, both anti-TNF drugs used to fight inflammation, dominate the market today.""We believe this market is likely to continue or exceed its recent 20% growth rate, with significant share and value likely to accrue to Celgene and some offsetting value available also for AbbVie despite the inevitable erosion of AbbVie's dominant Humira franchise,"" he said.New classes of inflammatory bowel disease drugs are arising. That's where the likes of Celgene, Roche (RHHBY), Galapagos (GPLG), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and AbbVie are looking to make their marks with drugs now in Phase 3 trials for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis — common forms of the disease.But earlier trials, without the benefit of clinical data to back them up, are having some difficulty in recruiting patients, Porges said. Many of these trials also exclude sicker patients, including the patients who've stopped responding to their current treatments.IBD'S TAKE: Earlier this year, AbbVie said it expects Humira to hit peak international sales in 2018 before facing erosion. Head to IBD's Technology page for a breakdown on where AbbVie sees its biggest drug going and how it plans to offset competition.Though anti-TNFs like Humira and Remicade were the ""first truly disease-modifying treatment approaches,"" many patients don't respond to or stop responding to anti-TNF drugs, Porges said. Studies suggest 50%-60% of anti-TNF patients don't respond or lose response within a year.Estimates show there are up to 1.6 million patients in the U.S. with inflammatory bowel disease. Of those, about 640,000 have Crohn's disease and another 680,000 have ulcerative colitis. Patient numbers in Europe are about 60%-70% higher than in the U.S.This ""provides a large opportunity for drugs based on new mechanisms,"" he wrote.RELATED:Perrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan TrendCould This Small Biotech Break Out On A Tie-Up With Eli Lilly?AbbVie Topples As Humira Sales Brake For Third Straight Quarter

158,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) could fill a hole in its portfolio by acquiring Incyte (INCY), an analyst suggested Friday, offering one caveat — Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) would still be a less risky bet.Though Gilead could make a play now for Incyte — to the tune of a 30%-40% premium on its stock price — the No. 3 biotech would largely be betting on the commercial success of Incyte's immuno-oncology drug, epacadostat. Meanwhile, it's dealing with a slump in its Hepatitis C drug-sales unit.""Much of the value of the acquisition depends on achieving substantial sales (more than $4 billion by 2025) of epacadostat in the highly competitive and somewhat unpredictable world of immuno-oncology,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients.Porges imagines that Gilead could afford to pay $173-$187 a share to acquire Incyte. Earlier this year, Gilead acknowledged that it could be open to a deal, particularly in oncology. Analysts have suggested Incyte, Tesaro (TSRO), Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Kite Pharma (KITE) as potential targets.Incyte could help fill some gaps in Gilead's portfolio, Porges said. Its flagship product, Jakafi, is approved in a number of blood disorders and regions, and Incyte is also working on its immuno-oncology drug in trials with Dow's Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).IBD'S TAKE: Cancer therapies are winning investor approval with Kite Pharma sitting on top of a running streak. Check out the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at which companies might prove to be a strong bet.At a 30%-40% premium to Incyte's stock price, the deal could generate 19% accretion by year five, he said. The transaction could create an 11% rate of return for Gilead shareholders over the next 10 years. These projections are dependent on strong sales for epacadostat.Using a 75% premium model, Gilead's earnings would be dilutive until 2018, with an internal rate of return that's north of 8%.""While both the Vertex and Incyte deals are similar in size, Vertex represents a lower risk but less strategic option for Gilead given the limited (but still substantial) application of Vertex's products and technologies,"" he said.Incyte, on the other hand, offers a high risk/high reward with its epacadostat and broader development portfolio, he wrote.On the stock market today, Gilead fell 1 cent to 70.57. Incyte was up 0.6% to 134.27 and Vertex was up 7 cents to 130.99.RELATED:Are Gilead's Fortunes About To Change — Without An Acquisition?Gilead And Vertex Should Join — But Don't Hold Your Breath: AnalystWhy The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% Upside

159,GILD,"A key hepatitis C drug from Gilead Sciences (GILD) could top Wall Street's expectations, but investors will be tuning into the company's second-quarter report on July 26 for more hints on potential M&A activity, an analyst said Friday.Gilead's hepatitis C sales slipped in 2016 and, in the months following, the No. 3 biotech said it could be open to a deal, especially in oncology. Analysts have been quick to offer up Incyte (INCY), Tesaro (TSRO), Kite Pharma (KITE) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) as potential acquisition targets.Others have said Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) would be a smart buy to help fend off a larger dip in its hepatitis C franchise. But Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young expects Gilead's Harvoni, a key hepatitis C drug, to beat analysts' second-quarter models.For the period, she models Gilead pulling in $6.34 billion in sales, just north of the consensus, and $2.18 adjusted income per share, topping broader forecasts by a nickel. She expects a $110 million beat on U.S. Harvoni sales, at $857 million. That would still be down 7% year over year.Young also expects Gilead's Genvoya, an HIV medication, to top Wall Street views for U.S. sales of $694 million. She models $781 million for the period and sees total prescriptions growing 17% quarter over quarter vs. consensus expectations for just 4% growth.""However, we don't expect shares to react strongly to a beat since we think investors are looking for Gilead to do a deal,"" she wrote in a note clients.IBD'S TAKE: Big biotechs are likely to struggle this year as investor focus turns to smaller, cancer- and rare-disease-focused biotechs, analysts say. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at which companies are piquing analyst interest.Biogen (BIIB) also will be in the limelight as investors look for a strategic update and plans for growth amid heightened competition in the multiple sclerosis arena. No. 1 drugmaker Roche (RHHBY), in March, gained approval of its drug Ocrevus to treat two forms of multiple sclerosis.Young sees Biogen's key MS drugs, Tecfidera and Tysabri, pulling in-line sales, though her long-term numbers are below the Street. For the quarter, Young forecasts in-line total sales at $2.8 billion, but sees adjusted profits missing views at $4.04 a share to consensus' views for $4.50. Biogen is scheduled to report Q2 results and give a strategic update on July 25.For the strategic update, she looks for Biogen to give some insight into its collaboration with Eisai as well as newly seated Chief Executive Michel Vounatsos' long-term vision for the company. Investors also likely will want an update on Alzheimer's drug aducanumab.""We think investors are hoping to hear that the company will give an interim readout on the aducanumab Phase 3 trial next year,"" she said. ""For some we think it will make them want to own, but for others they may want to wait until after the data.""Incyte could beat on the top line from strong Jakafi sales, but investor focus will likely be on its immuno-oncology drug epacadostat and strategic partnerships with Dow's Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY). Incyte is set to report Q2 earnings on Aug. 1.More broadly, Young expects an in-line quarter for large-cap biotechs. She sees Amgen (AMGN), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Vertex and BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) reporting metrics in line with consensus views.RELATED:Gilead Could Acquire This Biotech — But Vertex Is Still Better: AnalystAre Gilead's Fortunes About To Change — Without An Acquisition?Why The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% Upside

160,GILD,"Arena Pharmaceuticals (ARNA) and Amicus Therapeutics (FOLD) led the biotech pack Tuesday on strong Phase 2 drug data and a favorable regulatory decision, respectively, sending both stocks to nearly two-year highs.Arena popped 41% to 26 on the stock market today. It dipped 1.7% in after-hours trading after it announced a secondary stock offering. Arena stock broke out of a cup base with a 21.70 buy point on Tuesday. Shares touched a high last seen in August 2015.Amicus shares leapt 26% to 12.92. Amicus rocketed to a 21-month high.Meanwhile, IBD's 437-company Biotech industry group rose 0.7% on Tuesday.Other risers included Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA) and Assembly Biosciences (ASMB), up a respective 8.3% and 6.9%.Early Tuesday, Arena said its drug ralinepag improved blood flow in a Phase 2 study of patients with high blood pressure in the lungs, a condition known as pulmonary arterial hypertension. The drug also improved six-minute walking distance.Ralinepag improved median pulmonary vascular resistance — the pressure with which blood flows in the lungs — by a median 29.8% vs. the placebo, Arena said in a release. The drug also helped patients improve from baseline in six-minute walking distance.IBD'S TAKE: In other biotech news, Gilead Sciences (GILD) could change its fortunes with an acquisition, analysts say. A number of cancer-focused biotechs and drugmakers could be on the auction block, but one viral company really stands out, a Needham analyst says. Head to IBD's Technology page for a closer look at why this firm would be a smart buy.Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz noted ralinepag's improvement in pulmonary vascular resistance from baseline was stronger than Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) rival drug Uptravi in a similar study — 20.1% vs. about 14%, respectively. Uptravi was approved in 2015.Dow stock J&J's effort on Uptravi could give some insight into what awaits ralinepag in Phase 3, Needham analyst Alan Carr said in a note to clients. The company's Actelion unit ran a 1,156-patient trial with a number of goals prior to its approval.Also Tuesday, Amicus announced the Food and Drug Administration will not require it to run a Phase 3 trial of its drug, Migalastat, prior to regulatory submission in the U.S. The drug is already approved in Europe and has been submitted in Japan.Migalastat is a treatment for patients with Fabry disease, a genetic disorder that causes a specific form of fat to build up in the cells, causing a wide variety of systemic issues. Now, Amicus plans to file for approval in the U.S. in the fourth quarter.The submission package will include data culled from completed clinical trials. Additional data, regulatory developments outside the U.S. and the new administration's push for quicker approvals for deadly diseases could have prompted the FDA's decision, Carr said.""Irrespective of the underlying developments, investors will welcome the positive developments on Migalastat,"" he said. ""Submission is anticipated in the fourth quarter that could potentially lead to U.S. commercialization in the second half of 2018.""RELATED:Could This Biotech Win In Hemophilia With 'One And Done' Drug?Could Biogen Spinoff Bioverativ Have A Blockbuster On Its Hands?Why Eli Lilly Is Gouging Diabetes Drug Share From Dow's J&J, Others

161,GILD,"Gilead Sciences' (GILD) fortunes are likely to change this summer on the expected approval of a key hepatitis C drug regimen and after the No. 3 biotech unveils Phase 3 data from an HIV trial, an analyst said Friday.XYear to date, Gilead stock is down 3.3% as of Friday's close. Shares declined as much as 10.5% to the year's low of 64.12 on June 16, but have since recovered somewhat amid a biotech rally that saw the sector rise collectively to a 17-month high in late June. Gilead stock was off marginally to 69.25 on Friday.Needham analyst Alan Carr lists Gilead among the biotechs with ""potential for upside around specific events."" The upside is sorely needed for Gilead which is struggling with a decline in its hepatitis C franchise as the U.S. and European markets mature.Following that decline, Gilead has identified its HIV drug known as bictegravir as its next big hit. In July, Gilead is expected to unveil Phase 3 data for bictegravir during the International AIDS Society conference in Paris, Carr said in a note to clients.In August, the Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve Gilead's combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir in chronic hepatitis C patients who have failed specific prior treatments. The regimen is a 12-week treatment.Other analysts have suggested that Gilead should make an acquisition to bolster its pipeline. The company has indicated it would like to explore a merger in oncology, fueling rumors that it could be looking at Tesaro (TSRO) or Incyte (INCY).IBD'S TAKE: Among strong biotechs, Exelixis stock has rocketed to highs this year not seen in decades. Head to The New America to see what catalysts sent the stock flying and whether more could be around the corner.Outside of Gilead, Carr sees catalysts for a number of players like Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY), Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT), Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX).Alnylam is expected to have Phase 3 data for its drug, patisiran, in September. Patisiran is being investigated as a potential treatment for a rare disease that causes abnormal buildup of material called amyloid within the tissues. These deposits can damage the organs.If approved, patisiran will rival drugs from Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS). Ionis is currently working on a trial of its drug, inotersen, in a population of these patients. That study should help provide proof of mechanism for both patisiran and inotersen, Carr said.Later in the third quarter, Intercept is likely to announce Phase 2 results of its drug Ocaliva as a treatment for a disease that causes inflammation and scar tissue on the bile ducts. It can ultimately result in liver damage. Ocaliva is already approved to treat a similar liver disease.""We expect (a) positive outcome and await clarity on registration requirements,"" Carr said. ""Our second-quarter Ocaliva sales estimate is $27 million vs. consensus at $26 million.""Neurocrine's second-quarter earnings will, for the first time, include sales from its drug Ingrezza, approved in May as a treatment for involuntary movements associated with long-term use of certain medications. Carr models $800 million in sales for the period.Also in the second quarter, Carr estimates Vertex will bring in $186 million and $294 million in sales of Kalydeco and Orkambi, respectively. Kalydeco and Orkambi are cystic fibrosis drugs for patients with specific genetic mutations.RELATED:Gilead And Vertex Should Join — But Don't Hold Your Breath: AnalystWhy The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% UpsideCould This Small Biotech Pique Interest Of Gilead And Others?

Cigarettes, But One Tobacco Giant Is Holding UpThe Federal Reserve kept to Wall Street's preferred script on Wednesday, leaving its key interest rate unchanged and putting off an announcement that it will begin unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.The Fed's patience comes as the economy is performing pretty well, with real GDP growing at a 2.6% pace in the second quarter, but inflation and wage gains have been more muted than expected. The combination has been good for the stock market, partly because the prospect of low interest rates has weighed on the dollar, which could be a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals in the second half of this year.The decision by the Fed to wait until September to announce a shift in its reinvestment policy — a gradual pullback from its current stance of reinvesting all principal from its maturing mortgage and Treasury bond portfolio — also sent a signal that policymakers aren't overly concerned that financial markets are too exuberant.The next interest-rate hike is expected in December.

Their Dow peer 3M (MMM) was an outlier with an overall miss, and shares tanked.Proofpoint (PFPT) reported Q2 profit and revenue that topped expectations and forecast current quarter sales and earnings just above consensus estimates. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Proofpoint specializes in email and data-loss protection for corporate networks and cloud-computing infrastructure.

163,GILD,"Biotech stocks toppled midday Thursday in line with broader indexes, and included pitfalls from large players like Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), United Therapeutics (UTHR) and Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) as long-term views look weak or uncertain.XOn the stock market today, Vertex dove 4.4% to 156.19; United Therapeutics fell 4.8% to 125.10; and Spark dipped 3.3% to 70.29. Broadly, IBD's 439-company biotech industry group lost 2.3%, reflecting major indexes that trended down.This followed beats from Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Vertex, Celgene (CELG) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) this week. All but Vertex increased some of their 2017 guidance. Vertex kept its full-year view, but sees a slowdown in the third quarter.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges trimmed his third-quarter views for Vertex and cut his 2017 sales forecast by 2%. He kept an outperform rating on Vertex but his price target on the stock got a haircut to 187 from 188.Second-quarter sales of cystic fibrosis drugs Orkambi and Kalydeco beat expectations. But Porges noted some of that was due to inventory stocking ahead of the anticipated summer slowdown. Vertex is also working on a triple-pill in cystic fibrosis.Outside its cystic fibrosis franchise, Vertex said on its earnings conference call that it could look to make small technology-based early-stage acquisitions, but will likely avoid ""the large-stage or large investments many investors fear,"" Porges said in a report.For United Therapeutics, second-quarter sales were the highest the company has ever seen at $445 million, ""but resumption of growth is not guaranteed,"" Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said in a note to clients.United is working on drugs to treat a rare blood disease known as pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. Schwartz increased his third- and fourth-quarter sales models by 5%-7% after the strong second-quarter report.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs are now ranked fourth out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. But mergers and acquisitions could send them higher with Vertex considered both a takeover target and an acquirer in some circles. Get the deep dive via IBD Industry Themes.""Due to lack of any curative therapy for PAH, providing a suite of PAH medicines could keep patients transitioning between United products,"" he said. ""However, we are reluctant to assume that a rebound in product sales this quarter will materialize resumption of growth trajectory in other United products.""Also Thursday, Alexion and Celgene topped expectations. Alexion rose 2.2% to 133.92, but Celgene still dipped 2.6% to 134.15.  Investors were likely looking for Celgene to raise its top-line guidance for 2017, but instead Celgene lifted its adjusted profits forecast for the year to $7.25-$7.35 a share.""The main surprise in this result is the lack of an increase in top-line guidance, which we would normally have expected at this time of year,"" Leerink's Porges said. ""Since the second quarter of 2010, this is only the their time that Celgene has not increased their revenue guidance in the second quarter.""Elsewhere in biotech, analysts were more bullish on Gilead which saw hepatitis C drug sales fall a collective 27.5% on slower revenue from Harvoni and Sovaldi. But that beat analysts' view, which predicted a fall of 32%, Porges said. He raised his price target to 83 from 74.The magnitude of the beat points to stabilizing hepatitis C drug sales, he said. But ""the windfall may be short-lived, however, as AbbVie's (ABBV) next-generation doublet is set to enter the market within weeks and is likely to represent the first real competition to Gilead's hepatitis C dominant market position.""RELATED:AstraZeneca Beats, But Stock Dives On Drug Failure; 4 More ReportThis Biotech Nearly Tripled Street Expectations For One Key DrugGilead's Hepatitis C Franchise Topples Again, But Shares Up On Beat

171,GILD,"Bellwether Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) second-quarter report bodes well for the biotech sector, an analyst said Tuesday, after the Dow component topped profit expectations and narrowly lagged sales views.On the stock market today, J&J stock climbed 1.8% to 134.46, as biotech stocks dropped nearly 1% as a group. Generic drugmakers inched down 0.3%.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges remains bullish on the biotech sector and Needham analyst Mike Matson says J&J's second-quarter results point to a stable period for medtech players like Boston Scientific (BSX), Medtronic (MDT), Stryker (SYK) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH).During the quarter, J&J's drug sales grew 4.7% sequentially, though they fell 2.6% vs. the year-earlier period. Porges partially blamed a one-time positive rebate adjustment in 2016 which eliminated 4% of year-over-year volume/price growth in the second quarter.Sales of J&J's immunosuppressant Remicade declined 14% year over year. But rivalry from biosimilars contributed to just 5% of that decline, which is lower than guidance for a 10%-15% decline in 2017, Porges wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Cancer and rare-disease specialists are expected to do well in the second half of 2017 as positive sentiment returns to the biotech space. Visit IBD's Industry Snapshot for a look at who may outperform in the second quarter.J&J also expects currency headwinds to subside in the second half of 2017 and called for acceleration in its pharmaceutical unit as well as positive trends in sales outside the U.S. Based on the presumed currency impacts, the firm raised its outlook for adjusted profits to $7.12-$7.22 a share.Outside the U.S., drug sales grew 7% sequentially in the second quarter, beating views for 3% growth, Porges said.""(This) supports our expectations for sequential outside-U.S. revenue growth for our companies due to a weakening dollar in the second quarter,"" he said.Porges expects guidance increases for biotechs during the second quarter. Earlier in the week, he called for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) to easily beat June quarter sales views and for Gilead Sciences (GILD) to handily top profit expectations.""Our covered companies will not be negatively impacted by the same prior period adjustments as J&J, and those with current or imminent biosimilar competition may surprise consensus if the Remicade market dynamics can be viewed as a proxy,"" he said.AbbVie (ABBV) could see some pain, though. Sales of cancer drug Imbruvica grew 40% in the U.S. and 64% outside the U.S., J&J said. J&J is partnered with AbbVie on Imbruvica in the U.S. J&J typically books 40% of U.S. Imbruvica sales, Porges said. This translates to about $501 million for AbbVie's Imbruvica sales.This would be a ""miss vs. consensus of $514 million and our estimate of $537 million,"" he said. ""For AbbVie, Imbruvica is considered the largest growth driver beyond the Humira patent cliff, but continued missed consensus expectations repeated in the second quarter would be a negative for the stock.""RELATED:'Stars Align' For These Biotechs To Crush Earnings ConsensusThese 2 Drug Giants In Buy Range Just Beat Earnings ViewsHow Novartis' FDA Win In Cancer Also Could Be A Boon For Its Rivals

172,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) would be better off acquiring Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) than an oncology asset like Tesaro (TSRO) or Incyte (INCY), an analyst suggested Friday as he lamented Gilead's cautious approach to mergers.XThe No. 3 biotech by market cap has shown interest in making an oncology-centric buy as it struggles with declining hepatitis C drug sales. The hepatitis C franchise brought in north of $44 billion over three years, but fell in 2016 for the first time.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says Gilead should turn away from the obvious cancer biotech buys — Tesaro, Incyte, Clovis Oncology (CLVS) or Kite Pharma (KITE) — and instead set its sights on Vertex. But, he said, it's likely Gilead will ignore that advice.""We would view an acquisition of a growing and largely de-risked revenue stream, such as Vertex, much more positively than a comparable investment, or set of investments, into the intensely competitive and technologically uncertain field of oncology,"" he said.Vertex would offer Gilead a rare disease portfolio and a robust pipeline. Vertex is now working on a triple-pill combination to treat cystic fibrosis, a lung disease. It's about a year ahead of its nearest rivals, Galapagos (GLPG)/AbbVie (ABBV), and the regimen looks likely to launch in 2020.Gilead has $32 billion in cash, meaning the company wouldn't have to stretch too much to make a transformational acquisition, Porges said. Vertex has a market cap of about $32 billion to Gilead's $92.4 billion market cap.Porges expects Gilead could pay up to $230 per share of Vertex stock and still make the acquisition accretive by year two with realistic synergies. Together with Vertex, Gilead could feasibly expand growth to 11 to 13 times that of slow-growing major pharmas.IBD'S TAKE: Big biotechs like Gilead struggled in the recent biotech rally. Instead, analysts say, keep your eyes on the biotechs highlighted in this Industry Snapshot.With Vertex in tow, Gilead could reverse its revenue trajectory from a projected decline to a 1.9% compound annual growth rate from 2017-22. The transaction would similarly improve an expected fractional decline in earnings to an estimated 5.2% growth rate over those years.But it's more likely Gilead will make a series of small transactions for relatively early-stage assets, Porges said in his note to clients. Those won't be enough to diversify Gilead from the hepatitis C ""roller coaster"" even with the help of its nascent HIV drug bictegravir.""It has been apparent that Gilead would need major acquisitions since 2015, and possibly even before then, and it is inexplicable to us that the company has been so faint-hearted in exercising their cash-flow advantage until now,"" he said. ""The company still appears to be responding to opportunities presented to them, rather than initiating and creating opportunities ahead of their availability.""Even if Gilead went after any of the obvious oncology assets, investors will question why the company is paying a premium today when the potential of those companies was apparent last year when prices were 25% to 500% below their current levels.Porges has a market perform rating and 74 price target on Gilead stock. Its valuation, he says, is at an all-time low and would otherwise justify a recommendation. But ""substantial termination uncertainty makes it hard for us to see the stock recovering its multiple in the foreseeable future.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, Gilead stock dipped a fraction, near 70.78. Vertex popped as much as 4%, though settled to be up 1.3% to 128.87. Incyte stock fell 2.2% to 125.91, while Tesaro stock lost 0.8% to 139.86.RELATED:Why The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% UpsideAre Sanofi, Gilead In A Bidding War Over This Small-Cap BiotechEven An Upgrade Couldn't Save Vertex From The Biotech Deluge

173,GILD,"Celgene (CELG), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) could lead the biotech sector to 15% more upside following the second quarter, an analyst said Thursday as shares trekked up for the fifth straight day.XAt the closing bell on the stock market today, IBD's 432-company Biotech industry group was up 1.3%, trading at a 17-month high. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges credited the lack of drug-pricing headwinds for the five-day uptrend.""The current rally reflects the lifting of perceived fears of pricing regulations, and a favorable tone from the FDA, but does not yet reflect more positive operating results, not to mention industry consolidation, which we still expect,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Porges expects the industry to tack on another 15% upside following what's likely to be a strong second-quarter earnings season. Biotech stocks have added 8% since June 15. On Thursday, leaders included a number of small caps trading below 10.Of the risers, Porges prefers what he calls ""growth stocks"" like Celgene, Regeneron, Vertex and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN). Since mid-May, Regeneron stock has added 16%, followed by 14% gains for Celgene and Vertex stock.""Gilead Sciences (GILD) performed the worst with only a 5% gain, which is still higher than the overall market,"" he said. Major biotech indexes have added 9%-14% over the last month as the broader market has only tacked on 2% growth.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts began predicting a biotech rally last month. What were the signs and who will benefit the most? Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look.Some analysts have said one reason for the sector's surge is that fears are subsiding over the prospect that President Donald Trump might take action to curb pricing. Some analysts now say that Trump's rhetoric to tamp down pricing appears to be ""lip service.""Wall Street expectations for Amgen (AMGN), Gilead and Regeneron's second-quarter earnings have dipped about 1%-2% over the last month and revenue views have been largely flat with a 1% decline for Amgen and Gilead.Large-cap biotechs will have to beat second-quarter views to gain that 15% upside, Porges said. Over the last five years, large caps have beat second-quarter expectations 60%-100% of the time with Amgen, Celgene and Gilead beating both views every time.Guidance increases are 85% more likely in the second quarter than the first, he said. With that, he expects the biotech sector could rally as much as 35%-50% compared to long-term relative multiples vs. the medtech and pharma sectors.RELATED:Could This Small Biotech Pique Interest Of Gilead And Others?Biotechs Surge As Generalists Return Amid Subsiding Trump WoesThese Biotechs Are Leading The Sector To A 3-Month High Today

175,GILD,"A slew of biotechs and drugmakers might take a closer look at Epizyme (EPZM) after the small-cap biotech presented strong data in a lymphoma trial Wednesday in Switzerland, an analyst said Thursday.The findings at the International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma could attract the likes of Gilead Sciences (GILD), AbbVie (ABBV), Celgene (CELG), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) or Roche (RHHBY), Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients.Epizyme is testing its drug, dubbed tazemetostat, in two forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Interim data show tazemetostat had a clinically meaningful benefit in all patients with what's called follicular lymphoma, a buildup on cells in the lymph nodes.Tumors shrunk in 92% of follicular lymphoma patients and in 29% of patients with an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and a specific genetic mutation. Tazemetostat proved safe across all patient populations.Leerink's Porges called the study a ""proof of principle."" He expects the drug to win accelerated approval at the Food and Drug Administration in follicular lymphoma. Accelerated approvals allow a drug to be marketed while still in clinical trials.""Few cancer drugs have a 90% response rate, or a 100% clinical benefit rate, in any disease,"" he said. ""And while investors might debate about how big that group of patients really is, and how long treatment duration will be, we would not be surprised to see Epizyme start to show up on potential takeout candidate lists.""Epizyme could be appealing to AbbVie, Celgene, J&J and Roche, Porges wrote. Roche is among the leaders in immuno-oncology, a method of treating tumors by blocking certain interactions that hide cancer cells.Gilead is better known for its virology drugs, including those that target hepatitis C and HIV. But Gilead's hepatitis C franchise declined in 2016 amid high cure rates. Now, Gilead has said it's open to seeking an acquisition in oncology. Incyte and Tesaro are also rumored takeout candidates.""Now that the molecule (tazemetostat) has been de-risked, we expect more investors to get involved into the stock and to build positions ahead of further data disclosures,"" Porges said.IBD'S TAKE: Seattle Genetics Chief Executive Clay Siegall says his company is aiming to change the 40-year method of treating Hodgkin lymphoma. How? Head to IBD's Technology page for an exclusive with the CEO.The same conference saw Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN) team up for a Phase 1/2 trial in classical Hodgkin lymphoma, also with robust results. But only Epizyme stock spiked on its news.Bristol-Myers and Seattle Genetics, too, had strong data in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Tumors shrunk in 85% of patients treated with a combination of Bristol's Opdivo and Seattle's Adcetris. All signs of cancer disappeared in 63% of patients. The combo proved safe as well, Bristol said.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Epizyme stock soared more than 13%, near 14.

That beat the S&P 500's monthly return of 0.4% and 9.1% for the year. The$1.2 billion fund, which tracks the Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index, carries a 0.49% expense ratio.MOAT remains in buy range from a 38.41 flat-base entry.

178,GILD,"French drugmaker Sanofi (SNY) is reportedly considering a bid for Tesaro (TSRO), but could face some competition from Gilead Sciences (GILD), whose frustrated hepatitis C franchise has left the massive biotech thirsty for an acquisition.At the close on the stock market today, Tesaro was up 2.8% to 142.67. Gilead stock popped 1.1% to close at 65.43. Sanofi stock, though, was down 1.3% to close at 47.57.According to insiders cited by StreetInsider, Sanofi is looking to put in a bid on Tesaro, which reportedly began seeking takeover bids last month following the approval and launch of its ovarian cancer drug, Zejula.Gilead is also likely in the running to buy Tesaro, according to reports. Gilead's two biggest drugs to treat hepatitis C, Sovaldi and Harvoni, saw sales dive in 2016 on high cure rates. Now, Gilead has said it's interested in making a deal, particularly one in oncology.But it won't be cheap. Insiders say it'll cost $10 billion (or $185 per share) to acquire the $7.6-billion-market-cap Tesaro. The winner will also get its hands on ovarian cancer drug Zejula, which launched earlier this year with a $118,000 per-year price tag.At that cost, Zejula is less expensive than AstraZeneca's (AZN) Lynparza and Clovis Oncology's (CLVS) Rubraca. And of the three, Zejula's label is broadest, allowing treatment of ovarian cancer patients regardless of specific genetics.IBD'S TAKE: Tesaro stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 52, meaning it outperforms just above half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Visit IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated stocks in the biotech sector.Analysts have speculated that the competitive landscape in what's known as PARP inhibitors — which includes Zejula, Lynparza, Rubraca and a non-approved drug from Pfizer (PFE) — could change as more data from rivals become available this year.Sanofi has struggled to make deals in recent history. Last year, it lost out to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in a battle for Actelion Pharmaceuticals, and to Pfizer which got its hands on a PARP inhibitor by acquiring Medivation.Gilead, too, is in a position to hunt for deals. Its hepatitis C drugs fell in 2016, and the company said on its most recent earnings call that it will rely on deals for growth, with a special interest in oncology assets. Incyte (INCY) has also been on the radar as a rumored target.Representatives for Tesaro and Sanofi declined to comment to Investor's Business Daily.

179,GILD,"With names like AbbVie (ABBV) and Celgene (CELG) on a tear the past week, many biotech sector ETFs hit 52-week or longer highs.On Friday, they took a breather but retained the bulk of their big weekly gains. Most biotech funds are extended from their buy points, but several are still in or have pulled back into their respective buy zones.For instance, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB), which rose as much as 6.5% from its 303.84 entry, eased Friday and is near the top of its buy range. The $9.4 billion fund has rallied 19% this year through June 21, according to Morningstar Inc. That's well above the S&P 500's slight one-week decline and 10% YTD return for the same period.BioShares Biotechnology Clinical Trials (BBC), up 31% YTD, is in buy range from a 24.31 cup-base entry. The $24.5 million fund is thinly traded with an average daily volume of about 12,000 shares.VanEck Vectors Biotech (BBH), up nearly 20% for the year, was waffling near the top of the 5% buy zone from 123.25 entry. The 5-year-old fund has attracted $702.3 million in assets.Analysts attributed the rally to subsiding drug-price concerns. Could there be further growth ahead?""CFRA is positive fundamentally on the biotech industry and sees strong revenue growth in 2017 aided by a robust pipeline,"" Todd Rosenbluth, Director of ETF & Mutual Fund Research at CFRA, told IBD via email. ""We have buy recommendations on ABBV, Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN), CELG and Gilead Sciences (GILD).""Those stocks all fall in the big-cap category, with market caps north of $16 billion.""We are more favorable on larger-cap biotechs and as such think IBB offers the best exposure to these stocks,"" he said. ""(Some) other ETFs offer more stock diversification and smaller cap exposure, which provides potential rewards, but also additional risk.""Leveraged ETFs, which try to magnify returns by doubling or tripling their benchmark index each day, posted double-digit gains in the week ended June 21. For instance, Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull 3X (LABU), which seeks investment results triple the performance of the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index, led with a 26% return, bringing its year-to-date haul to 113.9%.ProShares UltraPro Nasdaq Biotechnology (UBIO), which aims for three times the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index's daily performance, rallied 20.8% on the week for a 60.4% YTD return. ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotechnology (BIB) scored a 13.7% gain for a 17.9% YTD return.All three are well extended. While such leveraged plays can make for big gains when the going is good, they tend to carry higher risk than most traditional biotech sector funds.On the other end of the spectrum are inverse ETFs, which are designed to give the opposite performance of the index they track. These funds provide a result similar to shorting the stocks in the index. The four shown in the accompanying chart have seen losses as biotechs have rallied. But they'd likely outperform if the sector heads south.""We don't have a view on leveraged and inverse ETFs other than that investors can easily get hurt if they hold on to them too long,"" Rosenbluth said. ""The risks are compounded much faster than investors can appreciate.""RELATED:Can Biotech Stocks Keep Their New Lead?This Top Biotech Stock Remains Just Within Buy Range

180,GILD,"Traders can't get enough of biotech shares, whose advance this week has made them the top performers among U.S. equities in June.Up almost 7% in three days, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) exchange traded fund has been the site of frenzied options trading, with more than 41,000 contracts changing hands on Tuesday alone. Almost three calls have traded for every put that bets on a decline. A ratio that lopsided was last seen in July 2005, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Call volume on the $8.6 billion fund was three times the 20-day average on 10:30 a.m. Wednesday.Clinical breakthroughs and easing political pressure fuel investor appetite for biotech stocks that plunged the most in the S&P 500 Index last year amid concern over industry regulation and drug pricing.After threatening to give government more negotiating power over drug costs and accusing manufacturers of ""getting away with murder,"" President Donald Trump is expected to settle for an executive order that will be ""constructive"" and supported by the industry, according to Goldman Sachs Group health-care analysts.Hopes are also high that deal activity will also pick up after a few small and midcap firms including Clovis Oncology (CLVS) released promising data on new therapies. More transactions could help biotech giants such as Gilead Sciences (GILD) boost growth at a time when sales are slowing.It's not just biotech shares that are rallying. Health care stocks in general have been the best performers this quarter. A 6.7% rally has taken away most of their valuation discount to the S&P 500. The stocks trade at an average 16.4 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with 17.7 for the benchmark, the narrowest discount in more than 10 months.And the sector may have more room to run, according to Miller Tabak & Co. equity strategist Matt Maley. As investors rotate out of technology stocks, they're continuing to turn more defensive areas, including health care and utilities, he said.""As things get a little expensive, it's usually more nerve-wracking for investors when it's growth stocks getting expensive than defensive stocks,"" Maley said by phone.

Amgen, Regeneron, Biogen and Celgene are up more than 5% just this week, with Biogen and Regeneron up more than 10%.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene is rated No. 1 in IBD's Biomed/Biotech group, with a best-possible 99 Composite Rating. To find out which are the other top-rated biotechs, and how they stack up vs. objective critera, go to IBD Stock Checkup.Several other drug groups are big recent winners, among them the ethical drugs group, which includes Dow stock Merck (MRK). Merck rose 1.4% to 65.46 on Wednesday on a new approval for its immuno-oncology treatment Keytruda. Merck has a 66.90 conventional buy point with a 65.68 aggressive entry.Meanwhile, IBD's Software-Desktop group, home to Oracle, is the fourth-best industry over the past five days. The Dow's Microsoft (MSFT), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Red Hat (RHT) are also members. (Other software groups, including enterprise software and medical software, also have had big gains.)Celgene leapt 5.2% to 132.83, blasting past a 127.74 buy point, holding just within the 5% chase zone. There's a growing feeling among investors that President Trump will not crack down on drug prices, despite various comments he has made before and after the campaign.Regeneron rose 5.4% to 522.02, further extended from a buy point and trading at its best levels since the beginning of 2016.Amgen advanced 3.1% as it builds the right side of a base.Biogen gained 4.7%, retaking its 200-day moving average a day after vaulting above its 50-day.Recent Biogen spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) edged down 0.1%, but is holding in a buy zone after Monday's breakout. Bioverativ is on Leaderboard, IBD's premium service highlighting a select cull of stocks, mostly growth plays in or near buy zones.Clovis Oncology (CLVS) has skyrocketed 57% this week after reporting strong trial data, suggesting its ovarian cancer drug may get a much-wider use.Gilead Sciences (GILD) rose 2.9% to above its 50-day line as the Hepatitis-C and HIV biotech tries to break a downtrend going back more than a year.One good way to play the biotech boom is via ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) and iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB). Both XBI and IBB broke out of consolidations this week.Oracle reported much-stronger-than-expected earnings late Wednesday, with 3% revenue growth also edging past views. Shares of the business software giant shot up 11% to 51.35 in premarket trading on the stock market today. That would be a record high and well above a 47.09 buy point, though overnight trading doesn't always carry over into the regular session. Still, Oracle already topped an aggressive entry of 46.17 on Wednesday, rising 1.1% to 46.33 in heavy volume.In addition to desktop software names Microsoft, Adobe and Red Hat, which are all near long-time or all-time highs, several other business software stocks have been breaking out and hitting highs in recent months. They include cloud-based payroll software players such as Workday (WDAY), Paylocity (PCTY) and Paycom (PAYC), as well as ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Veeva Systems (VEEV).In Asian trading Thursday, Japan's Nikkei dipped 0.1% while China's Shanghai composite slid 0.3%. In Europe intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE retreated 0.4%, Germany's Dax was flat while France's Cac fell 0.3%.RELATED:The Big Picture: Biotechs Lift Nasdaq; Oil Bloodbath ContinuesBiotech Breakouts: Biogen Spinoff Bioverativ In Buy ZoneOracle Earnings Come In Ahead On Top And Bottom LinesBiotechs Surge As Generalists Return Amid Subsiding Trump WoesHow Dow's Merck Is Still Beating Bristol, Roche In Immuno-OncologyIs This Medical Cloud Computing Play Set To Rebound, Or Crash?

182,GILD,"Biogen (BIIB) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) stocks popped Thursday after the European Commission approved an application for their costly spinal disease drug Spinraza, five months after the drug launched in the U.S.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Biogen stock climbed 1.9% to 252.38 as shares of its partner in Spinraza, Ionis, jumped 5.3% to finish the regular session at 48.23. Those increases outperformed IBD's 432-company Biomed/Biotech industry group, which rose just a fraction.European regulators approved Spinraza to treat the most common form of spinal muscular atrophy, affecting 95% of patients, Biogen said in a news release. The drug costs $125,000 per treatment at a cost of $750,000 in the first year. Spinal muscular atrophy is caused by the degeneration of certain cells, leading to the wasting of various muscle groups.The approval came under the European Medicines Agency's accelerated assessment program. The program, like a similar effort from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, aims to expedite access to drugs for patients with unmet medical needs.Access to Spinraza will vary by country, per local reimbursement and pathways, Biogen said. The company has been working with health systems and government agencies across Europe to open up access to Spinraza.IBD'S TAKE: U.S.-domiciled biotechs and pharmas will benefit the most under President Trump's proposed tax plan. That list includes Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen. Head to IBD's Technology page for a closer look at the potential winners and losers under tax reform.In the U.S., Spinraza is approved for three types of spinal muscular atrophy, but analysts have worried that payer pushback could hurt sales.But in the first quarter following its launch, Spinraza sales hit $47 million, Biogen said in April. That helped Biogen and Ionis stocks pop 3.6% and 4.7%, respectively.Ionis' website says that in 2016 Biogen exercised its rights to Spinraza and became responsible for its marketing, development and commercialization. Ionis has received up to $320 million in milestone payments to date and gets tiered royalties on sales up to percentages in the midteens.RELATED: Biogen Earnings Top As $125,000 Drug Starts WellHow Biogen's Takeover Prospects Soured In Mere MonthsAmgen, Gilead Biogen Won't Lead The Biotech Boom — So Who Will?

183,GILD,"Tesaro's (TSRO) Zejula would likely outperform drugs from Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and AstraZeneca (AZN) when combined with treatments from big-name pharmaceutical companies, an analyst suggested Tuesday.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez suggested that Tesaro would do better mixed with drugs from Dow's Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) or Roche (RHHBY). His suggestion came a day after Clovis unveiled strong data for its drug Rubraca in ovarian cancer. The Phase 3 trial, dubbed Ariel-3, signals that Clovis could get a broader label than expected in ovarian cancer.On Tuesday, Wall Street scrambled to differentiate drugs from AstraZeneca, Clovis and Tesaro, all of which have what are known as PARP inhibitors. These drugs aim to block a family of enzymes that cancer cells use to proliferate.Differentiating Tesaro's Zejula from Clovis' Rubraca and AstraZeneca's Lynparza will likely come down to how well it combines with immuno-oncology drugs to block interactions involving the PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins in the immune system.""Zejula appears to be the only late-stage PARP inhibitor that is both combinable with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors and crosses the blood-brain barrier,"" Fernandez said in a note to clients.Tesaro's drug appears to be less toxic in the liver, which will be important in immuno-oncology combos. And the ability to cross the blood-brain battier will help Tesaro get a foothold in breast and lung cancers, which commonly spread to the brain.But Fernandez cut his price target on Tesaro stock to 143 from 158, though he still has a market perform rating on shares. He sees an even split for Tesaro and Clovis in ovarian cancer patients who've already undergone two rounds of prior therapy.IBD'S TAKE: Merck, Bristol and Roche are all working in the immuno-oncology space. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at how they performed during the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting earlier this month in Chicago.Fernandez and Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay see AstraZeneca benefiting from Clovis' trial, which shows that PARP inhibitors are more similar than dissimilar. Lynparza is approved to treat ovarian cancer patients with a mutation of the BRCA gene.PARP inhibitors are thought to work better in patients with a BRCA genetic mutation, though Clovis' trial showed responses in all patients regardless of genetics. Still, doctors' preference for screening patients for that mutation could benefit AstraZeneca.Chattopadhyay kept his neutral rating on Tesaro stock, but trimmed his price target to 120 from 139. Like Fernandez, he sees Tesaro having a leg-up on Clovis in immuno-oncology combos, but notes that its in-house anti-PD-1 antibody is far from mature.He also upgraded Clovis stock to a buy rating with a 107 price target. Clovis stock flew 46.5% on Monday following the trial. Meanwhile, Tesaro stock is still ""being buoyed by (the) M&A rumor mill,"" Chattopadhyay said. Gilead Sciences (GILD) is a rumored potential acquirer.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young, too, boosted her price target on Clovis stock to 107 from 88, though she kept her outperform rating on its shares. The top-line success in its Ariel-3 trial shows Rubraca can have a ""meaningful market opportunity"" in the PARP space, she said.At the close on the stock market today, Clovis stock was up 0.9%, near 88.68, as Tesaro stock dove 3.5% to 137.97. AstraZeneca stock lifted less than 0.2% to 34.72.RELATED:Why This Cancer Drug Specialist Is Up 50% TodayBiotech Flew Nearly 50% On Strong Trial — But Is Its Drug Better?Can AstraZeneca Keep Up As Clovis, Tesaro Unveil Blockbuster Drugs?

184,GILD,"Gilead Sciences' (GILD) experimental HIV drug-combination met its goal in four late-stage trials, the No. 3 biotech company said Tuesday, putting it closer to seeking approval in the U.S. and Europe later this year.The combination of bictegravir and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF) was just as effective as a regimen from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) using its drug dolutegravir. FTC/TAF is already approved to treat HIV. Gilead was hoping adding bictegravir would make it more effective.""Based on the results from these Phase 3 studies, the combination of bictegravir and FTC/TAF could represent an important advance in triple-therapy treatment for a broad range of HIV patients,"" Norbert Bischofberger, Gilead's chief science officer, said in a news release.Three studies looked at Gilead's combination against GSK's in previously untreated patients, while a fourth trial examined patients switching to Gilead's regimen from other HIV therapies. In all four cases, Gilead's regimen proved just as effective as the other therapies.Data showed the regimen was well tolerated and no patients discontinued treatment due to kidney issues.Gilead said it's aiming to file applications for approval in the U.S. and Europe in, respectively, the second and third quarters this year.IBD'S TAKE: Healthcare reform in the U.S. could change the outlook for some biotechs and pharmas, analysts say. Head to IBD's Technology page for a closer look at how Gilead narrowly escaped a potential game changer with the failure of TrumpCare.Gilead is pinning its hopes on HIV drugs in light of a slowdown in its hepatitis C franchise. In 2016, sales from that unit collapsed amid high cure rates in the U.S. and Europe. Gilead's first HIV drug, Viread, was approved 16 years ago.In HIV, Gilead is facing off with Britain's GSK and Dow component Merck (MRK), which are using generic drugs in their regimens. The use of generics will make GSK's and Merck's regimens less expensive, meaning Gilead will struggle to gain share, analysts have said.On the stock market today, Gilead stock fell 1 cent to 64.49. Shares are down 10% for the year. IBD's 432-company Biomed/Biotech industry group has risen 6.7% so far in 2017 but slid nearly 2% on Tuesday to close below its 200-day line for the first time in four months. GlaxoSmithKline shares rose 1.7% to 43.41.RELATED:Gilead Topples On Consensus-Lagging Q1 As Hepatitis C Drug Sales PlummetWill Merck, Glaxo Undercut Gilead's Next 'Mount Everest' Drug?Bristol-Myers Beats Gilead, Merck To Key Approvals In China, Europe

185,GILD,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB) would benefit the most among biotechs under President Trump's proposed tax reform, a measure that would cut the corporate tax rate by 20%.Under Trump's proposal ""no business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom-and-pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes,"" making corporate inversions unnecessary."" The U.S. corporate tax rate is currently 35%.That means Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen — all of which have guided to adjusted tax rates at or above 25% in 2017 — could see a serious boost in cash if Trump's proposal passes. Though, analysts say, it's all about compromise inside the Beltway, so that 15% rate is still up in the air.Trump's approval rating jumped to 39% in May from 34% in April, and he gained 7% in the IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index after unveiling his tax reform proposal. It was the first month-over-month increase since Trump became president.But that doesn't mean Big Pharma and biotech are totally sold on Trump's proposal — a four-page document released April 26. Shares of biotechs and drugmakers collectively lifted less than 1% that day, though generic drug stocks popped 2.8%.Gilead Chief Executive John Milligan noted uncertainty in Washington is the norm.""So I think we've kind of learned to filter that out and focus on the things that are right for the company,"" he said on Gilead's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. ""There may be tax reform. There may be repatriation. But you can't count on it and you can't wait for it, either.""Trump's plan would slash the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15% from 35%, benefiting companies whose consolidated tax rates remain well above that level. Consolidating taxes allows a firm to treat a group of wholly- or majority-owned companies as a single entity for tax purposes.U.S.-domiciled drugmakers typically pay 37%-40% in consolidated taxes, Canaccord analyst Dewey Steadman told Investor's Business Daily. But companies that acquire a foreign firm can move their tax domicile outside the U.S. to the acquired company's often lower-tax homeland.When Mylan (MYL) acquired a generics manufacturer from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) in 2014, it kept its operational headquarters in Pennsylvania, but reincorporated in the Netherlands. In March, Mylan said it expected to pay a 16.5%-18.5% tax rate in 2017.Similarly, Allergan (AGN) guided in February to a 13.5% adjusted tax rate in 2017. Allergan's corporate headquarters are in Ireland. In April 2016, Pfizer (PFE) scrapped its $160 billion attempt to acquire Allergan a day after the U.S. Treasury unveiled new rules to curb inversions.Former President Barack Obama called global tax avoidance a ""huge problem"" and urged Congress to close the loophole for good. Trump, on the other hand, says his tax reform proposal would make inversions unnecessary ""by making America's tax rate one of the best in the world.""Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen would be among the biggest winners of this cut, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in an April 26 report. Regeneron has guided to an effective tax rate of 32%-38% in 2017. Gilead sees 25%-28%. In the first quarter, Biogen paid 23% in adjusted taxes.Among drugmakers, Pfizer, Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) all guided to effective tax rates between 20%-25% for 2017. Canaccord's Steadman and Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD everything in politics is subject to negotiation.""Smaller biotechs say it's obviously positive for the future, but everyone is taking a wait-and-see approach,"" Steadman said. ""A 20%-22% rate is probably what's going to happen, but they're not changing their capital expenditures or organizational structure in the meantime.""IBD'S TAKE: Looking for the latest on biotech and drug news? Be sure to bookmark IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.A second facet of Trump's plan would allow the one-time repatriation of corporate cash parked overseas at a discounted 10% tax rate. This would be followed by an end to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.Evercore's Raffat says Amgen (AMGN) would benefit the most among drugmakers under this provision. Amgen has $34.4 billion in cash stashed overseas. That's money Amgen could use to help boost its war chest amid generic rivalries and a battle with Regeneron/Sanofi (SNY) on the cholesterol front.The same could be said for Gilead — $27.4 billion in overseas cash — which is facing dwindling sales in its hepatitis C drug franchise. Gilead had been under pressure for months amid analyst chatter that it should buy something to bolster sales. Incyte (INCY) is a likely candidate, analysts say.According to Raffat, Merck and Pfizer have a respective $21.9 billion and $15 billion in cash outside the U.S. Lilly, Bristol, Celgene (CELG), Biogen and AbbVie (ABBV) each have under $10 billion parked overseas. That cash could be repatriated for research and development, or used to fuel M&A.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read offered a similar view as Gilead's Milligan on the company's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. Though he expects industry consolidation to continue over time, the political atmosphere remains a major deterrent.""I believe there is simply too much redundancy and fragmentation, both globally and in the U.S., for the sector to continually efficiently deliver medicines to society,"" he said. ""However, there is a lack of clarity on potential tax reform, health care policies of the U.S. and uncertainties in the European markets.""Canaccord's Steadman doesn't expect a wave of M&A even if Trump's tax reform passes muster with Congress. There's no need to attempt Pfizer-Allergan-like mergers for inversion purposes, he said. Though the appetite for U.S. biotechs looks healthy.""We'd see a decline in those big inversion-type mergers that were not necessarily strategic, but you could see an appetite for U.S. biotech assets just because the tax picture looks better,"" he said. ""The net result is actually a decrease in large mergers but maybe an increase in valuations for biotech, but I don't think it drives much more M&A.""There's much that's still murky in Trump's tax proposal, analysts say.""The general theme is tax reform would be a good thing for biotech,"" Mizuho's Syed told IBD. ""But we don't exactly know what tax reform is going to be. There are still a lot of pieces moving around. Repatriation? A border tax? We don't have all the components of it.""A border tax, though, could be an extreme drawback for U.S. companies with manufacturing in less expensive countries. Such an adjustment could exempt exports from taxation, while taxing imports, PwC analysts Doug Strang and Kathy Michael wrote in a Feb. 6 report.In a January speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said a tax would eliminate the tax incentives for U.S. companies to move their manufacturing overseas.""Coupled with the new lower GOP tax rates on local businesses and ending double-taxation of U.S. earnings overseas, this establishes America as a 21st century magnet for new jobs, technology breakthroughs and headquarters,"" he said. ""The GOP tax plan is already driving companies to ask themselves, 'How soon can we bring our suppliers back to the U.S.?'""For most companies, relocating their operations back to the U.S. would be a ""paperwork nightmare,"" Canaccord's Steadman said. In the current plan — which doesn't include a border tax provision — there's nothing to incentivize companies to bring operations back to the U.S.But it could be enough to keep newer and smaller companies from re-domiciling overseas, he said.""It's probably enticing future companies to not leave the U.S., I think that's the core goal of what they're trying to do,"" he said. ""If they were U.S.-domiciled at a lower rate, they wouldn't have to leave cash in a foreign subsidiary and that cash would be based in the U.S. which would encourage investment in the U.S.""RELATED:Did Gilead Just Provide Some 'Incyte' Into A Potential Deal?Dow's Pfizer Tops Earnings Views But Sales Come Up ShortHow Lilly's New Drug Could Spark A Deeper Rivalry With Pfizer, Novartis

186,GILD,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) look likely to catch the next wave in biotech, an analyst said Friday, suggesting after two years of underperformance that the sector could be slated for a boom.X But it won't be ""value stocks"" like Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB) driving the boom, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges told clients in a note.""These large caps drag down the performance of the indexes and (exchange traded funds), but the growth stocks already seem to be capturing sustained new investor interest,"" he said. ""Our advice to investors remains to identify and scrutinize evidence of competitive advantage and to look to management to maximize profitability of existing businesses first and foremost.""IBD's 431-company Biomed/Biotech industry group is up 10% for the first five months of 2017 after finishing 2016 down 25%. During the ""boom years"" of 2015 and 2014, the stocks tacked on 11% and 41% growth. The group closed down 0.9% on the stock market today.Such is the pattern in the biotech market, Porges says. Typical corrections run two to three quarters, followed by two to three years of sideways performance. Today, much of the excitement of mid-2015 has dissipated, leaving shares 40% below their long-term median relative multiples.Consensus expectations for biotech sales and profits have declined 14%-23% and 7%-12%, respectively, over the last two years.But the signs are getting better, Porges said. First-quarter results yielded ""a mixture of positive and negative results vs. (the) consensus, and prompted some additional negative revisions, but so far this quarter's estimates have been remarkably stable.""IBD'S TAKE: Regeneron stock outperformed a broad market plunge Thursday, topping a 456.06 saucer buy point. Head to IBD's New Highs list for a look at other strong performers.Political pressure is also beginning to subside, he said. President Trump has promised to introduce a competitive system that would cut down on escalating drug prices. Meanwhile, the industry has seemingly begun to self-regulate on drug pricing.There are exceptions. Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals' (IONS) Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy drug, debuted this year at $125,000 per treatment, or $750,000 in the first year. Porges sees the $37,000 price tag for Regeneron and Sanofi's (SNY) eczema drug Dupixent and the $65,000 price for Roche's (RHHBY) multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus as more reasonable.""Furthermore, manufacturers of established brands are taking more modest price increases and fewer of them, and are adopting voluntary price-increase limits (which remain too high but are a step in the right direction),"" Porges said.Approvals — many on time and some earlier than expected — have accelerated this year at the Food and Drug Administration, after hitting a five-year low in 2016. So far this year, 20 drugs have grabbed FDA approval, matching the total for all of last year. Those labels also appear broader, meaning drugs could have greater use.Porges sees a number of drug launches coming over the next 18 months that could outdo consensus views. Key among those are gene therapies for rare diseases, treatments for end-stage cancer, and therapies for severe diseases created via a process that harnesses RNA molecules to inhibit certain genes.""This process finally validates all the capital that was invested in these remarkable technologies during the 'boom years' and had seeming headed for disappointment at many points during the bust of the last 24 months,"" Porges said.RELATED:How Biogen's Takeover Prospects Soured In Mere MonthsWill 'Comeback Kid' Regeneron Survive Amgen's Cholesterol Squeeze?

187,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) stock toppled late Tuesday after the No. 3 biotech reported first-quarter sales and earnings that lagged Wall Street and said it had another quarter of declining revenue from its blockbuster hepatitis C drugs.Overall sales fell 17% year over year to $6.5 billion for the quarter ended March 31, missing views for $6.62 billion. Adjusted income of $2.23 a share lagged expectations for $2.28 a share and plunged 26% vs. this time last year.Revenue from hepatitis C drugs Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa toppled 65% year-over-year to $2.6 billion. Gilead blamed the decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi on lower sales across all major markets, partially offset by stronger sales of Epclusa. Epclusa launched in last summer in the U.S. and Europe.Hepatitis B and HIV drug sales, on the other hand, grew 14% vs. the year-earlier period on continued uptake of HIV medicines Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. Other products, including drugs for blood pressure, chest pain and intravenous infusions, grew 7.6% to $536 million.During the quarter, HIV drug bictegravir showed positive results in a Phase 2 study, Gilead said. Gilead pledged earlier this year to put a massive effort behind bictegravir after sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi slowed in 2016 as the hepatitis C market in the U.S. and Europe matures.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 425-company Biomed/Biotech industry group is now ranked No. 12 out of 197 groups tracked. But the market has been volatile for some stocks. Visit IBD's Technology page for a look at which stocks look strong in 2017.Other markets are still emerging, however. Last week, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) was the first company to receive approval from Chinese regulators for an oral hepatitis C drug. Gilead's hepatitis C drugs aren't yet approved in China where north of 10 million people suffer from the disease.Gilead maintained guidance for $22.5 billion to $24.5 billion in product sales, including $7.5 billion to $9 billion in hepatitis C drug revenue. Hepatitis C drug sales would decline 44% at the midpoint and be at their lowest point since 2014. Sales in that unit declined 22.5% in 2016 after growing 54% in 2015.Shares ended trading Tuesday up 0.7%, at 68.59. After hours on the stock market today, Gilead stock was down 2.3%, near 67. Earlier in the day, Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK) reported their first-quarter earnings. Pfizer topped profit expectations, but sales lagged.

188,GILD,"Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) rheumatoid arthritis drug is 15% to 30% cheaper than rival drugs from Amgen (AMGN), AbbVie (ABBV) and Roche (RHHBY), an analyst said Tuesday after the duo's Kevzara grabbed Food and Drug Administration approval.Kevzara's approval comes seven months after the FDA delayed its approval on issues with manufacturing at a French factory where the drug is filled. The approval is for patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who don't respond to other anti-rheumatic drugs.""The approval came on time and with a label that more or less matches our expectations,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. Kevzara can be prescribed alone or in combination with FDA-approved methotrexate. It is a self-administered injection.Like Roche's Actemra, which belongs to the same class of drugs, Kevzara is associated with an increased risk of serious and minor infections, liver issues and injection-site reactions. But it's also at a 15% discount to Actemra at $39,000 annually.""With discounts, (it) should offer a cost-effective treatment option for payers in this setting,"" Porges said. Kevzara costs 30% less than Amgen's Enbrel and AbbVie's Humira, which are widely prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis, though belong to a different drug class.IBD'S TAKE: Regeneron could be among those leading a biotech resurgence this year, analysts say. Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive on why Amgen, Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB) aren't expected to be at the forefront of the revitalization.Regeneron and Sanofi expect European approval to come later this year and see Kevzara hitting the market in the U.S. within a few weeks. But Porges sees the drug as a minimal driver and forecasts $37 million in sales this year, growing to $456 million in 2021.A number of drug classes address rheumatoid arthritis, he noted. The field is likely to become more crowded later this year when Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) adds its drug sirukimab to the lineup and as more in a class dubbed JAK inhibitors arrive in 2018-19.""Kevzara contributes approximately 11% of our expected sales of joint Sanofi-Regeneron products in 2018, but this falls to 5% long term as expected growth of (eczema drug) Dupixent and even (cholesterol-lowering drug) Praluent rapidly eclipse Kevzara's importance,"" Porges said.The consensus forecasts Kevzara sales at $56 million this year, growing to $705 million by 2020 and hitting $1.1 billion by 2025.On the stock market today, Regeneron stock rose 0.1% to 461.37, as Sanofi stock fell 0.2% to 49.07. Shares of rivals Amgen and AbbVie were up 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively, while Roche dipped 0.4%.RELATED:Will 'Comeback Kid' Regeneron Survive Amgen's Cholesterol Squeeze?Regeneron Pops On 'Better-Than-Feared' Eye, Cholesterol Drug Sales

189,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD), on Tuesday, hinted it could be prepping to make an acquisition in oncology after reporting sales from its hepatitis C drug franchise toppled for the second straight quarter.On the late Tuesday quarterly conference call, Chief Executive John Milligan said the firm is ""assessing a number of different opportunities"" that could play out over the coming year, including partnerships and acquisitions.""I think it's pretty clear we're looking for another avenue to increase our opportunity for revenue,"" he said.

In the first quarter, the unit saw revenue plunge 65% from a year ago as fewer patients are starting on the drugs.But the HIV business seems strong, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. Gilead is successfully transitioning patients to tenofovir alafenamide, or TAF, from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, TDF, drugs. Older TDF drugs are lower priced and exposed to generics.Carr noted 42% of Gilead patients are now on TAF-based treatments for HIV.On the stock market today, Gilead stock lost 2% to 67.21, after earlier touching a two-week low.RELATED:Gilead Topples On Consensus-Lagging Q1 As Hepatitis C Drug Sales PlummetDow's Pfizer Tops Earnings Views, But Sales Come Up ShortHow Gilead Is Paying The Price For Actually Curing A Disease

190,GILD,"Dow component Pfizer (PFE) on Tuesday reported mixed first-quarter results as what it calls its Essential Health unit tugged down overall sales, though revenue from a Novartis (NVS)-rivaling cancer drug bounded 58% vs. the year-earlier quarter.Pfizer said it earned adjusted income of 69 cents a share on revenue of $12.78 billion for the first quarter, up 3% and down 2%, respectively. Analysts had expected the No. 2 drugmaker to report earnings of 67 cents a share on sales of $13.09 billion.During the quarter, Pfizer's Innovative Health unit, which includes its newer products, grew 6%. But its Essential Health business, which includes legacy products, offset that, falling 9%. In September, Pfizer scrapped the idea of a corporate breakup that would have split the two businesses.Wall Street has pinned some hopes on Pfizer's Ibrance, which is approved to treat some forms of advanced breast cancer. Ibrance sales grew 58% to $679 million in the period. But it has some competition from Novartis' Kisqali. Further, Eli Lilly's (LLY) abemaciclib has shown promise in clinical trials.Sales of pneumonia vaccine Prevnar 13 toppled 8% vs. the year-earlier quarter. In the U.S., the dip was ""primarily due to the continued decline in revenues from the adult indication due to smaller remaining 'catch-up opportunity,'"" Pfizer said. Globally, sales fell on the timing of government purchases.Enbrel, an immunosuppressant, also saw sales dip. Outside the U.S. and Canada, Enbrel sales came in at $588 million, down 20%. In developed Europe, Enbrel sales fell 28% to $348 million. Revenue also toppled 6% and 3% in emerging markets and other developed parts of the globe, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Having trouble keeping up with the slew of pharma and biotech earnings this quarter? Catch up on IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.Pfizer also reiterated its 2017 guidance for $52 billion to $54 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings of $2.50-$2.60 a share, flat and up 6.3%, respectively. Analysts are calling for $53.15 billion in revenue and adjusted income of $2.55 per share.On the stock market today, shares for the member of the Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.5% to 33.61 after earlier falling as much as 2.7%, touching their lowest point in three months. The stock has a potential buy point at 34.75 out of a cup-with-handle that began forming in August.Meanwhile, fellow Dow drug giant Merck (MRK) also issues its first-quarter earnings report. Merck topped on earnings and sales, while raising full-year guidance. Gilead Sciences (GILD), a major biotech player, reported weaker-than-expected earnings and sales late Tuesday.RELATED:How Lilly's New Drug Could Spark A Deeper Rivalry with Novartis, PfizerPfizer Follows Baxter, Gets Slammed With Subpoena Related To Saline Shortage

191,GILD,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) grabbed a pair of major wins Friday after China approved its hepatitis C regimen and Europe blessed its immuno-oncology drug Opdivo to treat head-and-neck cancer, a spokesperson told Investor's Business Daily.Daklinza and Sunvepra were approved to treat hepatitis C patients with genotype 1b, a common malady in China. Daklinza was also approved in combination with other agents, including Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Sovaldi, for genotypes 1-6 pending approval of Sovaldi in China.Chief Commercial Officer Murdo Gordon doesn't expect Bristol to see a Gilead-like decline in sales despite the 91%-99% cure rate of its Daklinza-Sunvepra combination. Gilead's sales of hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni fell 24% and 34% in 2016 on high cure rates.But the picture is different in China, where Gilead hasn't yet gotten approval for its drugs. There are north of 10 million people living with hepatitis C in China, Gordon said. To put that in perspective, there were an estimated 2.7 million hepatitis C patients in the U.S. between 2003-10.""The numbers are staggering when you think about the number of infected people in China with hepatitis C,"" he said. ""When you think about the infrastructure in the Chinese market for care, it's going to need to scale up.""Gordon wouldn't comment on when Bristol plans to launch the combination or on its pricing, saying there's still some negotiation to be done. The Daklinza-Sunvepra combination was also approved in Japan in 2014.Bristol likely won't seek approval in the U.S. for its combination. The company discontinued those efforts in 2014 and Gordon says ""the competitive window in the U.S. has come and gone."" The U.S. and Europe are primarily mature markets for hepatitis C, he said.IBD'S TAKE: Though Gilead's sales of hepatitis C drugs in the U.S. toppled in 2016, the biotech giant is counting on its HIV drug, bictegravir, to be a major player. Visit IBD's Technology page for a closer look at how Gilead plans to leverage its assets.The company hasn't given a forecast for sales of Daklinza-Sunvepra or Daklinza-Sovaldi in China, Gordon said. Daklinza is approved in the U.S. in combination with Sovaldi and costs $63,000 wholesale for a 12-week regimen.Due to the market size in China, Gordon says it'll be awhile before the Chinese market becomes mature and begins seeing widespread eradication.""The dynamics in China could be different in terms of how long it takes to get to those 10 million-plus patients and treat them all effectively to the point you're actually eradicating the disease,"" he said. ""I think the duration is going to take a number of years to get to the point that sales decline.""Gordon expects competition in China and said, ""There are multiple products under review."" He emphasized the speed with which the Chinese government approved the combination — under a year from start to finish — and called it ""a significant event in China.""""I think it's important to highlight this is a great story for the Chinese FDA, for the innovative biopharmaceutical industry and for Bristol-Myers Squibb in particular,"" he added. ""We can help all of these patients who've been waiting on this innovation to hit the market.""In other news, Gordon said Europe approved its application for Opdivo in squamous cell head-and-neck cancer as a second-line treatment after platinum-based therapy. Opdivo targets the PD-1 protein to help the immune system identify camouflaged cancer cells. It competes most directly against Keytruda from Dow stock Merck (MRK).On the stock market today, Bristol stock rose 0.7% to 56.05 The drug approval announcement followed a strong first-quarter earnings report for Bristol. Sales and profits topped Wall Street expectations as Opdivo sales grew 60% in the quarter. Bristol shares rose 4.8% for the week, retaking their 50-day moving average and approaching their 200-day.RELATED: Vertex Big Winner In Biopharma Q1 As AbbVie, AstraZeneca DipAstraZeneca Wallops Profit Views Despite Toppling Sales; Eyes Key TrialAbbVie Flips With Buy Point After Q1 Earnings, Sales Top

192,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) narrowly escaped a potential game changer with the failure of TrumpCare, but its hopes for an HIV franchise still could be dashed on payer pushback as generics and ""hybrid"" combinations cut into its share.On Thursday, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges outlined how Gilead's HIV drugs, including a combination of bictegravir, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, could be at risk should the GOP revive the American Health Care Act, or AHCA, or offer a similar alternative. Gilead shares ticked up a penny to 66.48.The expansion of Medicaid under ObamaCare helped boost access to HIV drugs. Any changes to Medicaid funding under President Trump's administration or access could have hurt Gilead's chances of pushing its HIV drugs as it struggles to deal with 2016's sharp fall in hepatitis C sales.So Gilead is putting its ""might"" behind the HIV business.""Gilead appears to have dodged a bullet with the failure of the AHCA,"" Porges wrote in a note to clients. But ""any change to Medicaid funding could increase pressure on the funding for up to half of the drug coverage in some states.""Under that pressure, some state programs have already resorted to more active management of their HIV drugs, he wrote. Some semi-exclusionary formulations have been tested in Ohio, Illinois and Georgia. In 12-18 months, the quality of generic and semi-generic HIV meds is likely to improve.""If the current funding for Medicaid is unchanged, those options may not see much adoption, and Gilead's HIV franchise should not face disruption based on price,"" he wrote. If funding does change, semi-generic products could have a shot at undercutting Gilead on pricing, and take share.IBD'S TAKE: An analyst pleaded with Gilead to buy something — and it may have worked. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on what Gilead could buy and why.Payers, too, could also begin to more actively manage their HIV drug reimbursements especially if faced with further tightening for Medicaid funding. Currently, Gilead looks safe in that environment where physicians and patients have freedom of choice for HIV drugs.""Gilead may have to match the large discounts now offered to such plans for their legacy combinations when they launch bictegravir (plus emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide), but should still be able to secure preferred availability for their products in this channel,"" Porges said.This year, Porges expects HIV drug sales to account for 55% of Gilead's total sales, up 42% vs. the prior year, before growing to 78% of total sales in 2021.RELATED:Biotechs Defy Trump Tweets To Rally, But What Can Send Them Higher?Incyte Spikes To Record High On Rumors Gilead Could Acquire ItHow Gilead Is Paying The Price For Actually Curing A Disease

193,GILD,"How do you get a handle on the biotech market when an unknown stock like Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) — up nearly 200% since January — outperforms the likes of the industry's top name, Amgen (AMGN)?Sure, Esperion has had some breakthroughs in cholesterol medication. But Amgen recently had its own moment with one of its cholesterol drugs, proving that decreasing ""bad"" LDL cholesterol also cuts the risk of heart attack and stroke. Still, Amgen isn't getting the respect that smaller biotech players are getting, up a comparatively paltry 11% this year.Don't get discouraged, though, analysts say. Just because Amgen isn't getting a lot of love, it doesn't mean other biotech stocks are slouches. It's really a question of navigating what can be a complex sector.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says biotechs have done well since the election, though the stocks are subject to the whims of political debate over drug pricing and health care.""We're worried about Donald Trump and health care reform ... we're worried about FDA reform and now we're worried about drug-pricing regulations,"" he said. ""And it just doesn't seem as though the accumulated worries are going to go away in a hurry.""The overall group, though, looks strong. It's now ranked No. 10 out of 197 groups tracked, and four weeks ago it was ranked No. 5.IBD'S TAKE: Among drugmakers, Allergan is sweeping the medical-aesthetics market. But Hologic wants to play. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a breakdown on that battle.Porges and Mizuho analyst Salim Syed call it a ""stock-pickers market."" Some biotechs are bound to do well in 2017 with a number of catalysts still ahead of them, while others are more likely to struggle with macroeconomics and politics.""There are still some pressures that investors need to be cognitive of, like drug pricing,"" Syed told IBD. ""Some folks thought that was a presidential platform topic, but it keeps coming up now in the postelection.""IBD's 425-company Biomed/Biotech industry group is up 12% for the year. Major exchange traded funds iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (IBB) and the SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) are up 12% and 20%, respectively.The top five biotechs include Amgen, Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN). Each has been in the news in 2017, but none on stock price. Amgen has gained the most at 11% with Gilead lagging, down 6% since January.Syed has buy ratings on Amgen, Celgene and Gilead stocks and a neutral rating on Biogen stock.But the smaller players and potential takeout candidates like Incyte (INCY) and Tesaro (TSRO) have seen big gains on Wall Street. Tesaro is likely to remain a stand-alone company, though, after grabbing FDA approval for ovarian cancer drug, Zejula. Its stock rose as much as 43% through mid-February but is now up only 3% for the year.Incyte, on the other hand, has tacked on 24% since January on rumors that No. 2 biotech Gilead could be looking to acquire it. Incyte would open Gilead up to the oncology world as its hepatitis C franchise struggles amid high cure rates.""Once again, we're starting the year with the best-performing stocks being those that were cheapest and more of takeout candidates,"" Porges told IBD. ""So (making predictions has) definitely been somewhat challenging.""Earlier this month, Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) stock hit an 11-year high on strong data for a pain pill that could be an alternative to potentially addictive Oxycodone. Nektar stock catapulted 43% in a single day. Shares extended 25% from a cup-with-handle formation in late March, but have since given back 20% of those gains. The stock remains up 58% for the year.Other big stock earners include Kite Pharma (KITE) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE), both of which are working on drugs that belong to a class called CAR T-cell therapies. These drugs engineer patients' immune cells to treat cancer. Kite stock is up a whopping 80%, leading a 42% rise in Bluebird stock.And as Esperion rocketed on Amgen's heart study, so too did The Medicines Company (MDCO). Shares are up 45% since January. Porges lists Medicines Co. as a stock to watch, noting its ""spectacular returns.""""If you have the right stock and the right set of events, then you can still generate incredibly attractive returns and that's the excitement of biotech,"" Porges said. ""These are companies that are approaching critical readouts of ongoing development programs where investors think there's a reasonable chance a critical trial or a critical milestone turns out positively.""Mizuho's Syed suggests looking at individual stocks and equities, rather than hoping for a broad biotech resurgence. He sees a ""good number of catalysts"" in 2017 for the market, but notes the drug-pricing debate is likely to still weigh on the market.President Trump has keyed in on the drug-pricing debate and, though limited on details, says he has plans for a competitive-based system that would bring down the prices of drugs. Trump's pick to run the FDA, Scott Gottlieb, has said drug-pricing needs to be more transparent.As that struggle unfolds, Porges laid out some rules for picking biotech stocks likely to have better returns.""You want to be in growth companies early in their life cycle treating very serious illnesses,"" he said. ""And if you follow those three rules, you are generally going to end up with a portfolio that's going to perform better than the average, better than the index, better than the benchmarks.""Under those rules, Porges says Epizyme (EPZM), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) are interesting. Epizyme stock is up 44% since January, having topped a 12.70 buy point out of a cup-with-handle formation in early February. Vertex stock has gained 23% this year.Alexion stock is actually down 3% year to date, but the stock fits the bill using Porges' rules. The rare-disease company is working on drugs to treat disorders of the central nervous system, blood diseases and genetic disorders.The worst thing to do in biotech investing is to sell just because a stock is up, Porges said. And don't hesitate to buy a stock for the same reason.""One of the axioms of investing in biotech is always you never want to say, 'I'm not going to buy the stock because it's up,' because this is an industry where you can routinely see five-to-tenfold increases in value over the cycle of the emergence of a product,"" he said.""So often we see a stock where investors say, 'It's up 50%, but it's only gone from a $500 million market cap to a $750 million market cap,' which in the scheme of things is pretty small,"" he said. ""If you have a real drug, you're going to be a $5 billion or $6 billion company.""RELATED:Esperion And Medicines Co.

Celgene (CELG) is also working on an MS drug, ozanimod.Expectations are still high for Regeneron and Sanofi's (SNY) Dupixent, an eczema injection that launched at the end of the first quarter.""Initial feedback from the company and physicians after a month of commercialization will be critical to assess the launch sales trend, especially any anecdotes about the accessibility for patients after the price announcement,"" he wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead Sciences is suffering from a slowing hepatitis C drug franchise. Could it buy itself out of the decline? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a better look at what Gilead may have its sights on acquiring.Amgen (AMGN) and Regeneron are also likely to get questions on reimbursement changes for their medicines that lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. Amgen showed in a recent study that lowering LDL cholesterol reduces the risk for heart attacks and strokes, and the Street is hoping that will push payers to reimburse for the drugs.In upcoming filings, investors will look for Amgen commentary on migraine drug erenumab and romosozumab, a drug to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

203,GILD,"The largest biotech ETFs served up a reminder in March that investors in this high-growth industry should expect a bumpy ride. They hit their best levels in a year early on, then took a nasty tumble before bouncing back smartly from those losses.On Tuesday, SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) and iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) were modestly lower but holding above the 10-week moving average — a bullish sign after a recent test of that critical marker of support. And despite a stumble in March so far, they are holding on to double-digit gains for the first quarter, vs. 12% for the S&P 500.That's a nice turnaround from a plunge of more than 10% for many biotech exchange traded funds the prior quarter, which coincided with hawkish election rhetoric about price-gouging in the drug industry.The latest rally comes despite major setbacks this month, including Trump tweets on drug prices and serious blows to big-name biotechs Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB), which cast a pall on the entire industry.Biotechnology ETFs rallied sharply in January and February as higher beta names swung into favor after President Trump's shock election win. Plus, investors saw these stocks as a ""value play in a growth industry,"" said Matthew Bartolini, head of research for SPDR Americas.Some market analysts still see fair-to-attractive valuations in the sector, despite its year-to-date outperformance, helping IBB earn an upgrade recently.In light of improving valuations, however, two things will be key to the next leg up for this industry, in Bartolini's view.First, biotechs have to deliver on their promise of growth.Many smaller firms like Kite Pharma (KITE) and Esperion (ESPR) are unprofitable or have no sales, and even industry bellwethers such as Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Incyte (INCY) are in earnings slumps.However, earnings momentum for the sector as a whole is starting to look more favorable, some analysts say. Top biotech Celgene (CELG), which earns an extremely high EPS Rating of 98 from IBD, has scored upward revisions in forward estimates.Secondly, mergers and acquisitions must come to fruition to boost share prices. Intercept (ICPT), Regeneron (REGN) and Biogen are three names being bandied about as takeover targets.XBI has outpaced peers in 2017 so far, as it has consistently over the past three-, five- and 10 years. It is up 17.9% year to date through March 27 vs. a 10.6% gain for its iShares rival, which is cap-weighted and skews toward larger companies.Bartolini considers the SPDR biotech to be well placed looking ahead as well. An equal-weighted indexing method gives it a small-cap tilt. That may be beneficial in an industry such as biotechnology, where smaller and more speculative companies have strong potential as long-term growth plays, he said.Plus, relative to cap-weighted rivals, XBI is less tied to the fortunes of the largest names in the industry. On the one hand, that makes the SPDR ETF more immune to single-stock risk and ""tweet risk,"" in Bartolini's words. However, it also will benefit less from a big price gain for the industry giants.A Trump tweet on drug pricing hit XBI and IBB hard on March 7.RELATED:Which ETFs Are Making Big Moves?

204,GILD,"Conviction is vital to the managers of Parnassus Fund (PARNX). Ian Sexsmith and Robert Klaber, along with lead portfolio manager Jerome Dodson, have guided the fund into the upper echelon of large-cap growth funds by taking big stakes in relatively few stocks.They take above-average bets on each stock, particularly in their top 10 holdings. So they better have done their homework and have high confidence that their picks will pan out. Top holdings as of Jan. 31 include Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Micron Technology (MU).The Parnassus approach is working fine. The average annual returns of Parnassus and its stablemate Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX) have surpassed the S&P 500's in the past year, as well as the past three years, five years and 10 years -- by enough to earn them both IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards.Parnassus Endeavor took top honors for being among the top five winners ranked by 10-year average annual return in three categories: overall U.S. diversified equity, as well as growth and large-cap funds. Parnassus Fund was among the top five in growth and large cap.The $3.7 billion Parnassus Endeavor owns just 26 stocks, while its $950 million stablemate Parnassus Fund holds 36 stocks. The larger fund, which Dodson has managed alone since 2005, has 48% of its assets invested in its top 10 holdings. Parnassus, which has been around since 1984, has 38% embedded in the top 10.Many growth funds hold 50 to 100 stocks in smaller position, seeking to control volatility with greater diversification. Not Parnassus.""We are a high-conviction fund,"" Klaber said. ""We have high active share and are bottom-up stock pickers."" Active share is a measure of how much a portfolio's holdings differ from its benchmark index.Aside from its focused approach, another way the funds stand out is their mandate to invest in good corporate citizens. ""We have no exposure to the energy or utility sectors,"" Sexsmith said. ""We are looking for companies that are best-in-class from an environmental perspective, a social perspective and a governance perspective."" In addition, Parnassus Endeavor's holdings must offer outstanding workplaces.As a multicap fund, the Parnassus team has the flexibility to invest wherever it sees opportunity. ""It is a go-anywhere domestic stock fund,"" Klaber said. ""We have no market-cap restrictions, so it gives us a pretty broad playing field."" Though Parnassus does have more than Endeavor in small and midcaps, 29% vs. 25%, Parnassus still favors large caps with 64% of its assets. Meanwhile, large-cap-oriented Endeavor has 86% in big caps.Some funds aim to control risk by veering only so far from benchmark-index sector weightings. Parnassus' conviction-investing results in some heavy over- and underweighting in sectors. As of Jan. 31, Parnassus Fund had 23% in financials vs. the S&P 500's 16%. Parnassus Endeavor was close to the benchmark in tech with 18%, but had outsize bets of 38% in tech vs. 19%, and 31% in health care vs. 14%.Klaber notes that a long-term focus has been key to the fund's success. Both funds have turnover rates 42% or lower. ""We are a bit more contrarian than other Parnassus funds,"" he said. ""We're willing to accept a wider range of outcomes in the short term.""Indeed, a direct line between top holdings and current fund performance isn't always clear. Some of the two funds' recent top holdings show signs of struggling, including Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Allergan (AGN), off 33% and 14% from their 52-week highs.Parnassus screens all potential holdings for relevance. ""We are looking for companies that are becoming increasingly relevant for the products or services they offer,"" Klaber said. ""We want to own companies that are gaining share in their sector or industry. The focus on relevance helps us to avoid value traps."" In value traps, investors are attracted to a stock by its low valuations, but after investors buy, the stock fails to rise.Wide moats are a hallmark of portfolio holdings. ""We seek companies with sustainable competitive advantages,"" Klaber said. ""We feel that provides protection during down markets because there is stored value.""Another important consideration for Parnassus is efficient capital allocation by companies it invests in. ""We go back five years and analyze how management has allocated capital in the past,"" Klaber said. ""We then project how we think they will allocate capital in the future to understand whether they are good stewards of capital.""The Parnassus team creates a three-year forecast with base, bull and bear scenario analyses for potential new stock buys. ""We are looking for asymmetry,"" Klaber said. ""We want companies with moderate to low downside risk and significant upside. An asymmetric risk to reward ratio is a common feature across all of our holdings.""""Historically, the Endeavor Fund has had a tech bias,"" Klaber said. ""As of the end of last year, more than 40% of the fund was invested in tech.""As of the end of January, two sectors accounted for approximately half of the Parnassus Fund. ""From a sector perspective, one of the sectors we have been most overweight is financials,"" Sexsmith said. ""The pro-growth agenda of the new administration has been a tailwind for these firms.""Parnassus is weighted 22.9% in financial service stocks. It added Progressive (PGR) in the first-quarter of 2015. Endeavor also has a stake in the auto insurance company. Sexsmith sees the company's online sales strategy as a disruptive force. ""There aren't many companies that are going to gain market share for as long as we can see,"" he said. ""When we see opportunities like that we are going to invest in them. Every year, Progressive chips away and gains market share. Its market share now is around 9% of the U.S. auto insurance market. That's going to keep going up over time.""Progressive shares have gained 11.4% since the beginning of the year and 19.1% from a year ago.Parnassus is weighted 27.3 in technology. ""In technology, we own a collection of wide-moat businesses with strong growth profiles that trade at attractive valuations,"" Klaber said.Klaber cites eBay (EBAY) as a prime example of a company with a wide moat. It is owned by both Parnassus and Endeavor. ""The source of its moat is a strong network effect where more sellers bring more buyers and vice versa,"" he said.Shares of eBay are up 12% year-to-date and 37.9% over the past year. They broke out of a cup-with-handle base in February, ran up 4%, but have since eased to near the breakout point.IBM (IBM) is a top tech holding in both portfolios. ""It is trading at 13 times earnings, about a 25% discount to the market, with a 3% dividend yield, so expectations are low,"" Klaber said. ""We think its server business will do better than expectations and its strategic initiatives group will continue to see growth accelerate.""IBM has climbed 7.1% so far this year and 24.9% over the last 52 weeks.The Parnassus team sees a lengthy runway for Allergan. The pharmaceutical company is the top holding of Parnassus and a top five holding of Endeavor. ""It has a dominant position in many therapeutic areas,"" Klaber said. ""It's a stock we have owned as a firm since the end of 2013, when it was in the high 80s. We were also buying it aggressively toward the end of last year. This is a company that has six drugs either in phase three or entering phase three in 2017.""Allergan shares have jumped 14.8% in 2017.The Parnassus crew exhibit the kind of patience with Allergan that many growth investors do not. While the company's earnings have grown at a 24% annual rate the past three years, Wall Street analysts see growth slowing to 19% this year and 11% next year. The stock's Relative Price Strength Rating from IBD is just 50.RELATED:Contrarian Pin Oak Equity Rises To The Top

205,GILD,"Incyte (INCY) stock hit a record high Monday on rumors No. 3 biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) could be looking to acquire it amid projections of still dwindling hepatitis C drug sales in 2017.Incyte stock ended the regular trading session up 1.2%, at 151.03 on Monday, after earlier touching an all-time high at 151.63. Gilead stock, on the other hand, trended down for the third consecutive day, closing down a fraction, at 68.10.Rumors emerged Friday that Gilead could be putting together a bid on Incyte with eyes on its immuno-oncology drug, epacadostat. Epacadostat is currently in trials with Merck's (MRK) Keytruda to target five tumor types.Though Merck competes directly with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Incyte's drug is a different flavor of immuno-oncology, working to inhibit what is known as the IDO enzyme. Doing so, allows the immune system to identify tumor cells for what they are, and destroy them.Credit Suisse analyst Kennen MacKay boosted his price target on Incyte stock to 174 from 136 in a note titled, in part, ""Scarcity Value Makes for Compelling Target."" Incyte and epacadostat could offer Gilead an attractive entry point into the immuno-oncology field, MacKay said.IBD'S TAKE: An analyst urged Gilead to buy something on Friday. Which companies would be a good fit? Visit IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown of Gilead's potential targets.""Epacadostat could be a scarce immuno-oncology backbone blockbuster,"" he wrote in a note. Incyte's drug could be paired with drugs like Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo, both of which target a protein called, PD-1, to battle cancer.For Gilead, Incyte would offer the biotech giant entry into a potentially massive market as its hepatitis C franchise falls from a two-year run. Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni brought in north of $40 billion in sales before toppling in 2016.Hepatitis C is curable, Gilead has explained. So the company is seeing fewer patients and those who do suffer from hepatitis C are healthier. Healthier patients tend to wait longer before seeing a doctor.Gilead has pushed its HIV drug, bictegravir, as its next ""Mount Everest,"" but analysts have pushed for Gilead to make an acquisition. On Friday, an analyst suggested Gilead look at companies with pipelines resembling those of Incyte, Clovis Oncology and Tesaro.After reports emerged Gilead could be considering a bid on Incyte, Gilead declined to comment in an email to IBD. Incyte didn't return a request for comment.RELATED:How Gilead Is Paying The Price For Actually Curing A DiseaseWill Merck, Glaxo Undercut Gilead's Next 'Mount Everest' Drug?Gilead Hepatitis C Sales Plunge As Merck Swipes Share: Analyst
"
206,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) ought to pursue a merger outside its core virology, oncology, inflammation areas, an analyst said Friday — and the plea may have worked sooner than he thought.Barclays analyst Geoffrey Meacham suggested that Gilead look at companies with pipelines resembling those of Incyte (INCY), Tesaro (TSRO) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS). Then hours later, Incyte stock spiked more than 8%, to 149.24, on a StreetInsider report citing inside sources who say Gilead is ready to pull the trigger on acquiring the $26.6 billion biotech. Gilead stock, though, sank a fraction, near 68, on the stock market today.Representatives from Gilead had no comment. Incyte didn't immediately return requests for comment.Meacham's suggestion from came as total prescriptions of hepatitis C drug Harvoni dipped 2.2% week over week to 3,427, according to health care tracker IMS and cited by Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez. New prescriptions also fell 2% vs. last week.At the same time, Gilead's Epclusa saw total prescriptions flatten, though new prescriptions rose 6.1% on a week-over-week basis.Still, competition is mounting. Merck's (MRK) rival drug Zepatier posted a stout 5.8% jump in total prescriptions, though new scripts fell 10.3%.Gilead's struggles with its hepatitis C franchise are well documented. After two years and more than $40 billion in total sales, Gilead's Harvoni and Sovaldi saw sales decline in 2016, partially offset by new drug Epclusa. That's because hepatitis C is curable.Now, Gilead is pushing its HIV unit as its next ""Mount Everest."" Barclays' Meacham, though, is doubtful the company's HIV drug bictegravir will be enough to tug up Gilead stock by itself. Shares have toppled 4.5% since January. Shares lost 0.3% to 68.19 on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts had long predicted Gilead's hepatitis C downfall before it happened. But what were the warning signs? Head to IBD's Industry Themes for the breakdown.In a letter to Gilead management, Meacham implored the company to seek a ""transformational or even incremental transaction."" He suggested Gilead look at companies with immuno-oncology drugs that target the IDO checkpoint, those with assets in the PARP inhibitor class of drugs or firms working in lymphoma.""A deal that is much more pipeline-driven with a longer-term (profit and loss) benefit also likely would be well received but also carry substantial clinical risk,"" Meacham wrote in a note. The trade-off could be favorable if Gilead acquires a company with multiple mid-to-late stage drugs and a strong pipeline.Incyte with its drug, epacadostat, would fit the bill. Epacadostat belongs to a class of drugs that teach the immune system to identify camouflaged cancer cells. AstraZeneca (AZN), Tesaro and Clovis Oncology are all working on ovarian cancer drugs that belong to a class called PARP inhibitors.Companies like Seattle Genetics (SGEN) are working on classical Hodgkin lymphoma.Wall Street has long harped on Gilead to seek a deal like its acquisitions of Triangle Pharma in 2002 and Pharmasset in 2011. Meacham calls those deals ""literally among the best deals ever consummated in the history of the biopharma industry.""""We admire Gilead's discipline, especially through the valuation peaks and troughs in the biotech/pharma sector, but too much patience has put immense pressure on Gilead shares,"" Meacham wrote. ""By far and away, our fear is that as quarterly operating cash flow declines ... so does Gilead's capacity to do a meaningful transaction.""RELATED:How Gilead Is Paying The Price For Actually Curing A Disease

207,GILD,"When biotechnology giant Gilead Sciences (GILD) bought Pharmasset in 2011, it inherited a compound then known as 7977, which Wall Street analysts expected to bring in $3.6 billion in peak sales by 2018.But just three years later, 7977 launched under the name Sovaldi at north of $1,000 a pill. It raked in $10.3 billion in 2014 sales alone and proved to be a nearly foolproof cure for hepatitis C virus, or HCV. Over three years, Gilead's flagship HCV drugs pulled in more than $44 billion. They also doubled the company's net margins, pushing them past the 50% level at one point in mid-2014.Trouble is, Gilead didn't just treat hepatitis C. For the most part, it cured patients after about three months. Sovaldi had an unheard-of success rate of up to 95% in some hepatitis C patients, and its follow-on treatment, Harvoni, proved more effective in some cases. Eventually, the patient pool was bound to get smaller, and it has. Sovaldi and Harvoni sales fell a respective 24% and 34% in 2016.""Think of it like an opening of a blockbuster movie in Hollywood and people wait in line,"" RBC analyst Michael Yee told Investor's Business Daily. ""Thus, there are less coming in right now than before.""Now the pressure is on Gilead to produce another big hit to drive its growth. And for biotech investors, its story is a cautionary tale to look beyond the initial fanfare of a hot new drug and consider the costs should it deliver on its promise.Hepatitis — unlike HIV, Alzheimer's disease and many types of cancer — can be a short-term temporary condition, said Kevin Young, Gilead's chief operating officer, on the company's Feb. 7 earnings conference call with analysts. Gilead says fewer patients are starting on HCV regimens and those that do are healthier than past patients.""And thanks to Harvoni, (HCV) can be cured in as little as eight weeks in a genotype 1 patient,"" Young said, referring to the most common type of hepatitis C.Gilead confirmed worries of the hepatitis C slowdown on Feb. 7 after releasing its fourth-quarter earnings. Shares toppled 8.6% the next day, nearly touching a three-year low. Whispers of the looming dip in HCV drug sales had plagued Gilead stock for the better part of a year.After climbing rapidly in 2013 and 2014, Gilead stock started to slip in 2015 and lost 31% in 2016 as analysts issued report after report modeling what Gilead would look like without HCV. Today, Gilead sees its HIV unit, which grew 13% last year, as its next big enterprise and has described its HIV drug bictegravir as its future ""Mount Everest.""Still, sentiment hasn't been this negative on Gilead stock since its $11 billion Pharmasset acquisition in 2011, says Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum. Then, 82% of analysts surveyed by Schoenebaum said Gilead paid too much for Pharmasset. Later on, analysts missed the potential and immediate demand for Sovaldi, and didn't even account for Harvoni.""Last time sentiment on Gilead's management was this bad, investors were wrong, very wrong,"" Schoenebaum wrote in a Feb. 16 research report. More than half, 51%, in the November 2011 survey said the Pharmasset buy would destroy Gilead's value.Sentiment obviously improved. Before Sovaldi, old-school hepatitis C treatments weren't as effective and often came along with flu-like side effects and anemia. Sovaldi was so successful that Gilead launched Harvoni in 2015 and saw similar results: $13.86 billion in Harvoni sales that year. Its newest addition to the hepatitis C line, Epclusa, brought in $1.75 billion in 2016.Gilead stock flew 106% in 2013 as Wall Street performed a 180-degree turn on Sovaldi ahead of its launch. Though activist groups and patients were incensed as inside discussions bumped Sovaldi's price to $84,000 from expectations for $36,000, the drug was a Wall Street dynamo.Harvoni launched with an even bigger $94,500 price tag. Gilead took its lumps in headlines for the price of both, but RBC analyst Yee says the price tags weren't particularly egregious, considering prior treatments and costs.""The high cost of treatment was not high relative to the existing prior therapy and was significantly better,"" he told IBD in an email. ""The costs have all come down by 50% given competition and other rebating.""For the fourth quarter, Gilead Chief Executive John Milligan noted Harvoni now sells for $15,000 in the U.S. Meanwhile, rivalries with Merck (MRK) and AbbVie will help curb prices. Merck itself signaled its expectations for lighter HCV sales in February when it took a $2.9 billion impairment charge on uprifosbuvir.Merck acquired uprifosbuvir from Idenix Pharmaceuticals in 2014. The company cut its value estimate on uprifosbuvir to $240 million. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says Merck is signaling ""reduced value for its participation in the market, which is consistent with a declining market overall.""Merck has successfully defended its patents for HCV med Zepatier against Gilead, and AbbVie is working on a next-generation drug set to launch sometime in 2017-18.Wall Street suspected the HCV decline was coming, and modeled $28 billion in total Gilead sales with $11.5 billion in hepatitis C franchise revenue for Gilead in 2017.The company's guidance for $22.5 billion to $24.5 billion in total sales and $7.5 billion to $9 billion from hepatitis C drug revenue painted a starker picture.Along with that guidance, Gilead said it expects patient starts on HCV regimens to drop in 2017. In 2016, Gilead estimates 231,000 patients started on its hepatitis C drugs, about 25,000 fewer than in 2015. In 2016, HCV sales got a push after two large commercial payers opened access and amid a marketing campaign via the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.Gilead's Young doesn't expect those ""one-time"" drivers to repeat in 2017.""The guidance implies a 20%-30% lower EPS (earnings per share) than consensus was modeling,"" RBC's Yee wrote in a Feb. 8 research report. ""We think the stock is probably range-bound until they can hit at least one to two quarters, and demonstrate a handle on forecasts/visibility.""Yee also echoed other analysts' calls for acquisitions to bolster the top line while Gilead works through the HCV decline and works to launch drugs in its HIV and NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) units. Yee sees Incyte (INCY) as a smart, but unlikely, deal.Gilead withstood pressure before and after its Pharmasset buy and won't bend to public pressure for M&A, Evercore's Schoenebaum said in a Feb. 16 video. Investors are questioning CEO Milligan, but none have identified the specific deal he missed that would have prevented the HCV decline.IBD'S TAKE: For a strong drugmaking bet, check out Incyte, analysts say. Incyte's pipeline is brimming with potential blockbuster opportunities. Head to The New America for a deeper dive on Incyte and its upcoming catalysts.""What you have here is a company that's not just going to go do a deal so they can out a press release saying, 'We did a deal,' and hope they get a sugar high on the stock on it,"" he said. ""They're only going to do deals they have a high degree of confidence will work out and a high degree of confidence they're underpaying for the asset.""Meanwhile, Gilead is bolstering its HIV and NASH units. Gilead recently pitted HIV drug bictegravir against GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) incumbent dolutegravir, approved in 2013 and sold under the brand name Tivicay. The phase 2 trial showed bictegravir is numerically stronger than GSK's drug in certain combinations.Price is a bigger concern. GSK's medication is cheaper since it combines with a generic med, meaning the HIV regimen can be priced around $17,000 vs. the likely $30,000 price tag attached to Gilead's solution, Yee said in a Feb. 15 report.Other analysts say Gilead's HIV and NASH units are ""too late"" and offer ""little value."" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said on Feb. 8 that he expects hepatitis C sales to topple 45% in 2017 and then 12%-21% annually through 2020. Though his outlook on HIV is positive, those sales aren't on an HCV-like trajectory, Porges said.""This is not sufficient to offset the unusual dynamics of the HCV business and the relatively modest contributions from other products offer little to mitigate the boom and bust in HCV,"" he wrote. ""Those opportunities appear to be arriving too late, with too little value, in our view.""Yee, though, says Gilead isn't filling a hole left from its declining HCV unit. It's merely coming down off a ""massive bolus of hundreds of thousands of people who came in during the first two years.""""The drug is still set to do $8 billion in 2017 and is one of the largest drugs in the world. Not exactly a hole,"" he said.RELATED:Gilead Clobbered On Hep C; 'Little Value' In 'Too Late' NASH, HIV UnitsCan Gilead Swivel To HIV Amid Flounder Hep C Sales, GSK Rivalry?Gilead HIV Drug Tops GSK Combo But Rivalry 'Intense' With GSK Doublet

208,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) sees HIV drug bictegravir as its ""Mount Everest,"" but rivals like Merck (MRK) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) will be able to price their rival drugs 10% to 55% cheaper, an analyst said Thursday.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges noted Merck and Glaxo are working on HIV regimens that include generic drugs. Gilead, on the other hand, ""has established premium pricing for their fixed-dose combinations based on all-branded component pricing,"" Porges wrote in a research report.As a result, Gilead will struggle to gain share in HIV — a much-needed sector as its lucrative hepatitis C franchise continues to dwindle. After two years and $40 billion-plus in sales, Gilead's hepatitis C drugs saw sales decline in 2016. The biotech is guiding to further declines in 2017.Over the past five years, Gilead has dominated the HIV landscape, Porges said. Its HIV unit brought in $12.9 billion in sales in 2016, up 16.2%. But the competitive landscape is shifting for HIV, with four new drugs set to launch in 2018-20.Gilead's bictegravir-based formulas are likely to be the ""gold standard"" for first- and second-line HIV treatments, Porges wrote. But with Gilead unlikely to budge on pricing, it's ability to hold share and/or price will erode, he predicted.UBS analyst Carter Gould is more bullish on Gilead's HIV enterprise. The Street expects bictegravir, which eventually will get a different brand name, to pull in $3 billion in 2017 sales, and $5 billion to $6 billion in peak sales when combined with the substance now known as filgotinib. Filgotinib is a drug developed by Galapagos (GLPG).But Gould downgraded Gilead stock to a neutral rating from buy and cut his price target to 72 from 118, citing the company's struggles with hepatitis C. Guidance suggests a 40%-50% dip in 2017 hepatitis C drug sales with 25%-35% fewer patients starting on one of Gilead's hepatitis C drugs this year.That is in line with Gilead's notes on its fourth-quarter earnings conference call. Old-school hepatitis C medications weren't as effective as Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni and carried a number of side effects. Today, there are fewer patients and many are healthier and thus put off treatment.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead's hepatitis C drug downfall didn't come out of the blue. Analysts had predicted it for the better part of a year. What were the warning signs? Visit IBD's Industry Themes for a closer look.Gilead is also experiencing competitive pressure from the likes of Merck and AbbVie (ABBV). Merck has successfully fought off patent litigation vs. Gilead with its HCV drug Zepatier. AbbVie is set to launch a next-generation asset in 2018.A merger won't fix Gilead's problems, Gould wrote. In 2002 and 2011 when Gilead acquired Triangle Pharma and Pharmasset, respectively, the stock trended down for roughly a month after the announcements. Gilead stock is now down 2.7% for the year.RBC analyst Michael Yee disagrees, arguing Gilead could do a number of ""string of pearls"" acquisitions to improve pipeline visibility. Kite Pharma (KITE) would be an interesting acquisition, he said. Meanwhile, the ""tail"" on hepatitis C sales should be significant enough to sustain demand.Yee has an outperform rating on Gilead stock. By the closing bell on the stock market today, Gilead stock fell 1.8% to 68.39. Merck was up marginally to 65.89 while Glaxo added 0.8% to 41.45.RELATED:This Pharma Is Beating The Pack In Getting Drugs To MarketAbbVie Strong Bet Than Gilead, Amgen — At Least Until 2020: AnalystGilead, Glaxo Pitted In HIV Battle; Both Struggle Vs.

209,GILD,"Eli Lilly's (LLY) pipeline has the best ""bang-for-the-buck,"" one analyst said Wednesday in an R&D comparison pitting Lilly against rivals Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said Lilly is outperforming the pack, achieving the best balance in R&D investment while limiting external investments over the past five years. Bristol and Pfizer trail whereas Merck struggles on these metrics, he wrote.Still, drugmakers like Lilly have struggled to gain FDA approvals. Only 9%-22% of drugs from 2011 pharma pipelines have gained approval. By contrast, biotechnology companies AbbVie (ABBV) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) have been more successful with 36% and 40% conversion rates.Among the top drugmakers, Bristol-Myers and Lilly have had considerably more success with phase three drugs. Meanwhile, Pfizer has only converted 20% of its late-stage pipeline in 2011 to drugs sold on the market.Pfizer has the broadest pipeline in the group -- with 57 disclosed new drugs, Fernandez wrote. But it has struggled with fallen megamergers and R&D disruptions, limiting its scale on productivity. Merck is the lowest in the pharma universe with 30.IBD'S TAKE: American Funds recently upped its stake in Bristol-Myers Squibb stock. Who else received American Funds' vote of confidence? Find out at IBD's Mutual Funds page.In his analysis, Fernandez also looked at ""churn,"" the turnover of new drugs from 2011-15, and ""burn,"" the percentage of attrition of the 2011 portfolio by 2016. Bristol has the highest burn rate and lowest churn rate.""The company appears to be focusing more on internal assets/partnerships/early stage M&A over mid- to late-stage external agents,"" Fernandez wrote in a note. ""Conversely, Merck's churn rate is among the highest in the group.""Merck's ""high overall R&D expenses are driven in part by the large Cubist and Idenix deals, which have so far struggled to generate the sizable returns management had hoped (for), as well the company's extraordinary investment behind Keytruda,"" he wrote.Though Merck isn't alone in its struggles with partnerships and acquisitions. Among big drugmakers and biotechs, only Gilead's purchase of Pharmasset in 2011 appears to have succeeded, Fernandez wrote.Pharmasset began development on Sovaldi, the hepatitis C drug that rocketed Gilead's sales in 2014-15. But Gilead's hepatitis C franchise began faltering in 2016 amid the high cure rates of its trio of drugs, Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa.At the closing bell on the stock market today, Lilly finished trading up 0.8% to 83.41. Bristol-Myers rose 1.4% to 57.12. Meanwhile, Merck slipped 0.2% to 65.80 while Pfizer also lost 0.2% to 33.91.RELATED:Gilead Hepatitis C Sales Plunge As Merck Swipes Share: AnalystAbbVie Stronger Bet Than Gilead, Amgen — At Least Until 2020: LeerinkMerck, Roche Gouge Bristol's I-O Share After Lung Cancer Approvals

210,GILD,"Prescriptions for Gilead Sciences' (GILD) hepatitis C drugs have plunged since Jan. 1 — leaving at least one analyst waiting for industrywide revenue of the remedies to hit bottom — even as competition looms from rival Merck (MRK) and AbbVie (ABBV).Total prescriptions of Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa are flat week over week, but have fallen 16% from the beginning of the quarter on Jan. 1, RBC analyst Michael Yee wrote in a note to clients, citing health care tracker IMS. New prescriptions are down 3% vs. last week.Meanwhile, Merck's hepatitis C drug, Zepatier, has flourished. Total Zepatier scripts are up 11% quarter to date. New prescriptions climbed 9% week over week, though total prescriptions were down 1% vs. last week.Zepatier now has 16% of the new prescriptions market, Yee wrote. Merck has said it expects to grow its share in 2017 with overseas launches in Japan and Europe during the fourth quarter. Zepatier's list price for treatment is roughly $54,600, cheaper than any Gilead alternative at little more than half the $94,500 list price for Harvoni. Many drugmakers, however, have not been getting list price for their drugs.The company ""suggested that countries are opening up more access more,"" Yee wrote. That ""could be good for Gilead as well.""But even Merck isn't immune to the weakening hepatitis C market. Last week, Merck said it would take a $2.9 billion impairment charge on uprifosbuvir, a hepatitis C drug acquired in 2014.IBD'S TAKE: Among biotechs, Incyte is a strong bet with a number of potential blockbusters in its pipeline, analysts say. Can Incyte keep its lead? Visit The New America for a deep dive on the company and stock.After Gilead was first to market with a new class of highly effective hepatitis C drugs, prescriptions for the company's lineup topped out in 2015 after a major two-year run. During that time, Gilead's net margins more than doubled to roughly the 50% level at their peak.The disease is curable, though, meaning it's getting harder to find new patients. New patients are often healthier and procrastinate on beginning treatment, Gilead has said.Like Gilead, AbbVie's hepatitis C drug sales also are struggling. This week, AbbVie's Viekira Pak for hepatitis C fell 27% and is down 41% quarter to date, Yee wrote. Though new prescriptions grew 21% week over week.AbbVie is ""essentially a niche player now,"" but its second-generation drug could be a competitor in 2018, Yee wrote. That drug could be approved by year-end. For Gilead, it's yet another competitor in a slowing market.Earlier this year, Gilead guided to $7.5 billion to $9 billion in 2017 hepatitis C drug sales, missing expectations by $3.5 billion to $4 billion.""Guidance could actually be conservative, but Gilead will need to hit a couple of quarter and see scripts stabilize before investors gain confidence,"" Yee said. ""We are watching for HCV scripts to flatten, and for the slope of the curve to inflect and stabilize in order to establish a 'bottom' for the franchise.""In midday trading on the stock market today, Gilead stock was down a fraction, near 70. Shares of Merck and AbbVie were up a fraction each, near 66.50 and 63.50, respectively.RELATED:Gilead, AbbVie Could Perk Up On Merck's Hep C Downfall: LeerinkAbbVie Stronger Bet Than Gilead, Amgen — At Least Until 2020: LeerinkGilead, Glaxo Pitted In HIV Battle; Both Struggle Vs.

211,GILD,"GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) set a high bar for Gilead Sciences (GILD), as the floundering biotech attempts to swivel from its declining hepatitis C unit to better HIV drug sales, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said Monday.The No. 3 biotech by market cap, Gilead is slated early Tuesday to release the results of phase 2 and phase 3 trials in HIV drug bictegravir. Anything less than ""numerical superiority and unblemished safety and tolerability"" will disappoint investors, Porges wrote in a research report.Investors are increasingly eyeing Gilead's HIV unit as a replacement for slowing hep C drug sales. The hep C unit makes up 44% of total sales in Q4, but fell 35% vs. the year-earlier period. HIV drug sales, on the other hand, rose 13% and brought in 45% of total sales in Q4.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts predicted Gilead would post declining hep C drug sales. What markers did they use to make their predictions? Grab IBD'S Industry Themes for some clues forecasting the HCV dip.Gilead's HIV unit, too, has faced challenges in recent history. The patent on Gilead's Viread is set to expire in December and the biotech lost exclusivity on Sustiva and Epivir. Gilead will also be rivaling GlaxoSmithKline in bolstering its HIV unit.Bictegravir ""is crucial to out outlook for Gilead,"" Porges wrote. ""It comprises the primary bulwark for the company's HIV franchise against the competitive challenges of GlaxoSmithKline's branded portfolio and looming generic entrants.""In earlier trials pitting GlaxoSmithKline's dolutegravir and Gilead's Truvada, dolutegravir delivered 90% virological control, meaning Gilead's bictegravir will have to either meet or top that stat. But Gilead was particularly excited about early trial data.""We therefore presume that it shows bictegravir in a very favorable light compared to dolutegravir,"" Porges said.He has a market perform rating on Gilead stock. In the stock market today, Gilead stock rose 1.9% to 67.65, but GlaxoSmithKline stock fell 0.72% to 39.99.RELATED:Gilead Stock Dives To 22-Month Low As Hep C Cure Drains Total SalesGilead Will Boost HIV, NASH Drugs Amid Hep C Slump; Stock On 2-Week DipGilead Crashes On Q4 Hep C Sales Declines, 2017 Views; Q4, 2016 Metrics Top

213,GILD,"Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) stock seesawed Wednesday after the biotech guided to north of $80 million in 2017 sales for its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug Exondys 51, lagging Wall Street estimates by 40%.Sarepta stock was up and down a couple times on the stock market today, but it ended the session down 2.4%, at 30.38. Shares hit a 14-year high above 63 in September when the FDA approved Exondys 51, but are down more than 50% since then and now trade below both their 50-day and 200-day moving averages.The FDA's approval of Exondys 51 was met with widespread disapproval as payors like Anthem (ANTM), Humana (HUM) and United Healthcare (UNH) have pushed back against covering the costly drug, with doubts as to its efficacy. Analysts note the Duchenne market is small, in the thousands of patients.For the first quarter, Sarepta guided to $13 million to $15 million in Exondys 51 sales, in a late Tuesday conference call with analysts. Sales would accelerate from $5.4 million in the fourth quarter, when Exondys 51 had been on the market for about a month.IBD'S TAKE: For the best among biotechs, Incyte has a slew of potential blockbusters, analysts say. Head to The New America for more on the company.Analysts had broadly expected $14.9 million in first-quarter sales of Exondys 51, Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz wrote in a research note, cutting his price target on Sarepta stock to 27 from 32. He still has a market perform rating on shares.""Therefore, it comes as a negative surprise that management expects just $13 million to $15 million in revenue in Q1,"" he wrote in a note. ""This leaves us to wonder whether compliance, discontinuations and/or slower new patient adds are contributing to the shortfall.""Guidance for 2017 Exondys 51 sales was more disappointing. For the year, Sarepta guided to more than $80 million. RBC analyst Simos Simeonidis says the guidance is overly conservative. Exondys 51 has a monopoly on a market with a significant unmet medical need, he wrote.""The debate of whether the drug works or not is irrelevant at this point; the FDA has put the drug on the market,"" he wrote in a report. In the long run, payors will likely reimburse Exondys 51 ""after exhausting their usual tactics of placing obstacles and buying as much time as possible.""Simeonidis cut his price target on Sarepta stock to 91 from 98 to reflect the updated financials, guidance and Sarepta's sale of its rare pediatric disease priority review voucher to Gilead Sciences (GILD) in a $125 million deal.Needham analyst Chad Messer cut his 2017 Exondys 51 sales expectations to $109 million from $183 million. He also lowered his price target on Sarepta stock to 75 from 78, though kept his outperform rating.""We stress that this is simply a change in the slope of the ramp, not a change in peak estimates,"" he wrote in a research report.

214,GILD,"Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) is likely to succeed in a phase three nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) trial after the FDA blessed key changes, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Friday as the company's shares rocketed to a three-month high.On the stock market today, Intercept stock lifted 5.2% to 118.51, after earlier hitting its highest point since November, up 8.8% at 122.66. The stock has been consolidating since September, remaining far from its 173.04 entry point and trading below its 200-day moving average.The Food and Drug Administration allowed Intercept to reduce the number of patients in its phase three trial of Ocaliva in NASH to 750 from 1,400. Enrollment is expected to wrap by mid-2017 and, with a 72-week treatment period, data will likely be ready by year's end 2019.Ocaliva already is approved for primary biliary cholangitis, a rare liver disease. Now, Intercept is among a growing throng of companies aiming at the NASH market. Novartis (NVS), Allergan (AGN) and Genfit are also working on NASH drugs. Gilead Sciences (GILD), though, bowed out in November.IBD'S TAKE: Intercept stock has a low Composite Rating of 16, meaning it underperforms 8 out of 10 stocks in terms of growth metrics like sales and earnings power. Head to IBD's Stock Checkup to see how biotech's biggest leaders stack up. (Hint: The No. 1 company has a CR of 95 out of 99.)Intercept stands a good chance of meeting its endpoint in the phase three trial, Yee wrote. Per the FDA, Ocaliva must only meet one of two co-endpoints: improvement in fibrosis or NASH resolution. Previously, the drug had to meet both endpoints.The FDA also agreed to a standard definition of NASH resolution as an improvement of ballooning to zero or residual/no inflammation. Under the new definition, Ocaliva showed in phase two a statistically significant reduction in fibrosis and hit NASH resolution in 20% of patients.""Because of these changes and the calculation, they are well overpowered to hit on this with fewer patients,"" Yee wrote in his research report. He sees a 65%-75% chance of success for Ocaliva's approval in NASH.Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz, though, noted the ""questionable"" safety profile of Ocaliva, and wondered whether that could be the reasoning behind slow enrollment. Ocaliva resulted in itching in patients with primary biliary cholangitis. Meanwhile, others like Genfit aren't having problems filling trials.Schwartz is much more bearish on Intercept's chances of success in the trial. He has a market perform rating on Intercept stock vs. Yee's outperform rating.""It is discouraging that enrolling the 1,400-patient cohort was unattainable in a timely manner, and we are not convinced that this raises the probability of success in this trial,"" he wrote in a research report.RELATED:Conatus Pharma Doubles On Novartis NASH Licensing DealAllergan Challenges Intercept With Tobira NASH Drug

215,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) stock tumbled to a 22-month low Wednesday after the No. 2 biotech said its hepatitis C unit will see fewer patients and more pricing competition in 2017.In the stock market today, Gilead stock fell 8.6% to 66.83 and hit its lowest price since April 2014. Late Tuesday, Gilead guided to $7.5 billion to $9 billion in 2017 hep C drug sales, about $4 billion short of Wall Street's expectations.Unlike HIV, hep C is a curable disease, said Kevin Young, Gilead's chief operating officer, on the company's earnings conference call with analysts late Tuesday. Gilead sees huge promise on its growing HIV and antiviral franchise, which brought in 47% of sales in Q4.""This (hep C) disease has unique dimensions, the most important of which is that it can be cured,"" he said on the call. ""And thanks to Harvoni, it can be cured in as little as eight weeks in a genotype 1 patient.""Gilead saw 25,000 fewer hep C patients in 2016 vs. 2015 and expects a similar trend this year. Young noted a greater number of patients have a less advanced disease or circumstances that prevent them from immediate treatment such as unstable living situations.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead could bulk its HIV and NASH units to overcome slipping hepatitis C sales, some analysts say. But that view is largely contended by analysts who see those businesses and too late to make much of a difference.In Europe, Gilead's hep C drug sales declined 26% year over year in Q4, trailing a 77% slowdown in Japan where 40% of patients are over the age of 80. Countries like Germany, France and the UK are exhibiting similar characteristics as the U.S. — fewer and healthier patients.Analyst broadly predicted Gilead stock will remain range-bound, and some say the company is unlikely to grow in the near term unless it engages in M&A. On the call, CEO John Milligan acknowledged that besides its HIV pill bictegravir, Gilead doesn't have much launching soon.""We don't think Gilead will do a major M&A deal above $20 billion (Incyte (INCY) makes sense but not likely) so Gilead must do three to four smaller deals and hit next two quarters to regain Street attention,"" RBC analyst Michael Yee wrote Wednesday in a research report.Gilead isn't planning to divest its hep C assets, Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in a note Wednesday. But it's hard to know when Gilead will return to growth, he wrote. Total product sales declined 14% in Q4 and 6.8% in 2016.Gilead's recently launched Epclusa helped offset falling sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a research note.RELATED:AbbVie, Merck Pressure Gilead's 2017 Hep C Unit; GSK Battles HIV BizJ&J HCV Dip To 'Virtually Zero,' Mirroring Gilead; 2017 Views LagGilead Clobbered On Hep C; 'Little Value' In 'Too Late' NASH, HIV Units

216,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) stock crashed late Tuesday after the No. 2 biotech's 2017 guidance for hepatitis C drug sales lagged the consensus by nearly $4 billion, though Q4 and 2016 sales and earnings topped Wall Street views.After releasing 2017 projections, Gilead stock plunged 4% in after-hours trading. Shares rose 1% to 73.13 in Tuesday's regular session. Shares are down 4.3% since early January on analysts' fears following a report from market tracker IMS that Hep C prescriptions fell 6%-7% in Q4.Those fears were realized Tuesday. For Q4, Gilead reported $3.2 billion in Hep C drug sales — Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa — down 35% vs. the year-earlier period. Gilead's Hep C sales fell 23% in 2016 to $14.8 billion, comprising half of total product sales for the year.Guidance for 2017 total sales and Hep C sales also fell short. For 2017, Gilead sees $22.5 billion to $24.5 billion in net product sales, including $7.5 billion to $9 billion in Hep C drug sales. RBC analyst Michael Yee noted consensus views for $28.01 billion in total sales called for $12 billion in the Hep C unit.IBD'S TAKE: Among the giants in biotech, Gilead delivered analysts views for a slow 2017. See why Wall Street's expectations for Gilead were so dim on IBD's Industry Themes.But total Q4 and 2016 metrics smashed projections. For Q4, Gilead reported $7.3 billion in sales and $2.70 earnings per share ex items, topping the consensus for $7.15 billion and $2.61. On a year-over-year basis, sales and EPS dipped 14% and 19%, respectively.For the year, Gilead printed $30.4 billion, down 6.7% but beating expectations for $30.2 billion. EPS ex items came in at $11.57, down 8.2% but above views for $11.41.Analysts have been split on whether HIV drug sales can help offset the expected decline in Gilead's Hep C unit. But that proved to be the case in Q4 and 2016. For Q4, HIV and other antiviral drug sales grew 13% to $3.4 billion. In 2016, sales for that unit rose 16% to $12.9 billion.RELATED:AbbVie, Merck Pressure Gilead's 2017 Hep C Unit; GSK Battles HIV BizJ&J HCV Dips To 'Virtually Zero,' Mirroring Gilead; 2017 Views LagGilead Clobbered On Hep C; 'Little Value' In 'Too Late' NASH, HIV Units

217,GILD,"AbbVie (ABBV) is a stronger stock bet than Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Amgen (AMGN), Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said Thursday after comparing the biopharmas' Q4 earnings, 2017 trajectory and typical R&D turnover.""This analysis suggests that AbbVie offers more attractive fundamentals based on earnings momentum and dividend yield, and is the only company of the three that is likely to show sustained improvements in operating margin and cash flow over the next four years,"" Porges wrote in a research report.Like Gilead, AbbVie's earnings growth is largely based on operating revenue increases. But, Porges notes, those increases are due to volume growth for Humira, Imbruvica and Viekira. Gilead has boosted its operating revenue by increasing prices on franchise hepatitis C drug sales, he said.Both companies derive the lion's share of their sales from a single segment. In 2014 and 2015, Gilead saw sales spike on its hepatitis C drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni. Because HCV is a curable disease, sales plunged in 2016. Humira, AbbVie's anti-inflammatory, has been stronger. In Q4, its sales rose 15.5%.The two are also pitted in a patent battle over AbbVie's claims that an Amgen biosimilar drug infringes on its Humira patents. Though AbbVie is shoring up to defend its IP on Humira, analysts expect biosimilars to come online over the next few years.IBD'S TAKE: Among biotechs, analysts broadly see Incyte as a strong stock option with a number of potential blockbuster drugs in its pipeline. Read on in The New America for better insight into the firm.""AbbVie is certainly facing growth and quality issues beyond 2020, when the outlook for Humira becomes increasingly uncertain, but all three companies face generic, biosimilar and branded threats that challenge their current blockbuster product franchises,"" Porges wrote.Still, earnings momentum looks good for AbbVie in 2017 and 2018. In January, AbbVie guided to $5.44-$5.54 earnings per share ex items in 2017, which would be up 14% at the midpoint. That outlook didn't chip at consensus views for 2018, which are at $6.44.Gilead's forecasts have declined significantly over the past 14 months, Porges wrote. ""It's possible these estimates could decline more given the recent trend,"" he noted. Amgen, on the other hand, appears stable.AbbVie stock closed up 1% at 61.94 on the stock market today, while Gilead and Amgen both rose 0.8%. AbbVie stock is just above its 50-day line but just below its 200-day line. On a year-to-date basis, Amgen stock is outperforming its peers, up 18%, with AbbVie and Gilead stocks down 2% and nearly 4%, respectively.RELATED:Gilead Crashes On Hep C Sales Decline, 2017 Views; Q4, 2016 Metrics TopAbbVie, Merck Pressure Gilead's 2017 Hep C Unit; GSK Battles HIV BizGilead HIV Drug Tops GSK Combo, But Rivalry 'Intense' With GSK Doublet

218,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) will have a tough time divorcing HIV patients from their traditional three-pill regimens, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges predicted Wednesday following the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections.As its hepatitis C franchise busts following a 2014-15 boom, Gilead is looking at HIV medication bictegravir, in combination with FTC/TAF drugs, to become its next ""Mt. Everest."" In Q4, hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni fell 65% and 51%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier period.Bictegravir and Glaxo's dolutegravir went head-to-head in a phase two-B trial by Gilead. Both are used in FTC/TAF combos for 48 weeks. At weeks 24 and 48, 97% of bictegravir patients had a virological response compared with 94% and 91% of dolutegravir patients.Leerink's Porges spoke to specialists following the conference in Seattle.""The lower response rate in the dolutegravir arm didn't necessarily indicate actual treatment failures, but only that a few more patients had HIV-1 RNA greater than 50 copies per milliliter at the snapshot date,"" he wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts predicted the downfall of Gilead's hepatitis C unit. What signs were there? Read on for IBD's Industry Themes.Still, given recent success, Porges says specialists are ""comfortably"" certain Gilead's bictegravir will meet its primary hurdle of non-inferiority to Glaxo's dolutegravir in an ongoing phase three trial. Pricing will be a bigger concern for Gilead, though.Analysts broadly expect Gilead to price its bictegravir combination at $30,000, vs. the expected $17,000 price tag of rival HIV treatments from Glaxo and Merck. Glaxo's two-pill regimen is likely to be used in a small subset of patients, Porges wrote.In another trial, multiple patients dropped out after being required to take four pills.""The most important take-away from our conversation was the deep attachment to the existing three-drug HIV treatment standard,"" Porges said, ""and the limited impact two-drug regimens are expected to have, at least in the current payer environment.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, Gilead fell 0.7% to 68.83 while Glaxo inched down by 2 cents to 41.03. Glaxo stock on Tuesday touched a four-month high of 41.75, while Gilead on Feb. 10 hit a nearly three-year low of 65.43.RELATED:Gilead HIV Drug Tops GSK Combo, But Rivalry 'Intense' With GSK DoubletGilead Crashes On Hep C Sales Decline, 2017 Views; Q4, 2016 Metrics TopCan Gilead Swivel To HIV Amid Floundering Hep C Sales; GSK Rivalry

219,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) will bulk up its HIV and NASH units even as its hepatitis C drug sales crumble, Needham analyst Alan Carr said Friday, as Gilead stock continued its two-week slump.On the stock market today, Gilead fell 0.8% to 71.01. Shares have toppled 7% since Jan. 4, trading in the red nine out of the 11 past trading days.Analyst chatter has focused on Gilead's hepatitis C unit. Hepatitis C drug sales dipped 6%-7% in Q4 vs. Q3, according to market tracker IMS. Needham's Carr is the third analyst in as many days to point out Gilead's declining HCV sales. Analysts broadly expect Gilead's 2017 guidance to disappoint.""Although Gilead retains more than 85% of current HCV market share, we expect HCV revenues to continue to diminish as fewer patients are initiating therapy and more competition enters the market,"" Carr wrote in a research report Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead might be hamstrung on Hep C sales, but analysts are bullish on Amgen and Biogen. Why? Go deeper with IBD's Industry Themes.More treatment-naive Hep C patients are opting for eight-week therapy vs. higher proportions in the past who received 12-week or 24-week courses, Carr said. But he kept his hold rating on Gilead stock, noting the company also has its hands in NASH and HIV therapies.Carr expects Gilead to dominate the HIV space with bictegravir, an integrase inhibitor, in combination with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and emtricitabine (FTC). Phase 3 results are expected in Q2 with its New Drug and Marketing Authorization applications expected in Q3.""We expect the company to continue to dominate the HIV space, particularly with the introduction of TAF/FTC/BIC,"" Carr wrote. ""We believe that TAF/FTC/BIC will consolidate many HIV regimens and will become the forefront of HIV therapy.""Gilead also has its hands in the NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) sphere with three distinct drugs in Phase 2 monotherapy trials. Selonsertib is expected to begin a Phase 3 trial early this year with combination trials likely to begin before year's end.RELATED:Merck, Biogen, Lilly Top 2016 Drug Approvals Despite FDA Slump

220,GILD,"AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK) are pressuring Gilead Sciences' (GILD) already-burdened Hepatitis C unit, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Monday, a day ahead of Gilead's much-anticipated Q4 earnings report and 2017 guidance.Broadly, analysts anticipate Gilead to guide 2017 sales down 7% to $28.01 billion which assumes $12 billion in Hep C sales. A guide of $27 billion or lower indicates a $1 billion dip in Hep C sales and $1 sloughed off earnings per share minus items, Yee said.Investors ""will likely have little confidence in higher revenues, so it could be seen as risky guidance,"" Yee wrote in a research report. ""So either way, we think Gilead needs to guide around $28 billion and hit some quarters, and HCV needs to stabilize.""Gilead stock was hammered in January. That followed a report from market tracker IMS that Hep C prescriptions fell 6%-7% sequentially in Q4.This month, shares have recovered minimally and are now flat for the year. In the stock market today, Gilead stock edged up 5 cents to 72.39. The No. 2 biotech by market cap, behind Amgen (AMGN), is slated to report its Q4 earnings after the close Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Of the big biotech leaders, analysts have been most bearish on Gilead amid reports of slowing Hepatitis C drug sales. Dive in on the issue in IBD's Industry Themes.For Q4, analysts expect Gilead to post $7.15 billion in sales and $2.61 EPS minus items, down 16% and 21% vs. the year-earlier period. Analysts expect $30.2 billion in sales and $11.41 EPS minus items for the year, down 7.4% and 9.5%, respectively.But 2017 guidance is key, especially considering the struggles of its Hep C unit, Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in a research note Monday. Hep C drug sales — Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa — comprised 45% of Gilead's total product sales in Q3.In the past, Gilead has commented on new patients being healthier, Schoenebaum said. Gilead is also likely to experience competitive pressure in 2017 from Merck's Zepatier, a Hep C pill, and approval of AbbVie's eight-week regimen.Yee expects investors to key in on HIV drug sales. Gilead is likely to have phase 2 data on HIV drug bictegravir during the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) Feb. 13-16 in Seattle.There, Gilead faces competitive from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). GSK's dolutegravir, under the brand name Tivicay, is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration.""Gilead has said they will put 'everything' behind this launch and the 'might' of Gilead behind it,"" Yee wrote. ""And it will be the 'Mt. Everest' for years to come for them.""Yee has an outperform rating and 90 price target on Gilead stock.RELATED:J&J HCV Dips To 'Virtually Zero,' Mirroring Gilead; 2017 Views LagGilead Clobbered On Hep C; 'Little Value' In 'Too Late' NASH, HIV UnitsGilead Will Bulk HIV, NASH Units Amid Hep C Slump; Stock On 2-Week Dip

222,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) and AbbVie (ABBV) will benefit from Merck's (MRK) decision to take a $2.9 billion impairment charge on a hepatitis C drug as the market and prices shrink, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said Friday.Merck also cut its value estimate for uprifosbuvir, a hepatitis C drug acquired from Idenix Pharmaceuticals in 2014, to $240 million, based on its upcoming three-drug regimen and a change in its view on the whole hepatitis C market.Regulators say Merck must complete separate trials showing an added benefit with its triplet over its high-dose doublet regimen, Porges said. That complicates matters. The high-dose doublet is in phase 2 testing, behind the triplet.""This write-down also suggests that the remaining value of the 'rest of Idenix' is now very small,"" Porges wrote in a research report. Merck is also seemingly indicating ""significantly reduced value for its future participation in the market, which is consistent with a declining market overall.""IBD'S TAKE: Analysts projected the downfall in hepatitis C drug sales. What were the warning signs and are other markets at risk? Read on in IBD's Industry Themes.Gilead, AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) compete in the hepatitis C market. Merck's charge signals the drugmaker expects to have lighter sales and a smaller share than initially forecast.Drugmakers are struggling with 2014-15 growing pains following a boom and subsequent bust in hepatitis C drug sales. Gilead is the poster child for the phenomenon. Sales of Sovaldi and Harvoni toppled in 2016. Now, Gilead is betting on its HIV drug, bictegravir.Merck, too, noted the changing patient population dynamics.""The company determined that recent changes to the product profile, as well as changes to its expectations for pricing and the market opportunity, taken together constituted a triggering event that required the company to evaluate the uprifosbuvir intangible asset for impairment,"" Merck wrote in its 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday.In morning trading on the stock market today, Merck stock was up a fraction to 66.16 at the closing bell.

224,GILD,"Gilead Sciences' (GILD) newest HIV regimen topped a rival combo from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), in trial results released late Monday, but a doublet from GSK will keep ""intense competitive pressure"" on Gilead's HIV unit, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says.Porges' view followed Gilead's presentation during the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections late Monday in Seattle. In a head-to-head comparison, Gilead's HIV drug, bictegravir, had a narrowly better response than GlaxoSmithKline's.The phase 2 trial examined combinations of bictegravir and FTC/TAF (emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide), and Glaxo's dolutegravir plus FTC/TAF. FTC/TAF is Gilead's ""backbone"" combo in treatment-naive HIV patients, explained RBC analyst Michael Yee.On efficacy, 97% of patients in the bictegravir arm achieved the endpoint of HIV-1 RNA levels below 50 copies per milliliter at week 24. That compares with 94% of patients in the dolutegravir arm. The delta widened at week 48 with 97% and 91%, respectively, hitting the endpoint.Safety appears to be good, Yee wrote in a research report. One patient dropped out after week 24 due to urticaria (hives). Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum noted that the bictegravir combo appears to have a better safety profile.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead's hepatitis C unit has suffered as cure rates soar. Now, the No. 3 biotech is looking to pivot to potentially strong HIV drug sales. Could Gilead's hep C decline have been predicted? As it turns out, yes. Head to IBD'S Industry Themes for the clues that signaled the hep C crumble.Gilead has since moved the combination into four phase-three trials. Though Gilead's phase two results weren't strong enough to establish statistical superiority of bictegravir over dolutegravir, they were enough to explain Gilead's ""rush into expanded trials,"" Porges wrote in a research note.But ""investors are likely to remain cautious about the threat posed by Glaxo's dolutegravir-rilpivirine doublet program, which showed almost equally impressive results in two large phase 3 switching trials,"" he said.Also late Monday, Glaxo announced the results of phase three of its switching trial looking at a combination of dolutegravir and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) rilpivirine, which is marketed under the name Edurant.The combo achieved non-inferior viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per milliliter) by 48 weeks. Unlike Gilead's trial, GSK looked at patients who had already received treatment. The median prior treatment period for patients was four years.Glaxo's doublet of dolutegravir and rilpivirine is expected to be on the market by 2018, analysts for RBC and Leerink said. RBC's Yee notes that GSK could put pressure on Gilead by pricing its doublet at $17,000-$20,000 vs. other regimens at $30,000.But Glaxo's success will ultimately require persuading patients to switch from their three- or four-drug HIV regimens, Leerink's Porges said. GSK will most likely have to appeal to patients who have had adverse reactions or long-standing exposure to first-generation drugs.Most patients are likely to be switching from Gilead combinations anyway, meaning Gilead will likely recapture most of its share, Porges said.""We also consider the two drug approach to be an inherently more restricted proposition, given higher risks of resistance, and for that reason anticipate a relatively small share of the market being candidates for the doublet,"" he wrote.But in the stock market today, Gilead stock slipped a fraction to 67.55, while GlaxoSmithKline edged up 0.3% to 40.11. On Friday, Gilead stock touched its lowest price since April 2014, at 65.43.RELATED:Gilead Crashes On Hep C Sales Decline, 2017 Views; Q4, 2016 Metrics TopCan Gilead Swivel To HIV Amid Floundering Hep C Sales, GSK Rivalry?Gilead Stock Dives To 22-Month Low As Hep C Cure Drains Total Sales

Gilead reported not-as-bad-as-expected fourth-quarter revenue and earnings, but management's full-year revenue guidance was far below the consensus expectation. Gilead shares have been in steady decline since June 2015, as profits for its controversial hepatitis C drugs started to taper off.Akamai stumbled 11% following strong fourth-quarter results and Q1 guidance that appeared to be in line with expectations.

On the stock market today, Johnson & Johnson stock fell 1.9% to 111.76, sinking further below its 50-day moving average support line, where J&J had hovered for six weeks.For Q4, Johnson & Johnson reported $18.1 billion in sales and $1.58 earnings per share ex items, up 1.7% and 9.7%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Though EPS beat the consensus by 2 cents, sales missed analyst estimates of $18.26 billion.IBD'S TAKE: As drugmakers like Johnson & Johnson struggle in Q4, biotechs like Incyte are poised to jump. Incyte is digging into markets with potential blockbusters. Read on at The New America for more on those markets and ""Incyte"" into their opportunity.Johnson wrapped up 2016 with $71.9 billion in sales and $6.73 EPS minus items, up 2.6% and 8.5%, respectively.But 2017 guidance, in particular, disappointed. For 2017, Johnson sees $74.1 billion to $74.8 billion in sales. That would be up 3.5% vs. 2016, but lagged the consensus of 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $75.1 billion. EPS minus items guidance for $6.93-$7.08 missed the model for $7.11.As expected, Johnson's hepatitis C drug sales dipped to ""virtually zero,"" Porges wrote Tuesday in a research report.

229,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN) and AbbVie (ABBV) underperformed in Q4, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges predicted Monday — the fourth analyst in a week to hammer Gilead for declining hepatitis C drug sales.In the stock market today, Gilead stock slipped 0.45% to 70.69. Shares have fallen in 10 of the past 12 trading days amid Wall Street chatter over hep C sales. Market tracker IMS says hep C drug prescriptions declined 6% to 7% in Q4 from Q3.Hepatitis C drugs Harvoni and Sovaldi brought in 36% of total product sales in Q3, declining from 58% of total product sales in Q3 2015. Those drug sales toppled 44% year over year, though Gilead launched Epclusa, a third hep C drug, last summer.Gilead is facing competitive pressure in its hep C unit, as treatment times are shortening, Porges says. He sees Gilead's hep C sales declining 17% in 2017 and then by 24% to 44% per year through 2020.""This decline is being driven by patient presentation dynamics, price, duration and share trends for Gilead and is likely to accelerate in 2017 and beyond as better competitive HCV regimens come to market,"" he wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Though Gilead is expected to struggle with declining hep C drug sales, cancer biotech Incyte is poised to outperform the broader industry. Dig into The New America for more on Incyte.Needham analyst Alan Carr last week said Gilead could bulk up again on its HIV and NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) units. Porges, though, isn't as bullish. Those opportunities are arriving ""too late, with too little value,"" he said.""Our outlook for the company's HIV business remains positive, but this is not sufficient to offset the unusual dynamics of the HCV business, and the relatively modest contributions from other products offer little to mitigate the effect of the boom and bust in HCV,"" he said.Porges expects Gilead's major units to narrowly miss consensus expectations. IMS data suggest better-than-expected Harvoni sales but worse-than-expected Epclusa sales. IMS data also predict that major products from AbbVie and Amgen will miss the consensus by 1.1% and 1.2%, respectively, he wrote.Porges kept his market perform ratings on shares of Gilead, Amgen and AbbVie.He boosted his price target on Gilead stock to 91 from 89, and on Amgen to 164 from 163. He maintained his 69 price target on AbbVie.Amgen, which has formed a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 161.10, fell 1.3% to 152.72 Monday.

230,GILD,"The biotech industry has a mixed outlook for 2017 with few new drugs coming to market this year, but midcap Incyte (INCY) is one of the few companies with potential blockbusters in its pipeline.Incyte closed out 2016 and started 2017 with some major developments. The first came late last year when the company discovered that its Jakafi drug won't be facing competition from Gilead (GILD) in 2018 as previously expected. Jakafi is used to treat two maladies: myelofibrosis, a bone marrow disorder, and polycythemia vera, a type of blood cancer.Gilead's rival drug to Jakafi, now known as momelotinib, failed a Phase 3 study for previously untreated myelofibrosis patients in November. That left Incyte's primary revenue driver free of competition for the foreseeable future, according to Ian Somaiya, a biotech analyst at BMO Capital Markets.""It's rare to see a drug that can generate $2.5 billion to $3 billion (in sales) and face no competition,"" he said of Jakafi's peak sales potential. In its most recent earnings report, Incyte officials said Jakafi accounted for $224 million in net product revenue in the third quarter, up 39% from the year before. The company raised its full-year net sales outlook on the drug to $850 million-$855 million from an earlier outlook of $825 million-$835 million.Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note to clients Tuesday that they see the drug's revenue growing 13% a year.Then earlier this month, Incyte announced its immuno-oncology drug, epacadostat, along with Merck's (MRK) Keytruda, will be used in four Phase 3 studies this year. They include treatment of non-small lung cancer as well as renal, bladder and head and neck cancers.""The opportunities in solid tumors could be a (earnings) multiplier"" for epacadostat, Somaiya said.If the drug passes the trials and receives Food and Drug Administration approval, analysts expect $1.6 billion in peak sales, according to a recent Goldman Sachs note.Morgan Stanley analysts said in their note that they expect key data from the studies that prompted the companies to start a Phase 3 trial will be disclosed at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago in June.""Epacadostat has the potential at least to be one of the biggest pipeline drugs,"" said Eric Schmidt, biotechnology analyst at Cowen. ""It could be active against so many tumor types.""Finally, on Jan. 13 the FDA extended its review period of baricitinib, and investigational rheumatoid arthritis drug jointly developed by Incyte and Eli Lilly (LLY). But Morgan Stanley took that as a bullish sign that the FDA didn't ask for any new studies and sees ""imminent approval.""Still, analysts lowered its U.S. sales estimates for the drug to $98 million from $197 million for the 2017 on the delay. Yet they see peak sales of $1.8 billion in 2026.Management has played a key role in Incyte's success in recent years. Incyte Chief Executive Herve Hoppenot, who took the helm in 2014, was previously the president of oncology at Novartis (NVS). Many scientists on the oncology side followed Hoppenot to Incyte.""What always made Incyte unique is the expertise in biology,"" Somaiya said. ""With the management changes, you have that expertise to develop those drugs, conduct larger trials, bring those drugs to the market and independently market them.""But analysts question how much longer the company will remain independent. Incyte is the largest midsize company in the oncology space and a potential buyout target.The endgame for most biotechs is to be bought by a larger pharmaceutical firm that has a ""less fruitful pipeline"" according to Michael Schmidt, senior biotech analyst at Leerink Partners. He is no relation to Cowen's Eric Schmidt.IBD'S TAKE: Incyte is ranked second in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech Group and has a 94 composite rating. Shares jumped into buy range out of a flat base with a 110.05 buy point on Jan. 9, after the company announced its drug trails for epacadostat.""Oncology pipelines are very interesting from an M&A standpoint. There's scarcity of companies that have a good pipeline,"" Michael Schmidt said. But he wouldn't speculate on what companies could be interested in Incyte.In a September poll by the Evercore ISI investment bank, analysts voted Gilead as the most likely to buy out Incyte in the next 12 months.Despite President Donald Trump calling out the drug industry over ""disastrous"" drug prices, merger activity could heat up this year. Under a Trump administration, there could be changes in the tax code, as well as a possible boost in foreign cash and increased stock valuations, according to a Reuters report.While Incyte is poised for a successful 2017, the biotech world isn't without risks.""Beyond the traditional drug development risks, there is always regulatory risks,"" Michael Schmidt said. ""And oncology is obviously a competitive space, particularly immuno-oncology.""But Cowen's Eric Schmidt said he's not worried about competition in the oncology sector.""There is too much unmet need, too many patients are dying,"" he said, adding that valuation is the prime risk.""The biggest risk is that there is a fair bit of good news priced into Incyte,"" he said. ""So if something goes wrong valuation could come in and correct a lot.""Shares of Incyte seemed ready to hit a third straight day of gains, but met resistance after crossing the 120 mark on Friday. Shares ended Monday's session up marginally to 117.42.RELATED: FDA Track Record Bodes Well For Merck Keytruda Plus Chemo: LeerinkAmgen Plans Robust 2017 In Alzheimer's, Migraines, Oncology: CEO Exclusive

232,GILD,"Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham on Thursday said he expected Gilead Sciences' (GILD) 2017 outlook to be hindered on limited hepatitis C sales. He also sees Merck (MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) issuing sluggish views, though he is more bullish on Biogen (BIIB) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).RBC Capital on Wednesday said much the same about Gilead, and also was more bullish on Biogen as well as on Amgen (AMGN).Hepatitis C drug prescriptions dipped 6%-7% quarter over quarter in Q4, according to market tracker IMS. Gilead makes Sovaldi and Harvoni to combat hepatitis C.Merck and Alexion, meanwhile, will guide to declining metrics on heavier spending and new management, respectively, Meacham predicted. ""Though we'd argue this is widely anticipated,"" Meacham said in a research report.He sees Biogen offering upside guidance on its Spinraza launch with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), and Johnson leveraging cost controls to offer a better 2017 view.IBD'S TAKE: As hepatitis C sales fall, where will Gilead go? Check out IBD's Industry Themes for the full scoop on how biotech's five biggest are expected to do in Q4.Ahead of the Q4 pharma earnings season, which starts next week with reports from companies such as J&J, Stryker (SYK) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Meacham boosted his price target on Incyte (INCY) stock, noting that company's phase three tumor efforts with Merck. The duo are testing immunotherapy Keytruda and epacadostat in four tumors.Meacham expects Incyte, in its Q4 earnings conference call, to give some color on Jakafi trials in graft vs. host disease, as well as its tumor efforts with Merck. He bumped his price target on Incyte stock to 135 from 105. Incycte hasn't yet set a date for its Q4 earnings report.Incyte stock, which last week touched a 14-month high just shy of 119, rallied 2% to close at 117.53 in the stock market today.For Q4, the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Incyte to report $324.8 million in sales and 14 cents earnings per share, up a third and down 52%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.Merck's spending is likely ramping on Keytruda which was granted priority review last week in combination with Eli Lilly's (LLY) chemotherapy Alimta to treat non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with a high expression of the PDL1 gene.Keytruda-plus-Alimta is in phase three testing. If data are strong, Merck could open itself up to a larger patient population vs. the 25%-30% of patients with a 50%-plus PDL1 expression. Keytruda is already approved as a monotherapy in high-expressing PDL1 patients with NSCLC.RELATED:Merck, Biogen, Lilly Top 2016 Approvals Despite FDA SlumpTrump's 'Disastrous' Pharma View Doesn't Rattle JPMorgan Drug ConferenceWill Trump Break With Republicans And Push Major Drug Reform?

233,GILD,"No. 2 biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) will likely guide to declining 2017 sales, hamstrung on limited Hepatitis C visibility, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Wednesday, noting expectations are better for Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB), as the Q4 earnings season gets underway.For 2017, Yee expects Gilead to guide to $27 billion to $29 billion in product sales, bracketing consensus views for $28 billion. That would be down 8% at the midpoint of guidance vs. early 2016 guidance for $30 billion to $31 billion.""We appreciate that visibility is tough on Hep C right now, but buy-side consensus is also fairly low on Gilead given known uncertainties,"" Yee wrote in a research report. He predicts a decline of more than $1 billion in 2017 Hep C sales.Gilead makes Sovaldi and Harvoni to combat Hep C. In the U.S., though, prescriptions of Hep C drugs fell 6%-7% quarter over quarter in Q4, according to market tracker IMS. Europe remains a ""wild card,"" but the Q3 volume of patients fell markedly from Q2, Yee wrote.""This is an ongoing concern given the bolus continues to wear down in EU as the launches have occurred in major regions over the past year or so,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""Merck is now launching in a number of regions with possible lower pricing.""IBD'S TAKE: A small biotech and four IPOs outlasted giants like Amgen and Biogen to top 2016 stock gains among companies that started the year above 10 and traded an average daily volume of 10,000 shares. Was your pick among them? Check out IBD's Industry Themes.For Q4, Yee expects Gilead to report $7.2 billion in sales, a tick above broader consensus views for $7.1 billion. The consensus of 28 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Gilead to report $2.62 earnings per share ex items. Yee sees $2.59.Gilead is set to report its Q4 earnings and issue 2017 guidance after hours Feb. 7. Among big biotechs, Amgen and Biogen are ""set up well into (earnings per share) and guidance where there is current investor uncertainty and nervousness,"" Yee says.Amgen, which is scheduled to report late Feb. 2, is widely modeled at $5.8 billion in sales and $2.79 EPS minus items. Then, Amgen could report data from its (cardiovascular outcomes trial) CVOT in PCSK9 inhibitor Repatha, Yee wrote.""Whenever the CVOT data is out we see a 20%-25% CVOT benefit with higher-end stock trading up 3-5%,"" he wrote. The ""Street will want to own names that can hit earnings and give good guidance, and CVOT data is 'de-risking.'""For Biogen, 25 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters view $2.94 billion in sales and $4.98 EPS minus items. Yee sees $2.9 billion and $4.68. Biogen is set to report early Jan. 26.Biogen's story is clearer after it settled a patent dispute over Tecfidera with Forward Pharma (FWP). The company will also likely discuss its spinoff of its hemophilia unit into Bioverativ. The spinoff should cut sales and EPS minus items by $900 million and 50 cents to $1.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Celgene (CELG) are slated to report their Q4 earnings late Jan. 25 and early Jan. 26, respectively. Both preannounced financial results during the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.Cystic fibrosis drug sales grew to $1.68 billion in 2016, Vertex said. For Q4, CF drugs Orkambi and Kalydeco pulled in $453 million.Celgene preannounced net sales of $11.19 billion, up 22%, for 2016. The company also guided to $13 billion to $13.4 billion in 2017 sales, up 18% at the midpoint of the outlook.

234,GILD,"Roche (RHHBY) CEO Severin Schwan shrugged off President Trump's crackdown on drug prices Wednesday, saying the Swiss drugmaker expects to reap the benefits of ""literally billions"" invested in the market.""We focus on truly differentiated medicines — medicines which make a real difference for patients,"" he said, according to CNBC. ""I have no doubt whatsoever that there will be continued demand for such solutions, and particularly the U.S., I'm convinced, will reward this kind of innovation.""The U.S. market is important to Roche. In 2016, nearly half of Roche's pharmaceutical sales — 47% — stemmed from the U.S., and 26% of its diagnostics tools were sold in North America. But on Tuesday, Trump reaffirmed his pledge to go after rising drug prices.""We have to get lower prices,"" he told a slew of pharma bigwigs, including the CEOs of Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Novartis (NVS). A Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) executive also was reportedly in attendance. There, President Trump promised to deregulate the drug industry and cut taxes.Trump also abandoned his proposal to revisit the idea of allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid, which cover millions of Americans and are among the largest purchasers of drugs and health care services in the world.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's commentary momentarily boosted drug stocks on Tuesday, but a day earlier the president's ban on immigration took a bite out of airline stocks. Read IBD's Industry Themes column for more on a safer entry point in the travel sector.Drug stocks rose 1.5% on Tuesday following reports of Trump's softened stance on Big Pharma. IBD's 43-company Ethical Drugs industry group edged up a small fraction on the stock market today. Roche stock rose 0.47% to 30.10, touching a nearly three-month high.Schwan's commentary came as Roche reported 5% growth in 2016 sales to $50.98 billion. The consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected $51.57 billion. Core earnings per share rose 8%.Revenue from breast cancer and rheumatoid arthritis drugs helped outplay a dip in sales of drugs to treat hepatitis B and C, pancreatic and non-small-cell lung cancer, and wet age-related macular degeneration, an eye disease.The hep C sector has suffered recently, with sales dipping 6%-7% from the third to fourth quarters, according to market researcher IHS. Shares of Gilead Sciences (GILD) and J&J have been under pressure recently on their hep C units. J&J's hep C sales dipped to ""virtually nothing"" in the fourth quarter.Swiss Roche saw a similarly painful decline. Sales of hep C drug Lucentis, which is only sold in the U.S., fell 10% in 2016 to $1.42 million. Offsetting that, sales of breast cancer drug Perjeta and rheumatoid arthritis drug Actemra rose 26% and 16%, respectively.Roche also listed seven new launches, including oncology drug Tecentriq. Tecentriq is approved for previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer and previously treated advanced cancer of the urinary tract.

235,GILD,"After rising for three consecutive years, the FDA's drug approval rate in 2016 plunged to a nine-year low despite Biogen (BIIB), Merck (MRK) and Eli Lilly (LLY) each adding two new drugs to their bailiwicks, according to Swiss biotech HBM Partners.The Food and Drug Administration approved 19 new molecular entities in 2016, down 51% from 45 in 2015 — a year that marked a decade-high for approvals NMEs, says HBM. There had not been fewer NMEs approved since 2007, when the FDA gave its blessing to just 17.About half those NMEs in 2016 (nine), were not fully developed in house. Five were acquired via M&A and four were in-licensed, HBM wrote.Of the 19 new drugs, nine (47%) were for ""first-in-class"" drugs. By therapeutic area, cancer led among NMEs. Four new drugs in 2016 — projected at an industry-leading $7.5 billion in peak sales — were in oncology, HBM found.IBD'S TAKE: Easing the FDA approval process could be part of Donald Trump's health care initiatives, but will the president-elect really break with Republicans to enact major drug reform?That's a trend. Over the past five years, oncology drugs saw a major increase on the FDA approval list. From 2012-16, 50 new cancer drugs were approved, rising from 24 NMEs in cancer from 2007-11.From 2012-16, the FDA had an increased appetite for drugs to treat diabetes, respiratory diseases, viral and other infections. Its interest in cardiovascular, genetic and immunology drugs increased moderately. But those years also saw fewer central nervous system drugs.Since then, Merck and Roche (RHHBY) have had more drugs approved than any other companies. Each added eight.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer (PFE) follow closely with seven apiece.Gilead Sciences (GILD), Novartis (NVS), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Sanofi (SNY) and Lilly have each added six new drugs.IBD's 420-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group closed down 1% on the stock market today.

236,GILD,"In his first news conference since his surprise win, President-elect Trump on Wednesday indicated the issue of escalating drug prices would be a priority, using harsh words to describe the situation.""Our drug industry has been disastrous,"" said Trump. Drugmakers must be subject to ""new bidding procedures because they're getting away with murder,"" he said, hitting on an issue that already had been getting increased attention from federal and state lawmakers.Mylan (MYL) CEO Heather Bresch was skewered in a House committee in September, but plenty of others have been heavily criticized, including Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA).Mylan and Teva, which acquired generic drugmaker Actavis last year from Allergan (AGN), were the two publicly traded companies among six companies that in December were sued by the attorneys general of 20 states on price-fixing charges in the field of generic drugs.

See IBD's Stocks on the Move to learn the latest big movers, both up and down, with a number of drugmakers currently on the moving-down list.In an interview with Time, when named that magazine's Man of the Year, Trump pledged to bring down high drug prices, but Wednesday marked his first substantive comments on the subject.""Pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there's very little bidding on drugs,"" he said at the news conference. ""We're the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don't bid properly, and we're going to start bidding, and we're going to save billions of dollars over a period of time.""Actavis had boosted the price of its hydrocortisone tablets by 9,500% over a number of years, while Mylan's EpiPen to treat allergic reactions saw a 700% price increase in six years ended last year.

239,GILD,"Hematologists and oncologists like Incyte's (INCY) opportunity in polycythemia vera (PV) and see the biotech's growing Jakafi sales landing it a potential takeover deal, RBC analyst Simos Simeonidis said Sunday.But on the stock market today, Incyte stock fell 2.2% to 100.79. Shares are down about 7% for the year, though have traded above their 50-day moving average since early November. Incyte stock is creating a flat base with a 110.05 entry point.Simeonidis kept his outperform rating on Inctye stock after a call with three key opinion leaders in the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) market. All three were positive on the use of Jakafi in PV, which is a blood cancer, and expect its use to increase.IBD'S TAKE: PV isn't the only strong contender on the market for 2017. Regeneron could make a sweet buck on eczema drug sales, RBC says. How sweet? Check out IBD's Industry Themes for the full scoop.Jakafi belongs to a class of drugs called JAK (Janus kinase) inhibitors. Inhibiting the action of this family of enzymes has shown to help treat certain cancers and inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Gilead Sciences (GILD) and CTI BioPharma also are working on JAK inhibitors.Incyte is teamed up with Novartis (NVS) on Jakafi, which Novartis commercializes and sells outside the U.S. as Jakavi.Wall Street generally sees Incyte in the lead on JAK inhibitors, but Jakafi competes against chemotherapies like Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) hydroxyurea and Roche's (RHHBY) interferon, Pegasys, in the PV market, Simeonidis wrote in a research report. Jakafi is typically a second-line drug.About 25%-33% of PV patients are intolerant to or resistant to hydroxyurea, providing another upside to Jakafi sales, the doctors said. All three expect use of Jakafi in PV to increase in the coming year and going forward. One noted the median Jakafi benefit in PV is longer than in myelofibrosis.But European and American physicians differ when it comes to prescribing a JAK inhibitor in place of more traditional chemo or interferon, one physician said.""EU docs are more likely to treat patients based on European Leukemia Net (ELN) criteria while in the U.S. physicians are more likely to treat 'based on their gut,' i.e., has the patient been on hydroxyurea 'long enough' or experiencing side effects,"" one doctor told Simeonidis.RELATED:Gilead Could Scoop Up Incyte After Cancer Drug Proves 'Not Good Enough'Incyte Recoups Losses After Price-Fixing Fracas On Strong Chemo Results

243,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) stock lingered in the red Tuesday after the No. 2 biotech by market cap unveiled strong phase-two results for its oral NASH drug amid analyst chatter that the study wasn't controlled and phase-three data remain years off.Shares dipped 0.5% to finish at 76.35 on the stock market today, after rising a fraction Monday. Shares rocketed 6% Wednesday on Donald Trump's election, but have since waffled.Late Monday, Gilead presented the results of a six-month, phase-two study of GS-4997 to combat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The drug works by targeting a type of protein associated with cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.The drug showed a 35% to 50% improvement in fibrosis across two groups of patients. For patients on an 18-milligram dose, 43% saw an improvement in fibrosis vs. 20% in the population taking simtuzumab alone.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's win of the White House could be a boon for pressured drugmakers and biotechs, analysts say. Get the full scoop at IBD's Industry Themes.Simtuzumab is an antibody designed to treat fibrosis by binding to an enzyme and acting like an immunomodulator. It acted as somewhat of a control for the phase-two trial on GS-4997, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said.""We continue to think the phase-two data is interesting particularly because of its rapid effect on fibrosis at just 24 weeks (fibrosis typically takes much longer to improve on),"" she wrote in a research report.But RBC analyst Michael Yee notes some caveats to Gilead's data. He said the study was short and that phase-three data — starting in 2017 — will still take two to three years. Plus, the mechanism of GS-4997 was somewhat cloudy, he said.Secondary endpoints showed no improvement on NASH resolution or a less than two-point improvement in NAFLD Activity Score (NAS), he wrote. This is ""puzzling if the drug works by inflammation mechanism and strong fibrosis result but no benefit on NASH resolution.""Still, both analysts kept outperform ratings on Gilead stock. Young has a 90 price target on the stock.RELATED:Drug Stocks Rally On Relief Clinton Didn't Win White HouseCan This Small-Cap Biotech Take On Gilead, Celgene, Biogen In Alzheimer's?

244,GILD,"Drug giant Eli Lilly (LLY) is poised for a jolly December, if data and rulings come in positive.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan says all eyes are on new data for Eli Lilly's Solanezumab, an Alzheimer's disease drug that he predicts has a 60% probability of success. Legal decisions and regulatory rulings surrounding Lilly's Jardiance, Alimta and Trulicity also are expected next month.Eli Lilly stock could use a year-end bounce. Shares are down about 10% this year, falling 0.82% to 76.01 on the stock market today. IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group fell more than 1% Tuesday.Phase 3 data from Lilly's Sola is due ""any day now and definitely by year-end,"" Divan wrote in a research report Tuesday. Sola could act as a neuroprotector for patients with Alzheimer's. Its success could boost rival Biogen (BIIB), which has a similar drug in development.Divan predicts Lilly stock could soar more than 20% if Sola shows significant functional benefit, 10% if it shows a trend on function and 5% even if it shows no functional benefit. He predicts a 10%-15% drop if Sola misses on cognition.IBD'S TAKE: December could be jolly for more than just Eli Lilly. Drug stocks have rallied since the election of Donald Trump, who is seen as more business friendly than Hillary Clinton. But what happens if Trump makes good on his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act? The outlook isn't as certain. Grab IBD's Industry Themes for a deeper dive.In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is due to make a decision in December on whether to expand the label on Jardiance, a type 2 diabetes med. The risk is ""skewed to the downside"" as most observers are expecting FDA approval, Divan said.Also, patent litigation is ongoing for Lilly's Alimta, a chemotherapy for cancer in or near the lungs. But most expect the patent to expire in 2021-22, regardless, Divan noted.Also, in coming weeks Lilly is due to release an interim analysis of a study on type 2 diabetes drug Trulicity.But the news flow won't end there. Initial 2017 guidance is expected Jan. 4 and the FDA could approve baricitinib, a rheumatoid arthritis drug in conjunction with Incyte (INCY), by mid-January, he wrote.Baricitinib belongs to a class of drugs called JAK inhibitors. Gilead Sciences (GILD) is working on a JAK inhibitor, as is AbbVie (ABBV). Pfizer (PFE)has one approved and is currently in trials to expand its use. Incyte also has a JAK inhibitor on the market.

"
245,GILD,"Gilead Sciences' (GILD) latest cancer drug is ""not good enough,"" RBC analyst Michael Yee said Thursday, suggesting the No. 2 biotech would be better off buying midcap rival Incyte (INCY) for its stronger myelofibrosis drug.Late Wednesday, Gilead unveiled mixed results for two phase 3 trials of momelotinib, a JAK inhibitor. Janus kinase (JAK) is a family of enzymes. Drugmakers believe blocking these enzymes could treat certain cancers and inflammatory diseases.Among JAK inhibitors, Incyte leads the pack as Gilead, the No. 2 biotech by market cap, looks to unseat the incumbent. In a head-to-head phase 3 trial, Gilead's momelotinib wasn't inferior to Jakafi by week 24 in terms of splenic response. But it missed in terms of total symptom score.In a second phase 3 trial, momelotinib was pitted against the best available therapy in patients previously treated with Jakafi. Momelotinib didn't prove to be superior to other therapies, but did meet on the total symptom score endpoint.Gilead stock slipped 0.55% to 75.58 on the stock market today, while Incyte stock rose 4.8%, to 105.55, on Gilead's mixed results. IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group rose nearly 1%.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs look poised for a takeoff on Donald Trump's election, but what would an appeal of the Affordable Care Act do to the industry? Check out IBD's Industry Themes for some ideas.RBC's Yee suggests Gilead could push to acquire Incyte and its stronger JAK inhibitor. Gilead looks unlikely to file for momelotinib in Q1, as previously planned, Evercore analyst John Scotti wrote in a research report. Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young doesn't see momelotinib as a competitor to Jakafi.""Even if momelotinib makes it to market, we don't expect this drug to be meaningful competitor to Jakafi,"" she wrote in a report. ""We are uncertain if there is a regulatory pathway due to the mixed results and a drug on market that has a robust set of data already.""Gilead wrapped Q3 with $31.6 billion in cash, equivalents and market securities on its balance sheet. It also has a history of acquiring innovation including Nimbus Apollo for its nonalcoholic steatohepatitis assets and Galapagos NV for anti-inflammatory drug.The firm is typically a patient acquirer, Credit Suisse's Young says. And investors know it.""For investors, we think that these challenges heighten the focus on external M&A,"" she wrote. ""However, we know Gilead and they will be disciplined and patient acquirers of assets so we don't know if these challenges really change their sense of urgency.""Yee expects Gilead to make a play for Incyte to bolster its limited-view pipeline. Any bid would likely follow phase 3 data from Incyte on its lung cancer drug. He expects Gilead to make a string of cancer acquisitions over the next few years.""We don't see many companies over $10 billion to $20 billion that would fit well, so we believe they should do a string-of-pearls to buy five-plus companies over next one to two years,"" he wrote. ""Gilead hadn't done much outside of three NASH deals, and they are patient in cancer.""RELATED:Drug Stocks Rally On Relief Clinton Didn't Win White HouseCan This Small-Cap Biotech Take On Gilead, Celgene, Biogen In Alzheimer's?Biotechs Climb For Third Straight Day; Which Leaders Are Buyable?

246,GILD,"Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) could look to M&A following Donald Trump's election as 2017 sets up with fewer regulatory hurdles and a likely biotech resurgence, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Monday.Biotech stocks have surged since Trump's election, largely on the notion that he will be less likely to pressure drug prices than Hillary Clinton and likely to push business-friendly legislation, including tax incentives to repatriate cash to the U.S.With the election uncertainty over, Yee expects the big four biotechs to make good on M&A plans as capital remains inexpensive and organic growth slows. Trump appears poised to embrace innovation within his administration, Yee wrote in a research report Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs aren't alone in experiencing a Trump effect. Defensive stocks are on a furious upswing following the election. Should you get in on these five defensive stocks now? Get IBD's Industry Themes for the answer.To that end, Trump met with Patrick Soon-Shiong over the weekend. Soon-Shiong is a biotech exec and the former CEO of Abraxis BioScience, which Celgene acquired in 2010 for $3 billion. There's no telling what will come of Trump's meeting with Soon-Shiong, Yee noted.Regardless, investors are starting to key in on the pro-biz environment. Since the election, shares of IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group and the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) are nearly 15%. The iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF (IBB) is up more than 9%.""Barring any big policy surprises out of Trump, there is an increased feeling of pro-business including pro-biotech within the GOP,"" Yee wrote. ""So we see it as unlikely that any major legislation should derail innovation.""Those increases are merely the beginning, Yee wrote, noting, ""If good things happen, we believe stocks can go much higher."" Alzheimer's data in late 2017 or early 2018 from Eli Lilly (LLY) could be a catalyst. Biotechs will also likely update 2017 guidance in January, potentially pushing stocks higher.No. 3 biotech Celgene is most de-risked in the postelection world, with no near-term catalysts and no ""fear of any big disappointments,"" Yee wrote. Celgene has multiple sclerosis data due in the first half of 2017, but likely won't raise 2020 guidance in January.But Celgene stock could dip on a dilutive deal, he noted.""We'd view any pullback as a buying opportunity because the long-term tail question is sufficient pipeline — and that's what long-term investors want to see (near-term earnings variance is less important than tail questions),"" he wrote.Meanwhile, Amgen and Biogen will likely ""be OK,"" but uncertainty remains on shares of BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Yee wrote.Biogen stock could bound on strong Alzheimer's results from Eli Lilly. Amgen stock is still suffering the fallout of Q3 commentary on Enbrel pricing in 2017.On the stock market today, Celgene stock lifted 1.8% to 124.14. Shares of Amgen, Biogen and Gilead were all up a fraction.

247,GILD,"After Donald Trump's stunning win, drug and biotech stocks rallied Wednesday as investors in that sector cheered. Hillary Clinton had been seen as far more likely to crack down on drug prices and takeover activity.Gilead Sciences (GILD) rose 6% on the stock market today. Pfizer (PFE) shot up 7.1%, Amgen (AMGN) 5.8% and Merck (MRK) 6.1%. Mylan Labs (MYL), under fire for its EpiPen price hikes, leapt 4.9%. Mylan late Wednesday posteds Q3 earnings that fell short on the top and bottom lines, but shares were up a fraction.Clinton had said she would go after ""excessive"" drug price hikes. She also likely would have favored changes to the U.S. government negotiate lower prices with drugmakers. Meanwhile, Republicans retained control of both houses of Congress, also easing regular concerns.Drugmakers aren't in the clear. There is still populist anger at prices for new and old treatments, with Trump at times signaling he would also go after drug prices.

248,GILD,"Small-cap biotech Axovant Sciences (AXON) could pull in $2 billion to $4 billion in sales on an Alzheimer's drug, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Tuesday — pitting it against big players like Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Eli Lilly (LLY).Early Tuesday, Axovant reported Q3 losses and told investors that it expects to wrap up a key phase-three trial for its Alzheimer's drug intepirdine by year's end. Yee expects data by mid-2017.""We see 60% probability of success for phase 3 (intepirdine), on a $2 billion to $4 billion Alzheimer's drug, which could result in five to 10 times potential upside,"" Yee wrote in a research report. He has an outperform rating and 40 price target on Axovant stock.But Axovant stock toppled on the stock market today. Shares were down 7.2% to 11.15, at a five-month low, following the Q3 earnings report. Losses per share ex items widened to 43 cents from 12 cents in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts expected a 37-cent loss.Axovant made its initial public offering in June 2015, pricing shares at 15. The company hasn't yet reported sales.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks are trading positively for the third consecutive day. Biogen could be among the leaders in that pack on early efficacy in a phase three trial of a spinal muscular atrophy drug in conjunction with Ionis. Get the full scope in Industry Themes.The Alzheimer's market is huge, with big players Gilead, Celgene, Biogen and Eli Lilly all looking to take a chunk. Axovant most closely rivals Danish drugmaker Lundbeck, which has two phase-three trials due in 2017 on its drug idalopirdine.Intepirdine and idalopirdine have similar mechanisms. Both are 5HT6 antagonists that aim to assist cognition and memory. But Lundbeck's idalopirdine has safety issues and Yee gives it only a 20% probability of success.Lundbeck's idalopirdine ""is using doses below the levels needed due to safety issues for that drug, and thus we would not overly read into it if it were negative,"" Yee wrote in a research report.Axovant is also testing nelotanserin to treat the ""visual hallucination"" symptom of Alzheimer's and Lewy body dementia. Data are expected in February from a phase two trial of 20 patients. But, Yee notes, the consensus has no expectation for that trial, considering the size.""If data were great (strong numerical reduction in hallucinations), we believe we could see a 20%-25% move for Axovant vs. minor downside if negative,"" he wrote, noting that Alzheimer's data later in the year is more important for the stock.RELATED:Eli Lilly Q3 Revenue, EPS Miss; CEO Praises Drug Pipeline

The chipmaker will announce quarterly earnings Thursday.Nvidia used to be known mainly for its graphics cards for video game consoles, but the company has immersed itself in new markets with bright growth prospects, including self-driving cars and artificial intelligence.Shares dipped 0.2%, near 71.16 at the closing bell on the stock market today.Raymond James hiked its price target on the online travel company to 1700 from 1560. Priceline reported third-quarter earnings after the market close Monday that beat on the top and bottom lines.Online travel company TripAdvisor (TRIP) reports Q3 earnings after the market close Tuesday, following cautious warnings on its Q2 call, and EPS is expected to fall for a third straight quarter.Priceline stock surged 6.6% to close at 1578.13.Benchmark maintained a buy rating on Activision Blizzard and raised its price target to 50.87 from 49.79.

250,GILD,"Biotech stocks climbed for the third consecutive day Tuesday, with mid-cap Tesaro (TSRO) forging the way, but among the largest companies, Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG) are buyable now, says Mizuho analyst Salim Syed.Syed initiated coverage Tuesday on Amgen, Gilead and Celgene stocks with buy ratings. He also initiated on Biogen (BIIB), but with a neutral rating on the lack of near- or medium-term catalysts and uncertainty after former CEO George Scangos resigned in July.""To be clear, we still think Biogen has some good programs and it could be a matter of time before we get excited again ... just not right now,"" Syed wrote in a research report. He has a 290 price target on Biogen stock, which slipped 2 cents Tuesday to 295.60.IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group lifted a fraction on the stock market today. But the volatile election season has strangled shares, causing the group to topple 16% over the past seven weeks.IBD'S TAKE: Syed has a neutral rating on Biogen stock, but shares are looking better after Biogen and Ionis announced early efficacy in phase 3 testing of a spinal muscular atrophy drug. Check out Industry Themes for the full take.Syed likened Amgen to a jogger. He has a 164 price target on the stock, down a fraction to 138.45 on Tuesday.""Before Amgen's most recent Q3 call, we thought of Amgen largely as a 'ho-hum' steady stock, a jogger if you will,"" he wrote. ""However, since Amgen's Q3 call (about 1.5 weeks ago), the stock has come down about 12%.""Enbrel commentary during the Q3 call spooked investors, he says. Sales of the immunosuppressant were flat at $1.45 billion and, given contract negotiations, Amgen expects ""relatively little benefit from net selling price changes in 2017"" for Enbrel.Wall Street has been predicting a decline in Amgen's legacy businesses for some time. But Syed sees a silver lining in new drugs, like Amgen's Repatha, a cholesterol-busting PCSK9si rival of Sanofi (SNY) and Regeneron's (REGN) Praluent.Repatha already has U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, but sales have suffered on restricted access, Syed wrote. Repatha is currently in phase 3 testing to treat cardiovascular outcomes and, in September, met primary and secondary endpoints in a phase 3 test for coronary artery disease.CV data are expected in Q1. Syed calls this ""the most important data event for Amgen."" A positive event could pull Amgen stock out of the dumps. Shares hit a two-year low Friday, though they managed to close up fractionally for the day.Gilead managed the impossible in 2013-14 after it launched Hepatitis C (HCV) drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni and tripled its revenue to become a $30 billion company, Syed wrote in a separate report. But the duo are cures for HCV and, therefore, won't last forever.""The flip side of developing a cure is eventually the disease will be eradicated,"" he wrote. ""While great for patients, this means declining revenues over time. This has been weighing on Gilead's stock as the answer of slope of decline isn't exactly clear.""For Q3, Gilead's hep C trio -- Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa -- brought in $3.3 billion in sales, down 31% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Epclusa, which launched in June and July in the U.S. and Europe helped to offset declines in Sovaldi and Harvoni.Syed models 10% year-over-year declines in HCV sales for Gilead.But Gilead is working on its next leg of growth, Syed says. He has an 88 price target on Gilead stock. Its nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and Hepatitis B (HBV) drugs are still too early in their pipelines. Plus, Gilead is facing NASH competition from Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) and Allergan (AGN).Gilead isn't ""a table-pounding buy,"" but the stock is undervalued and the company will likely perform over time, rewarding patient investors, Syed wrote.Gilead stock rose 4 cents Tuesday to 74.04.If Celgene is a castle, chemotherapy drug Revlimid is its moat, Syed says. During Q3, Revlimid sales grew 30% vs. last year to $1.89 billion, driven by new market share gains and increased duration. Revlimid is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), multiple myeloma, and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).Revlimid ""allows Celgene to grow its next sources of revenue,"" Syed wrote in a separate report. ""(Revlimid is) still a growing part of the business and a value add to Celgene, but this part of the business is fairly well established and mature.""Inside its moat, Celgene has cancer drugs durvalumab and CAR-T in conjunction with AstraZeneca (AZN) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), respectively. Celgene is also working on its next-generation replacement for Revlimid, which is expected to go generic in 2022 and be fully generic in 2026.At its core, Celgene has ozanimod, currently in phase 3 testing for multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis, and GED-301, an investigational Crohn's disease drug.

251,GILD,"U.S. companies will devote $150 billion in repatriated overseas cash for stock repurchases next year if Congress enacts President-elect Donald Trump's proposal to lower taxes on such moves, says Goldman Sachs.The top five overseas cash holders are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL),  Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL).Trump has proposed a one-time tax cut for the repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas, with tax rates falling from 35% to 10%. This plan would indeed spur companies to bring back overseas cash, says Goldman Sachs.In 2017, for only the second time in 20 years, stockrepurchases will account for the largest share of cash used by S&P 500 companies, forecasts Goldman Sachs. Share buybacks will rise by 30% to $780 billion in 2017, says the investment bank.IBD's TAKE: Apple has been raising its dividend aggressively. On Nov. 10, the iPhone and MacBook giant paid 57 cents a share in cash to shareholders. Learn more at IBD's Income Investor.""We estimate that $150 billion out of $780 billion of S&P 500 buybacks in 2017 will be driven by repatriated overseas cash,"" said Goldman Sachs in a research report. ""We forecast that S&P 500 companies will repatriate close to $200 billion of their $1 trillion of total overseas cash in 2017, which will be directed primarily toward share repurchases.""Moody's Investor Service says Apple is on track to have $230 billion in overseas cash by the end of 2016, by far the most of any company.

252,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) cut its losses Tuesday on a fibrosis drug, but still plans to send two potential treatments for fatty liver disease to phase-two testing in 2017, a Needham analyst said Wednesday after the biotech's Q3 earnings report.But Needham's analyst, Alan Carr, kept his hold rating on Gilead stock following its Q3 report late Tuesday. In the stock market today, shares dipped 2.1% to 72.51. Shares are down 28% this year, matching the decline in IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group.For Q3, Gilead reported $7.5 billion in sales and $2.75 in earnings per share ex items, down a respective 9.6% and 15% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Sales topped the consensus of analysts polled by FactSet for $7.46 billion, but EPS missed by 9 cents.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead's Q3 report follows those of Amgen and BioMarin. Both are similarly struggling during the volatile election season. Keep tabs on Industry Themes for more.Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti attributed the Q3 sales beat to HIV-1 drug Genvoya, which brought in $80 million more than expected. That was partly offset by a $30 million miss in hepatitis C drug sales. Sales of hep C drugs have been impacted by Medicaid, which restricts access to all but the most seriously ill patients.Gilead's hep C unit is comprised of Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa. The trio brought in $3.3 billion in sales, down 31% vs. the year-earlier period. Gilead attributed the decline to lower demand for Harvoni and Sovaldi. Epclusa launched in June and July in the U.S. and Europe, respectively.RBC analyst Michael Yee expects some near-term challenges for Gilead stock on low visibility for its hepatitis C sales in the U.S. and in Europe. He kept an outperform rating on Gilead stock but cut his price target to 90 from 95.Gilead also announced it discontinued testing of fibrosis drug simtuzumab, which failed to show efficacy in phase-two trials of NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Instead, the firm is looking to send two single agents to phase-two testing and has plans for combination trials in 2017.The NASH battle, meanwhile, continues to heat up with Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT), Novartis (NVS), Allergan (AGN) (which is buying Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA) for that purpose) and Gilead all in the mix.

254,GILD,"It's been called a ""silent epidemic"" that's slowly wasting away the livers of millions of Americans while doctors have a paltry understanding of the disease and no approved treatments.But now, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, is in the sights of more than a dozen drugmakers. Allergan (AGN) became the latest Tuesday, announcing two deals to acquire NASH treatments in less than 12 hours. It's racing companies from startup Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) to giants including Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Pfizer (PFE) to reach an untapped market that could be worth $5 billion to $10 billion a year, according to a May estimate by RBC Capital Markets Corp. analyst Michael Yee.Drugmakers still are trying to determine how different components of the disease -- inflammation, scarring and metabolic changes -- interact and are experimenting with a variety of treatment mechanisms. With so many companies piling into the field, they'll have to work to distinguish themselves.""We're looking for something that's got a 'wow' factor,"" said Alex DePaoli, chief medical officer of closely held NGM Biopharmaceuticals Inc., which has a NASH partnership with Merck & Co (MRK). ""We want to develop something that pops your eyes out.""NASH occurs when fat accumulates in the liver along with inflammation and damage, and as much as a quarter of the U.S. population may have a precursor condition, called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The ailment develops slowly, and patients often don't show symptoms until their livers are heavily damaged. It's most common in people who are overweight or have diabetes, and doctors mainly prescribe diet changes and weight loss.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Biomed/Biotech sector is running hot, ranked eighth among IBD's 197 industry groups. The sector is led by Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN), and more can be found about it here.While doctors need to perform a biopsy to diagnose NASH, about 6 million to 15 million people in the U.S. alone are estimated to have the condition, and about 20% of them will go on to develop life-threatening cirrhosis. NASH will be the leading cause of liver transplants by 2020, according to Allergan. Drugs that treat it likely will command high prices, Elizabeth Krutoholow, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said.At the head of the race are Intercept and French biotech firm Genfit, with large trials underway. Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA), which Allergan agreed to buy Tuesday for as much as $1.7 billion, is preparing to recruit patients for a final-stage study. Investors also are watching for results from two of Gilead's mid-stage trials that are expected to be presented this year. On the acquisition news, Tobira shares soared by more than 721% Tuesday. Shares were up another 0.5% in afternoon trades Wednesday.Intercept is testing Ocaliva, already approved to treat a rare liver disease called primary biliary cirrhosis, against NASH. Enrollment of a final-stage trial of 2,000 people is expected to be completed next year, with interim results due in 2019.A potential concern is that in an earlier trial some patients experienced itching when taking the drug, in some cases so severe that it interfered with basic activities. Chief Executive Mark Pruzanski said in an interview that he hopes Ocaliva will become a backbone treatment, used in combination with other drugs.Genfit is developing elafibranor, a once-a-day-treatment that raises fat metabolism and fights inflammation, to ""treat the underlying cause of fibrosis,"" Dean Hum, Genfit's chief scientific officer, said in an interview.While elafibranor failed to meet a primary goal in a mid-stage trial last year, it showed promise in a subset of patients with moderate and severe forms of the disease. A final-stage trial in 2,000 moderate and severe patients is underway, and the company may have data by late 2018.Beyond the startup biotechs, some of the biggest companies are paying attention and ready to do deals. Merck said it will pay as much as $450 million for its partnership with NGM. Gilead, maker of the blockbuster hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni,  bought a NASH drug from Nimbus Therapeutics LLC for $1.2 billion, including milestone payments. Before that, Gilead also bought a drug from Phenex Pharmaceuticals AG for as much as $470 million.Gilead now has four NASH candidates in its portfolio and will have data from two later this year. The drugs target different aspects of the disease and will be developed individually, but may be used in potent cocktails. Allergan's Tobira is the biggest NASH deal so far, and on Tuesday the company also announced a $50 million purchase of Akarna Therapeutics Ltd., another developer of NASH treatments.Pfizer, the biggest U.S. drugmaker, may be a future acquirer. It has a NASH drug in trials and two more to be tested in humans by the end of the year. NASH is ""a major priority,"" said Morris Birnbaum, chief scientific officer of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. The company is trying to treat the disease in its early stages.It won't be easy. Along with Genfit, Tobira's mid-stage trial failed, and Raptor Pharmaceutical (RPTP) ended its program.""Data is starting to come out of studies, and a lot of confidence will be built and lost,"" said Jay Luly, chief executive of Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA), which will begin testing an experimental treatment in patients this year. ""The same, I expect, will happen with money.""

255,GILD,"Medical behemoths Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB) could square off to acquire muscle biologist Cytokinetics (CYTK), while more than a dozen potential players prep for an M&A donnybrook over small-cap Adamas Pharmaceuticals (ADMS), Needham analysts suggested Friday.Biotech M&A fodder heated up this week as Allergan (AGN) announced back-to-back deals to acquire Vitae Pharmaceuticals (VTAE) for $639 million and Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA) for $1.7 billion. The Tobira deal gives Allergan a leg up in the battle against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), where Gilead (GILD) and Intercept (ICPT) Pharmaceuticals also compete.IBD's 420-company biotech industry group has climbed to No. 10 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 173 just 13 weeks ago. Collectively, the group has a $771 billion market cap, No. 11 among all groups. The group fell 0.7% Friday, its first decline in the past eight trading days. The group was up 3.8% for the week.Needham analysts reviewed R&D pipelines, business development areas of interest and M&A activity for 26 large companies to gauge how interested Big Pharma is in biotechs -- ""an important theme in the biotech space,"" they wrote in a research report.Since 2012, Allergan, Amgen, Bristol Myers-Squibb (BMY), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), Roche (RHHBY), Shire (SHPG) and Valeant (VRX) have been most acquisitive, buying (or prepping to buy) more than 100 companies, collectively. Shire has been most active, with 14 acquisitions.""We believe late-development-stage and commercial-stage biotech companies are particularly attractive acquisition targets,"" they wrote in a research report titled, ""What does Big Pharma want to buy?"" Peak areas of interest include oncology and cardiovascular, Needham research showed.But that may not be where Big Pharma takes its beaucoup bucks for M&A. Needham analysts suggested central nervous system (CNS) players Adamas and Acadia Pharmaceuticals, and liver disorder drugmaker Intercept could be of prime acquisition interest.Eight firms overlap in potential interest for Adamas and Acadia: AbbVie (ABBV), Allergan, Eli Lilly (LLY), Lundbeck, Merck, Novartis Pharmaceuticals (NVS), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) and Takeda Pharmaceutical.Needham lists 13 potential acquirers for Adamas, but Allergan makes particular sense considering the duo already partner on the next-generation formulation of memantine and the fixed-dose combination product Namzaric, both of which battle Alzheimer's.By year's end, Adamas plans to file a new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for ADS-5102, a treatment for levodopa-induced dyskinesia -- involuntary movements -- in Parkinson's disease patients and multiple sclerosis walking impairments, Needham wrote.Meanwhile, Acadia's 11 potential suitors could be interested in Nuplazid, a drug to ease psychosis associated with Parkinson's launched earlier this year. Needham suggests Acadia could be looking to expand the label for other uses.Similarly, Intercept could draw interest from nearly a dozen potential buyers including Gilead, No. 2 biotech by market cap. On Thursday, an RBC analyst posited Intercept would continue to lead Gilead and Allergan in the battle against NASH.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks notched higher this week, up about 4% since last week.

258,GILD,"Eli Lilly (LLY), Pfizer (PFE) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are chipping away at AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira sales, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said Monday after AbbVie missed Q3 expectations Friday, primarily on declining Humira sales.Divan downgraded AbbVie stock to neutral and cut his price target to 60 from 70. He models immunosuppressant Humira pulling in $18.1 billion in 2018 sales, declining to $11.3 billion and $5.2 billion in 2022 and 2025, respectively.Humira accounted for 63% of AbbVie sales in Q3. The drug is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and irritable bowel disorder — markets where branded rivals are already on the market and biosimilars are pressuring AbbVie's patent on Humira.AbbVie is working to protect that patent, but Divan expects Amgen (AMGN) and others to have biosimilars on the market by 2022.""Whether it is in 2020, 2021, 2022 or some other year, at some point Humira will start to decline,"" Divan wrote in his research report. To cope with Humira's decline (it missed Q3 expectations by $100 million), AbbVie has eight late-stage drugs capable of bringing in $25 billion to $30 billion in combined sales.IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie's earnings have grown an average 20% over the past five quarters, but have also declined for the last three periods.

AbbVie has its own IL-23 drug in development, but ""it will be entering into a crowded market where it will have more competitive and pricing challenges,"" said Divan.In the irritable bowel disorder market, Celgene's mongersen and ozanimod could put pressure on Humira sales as soon as 2020-22, Divan wrote.But UBS analyst Marc Goodman says the pressure on AbbVie stock is overdone.

260,GILD,"Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and other technology companies could gain from President-elect Donald Trump's support of a one-time repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas — if the idea gets enacted by a still-Republican-held Congress.Trump has proposed a 10% repatriation tax on profits of U.S. corporate foreign subsidiaries, down from the statutory 35%. The top five overseas cash holders are Apple, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco and Oracle (ORCL).Trump's cash repatriation proposal ""could bring a flood of money back into the U.S. that would be available for dividends, share buybacks and possibly for capital investments,"" said Kevin Logan, an HSBC economist, in a research report. ""The tax revenue raised could be used to fund an infrastructure spending program, something that was advocated by both candidates during the presidential campaign.""Moody's Investor Service says Apple is on track to have $230 billion in overseas cash by the end of 2016, followed by Microsoft at $113 billion, Cisco at $62 billion, Oracle at $52 billion and Google at $49 billion. It projects that the top five will have $505 billion overseas by year-end, or 86% of their total cash, up from $441 billion in 2015.""We expect most companies would take advantage of a hypothetical tax reduction on permanently repatriated moneys to the maximum extent possible, but the devil is always in the details,"" Moody's analyst Richard Lane told IBD via email. "" Nevertheless, a hypothetical 10% tax on the $1.3 trillion offshore that we project for 2016 translates into $130 billion in tax revenue that could be invested in efficiency enhancing, domestic infrastructure investments.""More important than temporary, one-time tax relief, however, would be permanent tax reform that provides companies clarity to make long-term capital allocation decisions.""Trump has also proposed reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15%, down from 35%, in an effort to keep companies from leaving for countries with lower rates.""Given the Republican control, there is a possibility of some tax relief to incent companies to bring foreign cash back to the U.S. offering an opportunity for them to invest, buyback stock and acquire assets,"" Abhey Lamba, a Mizuho Securities analyst, said in a report.Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst, says a Republican-controlled House and U.S. Senate ""is not likely to block"" the 10% cash repatriation proposal. Republicans kept a narrow lead in the Senate and maintained a solid advantage in the House.Pritchard says Adobe Systems (ADBE), Autodesk (ADSK), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Red Hat (RHT) and VMware (VMW) are among companies that could bring back cash.""We believe the chances increase of a larger share repurchase or (lesser chance) dividend from these companies,"" Pritchard said in a research report.The biotechs with sizable overseas holdings include Amgen (AMGN), Medtronic (MDT) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), says a UBS research report. It says other companies with lots of overseas cash include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Coca-Cola (KO).""While the specifics would depend on the ultimate legislation, we would expect that a significant amount of the overseas cash balances (perhaps 75% or greater) would be repatriated and used to continue to repurchase shares and pay dividends, but also to increase the pace of M&A and growth capex, of which the latter has been a missing component in the current cycle,"" UBS analyst Julian Emanuel said in the report.Among big tech stocks, Oracle was up 1.1% to 39.55 and Cisco added 1.2% to 31.36 at the close on the stock market today. Meanwhile, Apple was down a fraction to 110.88 and Alphabet slipped 0.8% 805.59.

261,GILD,"Medical giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) beat Q1 estimates and raised guidance Tuesday morning, sending its stock to its fifth recent record high.J&J reported earnings of $1.68 a share, up 8% from the year-earlier quarter and beating analysts' consensus by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales rose 0.6% to $17.48 billion, matching consensus. J&J said that the foreign-exchange impact knocked 6.6 percentage points off sales growth.Nonetheless, the forex headwinds finally seem to be abating. J&J cited the improved forex outlook as the reason it was raising full-year sales guidance by $400 million, to $71.2 billion to $71.9 billion. It also added 10 cents to EPS guidance, now $6.53 to $6.68.IBD's Take: Johnson & Johnson rated No. 1 in its group, but CR is iffy.""Our Pharmaceuticals business continues to deliver impressive levels of growth, we have steady improvement in our Consumer business, and we are seeing momentum in our Medical Devices businesses, all of which are fueling our optimism for the full-year ahead,"" J&J CEO Alex Gorsky said in a statement.J&J stock was up 2% in early trading on the stock market today, touching a record high of 113.60 intraday. The stock is up more than 10% for the year so far, and it is the first of three medical stocks that are hitting new highs and are reporting this week, the others being Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) this evening and Stryker (SYK) late Wednesday.""This morning, J&J continued the growth momentum the company has seen in recent quarters, again delivering organic sales growth acceleration and its second consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth on an adjusted, operational basis,"" wrote Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy in a research note.She noted that, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, M&A activity and shrinking sales of hepatitis C drug Olysio -- which was made obsolete when Gilead Sciences (GILD) released Harvoni in late 2014 -- sales rose 6.9%. Operating EPS growth was just above 10%.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote that the pharma sales beat was driven by the immunology franchise -- Remicade, Simponi and Stelara -- as well as its stroke prevention treatment Xarelto.But another top seller, diabetes drug Invokana, missed consensus by 19%. Investors had been wondering if Invokana would take a hit from Eli Lilly's (LLY) Jardiance, which last September proved that it could dramatically cut deaths from heart failure but didn't get a sales bump from this in Q4.

263,GILD,"The new IBD Tech Leaders Index looks at companies in the technology field that are highly rated using IBD’s proprietary ratings. With the current market condition being Uptrend Under Pressure, these names should be approached with higher caution, especially since they will be tied more to the performance of the Nasdaq composite.As of the April 29 list, the electronics sector stands out with a dominant representation by two industry groups making up more than 25% of the list: the scientific measurement electronics group, at No. 10 of IBD's 197 industry groups, and the electronics parts manufacturers, at No. 23.Many of the stocks in the sector serve in support roles, so part of your analysis should include the areas of exposure for the companies. Are they focused on life sciences with exposure to the biotech industry? Biotechs had a great run in 2014, but the group has fallen considerably, with big winners like Celgene (CELG) and Gilead (GILD) topping in the summer of 2015.A company like Danaher (DHR) has exposure to multiple industries, with segments that serve life sciences and diagnostics vs. its segments focused on industrial technologies and petroleum businesses. Danaher will make the analysis a little easier when they complete a tax-free spinoff in the third quarter of 2016. The company retaining the Danaher name will keep the life science exposure and the new spinoff, named Fortive, will take the industrial side.What about the exposure to foreign markets? Bruker (BRKR) not only has strong links to the life sciences and pharmaceutical research but also, according to the company website, 80% of its revenue comes from outside the U.S. As the first-quarter earnings season has unfolded, companies have often pointed to currency headwinds created by a strong dollar as being the culprit behind soft earnings.

The stock took a beating despite a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report announced after the close Thursday.U.S. Concrete (USCR), another IBD 50 name, dropped nearly 8% in heavy volume and nearly erased a 17% gain from a 59.50 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. Shareholders should sell before letting a sizable profit turn into a loss.Computer data stocks were among the worst performers due to weak earnings reports from Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC).Seagate plunged 19% after profit for the latest quarter dived 80% to 22 cents a share, far below Wall Street expectations.

266,GILD,"There's a decent case to be made that investors' fear of Donald Trump winning the White House may turn out to be a good deal worse than the reality, at least in the intermediate term.Stock indexes crashed 5% overnight with odds for a December Federal Reserve hike tumbling. But after an initial modest sell-off at the open, the major averages have reversed for solid gains, with soaring bond yields.The overnight reaction to Trump looked like it may vindicate economists who predicted the market would fall up to 12% if Trump won. But once you consider Trump's near-term priorities and the challenges of working with Congress — even a GOP Congress restrained by a filibuster in the Senate — the agenda looks more market friendly than unfriendly.Priority one for Trump on the domestic front is likely to be revving up growth via infrastructure spending, cutting the corporate tax rate and offering multinationals the chance to repatriate overseas profits at a lower tax rate.He's talked about spending $1 trillion on infrastructure, double what Hillary Clinton proposed to spend, with both candidates talking up the potential of public-private partnerships.""With the focus on infrastructure, the basic resources sector is one of the best performers today,"" wrote Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research in London.Both Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) surged on the stock market today, suring 12% and 9%, respectively. Shares of gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) initially spiked as Trump's victory fueled a safe-haven bid with the dollar plunging. But as stocks and the dollar rebound, gold erased its big gains and Newmont traded 2% higher.IBD'S TAKE: Gold prices are rising sharply Wednesday. That will give a big boost to Newmont and other gold mining stocks, which are technical turning points.Biotech and drug stocks such as Pfizer (PFE) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) rallied on relief that Hillary Clinton will not be president and the Senate will remain in GOP hands. Clinton had vowed to crack on ""excessive"" price increases, notably on older treatments. She also likely would have pushed for the government to negotiate drug prices lower.Trump's victory means that regulatory relief for super-regional banks from Dodd-Frank regulations may go a step further than expected, paving the way for a round of acquisitions. It also may ease pressures on too-big-to-fail banks, which explains why Wells Fargo (WFC) popped 6% intraday, recovering from an overnight sell-off. Wells Fargo also may see less political pressure over its fradualent account scandal.""We expect a positive snapback move once investors digest the results and factor in a more favorable regulatory environment for the financial sector,"" wrote Brian Gardner, head of Washington research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.Banks have been rising in part due to expectations for a Fed hike amid stronger wage growth and tighter labor markets. While the Fed may decide to pause before hiking if Trump's election does send financial shock waves around the globe, that's far from clear.""Expect an immediate market pullback, on fear, and then a pause,"" said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. ""Should Mr. Trump be able to reduce the uncertainty around what policies he intends to pursue, it is quite possible markets will recover as the economic fundamentals in the U.S. remain sound.""Trump is likely to kill President Obama's overtime rule that's due to take effect in December that guarantees time-and-a-half pay for salaried workers earning up to $47,476 — about twice the current level. Wal-Mart (WMT) already raised pay for assistant store managers to $48,500 from $45,000, effective September, to avoid being liable for overtime, but many employers have been slower to adopt the change as Congress aims to delay it. Some, like Carrols Restaurant Group (TAST), whose 717 Burger King locations make it the Restaurant Brands International (QSR) chain's largest franchisee, have said they'll effectively demote their managers and make them punch the clock.The ObamaCare employer mandate is likely history, meaning modest-wage employers would no longer be fined if they fail to offer health insurance to workers clocking at least 30 hours per week. Along with retailers, Trump may bring relief to restaurant chains like McDonald's (MCD) that are being squeezed by competition and compensation hikes, contributing to a record gap between the cost of fast food and eating in.What are markets scared about? Trump's threats to impose tariffs on companies like Ford Motor (F) that send cars to the U.S. from Mexico, to walk away from Nafta and to crack down on unauthorized immigrants are why economists have said his agenda could hurt the economy.If Trump were to start his presidency by labeling China a currency manipulator and imposing tariffs, that could start a trade war, with China reciprocating by targeting the sales of Apple (AAPL), General Motors (GM) and Microsoft (MSFT). China, facing slower growth and an unsustainable build up in debt, could easily spark another bout of financial market turmoil as was seen this past January.How Trump proceeds on trade will be one of his most important early decisions. The good news is that Trump isn't campaigning anymore — and his was an especially insular campaign. Surrounded by pro-growth economic advisors and now in direct contact with top business leaders, Trump is likely to act deliberately, not rashly. That may mean opening up talks with both countries about how to move trade relations forward and setting out intermediate term goals to measure progress.This seems consistent with Trump's victory speech words: ""I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone — all people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.""Trump seems unlikely to back down from his pledge to build a wall on the border with Mexico, but that, in and of itself, would have more of a symbolic than an economic effect. His rhetoric has shifted to cracking down on unauthorized immigrants who are violent criminals, and there may be fewer of those than he implies.RELATED:Drug Stocks Rally On Relief Clinton Didn't Win White HouseTrump Wins, But Fed Hike Still On: Treasury Yields, Bank Stocks SoarAT&T, Time Warner Fall After Trump Victory; Is Merger In Doubt?Overtime Rule Fallout: Fast Food Managers Told To Punch ClockFBI Reveals More Evidence That Stocks Will Fall If Trump Wins

267,GILD,"Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA) stock was feeling some Mylan Pharmaceutical (MYL)-like pressure Monday on Congress' looming deadline to submit information regarding an $80,000 price increase for a rare cancer drug.Over the past year, Ariad upped its price on Inclusig to $199,000 annually from $120,000, RBC analyst Michael Yee wrote in a research report. Inclusig treats specific classes of chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Though Ariad sells 15-milligram and 45-mg bottles, the lion's share of patients (about 40%) are on a 30-mg dose, Yee wrote. The latter has to buy two 15-mg bottles, thus paying double the price.Yee doesn't see much stemming from Congress' pressure. Recently, Mylan agreed to make a generic, less costly version of its EpiPen, a device to treat anaphylaxis during emergency allergic reactions, after hiking the device's cost to $500 from $57.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech earnings season is in full swing with Merck, Eli Lilly, Vertex and Edward Lifesciences slated for Tuesday. IBD recently looked at some biotech giants and whether they can top expectations.Medivation (MDVN), which is being acquired by Pfizer (PFE), felt some congressional heat earlier this year over the $129,000 price tag on its prostate cancer drug. It later got a letter from Sen. Bernie Sanders.Gilead Sciences (GILD) came under some hot water earlier this year when it hiked the price on six of its drugs. But congressional requests for information didn't result in much, Yee wrote.""It's reasonably likely the congressional inquiries will blow over in time,"" Yee said.Ariad has until Nov. 4 to deliver information on the price hike including R&D spending and sales distribution tactics. Ariad has argued Inclusig isn't like Mylan's EpiPen and others.Ariad had ""a 20-year history of financial losses and unprofitability, far higher R&D spend than revenues, and $1.3 billion in historical spending to internally discover, develop and commercialize Inclusig,"" Yee wrote. Orphan drugs tend to be more costly from an R&D standpoint.Yee kept his sector perform rating on Ariad stock. But JPMorgan downgraded shares to neutral from underweight. By the closing bell on the stock market today, Ariad fell 9.7% to 9.37, at a nearly three-month low. Ariad is off 31% so far this month.

268,GILD,"Gilead Sciences' (GILD) nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) drug is ""clearly active and promising,"" but Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) remains one to two years ahead, RBC analyst Michael Yee said after Gilead, the No. 2 biotech by market cap, unveiled promising efficacy data.Gilead's Selonsertib aims to inhibit apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, a protein tied to NASH, diabetic kidney disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Of 72 patients enrolled in Gilead's 24-week phase-two study, 43% showed at least some improvement in fibrosis, the company said.That jibes with the results of Intercept's earlier NASH study, in which 35% to 40% of patients had a positive response vs. 20% on the placebo track, Yee wrote.Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA), which is being acquired by Allergan (AGN), also is active in the NASH market. In a recent study, 20% saw improvement in fibrosis using Tobira's drug.But Intercept has a healthy lead over Gilead and Tobira/Allergan, Yee says. All three are vying for a NASH market worth a potential $2 billion to $5 billion. Intercept should see key data in 2018-2019, but its rivals will likely have to wait until 2019-20, he says.""From a competitive landscape this is not shocking that there are NASH drugs that are starting to show promise and move into late stage,"" Yee wrote. ""Intercept is still one to two years ahead and will have data (in) 2018-2019.""Thursday's news did little for Gilead stock on Friday. On the stock market today, Gilead fell 3 cents to 74.28. Shares are down 26% for the year, as IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group has fallen 22%.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead is on tap to report its Q3 earnings on Nov. 1.

269,GILD,"What are ETF investors fretting about these days? A whole lot, but mostly over the stubborn fact that there are few bargains to be had across the broad U.S. stock market and broad fixed income market.""I have been confronted in almost every client conversation I have with stories about soaring high valuations,"" said Martin Small, head of U.S. iShares exchange traded funds at BlackRock. ""Nothing is cheap.""ETF investors can borrow from the popular ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy to find value investments, he told IBD in a phone interview. The Dogs theory recommends investing annually in the 10 highest-yielding companies of the blue-chip index. The thinking is that these ""dogs"" may be oversold and likely to rebound in price.Research shows this strategy outperforms the overall stock market in the long term. It has inspired several ETFs including ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs (SDOG).Small believes investors may be rewarded with a similar-but-different approach using ETFs. It takes advantage of the granular exposure to specific regions and industries that ETFs offer. The goal is to find the ""Dogs of ETFs"" that have sold off irrationally but offer value relative to the market. This is what the process involves, using iShares ETFs as an example:Screen the list of funds using price returns rather than dividend yield as the traditional Dogs strategy and Dogs-based funds do. The poorest performers will include funds that are cheap or oversold. Some of these may offer an attractive opportunity.Small suggests investors evaluate the performance of funds over both the shorter term (year-to-date, for example) and longer periods (one, three and five years).For example, here's what investors can learn looking at the current iShares ETF dogs. The 25 worst-performing iShares ETFs year to date show two broad areas that have been beaten down: foreign developed markets and health care.Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) crumbled 27% through Nov. 3. and iShares MSCI Europe Financials (EUFN) 11%. Over the same period, iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV), which tracks the broad U.S. stock market, advanced 4%.To Small, IBB seems oversold for a sector with favorable intellectual properties and strong sales. The fund's 181 stock holdings include Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Biogen (BIIB).Its negative trend coincided with scrutiny of drug pricing ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. That could mean a rally is in store for drugmakers after the political risks abate.In the case of EUFN, a turnaround is likely to depend on monetary policy having its desired effects. It has 30% of its assets in the U.K., where Brexit continues to cause uncertainty, and 5% in Italy, embroiled in bank loan troubles.It's important to look at how long the fund declined, as well as how fast and deep that decline was. ""Factors such as magnitude and speed (of decline) are additional pieces of information that can help you round out the story and decide if this is an opportunity you want to tap,"" Small said.The idea behind this type of analysis is to decide whether the ETF losers were unduly punished, as well as when they might revert to what is more attractive or normal.""Some of these incredibly sold off investments might return very quickly (to the mean) and others might take a very long period of time,"" Small said, adding value investing often requires patience.That's why he suggests value investors should not only ask ""How much is that dog?"" but also think about how long it might take to get the dog trained.Put your ETF dogs in the opportunistic sleeve of your portfolio. That's the one you carve apart from your core holdings for higher growth investments.""To the extent you need to take higher risk, it's best to do it with a strategy that does some type of value seeking,"" Small said. In other words, do what is hard for most fund investors. Buy low and sell high.It's the opposite of the buy-high-and-sell higher strategy that CAN-SLIM investors know and love.The value of the ""Dogs of ETFs"" approach is that it requires investors to understand the underlying drivers of the portfolio holdings, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of funds research at CFRA. Basically, it makes investors buy an ETF looking forward, not backward.He considers past performance to be of limited value in predicting future performance in ETF investing.""You should not chase winners and you should not discard losers without understanding why those ETFs have performed the way they have,"" he said. ""An ETF performing well is not relevant to whether it can continue to rise.""An index-based ETF merely reflects the performance of the market it targets. Unlike the case with active mutual funds, index fund managers have no control over the stocks in the portfolio.Related:'Dogs' ETF Hits Record High With Dividend Portfolio

271,GILD,"Biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ (REGN) core ophthalmology business still has huge upside as its Eylea sales grow in treating a variety of eye diseases, says RBC Capital. RBC also says that a legal settlement with Amgen (AMGN) over Praluent, a drug intended to lower bad LDL cholesterol, would be a positive.Most of Regeneron’s sales come from Eylea, launched in 2011 to treat age-related vision loss in the elderly. Regeneron aims to build sales of Eylea in the market for treating diabetic macular edema (DME), a cause of blindness in working-age people, as well as a related eye disease affecting older people.“Turning DME into a $2 billion to $3 billion market opportunity is important and likely,” Adnan Butt, an RBC Capital analyst, said in a research report Tuesday. In DME, Eylea competes with Roche Holding’s (RHHBY) Lucentis.Regeneron typically reports earnings in early May. Roche, Novartis (NVS) and Bayer (BAYRY) report earnings on April 19, 21 and 26, respectively, and their commentary could provide insights into Eylea’s growth, says RBC’s Butt.He says that consensus expectations for the recently launched cholesterol drug Praluent, which had only $7 million in December-quarter sales, still need to come down. Amgen makes a rival drug called Repatha. In March, a federal jury upheld the validity of two Amgen patents related to the cholesterol drug, dealing a blow to Regeneron and partner Sanofi (SNY).“A settlement with Amgen could be a positive,” Butt said in the report. He rates Regeneron stock outperform, with a price target of 668. Regeneron stock was up more than 1.5% in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 402.50.Amgen reports earnings on April 28, followed by Sanofi on April 29. Their earnings calls could provide reads on the status of Praluent litigation, says Butt.Regeneron stock has plunged 26% in 2016 amid a broad sell-off in biotech stocks, including Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD).Regeneron shares touched a six-month low below 349 last month but jumped on April 1 after the company announced strong phase three clinical results for dupilumab, a drug for eczema, an itchy skin condition. Regeneron is developing that drug with Sanofi.“The landmark deal with Sanofi provides $160 million per year to fund antibody discovery for eight years, gives Regeneron 50% of the profit and defers all development costs until the partnership is profitable,” added Butts.Startup Intellia Therapeutics late Monday announced a licensing deal with Regeneron. Cambridge, Mass.-based Intellia has developed “gene editing” technology to treat liver and blood diseases. It plans to go public.Regeneron has an IBD composite rating of 58 out of a possible 99, lower than both Celgene and Gilead. IBD’s Medical-Biomed/Biotech group ranks just No. 108 out of 197 industry groups. That’s down from No. 39 six months ago.  But it's up 9.8% the past four weeks, 10th best in that span.Anika Therapeutics (ANIK), Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) have the highest IBD Composite Ratings within the biotech group.

272,GILD,"Big biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) added to its fatty-liver-disease portfolio Monday by acquiring a line of biotech drugs in a deal potentially worth $1.2 billion.Gilead acquired Nimbus Therapeutics' Nimbus Apollo division for $400 million upfront, plus up to $800 million in milestones if Nimbus' drugs successfully make it through the development process. And the deal seemed to spark the shares of another drugmaker targeting nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT).Nimbus Apollo has a pipeline of  acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitors, the most advanced of which is NDI-010976 for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a common but currently untreatable condition causing liver damage through fat buildup. Phase-one trial results for NDI-010976 are due to be presented in a couple of weeks at the annual International Liver Congress.NASH is seen by analysts as a potentially enormous untapped market, and Gilead has been compiling a portfolio of drugs in the space to build on the liver-disease infrastructure it created to sell its massively successful hepatitis C drugs. In January 2015, the company bought Phenex Pharmaceuticals for its program targeting a different receptor, on top of its in-house development simtuzumab, which is in midstage testing for NASH.""These molecules will complement and further strengthen Gilead's pipeline and capabilities to advance a broad clinical program in NASH that includes compounds targeting multiple key pathways involved in the pathogenesis of the disease,"" Gilead Chief Scientific Officer Norbert Bischofberger said in a statement Monday.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young wrote that Gilead probably expects NASH to ultimately be treated with a combination therapy.The ACC approach has a bit of a checkered past, however.""This is a target that has been tried before by big pharm and has failed due to binding sites and difficulties in making it a drug-able target,"" Young wrote in a research note.Young also wrote that she was ""not surprised"" that Gilead chose to buy Nimbus Apollo instead of Intercept, which has what is generally seen as the leading contender for NASH with its drug candidate obeticholic acid (OCA). Intercept has been bandied about as a buyout target by Gilead and other players in liver disease, but analysts say it's unlikely that anyone will buy it before OCA is approved, and certainly not before this Thursday's FDA advisory committee meeting on OCA.Intercept stock was nonetheless up 6% in strong volume in early afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 138. Gilead stock was up nearly 1%, near 95.

274,GILD,"Pfizer (PFE) announced a deal Monday morning to buy Medivation (MDVN) for $81.50 a share, or an enterprise value of about $14 billion.The move follows months of takeover speculation for the cancer drugmaker, as well as widespread reports Sunday of an imminent Pfizer-Medivation deal.Medivation rose nearly 20% to 80.43 soon after the opening bell on the stock market today. Pfizer fell 2 cents to 34.96.""The proposed acquisition of Medivation is expected to immediately accelerate revenue growth and drive overall earnings growth potential for Pfizer,"" Pfizer CEO and Chairman Ian Read said in a statement.Pfizer said the deal will boost earnings per share by five cents in the first year after closing, with additional gains after that.Medivation closed Friday at 67.16 with a market valuation of $11.1 billion. That was slightly extended from a 63.04 buy point from a flat base.Medivation traded as low as 26.41 on Feb. 9. But it's been the subject of widespread buzz over possible buyouts. The biotech earlier this year rejected a $58 a share offer from France's Sanofi (SNY).Last week, a report had Pfizer, Merck (MRK), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG) and Sanofi as possible Medivation buyers.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs can deliver great growth. But are they generating profit and revenue gains via higher sales volumes or price increases? Here's how to hunt for biotech stocks.Medivation makes Xtandi, a prostate cancer drug with an annual sales rate already above $2 billion. It has other cancer fighters in development.Pfizer's $150 billion attempt to buy Allergan (AGN) fell apart earlier this year after the Obama administration changed rules to make tax inversion merger deals less attractive.RELATED:Medivation Affirms Guidance As Earnings Growth FlattensBiotechs Make Case For Leadership, But Is It A Convincing One?

275,GILD,"Big Pharma Merck (MRK) is now looking at a possible buyout of Medivation (MDVN), according to an anonymously sourced report.Reuters reported Wednesday afternoon that Merck was one of five big pharmas that have submitted indications of interest in buying Medivation, with the others being Sanofi (SNY), Pfizer (PFE), Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD).Sanofi has been very public about its attempt to acquire Medivation, and last month Medivation said it had entered a confidentiality agreement with Sanofi as well as other unnamed potential buyers. Earlier anonymously sourced reports said that Pfizer, Celgene and Gilead were among the interested buyers.There had been speculation that Merck might be interested: BMO Capital's May 5 research note asserted that Merck was preparing for a medium-size buyout and Medivation could be a target. Merck has been focusing much of its energy on cancer lately, and Medivation has one fast-growing drug on the market to treat prostate cancer and other cancer therapies in development.Medivation's stock had been trading flat on the stock market today, but popped to a 52-week high of 68.37 when the news came out. It closed up 1.9% at 66.48. Merck rose 0.4% to 63.29.IBD'S TAKE: Medivation was an IBD 50 stock up until its last earnings report, when year-over-year profit growth flattened and delivered a big hit to its EPS Rating. Analysts expect growth to pick up again starting in Q4, however. 
"
276,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) was falling sharply Tuesday after the big biotech reported weaker hepatitis C drug sales and lowered guidance late Monday, triggering a downgrade and several price-target cuts from Wall Street.""Management lowered 2016 revenue guidance by $500 million to $29.5 billion to $30.5 billion, citing challenges in HCV (hepatitis C), including fewer patient starts and shorter treatment duration, contributing to decline in revenue per patient,"" wrote Needham analyst Alan Carr as he cut the stock to hold from buy. ""We expect this trend to continue.""He added, however, that Gilead could regain his favor if its internal or acquired pipeline could show growth potential in areas such as hepatitis B, liver disease and cancer.Piper Jaffray analyst Joshua Schimmer lowered his price target on Gilead stock to 108 from 114 but maintained his overweight rating. While he admitted that the pipeline is ""overly speculative and in need of new direction,"" he also said that clinical-trial data coming out over the next six to 12 months should confirm his more bullish view.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young cut her price target to 115 from 120. BMO Capital Markets' Ian Somaiya, whose estimates had been below consensus, actually raised his price target by a dollar to 98 but maintained a hold rating.Gilead shares fell 8.5% to 81.05 on the stock market today, below the 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead's previously torrid growth turned negative this quarter, and its guidance suggests that will continued for the rest of the year. IBD's CAN Slim Investing System prefers stocks with current quarterly and annual growth of at least 25%. 
"
277,GILD,"Big biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) got a price-target cut from investment bank Leerink on Wednesday, after the company cancelled clinical trials on its cancer drug Zydelig due to safety problems.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said last Friday that it was looking into reports of serious adverse events, including deaths, in Gilead's trials of Zydelig in various forms of blood cancer. Later, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said that it was doing the same, and on Monday it issued a notice saying that Gilead had agreed to suspend six trials in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). Zydelig, first launched in July 2014, is now approved for relapsed CLL and as a third-line treatment for B-cell NHL and SLL.""The FDA is reviewing the findings of the clinical trials and will communicate new information as necessary,"" the agency said in its statement.Gilead also said that it's suspending trials of Zydelig as a front-line treatment for any cancer. On Wednesday, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges slashed his peak annual sales estimate on the drug from $935 million to $174 million in 2020, which he estimates will shave 1% to 3% off EPS in the 2017-2020 period. He therefore cut his price target to 127 from 130 while maintaining an outperform rating on Gilead stock.""Though accretive to revenue, oncology accounts for a small portion of Gilead's total revenue, 93% of which consists of antivirals,"" Porges wrote. ""We have never been convinced that oncology would become a major franchise for the company, and given these recent events, maintain this outlook.""Gilead stock was up 1% in early trading on the stock market today, near 90, but it's down more than 10% this year and sports a lowest-possible IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating of E.

279,GILD,"Drug stocks have long been favored by income investors for their relatively steady dividend payouts.Merck (MRK) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.46 a share, or $1.84 for the full year, which works out to an annualized yield of nearly 3.3%. That's well above the 2.1% average payout of the S&P 500. The New Jersey-based company has paid a dividend every quarter since 1970. Its long-term dividend growth rate is 3%.The drug giant on Thursday announced positive results from a comparative trial of its Zepatier hepatitis C drug to Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Sovaldi. And on Wednesday, Merck said the FDA accepted for review its supplement Biologics License Application for Keytruda to treat patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer. It also said the FDA granted a priority review on Aug. 9.Merck's full-year profit grew 3% last year, its best in four years. Analysts expect a 4% gain this year and 2% the next. Shares are working on the right side of a 10-month consolidation and are 9% off their 52-week high.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), whose products include blood-cancer drug Imbruvica and prostate-cancer drug Zytiga, offers a 2.7% annualized yield. Analysts forecast Q1 EPS to rise 6% to $1.65 a share on 1% higher sales to $17.5 billion when J&J reports Tuesday before the open. The stock is near the top of a buy range from a 104.88 cup-with-handle buy point cleared Feb. 25.Amgen (AMGN), known for drugs such as Neupogen and Epogen, pays an annual dividend of 2.5%. It has a three-year earnings growth rate of 17%. Analysts expect a 4% increase this year and 12% the next. Shares of the biotech are nearing a 165.33 buy point of a cup-shaped base.Neither Amgen nor Johnson & Johnson show up in Dividend Leaders in Friday's IBD, due to space limitations.

281,GILD,"An election year has added to the pressures that hit biotechnology stocks hard, but a look under the hood of two sibling biotech ETFs is revealing. It shows the more speculative companies in this extremely heterogeneous industry caused much of the hurt.BioShares Biotechnology Products (BBP) is down 1.4% year to date through Oct. 20 and invests in established companies that have brought at least one drug to market.The 35 stock holdings in this exchange traded fund include Biogen (BIIB), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Regeneron (REGN).IBD'S TAKE: The largest, cap-weighted biotech ETFs stand to benefit most if these five top companies climb the ""wall of worry"" that has built around the industry.BioShares Biotechnology Clinical Trials (BBC) is down 31.0% so far in 2016 and invests in young and smaller companies whose drugs are in the experimental-testing stage.Its portfolio includes Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT), whose shares rocketed in September after the FDA approved its drug to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. That approval means Sarepta will move to the BBP portfolio when the two BioShares ETFs next rebalance in December.This ETF pair allows investors to decide ""how much to mix,"" in terms of combining more-risky with less-risky biotechs, said Paul Yook, founder of BioShares.BBP's focus on household names makes it a relatively less volatile fund. In contrast, BBC holds the riskiest biotechs — highflying companies whose shares could double or triple overnight, and may crash and burn just as well.Yook describes BBP and BBC as the only exchange traded funds to separate clinical-trial companies and product companies into two distinct and stand-alone investments.Investors don't seem much enamored with the idea of custom-tailoring risk. The funds are extremely small and thinly traded, nearly two years after their debut. They have, however, seen a combined $5.8 million in net inflow over the first three quarters of 2016.The BBP fund is the best performer among biotech ETFs so far this year, and BBC the worst.Meanwhile, bellwether iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) has given up 20.8% year to date and sits 21% below its December high.Biotechnology ETFs crumbled over the past year, coming under pressure from lackluster earnings as well as negative scrutiny for health care peers Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Mylan (MYL) in a politically charged season.Despite the ""wall of worry"" around this industry group, at least one analyst has a favorable outlook for biotechs after the Nov. 8 presidential elections.Yook points out another promising sign: a pickup in M&A, with mouthwatering sticker prices for target companies. Allergan (AGN) announced in September that it would acquire Vitae Pharmaceuticals (VTAE) for roughly $639 million — a 159% premium per share.Biotechs are attractively priced too. This is one rare corner of the stock market where valuations are cheaper than they have been historically, Yook told IBD in a phone interview.While many ETF investors are waiting to buy biotechnology stocks until after the November election, he believes the fear of a Hillary Clinton presidency is priced in.The Democratic presidential contender's remarks on drug price-gouging had triggered sharp biotech declines.Yook added: ""Most of the political scrutiny will be faced by specialty pharmaceutical companies such as Valeant, Mylan and Horizon (HZNP), which our BioShares funds avoid.

282,GILD,"Celgene (CELG), the No. 3 biotech by market cap, could rival Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Galapagos (GLPS), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB) with a Crohn's disease drug that topped efficacy expectations, the company said Sunday — prompting a boost in shares on Monday.In the stock market today, Celgene stock lifted 1.2% to 99.64, after briefly slipping to a three-month low below 98. Shares are down 18% this year. RBC analyst Michael Yee says politics are tamping down biotech stocks.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs were the worst-performing group last Wednesday, as Supernus Pharmaceuticals and Prothena stocks toppled. Keep tabs on Industry Themes for your best stock bets.But Yee is bullish on GED-0301, Celgene's drug to combat Crohn's. In a recent study of 52 patients, GED-0301 showed improvements in CDAI (Crohn's disease activity index) and in SES-CD (simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease).Wall Street's eyes were more tuned to the latter. By week 12 of the trial, 37% of patients showed at least a 25% reduction in SES-CS, which would be a clinically meaningful endoscopic improvement, says Yee. By the CDAI metric, 67% showed a response and 48% were in remission by week 12.""This 37% is good and higher than expected, as our doctor expert said before the data that 25% of patients achieving this would be good, particularly as a convenient oral drug,"" Yee wrote in a research report Monday.Gilead's and Galapagos' filgotinib is in Phase 3 testing. Phase 2 didn't look at the SES-CD endpoint, so it can't be compared with Celgene's GED-0301, Yee wrote. J&J's Stelara showed the same improvement in 48% of patients at week eight, but that study included a placebo.Biogen also has MT-1301, a drug to treat inflammatory bowel disorder, going into Phase 3 testing. Crohn's as well as ulcerative colitis are both major categories of inflammatory bowel disorder.Yee models GED-0301 adding $1 billion to $2 billion in sales over time for Celgene, as the world moves to pills to treat Crohn's. J&J's Stelara is an injection.""We believe Celgene's promising early endoscopic improvements will get better over time and GED-0301 could be the Otezla of Crohn's disease — meaning even if not the most potent drug, it can still be a $1 billion-plus drug for Celgene if well tolerated, good safety, convenient, and good efficacy,"" he wrote.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young models $2.3 billion in peak sales for GED-0301. She has a 140 price target and outperform rating on Celgene stock. The next catalyst for Celgene stock will likely be when the firm presents 52-week data in 2017, Young said.""This will provide important clues around sustainability of mucosal healing,"" she wrote in her research report. ""Though seeing effects early is positive.""Some have suggested mucosal healing should be a therapeutic endpoint of testing for Crohn's drugs. Mucosal healing, or endoscopic remission, is associated with increased rates of clinical remission, according to the National Library of Medicine.RELATED:Celgene Among Biotechs That Could Top 'Wall Of Worry'Trio Of New Celegene Drugs Could Bring $3 Billion-Plus

284,GILD,"Growth-stock funds have outperformed their blend and value counterparts in the past 10 years. But the reverse is true for this year, with the average value fund up nearly 8%, the average blend fund up nearly 6% and the average growth fund up 3%.Among the growth funds that have kept pace with value funds this year is Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX). The large-cap growth fund is up 12% this year. Its recent top holdings include Applied Materials (AMAT), up 56% this year, Qualcomm (QCOM) up 43% and Micron Technology (MU) up 24%.Holdings that haven't done as well include Gilead Sciences (GILD), down 24% this year, and generic-drug maker Perrigo (PRGO) down 37%.The $1.9 billion fund has been managed by Jerome Dodson since 2005.The fund seeks to buy high-quality companies that it can hold long-term. It seeks to keep about 30 companies in its portfolio, giving significant weightings to most. It has a turnover rate of 63%.Parnassus Endeavor has an environmental, social and governance (ESG) component, as holdings must offer outstanding workplaces and not be involved with oil and other fossil fuels.In his fund commentary for Q3, written in early October, Dodson said the market looked fairly valued. A decline in the number of attractive stocks helps explain why cash in the fund had built up to over 15%, way above average for stock funds. It's also way above his goal for 5% cash.""Although I would like to put some of the cash to work, I won't invest just for the sake of reducing our cash position,"" he said. ""There has to be a good idea to inspire an investment, and that means a good company trading at a very attractive price. This strategy has served us well over the years, as evidenced by our strong returns, so I'm not tempted to change our policy and lower the fund's standards just to reduce our cash balance.""Strong inflow to the fund from investors attracted by its strong performance has contributed to the cash build. Dodson encourages investors stay the course. ""Keep those investments coming in! At some point, I'll figure out what to do with the money,"" he said.Dodson professed a lack of deep concern for the likely path for interest rates.""While the immediate reaction to an interest-rate increase will probably be a drop in the stock market, longer‐term, a gradual and reasonable increase in rates will probably not depress the market for very long,"" he said in his commentary.""Rising interest rates usually mean the economy is doing better, so corporations are doing better and stocks find a way to move higher,"" he continued. ""If interest rates move higher late this year or early next year, the initial reaction may be a stock market swoon. If this happens, and stocks go down to more attractive valuations, it may provide us with an opportunity to put some of that idle cash to work.""RELATED:Parnassus' Dodson Wins With Hot Tech Stocks That Pass ESG ScreensThis Is What Fidelity Trend Likes About Apple, Amazon And AlphabetWhy A Top Columbia Fund Likes These Stock LeadersChinese, Other Foreign Stocks Drove Top Q3 Mutual Fund Performance

286,GILD,"Big biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) beat Q2 earnings estimates but lowered its full-year revenue guidance late Monday, sending the stock down more than 3% in after-hours trading.Gilead's sales and earnings both declined from last year, but hepatitis C drug Sovaldi outperformed expectations, while its newer cousin Harvoni came up short. Epclusa, the next-generation HCV pill that was approved in the U.S. just two days before the end of the quarter, already brought in $64 million.Gilead priced Epclusa much lower than its previous drugs, reflecting new competition from AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK). While Sovaldi and Harvoni officially retain their higher price tags, Gilead has been rebating them heavily, and it said Monday that the rebates have continued to increase.The HIV franchise was also a mixed bag, with the perennially popular Truvada beating estimates though most other drugs underperformed.The company trimmed its full-year product sales guidance by $500 million, now $29.5 billion to $30.5 billion.It also lowered its guidance for sales, general and administrative expenses while raising its research and development guidance slightly, leaving overall costs looking more or less the same. Gilead does not provide EPS guidance, but the lower sales suggests a possible margin squeeze.Gilead stock rose 2.3% in Monday's regular session, to 88.55, but shares are down 12% this year.

287,GILD,"This week's top insider sales were led by the chief executives of Amazon (AMZN), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Gilead Sciences (GILD). Meanwhile, top brass at Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) purchased shares amid the industry's recent sell-off. Bank of America (BAC) also got in on the action ahead of Friday's bullish jobs report.Chief Executive Jeff Bezos disclosed on Thursday the sale of 1 million shares for a total transaction value of $756.7 million, a week after the company's view-topping second-quarter earnings report. Bezos also shed 1 million shares the week after Amazon's first-quarter report.The e-commerce giant has been on a big run, gaining 27% since breaking out of a cup-with-handle base shortly before its first-quarter earnings report in April. Amazon shares finished Friday up 0.7% to 765.98, just below their all-time high of 770.50 set on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon earns a high IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of 99 based on top-notch fundamental and technical factors including earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance. For all the details, take a look at IBD Stock Checkup.The defense contractor's CEO, Wesley Bush, disclosed on Friday the sale of 35,000 shares for a transaction valued at $7.65 million.Northrop reported estimate-beating quarterly results last week, but a drop in technology service sales impacted its profit margin and weighed on shares.Still, the stock has been able to find support at its 50-day line. It ended Friday trading at 218.95, a penny ahead of its buy point. Northrop is also trading just 2% below a recent high.CEO John Milligan on Monday disclosed a sale and options exercise of 70,000 shares for $4.97 million.Last week, Gilead gapped down to breach its 50-day moving average after reporting its first quarterly sales and earnings decline in years.

Certainly the fact that the Q2 earnings season has so far been good, especially compared with lowered expectations at the start of the year.Big caps Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG) and Amgen (AMGN) have already beaten expectations and raised guidance, while Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) affirmed its guidance but still rose after a good quarter. This more than made up for Gilead Sciences' (GILD) guidance cut.Biogen was also boosted Monday by unexpected good news on the drug-development front.Biogen stock was up 4.1%, to 301.83 at the close on the stock market today, at a seven-month high. The Biomedical/Biotech group finished the day up 1.2%, at a nearly two-month high.Still, there may be larger factors at work. Over the weekend RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee released a video theorizing that the political fears that led to last year's crash, sparked by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's tweeted threat to do something about high drug prices, have largely been priced into the stocks by now. It helped that both the Republican and Democratic presidential conventions have gone by with barely a word said about drug pricing, so investors might be thinking it won't be such a big deal, Yee added.Yee also noted that medical device stocks have been performing well this year, and it's unusual for a huge gap between device and drug stocks to be sustained. Indeed, the Medical Products group ranks No. 25 and has moved up after a round of good earnings reports last week.IBD's TAKE: Abiomed was among the Medical Products earnings-beaters that week. It's trading near record highs, is in a buy zone and sports a coveted spot on IBD Swing Trader, which identifies stocks with the fundamentals and technicals to product short-term gains.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges also noted the gap between biotech and device valuations in a detailed analysis last week.""Compared to medtech and pharma, biotech is trading at a discount on a growth-adjusted basis; the price of growth in biotech is 20-25% below the price of other medical products sectors,"" Porges wrote in his report. ""The growth outlook for large cap biotech (ex-Gilead), is 40% better than pharma, and 20-25% better than medtech, but biotech stocks trade at only marginally greater multiples than pharma stocks.""Porges says there might be a parallel between the recent panic and December 2012, when biotech stocks declined for a few weeks as investors worried that growth could not be sustained.""By December 2012, growth expectations for 2013 had fallen from +23% to +9%,"" Porges wrote. ""However, in 2013 the sector's aggregate net income grew by +14% year-over-year.... We also note that after the sector grew net income +24% in 2015, future growth expectations have steadily declined since June 2015 down to +17% year-over-year for 2015 and 2016.""We believe these downward estimate revisions are not fully driven by fundamentals, but include political fears and currency effects, and expect growth to recover into the back half of the 2016 as the impact of pricing power and volume demand is realized in profit growth.""Still, it's worth noting that we've been here before. On Monday, the collective value of the biotech group was hovering around 2500, which has been something of a ceiling this year: The group bumped against it twice in April and again in early June before heading south again.

289,GILD,"Big biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) hit a two-month high Monday after two analysts delivered bullish outlooks for the company.On Sunday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee lifted his Q1 EPS estimates due to a stock buyback and noted several recent pieces of ""incremental"" good news. For one, he cited late Friday the successful patent suit brought by Merck (MRK) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), which had resulted in a somewhat lower damages award ($200 million) than Wall Street had expected.He also noted that weekly prescription data from IMS Health (IMS) suggest Gilead's hepatitis C drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, were holding up reasonably well in the face of competition from Merck's Zepatier, which launched in late January. This point was made more emphatically Monday in a research note by Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges, who called Merck a ""pretender to the HCV (hepatitis C  virus) throne."" Porges noted that a survey of top payer plans backed this up.""Seven weeks after the launch of Zepatier, Sovaldi and Harvoni retain a relatively favorable position in 65% of the top 20 largest commercial plans and 70% of the top 10 largest government plans relative to AbbVie's (ABBV) Viekira Pak (20%, 30%, respectively) and Zepatier (0%, 10%),"" Porges wrote. ""Further, in the top 20 Medicare plans, while Harvoni is covered by 100% of plans, 85% of plans do not cover Viekira Pak, and none cover Zepatier.""Porges affirmed his outperform rating on Gilead stock, with a price target of 127.In midday trading on the stock market today, Gilead stock was up more than 2%, near 93, and earlier rose above 94. The stock has climbed about 14% from the 20-month low it hit on Feb. 2, but still has a weak IBD Relative Strength Rating of 29, meaning the stock's performed in the lowest 29% of all stocks the past 12 months, with an emphasis on the most recent six months.Merck stock was down a fraction midday Monday.

290,GILD,"Biotech stocks of virtually all stripes and colors moved higher Monday, rising 2% as a group amid quiet market action. But was it a moment for the CAN SLIM-driven investor to make a move into the beaten-up group? A study of the chart action among the top names in terms of fundamentals, trading liquidity and market cap produces a quick answer:…
"
291,GILD,"Big biotechs Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB) both fell Wednesday after receiving unfavorable patent news.Late Tuesday, Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) said that it and its big pharma partner Merck (MRK) had won a case alleging that Gilead's hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug sofosbuvir, which is sold individually as Sovaldi and as an ingredient in Harvoni, infringed on patents that Ionis and Merck had obtained from earlier research.""We used our expertise in a 1998 collaboration with Merck to discover and develop modified nucleosides that benefit patients with HCV,"" said Ionis CEO Stanley Crooke in the press release.The case goes back to 2013, when sofosbuvir was on the verge of FDA approval and Merck sought a 10% royalty on sales from Gilead. Gilead sought a judgment invalidating the patents, though it conceded that it had infringed them. The case went to a jury, which ruled Tuesday that the patents were in fact valid.There was no word on damages, though Ionis said that it's entitled to 20% of the damages. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said that the awards won't be huge and that more litigating would delay them.""We continue to expect that any damages awarded in this case will be relatively modest, the equivalent of a single-digit royalty, significantly less than the 10% Merck was seeking,"" Porges wrote in a research note. ""In spite of whatever damages the jury awards Merck, Gilead has already indicated that it will appeal.""Ionis stock popped to an eight-week high of 46.05 early on the stock market today, but by the end of the session shares had fallen 4.7%, to 39.80. Gilead stock fell 3.9% to 90.08, while Merck was flat, at 53.08.Biogen stock, meanwhile, fell 1.6% to 255.24, after the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) reversed an earlier decision and decided to review a patent on Biogen's top-selling drug, Tecfidera. Hedge-fund manager Kyle Bass filed the request for a review; last year, he launched an unusual short-selling strategy by filing such requests on a number of blockbuster drugs, which he said had ""BS patents.""The USPTO initially denied his request in September, but on Tuesday it changed its tune. Coincidentally or not, European Union authorities earlier this month invalidated the European equivalent of the same patent, which expires in 2028. In addition, Forward Pharma (FWP) is separately challenging the patent; its stock rose 2.3% Wednesday, to 16.80.""Today's decision is just a first step in the (review) process, and nothing happens yet in the USA, and as of today Tecfidera still enjoys 10-year exclusivity in EU (would protect it to 2024 in EU),"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a research note. ""Even though the ... patent expires in February 2028, consensus did not assume this would get full protection and already assumed/expected generics to launch at some point.""
"
292,GILD,"IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group dropped 8% over the past three weeks, but RBC analyst Michael Yee expects stocks to rally, despite lackluster Q3 earnings, after the election season wraps.The sector still has nearly four weeks of ""choppiness"" before the Nov. 8 election, and recent blowouts have had some investors taking profits. But Yee suggested in a recent video to buy on the dip, as biotechs climb the ""wall of worry.""""Because of Q3 earnings not being hugely great for biotechs, and a combination of uncertainty in the election, I understand we could trade choppy in the (SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI)) until we get some clarity on the election,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs were the worst-performing group Wednesday, and IBD tracks 197 groups. But last month, biotechs were on a major roll. Keep tabs on the Industry Theme for which sectors should grab your attention.Like, the 421-company group, shares of the SPDR Biotech ETF have plunged dramatically this month, down 10% over the past three weeks. On Thursday, shares were flat at 61.32, 6% from an entry point at 65.05 out of a flat base.Of the biggest biotech players, Yee is most confident on Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB), respectively, Nos. 1 and 4 in market cap. In the stock market today, Amgen and Biogen both rose a fraction, to 164.29 and 294.41, respectively.The consensus of 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Amgen to report $5.73 billion in sales and $2.80 earnings per share ex items, flat and up 3%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Analysts model Biogen reporting $2.9 billion in sales, up 5%, and $4.97 EPS ex items, up 11%.Biogen is a stock to own over the next three to six months, Yee says. There's a 30% chance Biogen will get taken over, as it still lacks a CEO after the company announced in July, amid M&A rumors, that George Scangos would step down. Yee also sees a 30%-40% chance Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alzheimer's drug trial could yield positive results, which could tug rival Biogen up 20%.Other catalysts include Biogen's partnership with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) for drugs to treat type 1 muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Ionis is enrolling infants and children in Phase 3 trials for SMA. Wall Street underappreciates those catalysts, Yee says.Celgene (CELG), too, has a number of trials that could stoke the stock, Yee says. For Q3, analysts model a 22% jump in sales to $2.84 billion and $1.48 EPS ex items, up 20%. Celgene share are down 8.5% since Sept. 23, rising a small fraction Thursday, to 100.63.Yee only expects an in-line quarter. Early next year, Celgene is expected to release the results of trials for drugs to treat muscular dystrophy, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis — which are likely stock catalysts.Gilead (GILD), the No. 2 biotech by market cap, is in for a rough quarter on shadowy visibility for its hepatitis C drug, Yee says. The drug, Epclusa, won FDA approval in June and can be used in pill form to treat six types of hep C. But lacking greater visibility, Gilead stock is range-bound, Yee says.Consensus expectations are too high for hep C sales and EPS in 2016, he wrote in a research report. For 2016, the consensus of 26 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models $11.79 EPS ex items. Yee's estimate is $10.Broadly, analysts are bearish on Gilead's Q3, forecasting a 9% sales dip to $7.53 billion and EPS minus items down 10%, to $2.89. Shares are down 10% over the past three weeks, ending Thursday near flat, at 73.06.Smaller Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) (with a $3.55 billion market cap) will likely print an across-the-board beat for Q3, Yee predicts. But shares have been pressured recently by Gilead, Novartis (NVS) and Allergan (AGN) which are jumping on the NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) train.NASH drugs have made big headlines over the past month with Allergan buying Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA) to bulk-up in the NASH battle. But, says Yee, Intercept's drug, which belongs to a class called FXR agonists, is more potent.""Intercept's drug gets into the liver an activates FXR (farnesoid X receptors) in the liver,"" he said. ""The others don't get as much FXR effectivity in the liver; they just do it in the gut. It's not as potent as Intercept.""Yee also calls Prothena (PRTA) one to own on likely positive Parkinson's drug and psoriasis drug data in Q4 and the spring, respectively. Prothena stock was in a sell zone Thursday, 16% below a 65.05 entry point achieved Sept. 19, after rising nearly 1% Thursday to 54.85.RELATED:What Will Gilead Try Buying Next?

293,GILD,"Biotech stocks dragged down an overall flat stock market on Wednesday, with Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) and Prothena (PRTA) among the worst performers among the larger biotechnology companies.IBD's 420-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech group was last among 197 groups tracked, falling 3% in the stock market today and piercing the key 50-day-moving-average support line for the first time since early July. The group still ranks No. 9, up from No. 126 just 13 weeks ago.IBD'S TAKE: Sectors can be volatile, and just last month biotech was a riser. Want to get a feel for some of the top groups? Then keep tabs on IBD's in-depth Industry Snapshot feature.No major news event shook the sector, but instead stocks are reacting to the ever-shifting political winds, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee told IBD via email.Yee says sentiment is rising that the Republican Party could lose its majority in the U.S. Senate and even the House, which he said could have a big impact on any number of health care bills as issues such as high drug prices continue to roil the industry. IBD's Medical-Generic Drugs group of 19 companies was the fourth-worst performer Wednesday, down 1.5% and coming right up against its 50-day line.On Wednesday, Prothena — along with Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (RARE), Acceleron (XLRN) and Fibrogen (FGEN) -- were among the larger biotechs falling below their 50-day lines for the first time in at least a month. Supernus fell below its 50-day line on Tuesday, despite releasing seemingly solid data on a trial for its ADHD drug.The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) ETF, the largest biotech ETF, fell 2.5% Wednesday and is down nearly 5% this week.Acceleron stock crashed 8.8% Wednesday, while Ultragenyx, Supernus, Prothena, Fibrogen and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) all tumbled 6.4% to 7.3%. Gilead Sciences (GILD), one of the largest biotechs, fell 1.1% to 73.03, touching a 30-month low for the fourth day in the past five trading days.RELATED:Supernus Reverses Downward Despite Good ADHD Drug Trial Allergan Challenges Intercept In NASHMylan Jumps As DOJ Settlement Eases 'Lingering Concerns'
"
294,GILD,"Allergan (AGN) is taking on Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) with its acquisition of Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA), but Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler likes the deal, saying a key Tobira drug has ""a solid chance of approval.""Tobira's cenicriviroc (CVC), a drug to battle nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, failed to meet its primary endpoint in a two-year study ended in July. The drug, however, did show efficacy in improving fibrosis without worsening NASH.Regulatory endpoints on NASH drugs continue to change, Koffler wrote in a research report. Last year, the FDA outlined two surrogate endpoints: an improvement in fibrosis without a worsening in NASH or complete resolution of steatohepatitis without a worsening in fibrosis.Genfit and Intercept are using surrogate endpoints with interim analysis after weeks 52 to 72. If Allergan follows that path after the Tobira acquisition is final, expected late this year, it's likely CVC will get the FDA nod, Koffler wrote.Koffler trimmed her price target Tuesday on Allergan stock to 299 from 305, based on R&D expenses and expected buybacks. Allergan has been on a buying spree recently, agreeing to acquire Vitae Pharmaceuticals and Akarna Pharmaceuticals, in addition to Tobira.In midday trading on the stock market today, Allergan stock fell 1.9% to close at 237.95, and continues to trade below its 50-day line.Koffler expects a sweeping beat when Allergan reports its Q3 earnings. A date hasn't yet been scheduled. For Q3, Koffler predicts $3.78 billion in sales, down 10% vs. Q3 2015, and $3.72 earnings per share ex items, up 9%.The analyst consensus models $3.79 billion in sales and $3.63 EPS ex items, according to Thomson Reuters.Koffler kept her buy rating on Allergan stock. But she also lowered her 2020 sales expectations for Restasis, Allergan's dry-eye drug, following an impressive launch from rival Shire (SHPG) with its Xiidra. For 2020, she sees $1.36 billion in sales vs. earlier calls for $1.58 billion.She also gave her Viberzi forecast a haircut, down to $495 million from $621 million.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan isn't the only drugmaker battling it out against rivals. Bristol-Myers Squibb stock toppled to a two-year low Monday on positive phase-three trial news from competitor Merck.

"
295,GILD,"Incyte (INCY) is a prime M&A candidate, RBC analyst Simos Simeonidis said Friday after the drugmaker revealed ""deep and durable"" results for a med that aims to treat advanced and metastatic melanoma.""We view Incyte as a throwback to what biotech companies were originally meant to be,"" Simeonidis wrote in a research report, ""companies built on great science, which managed to develop multiple drugs while reinvesting heavily in their own R&D engine.""But he doesn't offer a guess at which companies might take a crack at buying Incyte. A poll by Evercore ISI investment bank last month identified Gilead (GILD) as a likely buyer for Incyte.Early Friday, Incyte revealed the results of its epacadostat combination with Merck's (MRK) pembrolizumab. The combination faces off with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) nivolumab (Opdivo) in combination with ipilimumab (Yervoy).Incyte-Merck didn't reach progression-free survival, or PFS, during three months of follow-up after the March 28 data cutoff. BMS-Opdivo's combination has a median PFS of 11.5 months, Simeonidis wrote.""This increases our confidence that the combination of Epacadostat plus Pembrolizumab will end up with a median PFS that will be superior to the Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab combination,"" he wrote.Simeonidis also noted that 83% (5 out of 6) patients receiving the combination of drugs from Incyte and Merck responded to treatment. He has an outperform rating on Incyte stock, which rose 3.2% to 97.83 on the stock market today. Incyte broke out at a 92.92 buy point on Sept. 28, so is within buy range, though caution is advised during a volatile time for the market.Merck stock rose 0.2% to 62.77 on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: This isn't the first time Incyte has appeared on an analyst's M&A hot list.

"
296,GILD,"Several big-cap drugmakers reported solid Q2 earnings Thursday morning, continuing what's been a fairly positive earnings season for the medical industry.Celgene (CELG) ended trading up 2.9% to 111.26 on the stock market today after it narrowly beat analysts' Q2 estimates on both the top and bottom lines and raised its full-year guidance.Notably, it raised sales guidance for its lead drug Revlimid even though the blood-cancer treatment narrowly missed analysts' estimate for the quarter. Most of Celgene's other drugs more than made up the difference.Celgene expects roughly 19% sales growth and 21% earnings growth this year, in line with its growth rates the last three years.Celgene stock took a modest hit Tuesday after the company decided not to pursue a label expansion for Revlimid following mixed trial results in lymphoma. It bounced back quickly, though, and was up nearly 2.5% Thursday afternoon, near 111.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) also delivered a modest beat-and-raise, but its stock fell. This might be because much of the quarterly beat came from its hepatitis C drug Daklinza, which is threatened with obsolescence now that Gilead Sciences (GILD) has released its pan-genotypic hep C pill Epclusa. Daklinza is used to treat the minority genotype 3, usually in combination with Gilead's Sovaldi, which also outperformed in Q2.Sales of Bristol-Myers' fast-growing cancer drug Opdivo slightly beat expectations worldwide, rising sevenfold over the year-earlier quarter to $840 million, though it was a bit light in the U.S. Yervoy, which Bristol is hoping to combine with Opdivo to make the standard of care in lung cancer, was also a bit short of expectations.Bristol-Myers stock finished the regular session down 2.4% to 74.66.IBD'S TAKE: Bristol-Myers' 4% earnings growth in Q2 wasn't much, but that's expected to accelerate, and the company is guiding 29% growth for the full year. That's a positive sign, as IBD's CAN SLIM system looks for at least 25% annual earnings growth, preferably accelerating.Rare-disease biotech Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) closed out Thursday trades up fractionally to 130.40, even though its profit technically missed consensus. But that was apparently due to the SEC's recent changes in non-GAAP reporting requirements.""The non-GAAP EPS miss was due to the modification of the definition of non-GAAP income tax ... which resulted in 12-cent-per-share reduction,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Simos Simeonidis in a research note. ""Importantly, this adjustment has no impact on the amount of income tax the company will pay and on its cash flow.""With the 12 cents added back in, Alexion's Q2 would have beat consensus, although it would still have been a slight year-over-year decline, as the company has invested in new drug launches. However, revenue rose 18%, topping Wall Street's number.Alexion affirmed its previous full-year guidance.

297,GILD,"Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) won several price target hikes Friday after strong quarterly results, while Ford (F) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) were downgraded.Jefferies hiked its Amazon price target to 950 from 865, Oppenheimer to 941 from 930, Macquarie Securities to 875 from 860, and UBS to 900 from 785. Pacific Crest Securities, SunTrust Robinson Humphry, CLSA and Mizuho Securities also raised their targets on Amazon.The e-commerce giant's Q2 earnings and sales topped views late Thursday, but Q3 guidance on operating income was below expectations.""Only two things matter: Prime and Amazon Web Services, both of which are dominating,"" said Ben Schachter, a Macquarie analyst, in a report. ""Amazon is expanding margins, even as it invests in fulfillment, video, India, AWS capacity, and emerging businesses.""Amazon shares ended trading up 0.9% to 759.28, hitting a record 766 intraday.Jefferies hiked its price target to 1,000 from 925, Macquarie Securities to 975 from 890, Oppenheimer to 970 from 958, Credit Suisse to 940 from 920, and UBS to 925 from 880. Citigroup, Mizuho, Stifel, Axiom, Goldman Sachs, Pacific Crest Securities, and MoffettNathanson also hiked their targets.""U.S. quarterly growth of 25% was the strongest rate in five years, and along with Facebook's (FB) results, dispels the notion that digital dollars were decelerating,"" wrote Michael Nathanson, analyst at MoffettNathanson. ""The digital advertising world now is essentially a duopoly between Facebook and Google.""Alphabet shares touched the 800 mark Friday before retreating to 791.34, a gain of 3.3%.Goldman Sachs downgraded Ford to neutral from buy after the automaker missed earnings views as an increasing reliance on higher incentives hit margins. It also signaled sales have stalled. Citigroup lowered its target on Ford to 13 from 15.Shares dipped 0.4% to 12.66 after plunging 8% to 12.71 Thursday.Argus Research downgraded Gilead Sciences to hold from buy. Needham had downgraded the biotechnology company to hold on July 26. On Monday, Gilead reported weaker hepatitis C drug sales and lowered guidance.Shares were off 2.3% to 79.41.In other analyst moves, RBC Capital upgraded Oshkosh (OSK) to outperform from neutral, UBS downgraded Deere & Co. (DE) to neutral from buy, RBC Capital and Wells Fargo each downgraded Harley-Davidson (HOG) to sector-perform from outperform, and Oppenheimer raised its price target on Comcast (CMCSA) to 74 from 70.
"
298,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD), Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and Texas Instruments (TXN) report quarterly results after the close Monday.Estimates: Analysts expect Gilead, the maker of hepatitis drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni and the HIV drug Truvada, to report second-quarter earnings per share down 4% to $3.02, with sales falling 6% to $7.768 billion.Results: Gilead earned $3.08 a share excluding items. Revenue was $7.776 billion. Both topped views but it was the first quarterly sales and earnings decline in years. Gilead's hepatitis C businesses has slowed, but the company has put more focus on potentially treating hepatitis B.HCV drug sales were $4 billion vs. $4.9 billion a year earlier. Gilead blamed weaker Harvoni sales. HIV and other antiviral drug sales rose to $3.1 billion from $2.7 billion. Gilead cut full-year net product sales forecasts.Gilead is the first of 5 big drugmakers reporting this week.Shares fell 4% in after-hours trading. Gilead closed up 2.3% to 83.55 in the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: The iShares biotech ETF IBB is close to breaking a downturn. It's meeting resistance near 286-288. Getting above those levels would also push IBB over its 200-day moving average for the first time in 10 months.Estimates: Wall Street expects the casino operator's second-quarter EPS to slip 7% to 56 cents, with revenue falling 6% to $2.756 billion.Results: Las Vegas Sands earned 52 cents a share adjusted. Revenue was $2.65 billion.Las Vegas Sands, like rivals MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN), has struggled in the Macau region, a global casino hub in China that has been hurt by a weaker economy and a crackdown on money laundering and other corruption. MGM will report earnings on Aug. 4.""The operating environment in Macao remained challenging during the quarter; but we do see signs of stabilization, particularly in the mass market,"" Las Vegas Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson said in a statement. He expects strong June activity to continue.Las Vegas Sands rose more than 4% in after-hours action, despite missing EPS and revenue views, on those Macau ""stabilization"" signs. Sands stock climbed 1% to 47.80 at the close.MGM Resorts and Wynn Resorts also rose late after climbing during the regular session.Estimates: Second-quarter EPS of 72 cents, up 10%, on revenue of $3.2 billion, down around 1%.Results: Texas Instruments earned 76 cents a share on revenue of $3.273 billion.TI sees Q3 EPS of 81-91 cents on revenue of $3.34 billion-$3.62 billion. Analysts have expected 81 cents and sales of $3.38 billion.Texas Instruments cited strong demand for chips used in cars.Shares rose 5.5% in after-hours action. TI closed 1.1% higher at 66.22, hitting a fresh all-time high.

299,GILD,"The two largest biotechnology ETFs are poised at a critical juncture in their troubled growth story. It may be too early to call a reversal in fortune, but they're certainly stock investment ideas once again.SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) on Thursday broke out of a first-stage base, climbing to its highest level since early June as industry giant Biogen (BIIB) trounced analyst estimates for profit and sales growth. The stock jumped 8% in heavy trading volume after reporting global growth from its multiple sclerosis and hemophilia businesses.The largest biotech fund, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB), could follow in XBI's footsteps this week by retaking its 200-day moving average. If it does so, and both ETFs manage to hold above that critical line of strength, it could suggest that investors are rekindling their love affair with biotech.Earnings this week will play a part in the success or failure of that attempt. Industry heavyweight Gilead Sciences (GILD) reports Monday, Edwards Lifesciences (EW) on Tuesday and Amgen (AMGN) on Wednesday. Celgene (CELG) steps up Friday.The SPDR biotech exchange traded fund is mired 31% below the price that investors were willing to pay for it a year ago. But it has rebounded 11% in the past month, outpacing virtually all other segments of the U.S. stock market.Jeffrey Loo, an equity analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence, considers the biotechnology subindustry attractively priced after a sharp sell-off. That, coupled with Biogen's solid report, may be behind the recent rally, he suggested.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech exchange traded funds offer diversified exposure to a high-risk, high-reward industry, lowering single-stock risk. But fund investors should get to know the individual companies they own. To learn which stock is top rated in the biotechnology group, check out IBD Leaderboard.In a March report, Loo wrote that the biotech industry would sustain healthy growth over the next several years. Breakthrough drugs like Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni for hepatitis C are helping to drive sales. Loo also has a positive outlook on an issue of key interest to investors:""The industry pipeline is also solid as several drugs have blockbuster sales potential,"" he wrote.One potential headwind in the coming months: the November elections. In an email to IBD, Loo noted that ""the scrutiny over high drug prices"" since the fall of 2015 had weighed heavily on biotechnology companies. Now Hillary Clinton, whose tweet on ""price gouging"" triggered that scrutiny, is poised to become the official Democratic candidate for next president of the United States.IBB has seen assets shrink this year to $7.10 billion despite a net inflow of $357.7 million over the first six months of 2016. The fund holds 187 stocks and skews toward large caps such as Amgen and Celgene, as well as Gilead and Biogen.XBI has also seen assets diminish in 2016, to $2.14 billion. It has taken in $164.6 million in new investor money over the first half of this year. It offers more exposure to smaller-cap names than IBB, as well as a lower expense ratio.Their performance is neck-and-neck over longer periods of time.

300,GILD,"In an era when more than 80% of the active managers fail to beat their benchmark index, finding a mutual fund that consistently achieves the elusive element of alpha is akin to finding the Holy Grail.USAA Growth Fund (USAAX) is one of those funds. This portfolio of large-cap growth stocks has beaten its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. year to date, as well as in the past one, three, five and 10 years. And it has beaten the S&P 500 stock index in the past one, three, five and 10 years. In 2015, it returned 5.63% vs. the S&P's 1.38%.Lately much of its outperformance has been driven by such stock market leaders as Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alibaba (BABA).The portfolio managers are Michael Schroer of Renaissance Investment Management and Aziz Hamzaogullari of Loomis Sayles. They each separately manage half the portfolio. Schroer has been with the fund since 1991 and Hamzaogullari since 2010.The fund's strategy is to look for high-quality companies that can generate sustainable and profitable growth. When the managers see stocks selling at a significant discount to their estimate of intrinsic value, they snap them up. This leads to a small portfolio of just 92 companies. The fund also has a very long-term investment horizon, seen in its 31% portfolio turnover rate.Still, even a fund that consistently outperforms has moments when it doesn't. So far this year, it's underperforming the S&P 500 5.90% to 6.61%.""We favor companies that are high quality growth selling at a reasonable valuation,"" said Schroer. ""In the first half of the year lower P/E growth didn't do well. Higher P/E companies led the market, but by the later part of the year that reversed and lower P/E companies are doing better and we've benefited from that. We're in the sweet spot for the market where lower P/E, higher quality are doing better.""Another part of the strategy, this one favored by the Loomis Sayles team, is described as high ""active share."" Active share is a way of measuring how much a portfolio differs from its benchmark index. ""Our active share has been at or above 80%,"" Hamzaogullari told IBD late last year. ""While it does not ensure outperformance, we believe it is a necessary condition for generating alpha and outperforming the benchmark, net of fees, over the long term.""U.S. stocks make up 90% of the fund, with the rest in foreign equities. Technology makes up 27% of the portfolio.Amazon as of July 31 stood as USAA Growth's largest holding, at about 4% of assets. The stock made up the entire retail-internet segment of the fund. Amazon is up 21% this year, sitting just above support at its 50-day moving average after pulling back 3% from its all time high set Oct. 6. Analysts expect Amazon to post Q3 earnings 371% higher than a year earlier when it reports results Thursday.Facebook is the No. 2 holding also at about 4% of assets. The social networking and media leader is up 24% year to date near the 28.43 buy point of a flat base. Fiscal Q1 earnings are expected to rise 70% from a year earlier when results are reported, expected Nov. 2 after the market's close.Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giants and another top fund holding, is up 28% so far this year. The stock has found support at its 50-day moving average, 6% below its 52-week high. The company is expect to show a fiscal Q2 earnings increase of 23% when it reports Tuesday.Not all USAA Growth top holdings have been barn burners. Database bellwether Oracle (ORCL) is up 5% this year. It's been in the fund since 2007.The rest of the top 10 holdings and their percentages are: Cisco Systems (CSCO), 3.24%; Visa (V), 3.11%; Qualcomm (QCOM), 2.89%; Monster Beverage (MNST), 2.52%; Alphabet (GOOGL), 2.48%; United Parcel Services (UPS), 2.37%.""We think technology and consumer discretionary look attractive,"" said Schroer. ""Health care still looks attractive. Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) still look very cheap. In this market there are still high quality companies.""Schroer likes Foot Locker (FL). The athletic shoe retailer posted very good second-quarter sales and still trades at a ""very reasonable multiple of 14."" The stock is up only 4.4% this year.""Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) and both are doing well over the last several months,"" said Schroer. ""They had sold off on fears of the Zika virus hurting tourism, but they didn't suffer too much. Now bookings for next year are running high and multiples are very attractive, Royal's trailing P-E is 13 and Carnival's is 14.""We've taken some things off the table, but we still think there are selective opportunities in this market,"" he said. ""We've gone through six quarters of negative earnings growth and we're watching this quarter carefully for signs of a rebound. So far, so good.""RELATED:Why This Top Columbia Fund Loads Up On Facebook And Other Stock LeadersChinese, Other Foreign Stocks Drove Top Q3 Fund PerformersAlibaba Sets Stage For Big Online Shopping Spree

301,GILD,"Mobile chip company Qualcomm (QCOM) had its price target raised, as did disk drive makers Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC), while oilfield services provider Halliburton (HAL) was raised to a buy.RBC Capital Markets raised his price target on Qualcomm to 70 from 59 and maintained an outperform rating. Qualcomm is reportedly in talks to acquire NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) in a bid that values NXP at about $30 billion.""While the NXP transaction is certainly much larger vs. what investors had contemplated,"" wrote RBC analyst Amit Daryanani in a research note, ""we think it offers Qualcomm with several unique assets to further enable diversity away from their 90% mobility exposure.""Qualcomm shares fell 2% to close at 67.11 on the stock market today.Seagate Technology and Western Digital received price target increases at RBC Capital Markets.Western Digital had its price target raised to 65 from 60, with an outperform rating.Western Digital, which closed its acquisition of SanDisk in May, is seeing ""sustained tailwinds"" across and business lines, wrote RBC analyst Daryanani. He said earnings estimates for Western Digital are positioned to keep inflecting higher through the end of 2016.Western Digital stock closed up 0.7% at 58.86.Daryanani raised his price target on Seagate to 40 from 34, with a sector perform rating. He said channel checks on the disk drive market ""imply upside"" to Q3 earnings estimates.""Fundamental trends that enabled strong performance in the June quarter remained intact,"" he wrote.Shares fell 0.4% to 38.41.RBC lowered its price target on Gilead Sciences (GILD) to 95 from 105. RBC analyst Michael Yee wrote that the price target is reasonable and in line with comparable low-growth large-cap drug companies but also reflects the lack of visibility on the long-term trajectory of its hepatitis C vaccine franchise, which is facing ""increasing competitive uncertainties.""Shares fell 1.4% to 78.03, close to two-year lows set last month.Societe Generale upgraded Halliburton to a buy from hold. A bounce in oil prices and rising confidence in forecasts that the industry's supply glut will end heading into 2017 are luring speculative dollars back into U.S. exploration and oilfield services stocks. Analysts project a broad recovery among domestic energy producers in 2017.Shares initially rallied but finished essentially flat at 44.90.

302,GILD,"Eli Lilly (LLY) and AbbVie (ABBV) topped a Credit Suisse evaluation of pharmaceutical companies heading into 2017, leaving more challenged Pfizer (PFE), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) in the dust.But the PharmaValues 2017 list did little for IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group, which fell a fraction on the stock market today, a fifth consecutive down day. The group is down more than 20% this year, touched a three-month low Monday and is trading below its 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech and pharmaceutical stocks have been trampled in the last month. With Q3 earnings reports coming up, can they climb the ""wall of worry?""Credit Suisse ranked 48 Big Pharma stocks on factors like enterprise value/net present value, pricing and replacement powers, and sales growth. Overall, Eli Lilly topped the list, with Europe-based Sanofi (SNY) and Novartis (NVS) trailing closely.AbbVie ranked highest on fundamentals, with investors likely assuming a long life span for Humira, Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a research report. Humira is the brand name for adalimumab, Abbvie's drug to treat arthritis, plaque psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.AbbVie stock, though, slipped a small fraction Monday, while Lilly stock fell nearly 1%.Meanwhile, Pfizer was ""weak across the board,"" AstraZeneca has a high EV/NPV (enterprise value to net present value) and Novo Nordisk is exposed to U.S. pricing pressure.For AstraZeneca, investors are potentially factoring in its oncology pipeline, Credit Suisse says, but ""recent results from others demonstrate significant risk.""Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) scored well in EV/NPV valuation, with most of its sales power driven by its generic division. Gilead Sciences (GILD), Incyte (INCY) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are all trading at a discount with Vertex only needing ""minimal further pipeline success to justify the current valuation,"" the report said.Among biotechs, Vertex topped Credit Suisse's list, with Amgen (AMGN) flailing at the bottom. Like pharmaceuticals, IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, has been down this month. The group fell a fraction Monday and, like the ethical drugs group, also fell for a fifth straight trading day, and fell for the seventh day of the past eight trading days.Though near the bottom overall, AstraZeneca scored well in terms of pricing power with its shift toward oncology products. But Novo Nordisk is in ""the eye"" of the diabetes-rebate storm in the U.S., Credit Suisse said.Pricing power, Credit Suisse analysts note, is important as it helps ""companies to resist discount pressures from formulary managers and governments."" In that regard, Allergan (AGN) is the clear winner, with only Shire (SHPG) rivaling it in the dry-eye market.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), which focuses on rare diseases, is the most exceptional biotech, the analysts said, while Biomarin (BMRN), Incyte and Vertex also get high marks for being unique.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Eli Lilly beat out the cohort on R&D productivity and ability to drive the current pipeline.This follows the dramatic seesaw between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck (MRK) after Bristol-Myers' lung cancer drug, Opdivo, failed to meet a key endpoint. Eli Lilly scored well on its launches of Trulicity for diabetes and Taltz for psoriasis.

303,GILD,"Biotech Gilead (GILD) is most likely to scoop up Incyte (INCY) over the next 12 months, according to a survey of 244 industry watchers by Evercore ISI investment bank, ahead of the presidential election pitting Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.Of those surveyed, 16% say they'd most like to see Gilead purchase Incyte, and 14% identified Incyte as the biopharma most likely to be acquired over the next year. Nearly 12% and 10%, respectively, see Biogen (BIIB) and BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) as targets.Gilead, Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD), Celgene (CELG) and Kite Pharma (KITE) are least likely to be targeted, with only 2% of industry experts identifying each as a likely takeover candidate. That's a departure from Needham's analysis last week identifying 11 potential suitors for Acadia.An Incyte takeover would likely come at a heavy price. As of June 30, Gilead had $24.6 billion in cash, equivalents and market securities on hand. By market cap, Gilead is the No. 2 biotech, trailing only Amgen, but it's widely viewed as among the big biotechs that most needs to be active on the M&A front. Incyte has a $17 billion market capitulation. Smaller coalitions, 10% and 8%, say Gilead could buy Vertex (VRTX) or Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).Outside M&A, the lion's share of experts (52%) expect biotechs to outperform the broader markets over the next six months, whereas 54% of respondents say biopharmas will merely be in line. Both will trade up after the election, say 65% of experts.But IBD's 241-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group is down 16% this year, but those losses were early in the year, when the overall market tumbled. The group is up more than 25% since late June and now ranks No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 160 just 13 weeks ago.At the close on the stock market today, the group was up more than 1.4%, bucking a two-day downtrend.IBD'S TAKE: The latest Industry Snapshot explores biotech M&A and promising new drugs, and which stocks are leading the biotech sector.Drug pricing initiatives could rout stocks this year, an RBC analyst said Thursday. Though he acknowledged drugmakers like Amgen (AMGN), Gilead, Celgene, Biogen, Regeneron (REGN) and Vertex could easily find loopholes to skirt new regulations.Still, fewer than 1% of the people polled by Evercore expect the government to take meaningful action on drug pricing in 2016. Nearly 44% (the largest chunk) say the government won't ever push for a reduction in drug prices.Other predictions stem around specific companies. Only 14% expect Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alzheimer's drug, Solanezumab, to hit cognition and function endpoints. More broadly, 42% say it will hit cognition but miss on function.More than half (51%) say Celgene's Phase 3 testing for GED-0301, an oral mongersen treatment for Crohn's, will fail to reach the overwhelming efficacy seen in Phase 2 testing. During Phase 2, 67% of patients taking 160 milligrams were in clinical remission on day 15.A small 7% say Celgene will see better results in Phase 3 testing. Only 3% expect the study to fail entirely. If the results show endoscopic improvement, 64% of respondents say Celgene stock will pop. A third expect shares to remain stagnant.RELATED:Gilead 'Paralyzed' On Likely Hep C Share LossAmgen, Biogen, Gilead Could Spike VA Pricing To Skirt California MeasureRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Falls As Combo Therapy Worse Than Eylea Alone

305,GILD,"There's something for everyone in the vast universe of sector funds, from consumer staples to health care to technology.When a sector is in favor, those funds can rack up big returns. But they can also be prone to bigger declines, since they're more concentrated in specific areas than a diversified fund.IBD ran a screen of actively managed funds with at least $100 million in assets that have beaten their benchmarks in each of the past one, three, five and 10 years. Two sectors were the clear winner: The five best sector funds ranked by 10-year performance all focus on biotech or health sciences. (See our full list of best sector mutual funds.)To highlight the best mutual funds in the top-performing sectors, the ""best of the best"" list of IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Award winners includes the top fund in each of six sectors.Click Here To View A Table Of Top Performing Mutual Funds By CategoryFidelity Select Biotechnology Portfolio (FBIOX) came out on top with a 10-year average annual return of 16.9%, well ahead of the S&P 500's 7.31%. The fund held $9.7 billion in net assets as of Feb. 29. Its expense ratio is 0.74%. Rajiv Kaul has managed the fund since October 2005.Like most sectors, biotech has seen its fair share of volatility. But that's not necessarily a negative.""In the next five to 10 years, there's going to be a renaissance for the industry in terms of the golden age of innovation,"" Kaul told IBD. ""It's not going to be in a straight line. Biotech is volatile for investors. That's the amazing opportunity that happens.""As of Jan. 31, biotech stocks made up 86% of the portfolio and pharmaceuticals 13%. Fidelity Select Biotech held 277 stocks in all. Top holdings at the end of Q4 included Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG).All five stocks belong to IBD's biotech industry group, which surged more than 800% from a November 2008 low to its July 2015 peak. Turnover in the fund tends to run fairly low, at about 29%.There are high barriers to entry in the biotech field, including expertise, capital and regulatory hurdles, Kaul points out. ""But when you do get a major breakthrough in a medication, you really improve people's lives and help save costs for the health care system.""How does Kaul pick stocks for the fund?""You have to understand the management and what is the track record of success,"" he said. ""We have that kind of historical understanding and depth of understanding of the industry and the individual players. Equally important is the ability of these companies to access capital at a low cost. I want my companies to be self-reliant.""The five top biotech funds all owned big-cap biotech and Soliris maker Alexion in their recently reported quarters. Four of the five funds also held biotechs Celgene and Gilead, which focus on cancer and hepatitis C, respectively.

306,GILD,"The amazing diversity of ETFs allow investors to kill one bird with two stones.Consider iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB), the largest exchange traded fund in its segment. IBB debuted on IBD Leaderboard March 9, making it the first ETF to be added as a short-sale idea. Shorting the ETF would allow investors to profit if its holdings continue to decline.The $6.04 billion exchange traded fund's downward-sloping relative strength line reflects the weakness found in the charts of most major biotechs. Investors can also use ProShares UltraShort Nasdaq Biotech (BIS) to achieve the same goal. It's an ETF leader in the current market with a Relative Strength Rating of 98. That means its recent price performance is in the top two percentile of all stocks and ETFs tracked by IBD.BIS seeks daily investment results that correspond to two times the inverse (-2x) of the daily performance of the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index.An ETF investor might legitimately ask: Is it better to short the largest biotech ETF or to take a long position in its inverse counterpart?The inverse ETF is probably best left alone by all except sophisticated ETF investors and day traders.""If an investor is looking for dollar-for-dollar gain for falling ETF price, then it would be appropriate to short the specific ETF,"" Monish Shah, head of ETF trading at Mizuho Securities, recently told IBD. ""For instance, if you short 1,000 shares of a particular ETF and then the price drops by $1, your unrealized profit would be $1,000. However, the major risk of short selling is that while the profit is capped, risk is unlimited. Because in a short position, the ETF price could rise indefinitely, and this would force the investor to cover at a higher price.""With an inverse ETF, the loss is capped, i.e. the amount you have invested. But inverse ETFs may bring risks or challenges for the average investor.""It is critical to understand that an inverse return on the underlying index is expected to match only on a daily basis,"" Shah added, ""but over a longer term, a significant disconnect will likely arise between the return on an inverse ETF and the return on its underlying index due to the compounding effect.""Both types of investing strategies have the potential to amp up your portfolio returns in a restrained investing climate. However, they require more molly-coddling to ensure any losses don't run away from you. That will be key to successful investing.How's the overall picture for IBB and other biotech ETFs?The major holdings of IBB include Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD).""While those stocks are in deep corrections, the industry fundamentals aren't so bad,"" according to the IBD markets team. ""The heath care sector has the best EPS and sales growth estimates for 2016, and analyst revisions in biotech are the best for any part of the sector. Drug pipelines remain well-stocked. Plus, licensing deals remain hot. But no question, sales growth has slowed sharply from a 2014 peak.""IBB was falling 3% on the stock market today, while BIS added 6% intraday.Year to date, IBB plunged 23% through March 14. It saw $295.3 million in net outflow over the first two months of the year.By comparison, BIS is up 53% over the same period and leaked $15.4 million.

308,GILD,"This week will bring a boatload of earnings from large-cap drugmakers. Here are five popular stocks facing turning points in their companies' growth cycle.The key unknown, on the hep C front, is how much the Veterans Administration has been buying, since this isn't available through analysts' usual sources of prescription data.IBD'S TAKE: The N in IBD's CAN SLIM investment system stands for New, as in new management, new conditions and other ""new"" things, such as new products. So it's wise to keep abreast of upcoming drug trial data from biotech companies. Gilead's shares have languished, but the company is expected to release some key data on a possibly big hep B drug later this year, as IBD reported. ""The VA has budgeted $1 billion HCV drug spending for fiscal year 2016,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email Friday, noting that Gilead has historically had a 70% share of VA prescriptions.

309,GILD,"The biggest change in accounting standards since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will shake up how public companies book revenue, in many cases resulting in earlier recognition of sales.And the ripple effects could touch everything from earnings and taxes to bonuses, commissions and buyout decisions.The new FASB ""606"" rule developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board takes effect in 2018 or fiscal 2019. It will affect many companies but likely will have the most impact on businesses with multiyear contracts, licensing revenue, contracts that peg revenue to performance benchmarks, or third-party sales distribution channels.In the short term, stock market investors will sometimes have a tougher task in discerning corporate trends because current financial results might not be comparable to previous quarters. Sales and earnings also might be more volatile, potentially affecting stock prices.""The new revenue recognition standard is one of the biggest accounting events we've ever seen,"" said Dusty Stallings, a partner at accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers. ""It's going to be a tough exercise for most companies.""IBD'S TAKE: The best stocks to buy usually are powered by a strong revenue stream. But smart investors look at revenue within the context of a company's overall financial performance. IBD calculates a unique rating for every stock that does just that. For an explanation and a list of stocks that rate highly now, read Paul Whitfield's new article ""Don't Judge Sales In A Vacuum.""Some of the businesses that could be most impacted are telecom stocks AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) and computer software stocks such as Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Microsoft (MSFT), analysts say. AT&T stock rose 0.2% Friday to 43.16, while Verizon shares were off 0.5%. Adobe climbed 2% Friday and Microsoft 1%.Just about every tech company has said in regulatory filings that it's evaluating how the new standard could impact financial statements. That includes Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Facebook (FB), Intel (INTC), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Qualcomm (QCOM).But the new FASB 606 revenue standard will affect most other industries as well, including media, entertainment, aerospace, biotech, health care, construction, auto, defense, real estate and franchisers, such as restaurants. Boeing (BA), Walt Disney (DIS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are among stocks assessing the standard's impact.And companies will need to adapt more than just their financial statements. The revenue standard could impact sales commissions, bonuses, corporate taxes and debt covenants.RELATED COVERAGE:Verizon Brings In British Mobile War Veteran As T-Mobile And Sprint Pick Off SubscribersDisney And Comcast Pull Out Their Wallets To Get Ready For The 'Netflix Of VR'Microsoft Stock Breaks Out To New Highs, One Of 5 Big Stock Moves (Video)Sarbanes-Oxley financial reforms targeted fraud in the wake of accounting scandals at Enron, WorldCom and others.FASB 606 will make revenue recognition consistent across U.S. industries. Guidelines specific to the software and defense industries, for example, are going away.""Revenue recognition is all about when and how much,"" said Prabhakar Kalavacherla, a partner at another Big 4 accounting firm, KPMG. ""There is now going to be a unifying principal that is agnostic to industries.""For many software and some other tech stocks, the new standard might speed up the timing of revenue recognition vs. today's GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) guidelines. They'll have to recognize revenue immediately, not over the broad length of some contracts. Often, the companies won't know exactly what revenue to disclose, so they'll be asked to make more estimates and judgment calls rather than rely on the old rules.Computer makers and other companies that sell products through distributors likely will book more revenue upfront. They'll need to estimate, based on historical data, how much product will eventually be sold to end users through the distributors, and then book that amount.""Certain industries will recognize revenue sooner than they have in the past, and software is one example,"" Stallings said. ""But the change in guidance from the very strict rules today to the (new) requirement to make estimations is going to go across a lot of industries.""Key to the new accounting rules is that revenue must often be booked right away and not stretched out over time. AT&T and Verizon will likely book more revenue from smartphone sales upfront, rather than over the course of a lease contract or payment plan.If software companies fast-forward revenue recognition, there could be an uptick in acquisitions, says Todson Page, another partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. That's because smaller companies may be more attractive takeover targets if deals are earnings-positive immediately, or at least within a few quarters.""From a deal justification point of view, it may help some buyers because it would allow them to reach GAAP accretion numbers quicker,"" said Page, PWC's U.S. technology deals leader.Changes on the top line, of course, can affect a stock's earnings.""The new revenue standard has the potential to change not only the top line, but also the bottom line,"" Wesley Bricker, deputy chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a May speech.Earlier recognition of sales would help the bottom line at first, but it would lead to lumpier earnings overall, as more revenue is booked upfront and less over the duration of a contract or long-term license.Companies might have less deferred revenue that they book over time. Thus, the FASB 606 standard means they might have less leeway to manage earnings and meet consensus estimates by accelerating or deferring revenue.One broad aim of FASB 606 is to bring U.S. revenue recognition in line with international financial reporting standards, which are also being overhauled. A goal is to make it easier for investors to compare stocks across industries and countries, says KPMG's Kalavacherla, also a former member of the International Accounting Standards Board.Companies will have to chose just how to comply with the new standard. Some companies will opt to restate sales for some prior years, while others will take a modified compliance route, applying the new rules only to existing and future contracts as of the effective date.Telecom, media and entertainment companies are among those most likely to restate revenue, analysts say.And that likely would be the cleaner tack, says Kalavacherla. With the modified route, he says, less trend information will be available to investors and analysts. ""That comparative data will be lost,"" he said.In 2015, FASB delayed the effective date of the new revenue standard for one year to 2018 after companies asked for clarifications. Some companies are still griping.FASB has said it is not considering another delay. Some analysts, however, say the rules are still in flux.""The rules simply don't make sense right now,"" said John DiFucci, a software industry analyst at Jefferies.At a JPMorgan conference in May, some software companies hedged when asked how soon they'll be affected by the standard.The accounting changes come amid a huge change in the computer industry that finds software companies shifting from one-time licensing fees to subscription-based, software-as-a-service business models. Under the FASB 606 standard, only software that is ""continuously updated"" can be recognized over time — and that applies for most SaaS.Companies that have had SaaS business models from the start, such as Salesforce.com, might be less impacted by this change than others, analysts say. Adobe, Microsoft and Splunk (SPLK) are among software stocks that are transitioning to SaaS but still have considerable licensing revenue. The timing of revenue recognition for software licenses could be accelerated, says Citigroup.A KPMG survey found many companies are taking a wait-and-see approach. They haven't upgraded IT systems, recalculated contracts or taken other steps to comply with the new standard. Such companies are more likely to take the modified approach in complying with the standard, rather than restating financial statements.Since companies will need to make more estimates in revenue recognition, they'll need to disclose more historical and other data in footnotes, says KPMG, which will improve transparency, a plus for investors.The new standard also is a business opportunity for startups that offer financial software designed to help in revenue recognition. Among such companies are Leeyo Software, Zuora and Revstream.As Leeyo CEO Jagan Reddy told IBD: ""This is going to be a real challenge for auditors.""

310,GILD,"It was a huge week for earnings. Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) all beat forecasts, while McDonald's (MCD) and Ford Motor (F) indicated some weakness in U.S. demand. Tech M&A stepped up, including a Verizon (VZ) deal to buy Yahoo's (YHOO) core assets. The U.S. economy is growing a lot slower than expected, and oil prices are nearing $40 a barrel.The Nasdaq composite rose 1.2% to its best levels since early December, fueled by strong earnings from Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon. The S&P 500 hitting a new record high Friday but closed the week down fractionally. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.7%, also snapping a four-week uptrend, as weaker oil prices and earnings reports hit the energy sector. The Federal Reserve's statement that the ""near-term economic risks"" have ""diminished"" seemed to have little impact on investors.The iPhone maker earned $1.42 a share, down 23% year over year, on sales of $42.4 billion, down 15%. It was Apple's second straight declines in earnings, revenue and iPhone sales -- but they were still better than expected. Apple's current-quarter revenue target is $46.5 billion at the midpoint, off 10% but above Wall Street consensus of $45.71 billion. The iPhone 7 is expected to be released in mid-September.Apple stock rose 5.6% for the week, just retaking its 200-day line.Amazon Q2 EPS of $1.78 shattered the estimate of $1.11.

Revenue guidance for Q3 also was strong, though operating income may be light.Amazon stock rose 1.9% to 758.81 for the week, hitting a record 766 intraday Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is a Leaderboard stock, hitting new highs as growth booms. But it's only rated No. 4 in IBD's Retail-Internet group. To see who's No. 1, go to IBD Stock Checkup. Facebook reported Q2 revenue of $6.43 billion, up 59% and maintaining a streak of double-digit growth going back more than four years. EPS jumped 94% to 97 cents, shattering consensus for 82 cents. It was the fourth straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth. Facebook stock rose 2.4% to 123.94, hitting a record high and still within range of a 121.18 buy point.Twitter (TWTR) reported Q2 EPS that topped views. But revenue fell short, and Q3 revenue guidance also missed estimates. Twitter stock fell 9.4% but closed the week above its 50-day line.Bouncing back from a Q1 miss, Alphabet reported Q2 EPS and revenue that blew past expectations. The Google parent's earnings minus items rose 20% to $8.42 a share. Total revenue climbed 21% to $21.5 billion. Despite Google's size, it's still delivering growth, says Mark Mahaney, analyst at RBC Capital. ""This is now the 18th straight quarter of 20%-ish year-over-year revenue growth, and did we mention acceleration?"" he said in a report.Alphabet stock rose 4.2% to 791.34, closing just above a 791.05 entry point after rising as high as 803.94.Ford Motor sent a signal that the long auto industry bull market is over, as U.S. auto sales stall, and higher incentives hit profit margins. The No. 2 U.S. automaker's Q2 earnings per share and revenue rose, but EPS growth was weakest in five quarters, sales growth was the slimmest in three quarters, and Ford cited ""downside risk to global growth."" Offering further evidence of slowing, auto parts maker Lear (LEA) missed on sales and warned on 2016 revenue, while Gentherm (THRM) earnings missed. Volkswagen (VLKAY) Q2 sales edged up 1.7%, but its net profit plunged 57% vs. a year early as it struggled to recover from an emissions test cheating scandal involving diesel-engine models.Ford stock fell 8.5%.The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged after its two-day policy meeting, as expected. Policymakers said ""near-term economic risks ... have diminished,"" suggesting a baby step to raising rates, and some analysts said it opened the door, slightly, to a September rate increase. But after the Fed meeting and weak GDP data, investors pushed back their expectations for the next hike beyond the next 12 months.The U.S. economy rose at a 1.2% annual rate in Q2, less than half of what Wall Street expected, after Q1's downwardly revised 0.8% pace. Consumer spending was very strong, climbing 4.2%.But residential investment fell, even as separate reports show new- and existing-home sales hitting multiyear highs. Business investment contracted for a third straight quarter. With oil prices falling back toward $40 a barrel, corporate spending may remain weak going forward.U.S. crude oil futures tumbled 5.9% to $41.60 a barrel, hitting three-month lows as the crude tumbled 13.9% for July. U.S. crude and gasoline supplies rose again, according to the Energy Information Administration, which also reported higher U.S. production. The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a fifth straight week, suggesting further production gains. But a glut of gasoline and refined products, suggesting less refinery demand for crude ahead. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP) reported weaker-than-expected results.Mobileye (MBLY) reported Q2 EPS jumped 70% to 17 cents, while revenue grew 51% to $83.5 million. Both topped views. The maker of driver-assistance systems said that its relationship with Tesla Motors (TSLA) is ending. That news sent Mobileye down 8% on Tuesday, but the stock pared losses for the week to 3.4%. Tesla rose 5.6%.Boeing (BA) reported its first quarterly loss in years due to various charges, but it wasn't as deep as feared. Free cash flow was better than expected on big jet deliveries. Northrop Grumman (NOC) reported modest earnings and sales growth that topped views, but weaker tech services revenue hurt margins. Raytheon (RTN) beat views and raised profit guidance. General Dynamics (GD) topped on earnings and raised EPS guidance, but Q2 revenue missed.McDonald's earned $1.45 a share, beating analysts' expectations for $1.38. Total revenue fell 3.6% vs. a year earlier to $6.265 billion. Analysts had expected $6.27 billion. Global same-store sales, excluding currency effects, rose 3.1% vs. estimates for about 3.6%. U.S. same-store sales rose just 1.8%. Management said they were ""not immune"" to consumer unease -- be it over finances, the election or, in general, ""an unsettled world"" -- that may have hurt other restaurants during the quarter.Shares fell 8.3% to 117.60 for the week, tumbling through their 50-day and 200-day moving averages -- and a 124.18 buy point.Stifel Nicolaus downgraded a large number of restaurant stocks, while Jefferies predicted a U.S. recession would hit the sector. Top-rated Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which reports earnings in the coming week, fell 6% on Wednesday. But the steakhouse chain found support at its 50-day line and closed the week down 2.3%.United Technologies (UTX), maker of Pratt & Whitney brand aircraft engines, Otis elevators and other products, reported second-quarter earnings per share and revenue that beat estimates and raised its Q3 EPS estimate. Its stock hit a one-year high at 108.49, above a 107.07 buy point. Caterpillar's (CAT) Q2 EPS and revenue both fell as the mining and construction equipment giant deals with an energy and mining downturn. Its stock hit a roughly one-year high at 84.29, rising above an 80.89 entry point. Chemicals giant DuPont (DD), which is merging with Dow Chemical (DOW), crushed earnings estimates but was light on revenue. Shares rose to 69.87, the highest point since mid-December, triggering its 69.50 buy point. Meanwhile 3M (MMM), which makes tapes, adhesives, medical supplies and other products, also reported higher EPS and lower revenue, beating estimates on both. But its shares fell 1.1%.Analog Devices (ADI) agreed to buy Linear Technology (LLTC) in a cash-and-stock deal worth around $14.8 billion to create a microchip-industry giant. The deal is expected to close within the first half of 2017. Meanwhile, Oracle (ORCL) said it would buy cloud-services provider NetSuite (N) in a $9.3 billion deal. Oracle's Larry Ellison is the leading shareholder of NetSuite. Meanwhile, Citrix Systems (CTXS) will merge its Go To Meeting unit with LogMeIn (LOGM). Citrix was already planning to spin off Go To Meeting.Verizon Communications acquired struggling the core assets of Yahoo for nearly $6 billion, including $1.1 billion in stock compensation costs. ""Despite the massive execution challenges ahead, the Yahoo acquisition demonstrates that Verizon recognizes its own limitations as a consumer brand,"" said research firm The Diffusion Group. Verizon reported Q2 revenue that missed views and in-line EPS, and added fewer wireless postpaid phone subscribers than expected.T-Mobile US (TMUS) in Q2 added 646,000 postpaid phone subscribers, topping Sprint (S) at 173,000 and Verizon's 86,000. AT&T (T) lost 160,000 postpaid phone subscribers. T-Mobile's earnings fell 40% but still beat expectations. Revenue rose nearly 13% to $9.2 billion. ""TMUS revenue growth continues to significantly outpace peers,"" said Matthew Niknam, a Deutsche Bank analyst, in a report.Under Armour (UA) met top-line and bottom-line expectations when it reported per-share earnings of a penny, down 75% from the prior-year Q2, and 28% revenue growth to $1 billion. The Nike (NKE) rival announced several assertive plans, including its takeover of the FAO Schwarz space in Manhattan, as well as a partnership with Kohl's (KSS). But shares tumbled 7.9% for the week.Amgen (AMGN) beat and raised, but its stock slipped as its growth continued to be driven by price increases rather than volume. Celgene (CELG), meanwhile, jumped as only a third of its growth was price-driven, making up for a hit earlier in the week when its drug Revlimid failed a lymphoma trial. AbbVie (ABBV), Merck (MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) also rose on solid reports. AstraZeneca (AZN) was the biggest winner stock-wise when it jumped 9% Thursday on rumors that Swiss pharma Novartis (NVS) was thinking of acquiring it. The biggest loser was Gilead Sciences (GILD), which trimmed its guidance as its hepatitis C franchise continued to decline.Meanwhile, top-rated medical device companies Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and orthopedics giant Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) each hit new highs after beating estimates and raising guidance. Big Cap 20 stalwart Boston Scientific (BSX) hit a 10-year high after it reported its strongest quarter of sales growth in nearly a decade.

He cut his hepatitis C sales expectations by 17% in 2017 and 20%-25% after.""Our existing HCV estimates were already materially below (the) consensus,"" he wrote in a research report. ""We now think that HCV revenues will decline faster and farther than we previously estimated, and than (the) consensus currently forecasts.""It briefly had a stranglehold on the market, but Gilead now faces competition from AbbVie (ABBV), which has sold Viekira Pak since April. Merck (MRK) shook up the market even more when it started selling its own medication well below the high costs of Gilead and AbbVie earlier this year.Gilead caused a stir in the biotech world when it released its first hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, in late 2013. The drug cost $84,000, or $1,000 a pill for a 12-week regimen but offered a near guarantee that patients who used the drug would be cured. Gilead saw triple-digit jumps in profits throughout 2014 as a result.In late 2014, Gilead released Harvoni, its follow-on to Sovaldi that cost even more, beyond $90,000. Profits continued to grow at a double-digit pace throughout 2015. That slowed to a single-digit increase in the first quarter of this year and a 2% drop in profits in the second quarter. Shares of the company now trade below 80 after reaching a peak of more than 123 in mid-2015.AbbVie started selling Viekira Pak for around the same price as Sovaldi, but Merck's Zepatier goes for much less, at $54,600.On the stock market today, Gilead stock dipped 1.7%, to 79.25, hitting its lowest point in a week and falling below the key 50-day moving average support line after five straight down days.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead stock has a Composite Rating of 62, meaning it underperforms 38% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group is on a recent hot streak amid the potential for M&A by Big Pharma.The hepatitis C market in the U.S. appears to be in steady, secular decline, Porges said. Despite a large pool of treatable patients, the U.S. and Europe will likely only see 60,000 to 70,000 patients apiece annually in the long-term vs. a record high 270,000 in 2015.Through 2020, Porges forecasts 15% patient erosion per year, 5% erosion of revenue per unit and a 7% dip in treatment erosion. He also expects Gilead to lose 10% market share and sees hepatitis C sales toppling nearly 90% by 2020 to $1.7 billion from peak $13 billion in sales in 2015.Gilead should have seen it coming, Porges said. But, he said: ""Gilead has been surprised by the slowing in patient volume around the world, as well as price erosion in the U.S. and other developed markets.""""We fear that the company has become paralyzed by its size and good fortune, and the uncertainty about its outlook and its capabilities,"" he wrote. Gilead appears unwilling to match the market's price for high-quality assets or to invest in a pipeline for its future.Outside hepatitis C, Porges has kinder words for Gilead's HIV business. But that is contingent upon the success of its development of bictegravir. He currently models $3.4 billion in sales for a bictegravir combination in 2020.Gilead also has a rheumatoid arthritis treatment, filgotinib, for which Porges sees a 65% probability of success, up from 35%.RELATED:Gilead, Allergan Seen Trailing Intercept In Ongoing NASH BattlePfizer Will Buy Cancer Drugmaker Medivation For $14 Billion

332,GILD,"A California ballot initiative requiring the state's Medicaid arm to buy drugs at comparable prices to what the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs pays could backfire, thus preserving sales for the nation's biggest drugmakers, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Thursday.Proposition 61, the California Drug Price Relief Act (CDPRA), sounds good in theory, Yee wrote in a research report. But that's assuming drugmakers don't simply eliminate the steep discounts already provided the VA.After all, he says, that's what happened in 25 years ago.""Congress passed a 1991 law requiring drugmakers to grant Medicaid similar discounts given to manufacturers' larger customers,"" he wrote. ""But the law ultimately prompted manufacturers to raise prices paid by larger customers, including the VA.""That will likely be the fate for the CDPRA, he wrote.Californians appear to overwhelmingly support the initiative. Early this month, a University of Southern California and Los Angeles Times survey found 66% of 1,900 respondents approve of the CDPRA. A San Francisco firm's poll in July which found 73% in support.For drugmakers like Amgen (AMGN), Gilead (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB), Regeneron (REGN) and Vertex (VRTX), the CDPRA offers merely a headline risk, Yee wrote. Assuming a large 20% price cut to Medicaid, 2017 and 2018 sales and earnings would decrease by 2%, as only 10%-20% of the companies' U.S. products are exposed to Medicaid.If all 50 states enacted such a measure, it could mean a 2%-3% earnings per share risk for large-cap players, Yee wrote. This year, though, California is alone with its initiative. An Ohio proposition didn't make it to the ballot.""However, VA price discounts would then probably become nonexistent since lower VA prices would lead to reduced Medicaid prices,"" he wrote, noting Medicaid already gets a 23% discount.To date, CDPRA opposition has only spent 5% of $87 million in donations. Yee expects that spending to ramp up significantly ahead of the Nov. 8 ballot. RBC research shows 100% of all propositions in 2014 were won by the side that had the most funding. CDPRA supporters have raised only about $9.5 million.Supporters, which include former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, say the CDPRA could save 5 million Californian taxpayers $5.7 billion in 10 years, since the VA pays 20% to 25% less than other government agencies for prescription drugs.Opponents argue the CDPRA could invalidate existing contracts between the state and drugmakers, forcing increased state drug prices and reducing funding for Medi-Cal. The initiative could also increase state expenses as employees spend time and resources matching state prices to what the VA pays.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group ranks No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, having climbed from No. 160 just 13 weeks ago. Stocks have heated on Wall Street expectations of major Big Pharma M&A action. However, on the stock market today, the group closed down 3.6%, hurt by Intra-Cellular Therapies' stock plunge.

333,GILD,"Smart ETF investors stay tuned for opportunities in the stock market as sectors rise and fall, styles ebb and flow, and factors come and go.Take the case of iShares Edge Minimum Volatility USA (USMV) and PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV). The two exchange traded funds target volatility, one of several ""factors"" or drivers of returns that are historically proven to add value to stocks.With the use of factors, ETF investors hope to achieve attractive or enhanced portfolio returns across full market cycles, notwithstanding periodic bouts of sunshine and squall.For instance, USMV and SPLV limped through the third quarter after bolting ahead of the S&P 500 in the first two. Investors coveted the low-volatility style earlier this year, but on the stock market today these ETFs lurched to or near June lows.It's the nature of factor-based exchange traded funds to outperform in some markets and underperform in others. So in the spirit of staying tuned for opportunity, as successful investors do, which factor ought to be on your radar?Quality, according to PowerShares. That basically means financially sound companies, typically those with stable earnings growth. PowerShares is a pioneer in the world of factor-based, alternatively weighted ETFs. These funds stray from the traditional cap weighting of stock holdings and also go by the names smart beta or strategic beta.""Quality is a step up from volatility,"" said Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at PowerShares. He likes the quality factor now because it offers more upside participation while also buffering against downside risk, though to a lesser degree than low-volatility strategies.Kalivas sees in quality ""a factor that makes sense"" when investors are starting to position for a recovery in corporate profits, but aren't unfettered by worries.Two of the largest ETFs offering exposure to this factor are iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor (QUAL) and PowerShares S&P 500 Quality (SPHQ). They hold more than $4 billion in assets combined.Quality factor ETFs invest in profitable U.S. firms, with solid earnings growth and low risk. Both QUAL and SPHQ choose stocks based on measures such as return on equity, financial leverage and cash flow. Each counts industry giants PepsiCo (PEP) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) among stock holdings.There are differences between them, however.QUAL avoids big sector bets. SPHQ offers a more pure focus on the quality factor. The former is younger, but larger in assets. It holds a more diversified basket of stocks and has a far lower 0.15% expense ratio.Year to date through Oct. 5, SPHQ is up 9.0% and QUAL 5.5%, while the market-proxy SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) has advanced 7.4%. SPHQ also performed better over the last three years, averaging a 12.1% gain.IBD'S TAKE: An uncertain outlook for interest rates and a divided Fed are among the issues weighing on stock market investors.Bear in mind that good companies don't always make good investments, as Morningstar analyst Alex Bryan wryly notes. He wrote in August that quality stocks seldom offer eye-popping returns and tend to lag in strong market rallies, although they hold up better during market downturns.Rather than getting shaken out in volatile markets, investors may want to consider a long-term allocation to quality factor ETFs, according to PowerShares.Kalivas described SPHQ as both a nice core holding in portfolios and a potential tactical opportunity.Don't take that last bit to mean you should jump headlong from volatility- to quality-focused strategies. Factor timing requires expertise and skill.Investing in multifactor ETFs may be a better approach for most investors. These funds are an alternative to trying to combine or time single factors on one's own.IShares Edge MSCI Multifactor USA (LRGF) combines the quality factor with value, size and momentum. So does JHancock Multifactor Large Cap (JHML).Combining factors takes advantage of their low correlations with one another and their tendency to perform well at different times.RELATED:Which Of The Best ETF Investment Strategies Is Right For Your Portfolio?

334,GILD,"Medical behemoth Gilead (GILD) is trailing Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) in the battle against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) liver disease, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said Thursday, two days after Botox maker Allergan (AGN) jumped in with its $1.7 billion agreement to acquire Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA).Larger Gilead and Allergan — with $107.2 billion and $94.4 billion market caps — are later to the NASH race than Intercept ($4.1 billion market cap). Intercept began enrolling its Phase 3 trials in September 2015 and expects to complete enrollment early next year.IBD'S TAKE: Would you shove a stick in your eye to avoid daily eye drops to treat glaucoma? Glaukos can help. Check out IBD's New America.Intercept, and a handful of rivals, are attempting to treat NASH by targeting FXRs (farnesoid X receptors), a class of proteins found in the liver and intestines. FXRs can be stoked to regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, bile-acid homeostasis and fibrosis — all tied to NASH.But newer players are looking at using non-bile acid FXRs, a departure from Intercept's chemistry. Still, Intercept's Phase 2 FLINT trial is the ""most mature data set in the space to show significance on both fibrosis and liver histology based on pre-specified parameters,"" Young wrote in a research report.Long-term, Young sees room in the NASH space for many players, but Intercept will be more successful than Gilead with a 75% success rate vs. 50%, respectively, she predicted. Intercept will also have to contend with Novartis (NVS), Encanta and now Allergan.Allergan entered the race on Tuesday with its plan to acquire Tobira to get a leg-up on NASH treatment. Yet, Tobira's CVC (cenicriviroc) missed its goal of improving nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLAD) activity score. The activity score is a severity measurement for patients who likely have NASH.Tobira'a CVC successfully reduced fibrosis without worsening NASH in 20% of patients vs. 10% treated with a placebo. Comparatively, Intercept's Phase 2 trial for OCAs (obeticholic acid) improved fibrosis in 35% of patients vs. 19% who received the placebo.Now, Allergan expects to combine Tobira's CVC, a diabetes treatment and a preclinical non-bile acid FXR from Akarna. Encanta has both bile and non-bile FXRs likely slated for human trials soon. Combining treatments will be key, Young predicted.""We think a combination of regimens will be an important part of the treatment paradigm and we think Intercept is positioned well here long term,"" Young wrote. She has an outperform rating and a 200 price target on Intercept stock.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Intercept stock rose 1% to 170.40, but are up nearly 15% so far this month. Shares are in a buy zone for the third consecutive day after pivoting from a 169.17 buy point out of a double bottom base on Sept. 20.Gilead Sciences shares fell 0.2% to 81.52. Allergan climbed 2.1% to 243.43.

The maker of mechanical heart valves, implantable tissues, a surgical glue and other medical products beat Wall Street estimates.But Gilead Sciences (GILD) slid 9% to nearly 52-week low after the biotech edged past earnings views, but lowered its guidance and reported weaker hepatitis C drug sales.Restaurants were broadly weaker as analysts made bearish comments on the industry.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which was downgraded by Stifel Nicolaus and Jefferies Group, crumbled 6.5% in intense volume. Shares fell to the 50-day moving average, where they now seek support.Stifel also downgraded Panera Bread (PNRA), BJ's Restaurants (BJRI), Chuy's (CHUY), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Darden Restaurants (DRI) and other chains. Panera shares fell 4.5% but remain in a basing pattern. Darden and BJ's hit new lows in bases they are forming.

Specialty drugs, as well as new launches and rising costs, ""had less impact than inflation of brands in high-volume categories such as drugs used to treat diabetes.""The announcement follows two years in which the price of specialty drugs has been under increased scrutiny.""The double-digit drug trend increases we were experiencing in 2014 resulted in a call to action from our clients to help them ensure their plan members could access the medications they need to stay healthy, at an affordable price,"" CVS Health Executive Vice President Jonathan Roberts said.CVS shares finished 0.7% lower in the stock market today. Rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) fell 0.1% and Rite Aid (RAD), which Walgreens is buying, eased 0.1%.In 2014, the price of specialty drugs, exemplified by the near six-digit treatment price of hepatitis drugs from Gilead Sciences (GILD), became a lightning rod for criticism. Pharmacy benefit managers such as CVS and Express Scripts (ESRX) have since negotiated discounts from drugmakers in exchange for coverage.In 2015, the lightning rod became the practice of some companies, including Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Martin Shkreli's Turing Pharmaceuticals, which bought obscure drugs on the cheap and hiked their prices.CVS has tried to curb usage of Valeant's Jublia, a toenail fungus drug that reportedly has a retail price of around $1,000 for an 8-milliliter bottle.

But on top of that, drugmakers evidently shrugged off recent political criticism and raised prices on a number of products.""The WAC (wholesale acquisition cost) price of Celgene's Otezla increased in April by 7.9%, following an 8% raise in January and, before that, an increase of 9.9% last June -- representing a year-over-year cumulative increase of 28%; Celgene also raised the price of Abraxane in April, a 10% year-over-year cumulative increase,"" Porges wrote. ""Other Q2 price increases included: Amgen's Kyprolis (8% YoY); Biogen's Tecfidera (16%), Avonex (16%), and Plegridy (16%); and Medivation's (MDVN) Xtandi (6%).""Leerink nonetheless lowered its estimates for Medivation, based on lower Xtandi sales, as well as a lower royalty on sales outside the U.S. He also modestly lowered his forecasts for Amgen (AMGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), though he added that he was still above consensus on both companies.Celgene stock climbed 4.3% to 104.60 on the stock market today.

"
342,GILD,"The first half of 2016 was an exceptionally difficult one for drug stocks, not just because of overall sentiment but because of a relative dearth of good news compared with the previous few years.The second half of the year, however, will bring some very important clinical-trial news from several leading players, with the potential to move stocks sharply. Here's a look at some major events ahead:• Probably the most anticipated data drop of the year is Eli Lilly's (LLY) initial report on its Alzheimer's disease drug solanezumab, expected in December. With almost 50 million sufferers worldwide, Alzheimer's is one of the largest diseases that doesn't have a current treatment. And the many companies that have attempted to create one have a long history of failure.The phase-two trials suggest that solanezumab isn't a miracle cure -- it only created a statistically significant improvement when Lilly parsed the data to focus on early-stage cases. Lilly created a patient pool for its phase-three trial, Expedition 3, composed entirely of such cases. In an interview this year, Lilly CEO John Lechleiter told IBD that Alzheimer's will probably be treated by more than one product, ""not unlike the way diabetes is treated today, not unlike the way cancer is treated.""Lilly at first had two primary endpoints for the trial: improvement in cognitive decline and improvement in functional decline. However, in March it demoted the functional-decline measurement to a secondary endpoint, which analysts took as a sign that Lilly thinks it might miss that one. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan noted that pooled data from the previous two trials showed a 34% impact in slowing cognitive decline, but only a 17% impact in slowing functional decline.""From a regulatory perspective, however, being able to show signs of a functional benefit remains important, and on this point we are now incrementally more cautious,"" Divan wrote in a March 15 research note.Biogen (BIIB) and its investors will be among the interested spectators of Lilly's report. Biogen's earlier-stage drug aducanumab is based on the same theory as solanezumab, that reducing the amyloid plaques that form in Alzheimer's patients' brains will slow the disease progression. So far, this hypothesis hasn't been definitively proven.• Gilead Sciences (GILD) also has a risky but potentially high-reward program in the works, though it's garnered somewhat less attention. After all but conquering hepatitis C with its drugs Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa, Gilead has turned its attention to hepatitis B, a virus even more common than hep C and with only a 5% cure rate with current treatments.In a June 23 report, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said Gilead Chief Science Officer Norbert Bischofberger is placing the most confidence in GS-9620, which this year will read out its first data in humans.""Dr. Bischofberger explained that the first cohort for these studies is always virally suppressed patients, and the data should be available for these patients for presentation during November's American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) conference; data from the second cohort, virally naive patients, should be available at next year's European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) conference,"" Porges wrote.• Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and its big-pharma partner Sanofi (SNY) could report the first data on whether their cholesterol-lowering drug Praluent can reduce death from cardiovascular disease. Full results from the trial aren't expected until next year, but Regeneron will do an interim analysis to see if results have achieved ""overwhelming efficacy"" that would justify stopping the trial early.Initially, Amgen (AMGN) was expected to be the first to report such data on a PCSK9 inhibitor, the class of drug to which Praluent and Amgen's Repatha belong. In early June, however, Amgen pushed that report to early 2017.Praluent and Repatha have both underperformed expectations since they launched last year, but Regeneron and Amgen have warned that sales would likely be slow until they could prove to payers that their drugs actually improve patients' health. In its Q1 earnings report in April, Amgen said that 77% of Repatha prescriptions were rejected at the pharmacy because they require prior authorization from the insurer.Biogen shares rose 1.3% on the stock market today. Gilead Sciences climbed 1.7%, Regeneron 2.65% and Amgen 1.4%.IBD's Take: Biogen, Gilead and Regeneron are all trading well off their highs, below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages as investors worry about slowing growth and drug pricing pressures from regulators and politicians.

343,GILD,"Recent weeks have not been friendly to the pharmaceutical industry, with some stocks in the sector such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Horizon Pharma (HZNP) withering amid criticism over the industry's drug-pricing practices and fears of greater regulation.But two biotechs with top fundamentals — Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), the focus of the Screen of the Day — have maintained strong ratings and held up in the stock market despite the furor. Companies with top fundamentals, by IBD's definition, have three-year EPS and sales growth rates of at least 25%.Gilead Sciences, which has faced a raft of criticism over the price of its hepatitis C wonder drug, Sovaldi, has a three-year EPS growth rate of 106% and a three-year sales growth rate of 60%. The company handily beat Q3 estimates last month, raising full-year sales guidance that was just shy of expectations.Gilead, like other pharma stocks, fell on Sept. 21, when Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton said she would introduce a plan to crack down on what she called ""price gouging"" in the industry. Clinton's announcement came after Turing Pharmaceuticals was harshly criticized for its decision to buy a six-decade-old drug and quickly raise its price by more than 5,000%.Gilead breached its 200-day line that day and sank further for a month before clearing its 50-day and 200-day line. The stock has found support at its 200-day moving average since.Shares closed down 2.8% in the stock market today.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), which makes the cholesterol fighter Praluent with Sanofi (SNY), has a three-year EPS growth rate of 46% and a three-year sales growth rate of 45%. But sales of Praluent, seen as a possible blockbuster, were less than half of what analysts expected in Q3. EPS and overall sales beat forecasts.Regeneron fell the day of Clinton's announcement, finished higher the next two days, then descended below its 200-day line on Sept. 28. But the stock has since climbed above its 50-day line.Regeneron stock dipped 2.5% Thursday as the stock formed a handle on a three-month consolidation.While Regeneron and Gilead have turned in stronger showings recently, stocks such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Mallinckrodt (MNK) and Horizon Pharma have been hit hard. Short-seller Citron Research last month accused Valeant of shady sales practices and criticized the drugmaker for price-hikes in its acquired drugs. And Citron this month attacked Mallinckrodt, saying sales of its drug Acthar had lagged and questioned the gel's effectiveness.And Express Scripts (ESRX) on Wednesday sued Horizon Pharma, saying it owed millions in unpaid drug rebates, and cut from its network a specialty pharmacy that Horizon was using. Valeant also has been hammered over its specialty pharmacy ties.Mallinckrodt, Valeant and Horizon are all trading their 50-day and 200-day lines.Valeant shares ended down 6.5% Thursday, Horizon lost 2%, while Mallinckrodt fell 6.5%. Express Scripts slid 0.5%.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

344,GILD,"ETF investors have lately been seeking out safe, sound and stable stocks as the market turned more volatile. Stocks likely to make the whiz-bang moves are getting a lot less love.A deterioration in credit market conditions is contributing to choppiness in the stock market, Russ Koesterich, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, wrote in a Nov. 9 report.""We continue to favor a tilt toward quality,"" he added. ""While momentum has been an effective style over the past several years as markets generally marched upward, it has struggled since volatility began to rise in the late summer.""IShares MSCI USA Quality Factor (QUAL) gained 1.7% in the past three months through Nov. 11 vs. 0.8% for iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM).On a year-to-date basis, the momentum ETF has outperformed the quality ETF. It also came out tops in 2014.QUAL, the quality ETF, homes in on profitable companies for successful investing.It tracks an index that targets large- and midcap U.S. stocks with high returns on equity, low debt burdens and more consistent earnings over the previous five years.Stocks are weighted based on both the degree to which they exhibit these characteristics and their market capitalization.""This skews the portfolio toward stocks with durable competitive advantages,"" Morningstar analyst Alex Bryan wrote in a recent report. ""The fund is better positioned than many of its peers for market downturns.""But expect it to underperform its momentum peer when the stock market's rallying strongly.This exchange traded fund holds 125 stocks.

It may allow this ETF investment strategy to hold stock winners whose recent performance is likely to persist, says Bryan.""The fund's focus on risk-adjusted momentum may help reduce volatility and turnover,"" he added. On the flip side, this ETF investment strategy may offer a diluted momentum effect because it rebalances only twice a year.It also holds 125 stocks.

346,GILD,"Core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.3% in January and 2.2% from a year ago, the fastest annual rise since June 2012, the Labor Department said.Overall prices were unchanged for the month and up 1.4% from a year ago. Energy costs slid 2.8% for a second straight month, but the yearly decline slowed to 6.5% vs. 12.6% in December and 18.4% in September, as comparisons get tougher.Core prices were driven by gains in the cost of medical care, health insurance and housing, including lodging away from home.Health insurance costs rose 1.1% for the month and 4.8% from a year ago — the biggest increase since April 2013, before the ObamaCare exchanges were launched. Although subsidies help reduce the prices, inflation measures take into account the added government costs as well. Despite rising premiums, UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have warned of losses in the exchanges, with UnitedHealth the most explicit about possibly exiting the market if conditions don't improve.The cost of medical care rose 0.5% in January, bringing the yearly increase to 3%, tied for the highest since early 2013. Prescription drug companies such as Gilead Sciences (GILD)and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX)  have been under fire for high costs, but the annual rise in prescription costs has decelerated to 3% from 6.4% at the end of 2014.The cost of medical service rose 0.5% for the month and 3.3% from a year ago, the biggest annual rise since April 2013.Rent of primary residence rose 0.3% in January and 3.7% from a year ago, matching December's annual gain for the biggest since June 2008.Lodging away from home, which sees volatile swings from month to month, rose 2% in January and 3.1% for the year.All items excluding food, shelter and energy still were up a more moderate 1.5% from a year ago.The core inflation rate has risen above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

"
350,GILD,"Shares of big biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) were off more than 1% midday Wednesday after the attorney general of Massachusetts threatened legal action against the company for its drug pricing.The Boston Globe reported that Attorney General Maura Healey had sent a letter to Gilead saying that its pricing of hepatitis C drug Sovaldi and Harvoni ""may constitute an unfair trade practice in violation of Massachusetts law."" Sovaldi was launched in December 2013 at $84,000 for a 12-week round of treatment, while Harvoni was launched in October 2014 at $94,500 for the equivalent-length treatment, though a large minority of patients have been successfully treated for eight weeks.Gilead and its defenders have argued that the price is justified by the vast superiority of the drug over previous treatments, curing upward of 95% of patients and preventing expensive medical problems down the road. However, for Healey the curative powers of the drugs only make the high prices more egregious, since ""pricing the treatment in a manner that effectively allow (hepatitis C) to continue spreading through vulnerable populations, as opposed to eradicating the disease altogether, results in massive public harm.""The prices of Gilead's drugs have been criticized ever since their launch, and in fact a Senate investigation last year culminated in a December report saying that the prices placed an inordinate burden on state Medicaid programs, which was also the focus of Healey's letter. However, no one's been able to do anything about them expect AbbVie (ABBV), whose competing treatment Viekira Pak sparked a rebate war with Gilead after its December 2014 launch. Thus, while the drugs still have the same official price tags, they're actually selling for around 40% less.Analysts are expecting further price erosion with the arrival of Merck's (MRK) own competing treatment, which is due for an FDA decision by Thursday. Gilead has said in the last few earnings calls that the U.S. hepatitis C market has flattened, but it is planning to launch a new version of its treatment in June that could potentially treat all genotypes of the disease, thereby broadening the market.Gilead stock has been hammered since the re-ignition of the drug-price debate in the presidential race last fall, though that has focused more on practice of specialty drugmakers like Turing Pharmaceuticals and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) of raising prices on older drugs without any improvement in their quality. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform had planned a hearing on the subject for Tuesday, but the big East Coast blizzard led them to reschedule it to Feb. 4.
"
351,GILD,"The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved Gilead Sciences' (GILD) latest hepatitis C pill, which the company priced significantly lower than its previous drugs.The drug, Epclusa, improves upon Gilead's previous drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni in that it treats all six major genotypes of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), both enlarging the market and eliminating the need for genotype testing. For most patients, the regime is one pill a day for 12 weeks, although patients with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e. very advanced liver disease) must take it with ribavirin, a standard generic HCV medicine.Gilead representative Cara Miller told IBD in an email that the wholesale price for a 12-week regimen of the drug is $74,760. That's down quite a bit from Sovaldi's $84,000 and Harvoni's $94,500, which raised an outcry when those drugs were launched in 2013 and 2014, respectively.The HCV business, however, has gotten more competitive since then, with AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK) both launching treatments at a significant discount. Those treatments are for genotype 1, but that strain makes up 70% of the market. Merck's Zepatier also is approved for genotype 4.Miller noted that the current standard treatment for patients with genotype 3 is Sovaldi combined with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Daklinza, which together cost twice as much as Epclusa.Gilead has said that in the U.S. it will position Epclusa mainly as a genotype 3 treatment, as that is one of the most difficult to treat. While it may sound like it would obviate the need for Sovaldi and Harvoni, the company has engaged in extensive rebating to keep those drug competitive. Also, many patients take Harvoni for only eight weeks, and Gilead said it has no plans to study a shorter-duration treatment with Epclusa.""Despite Gilead's positioning, we anticipate some cannibalization of Sovaldi revenue for GT2 and GT3 patients and some Harvoni revenue for GT1 patients due to more friendly regimens (e.g., potential to omit ribavirin; shorter duration for GT3 patients),"" wrote Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges in a research note.Porges forecast $1.8 billion in Epclusa sales this year, jumping to $10.3 billion next year, though he expects a quick drop-off as next-generation treatments start to come out. He noted that his estimates are almost double consensus, however.The FDA approval was widely expected, but Gilead stock shot up 5.2% to 82.31 on the stock market today. Gilead stock hit a two-year low Monday below 78, as shares tumbled 6% Friday and Monday amid the Brexit vote fallout.
"
352,GILD,"Biotech stock analysts pondered the potential impact of the Brexit Friday morning, finding that most big U.S. biotechs have low exposure in the U.K. but could run into other headaches.Exposure to the European Union in general ranged from 9% for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) to 37% for Celgene (CELG), according to Jefferies. Celgene nevertheless told Evercore ISI that less than 1% of its revenue comes from the U.K.Gilead Sciences' (GILD) EU exposure is 19%, while its U.K. exposure is 2.9%, according to Evercore's calculations.Vertex Pharmaceuticals' (VRTX) EU exposure is 29%, with 2.5% in Britain, but RBC Capital Markets notes that's expected to grow as Vertex's latest cystic-fibrosis drug Orkambi is supposed to get reimbursement in the U.K. next year. RBC analyst Michael Yee said in a research note that it's ""not clear whether these (reimbursement) negotiations will be impacted in any way.""However, Edison Investment analyst Maxim Jacobs opined in a research note that these measurements of exposure were ""looking at the wrong kind of risk. The risk is if a global bear market kills biotech funding.""Needham analyst Alan Carr wrote that Britain's separation from the EU will also bring regulatory complications down the road.""The European Medicines Agency (EMA), which conducts a centralized drug review process for Europe, is based in London,"" Carr wrote in a research note. ""If Article 50 (the withdrawal clause) is invoked, the EMA will need to move, and the U.K. will need to establish a new, separate regulatory organization.""Although we do not expect a meaningful impact on companies with drugs now under review by the EMA, Brexit will lead to a less efficient, more expensive, and potentially lengthier regulatory process for companies seeking approval in the EU and U.K.""Biotechs were hammered along with the rest of the market on the stock market today. Celgene fell 4.3% to 96.29, Regeneron was off 4.9% to 339.48 to its lowest level since October 2014. Gilead faltered 3.5% to 80.47, a 2-year low. Vertex shed 7.1% to 81.90. IBD's biotech industry group plunged 4.5%.
"
353,GILD,"Drug giants Eli Lilly (LLY) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) both face key Food and Drug Administration actions this Tuesday that will affect the future of their leading disease-treatment franchises.An advisory committee to the FDA will meet to discuss expanding the label of Jardiance, Lilly's 2-year-old drug for treating type 2 diabetes. What Lilly wants to add to the label is that the drug also reduces death by cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, and the risk of death in general.Those claims are based on a large, long-term trial called EMPA-REG, the results of which surprised the industry last year. Patients on Jardiance showed a 38% reduction in death from cardiovascular causes, a 35% reduction in hospitalizations for heart failure, and a 32% cut in deaths from all causes. If the FDA approves the label expansion, Lilly's sales reps will be able to use this in marketing the drug.The problem, according to Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez, is that those were not the primary endpoints of the trial; they were secondary, ""exploratory"" endpoints. The primary endpoint was a three-point measurement of major adverse cardiac events (MACE): the time to the first cardiovascular-related death, non-fatal heart attack and non-fatal stroke. On that, results were more mixed: Only on the first point did Jardiance achieve a statistically significant difference, while the non-fatal stroke incidence was actually slightly higher than in the placebo group.When the FDA released its briefing documents for the panel Friday morning, in fact, the conclusion affirmed that the study does show a reduction in CV death, but advised against including the MACE, heart-failure and all-cause death info on the label. This was nonetheless interpreted positively by analysts, and Lilly stock was up 0.5% on the stock market today despite the general Brexit sell-off.""The panel also consists of a substantial portion of cardiologists, which will help tilting the balance towards highlighting the CV benefit during the panel, in our view,"" Fernandez wrote in a research note Friday. Previewing the event on June 2, Fernandez had predicted the panel would be ""a battle of 'statistical purists' vs 'clinicians,' "" adding that ""clinically, the large and consistent CV death benefit seen in the EMPA-REG trial is viewed to be precedent-setting.""That precedent will also be of interest to Novo Nordisk (NVO), which recently reported that a similar study of its diabetes drug Victoza also brought a reduction in cardiovascular deaths, though not to the extent that Jardiance did. Novo Nordisk has said that it will also file for a label addition but hasn't yet decided on the language. The Danish diabetes specialist fell 4.4% Friday.Tuesday will also be the deadline for the FDA to decide whether to approve Gilead's latest hepatitis C pill. Gilead's last two hepatitis C launches, of Sovaldi and Harvoni, broke financial records, but those were restricted to certain genotypes of the virus. The new pill would be approved for all genotypes, not only enlarging the market, but also removing the need to test the patient's genotype before writing a prescription.Wall Street has no doubt that the FDA will approve the drug, but the interesting question is how Gilead will price it. When it launched in December 2013, Sovaldi gained notoriety for its price of $84,000 for a 12-week regimen, while Harvoni (launched in October 2014) was more than $94,000.However, when AbbVie (ABBV) launched its competing Viekira Pak in December 2014, the two companies started a rebating war that hit Gilead's income.Then this January, Merck (MRK) priced its new HCV drug Zepatier well below both, which both Gilead and AbbVie acknowledged hit their Q1 financials. It remains to be seen how Gilead values the pan-genotypic nature of the new drug.Gilead stock was down 3.5% Friday, hitting a 2-year low. AbbVie sank 2.4% and Merck 3.1%
"
354,GILD,"Jerry Dodson's Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX) proves that you can have your socially responsible cake and eat it too.The $1.5 billion mutual fund favors companies that provide employees with ""outstanding workplaces."" So do the five other funds at Parnassus Investments, which Dodson founded in 1984. That includes things like offering workers profit-sharing, time off for working parents, paid time off for volunteer work, fair treatment and clear communication.The investment team at Parnassus, which has $16.5 billion under management, also screen out companies engaged in the extraction, exploration, production, manufacturing or refining of fossil fuels.None of those criteria have prevented Endeavor from outperforming its peers or the broad market in the past 10 years.It is the top-performing environmental, social and corporate-governance (ESG) fund over the 10 years ended June 30, with an 11.57% average annual return in that decade, says Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 averaged a 7.42% yearly gain in that span.The fund also ranks in the top 1% of all large-cap growth mutual funds in that period and the top 2% over the past five years.And it is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, glowing in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large caps. It outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Through Q2, it was ahead of roughly 42% of all U.S. diversified stock funds so far this year.Dodson's affinity for ESG investing has deep roots. He founded Parnassus Investments at the age of 41 with those goals in mind. Earlier work was a harbinger of what was to come: A political science major as UC Berkeley, he got his MBA from Harvard Business School in 1971, then went on to work for a nonprofit outfit that helped minority-owned businesses. He helped organize Continental Savings of America, becoming the president and CEO of the S&L, which developed an innovative product for depositors to invest in solar energy projects.Dodson is lead manager on Parnassus Fund (PARNX) and Parnassus Asia Fund (PAFSX) and sole manager of Endeavor. From his office in San Francisco, 73-year-old Dodson talked with Investor's Business Daily about the ins and outs of his investment approach and how he began to use social screens.IBD: You're juggling two tough tasks: You not only use ESG criteria, you also run a concentrated portfolio. Which is tougher?Dodson: You know, the hard part was getting the philosophy and tweaking it with simulations, which was done over many years. Once we understood the strategy would work, the size of the portfolio just followed.You'll be surprised that we took advice from a journalist (about the size and strategy). I was social friends with Milton Moskowitz, who was writing a news story that started as a book. It was about the 100 best places to work.I looked at the returns of the 50% to 60% that were publicly traded ... and thought I should start a fund based on that. Milton thought I should stick with 100 companies. I disagreed. He said I'd screw it up.Anyway, it took years (of looking for fundamental metrics that correlated to good stock performance). It took about two years of back-testing on paper, then five more years of running the portfolio (before opening it to the public).IBD: Aside from ESG criteria, it looks to me as if you seek large-cap companies with wide moats or strong competitive advantages, and quality management teams that act in the best interests of shareholders. Have I got it right?Dodson: That's it, succinctly.IBD: Information technology is your largest sector, with a 50% weighting as of March 31. Is that a typical exposure to tech?Dodson: It's usually been our largest sector, but not 50%. Normally it's around 30%. The reason is that we know the sector well. Silicon Valley is down the road from us and more and more right here in the city.Also, in terms of workplace, technology companies seem a step ahead in providing a good environment. Google -- Alphabet (GOOGL) now -- has generous maternity leave, a gym where you can work out, days off for doing charitable events.Compared to, say, the steel industry, workplace issues score stronger at tech companies.IBD: Speaking of Alphabet, it's been trending sideways since late April. Do you still like the stock?Dodson: We started buying at 525 in December 2014. Now it's up to (the low 700s). We think it will make more gains. But you're right, it's been pretty flat. We regard it as a long-term holding. It's got a great moat and a good social story.IBD: Why do you think it has more room to run?Dodson: Primarily because of its moat, and it's looking to develop new products. It has a huge cash stake, a talented workforce. Its search engine gives them (revenue and earnings) stability. I don't know what new ideas they're working on, but I know they're looking for new products and they'll find something.IBD: In general, you emphasize some ESG criteria more than others, right?Dodson: We are more focused on the workplace, how a company treats employees. Then the environment. Workplace is a component of ""social.""IBD: How is workplace part of ""social""?Dodson: The word ""social"" covers a lot. For us, it means how a company treats its employees. It can mean safety record, privacy policy, relationship to the community where the company operates, diversity programs and good, clear, honest communication.IBD: Do you ever invest in a stock because its E, S or G features are very attractive, even though its financial performance is not so bright?Dodson: In the past we've done that. I did it before Endeavor Fund, with Parnassus Fund (PARNX). The stock was Control Data (a supercomputer company). They would hire former prisoners, do great social things. But the business strategy was just OK. We invested, and it was one of the worst mistakes I ever had. It cured me of picking for environmental or social reasons alone.IBD: Let's talk about individual holdings as of your latest disclosure. Citrix Systems' (CTXS) earnings per share rose 51% and 82% the past two quarters. A lot of people think the enterprise software developer, specializing in desktop virtualization, lost its focus. It's in a reorganization that has involved layoffs of staff and contractors. How does this situation look to you?Dodson: The reason we invested was because of their GoToMeeting app (which is being spun off). GoToMeeting is similar to Citrix's XenApp. You can be thousands of miles away from your server, doing applications, and you can use it on your smartphone or laptop, and it delivers it safely on your mobile device. That's what makes them successful. People want applications, this company delivers them where you want.IBD: Your stake in Applied Materials' (AMAT) is up. Are you satisfied with their progress?Dodson: It was in the doldrums when we initiated a position in May 2009 at 11.22. Equipment used to make semiconductors tends to be volatile. Sales and earnings are very cyclical. We tried to buy at a time when the stock had fallen off, then ride it up. Now it's (rising). We believe Applied will benefit from significant order growth with its leading etch and deposition tools.IBD: Ciena's (CIEN) earnings per share have slowed from 625% growth three quarters ago to 50% growth and a 3% decline the past two frames. Everything OK there?Dodson: We've owned it quite a while. It's more volatile than we expected. It makes communication glass wires, equipment that moves impulses, whether they are voice or data, along transmission lines. Earnings have been lumpy because any time you have an equipment maker, it has ups and downs. We've held it through cycles. It's more volatile than we expected. But we like the company, and we think it has more upside.IBD: Why do you own C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW)? It's not a tech story. And revenue has declined three quarters in a row.Dodson: It's a freight forwarder, focusing on trucking. You're right. It hasn't done well. That's primarily because shipping has not picked up as much as anticipated. The economy is growing (at an annualized rate of) 2% or less. To get trucking and freight forwarding growing, the economy has to grow more. So it's a play that the economic recovery will accelerate. But our average cost is 55. The stock is in the mid-70s, so we've done well.IBD: Charles Schwab's (SCHW) EPS grow has accelerated for two quarters, but share price has been weak. What's your play here?Dodson: We're tied in to them. We pay Schwab if customers come in through them.But the key? A lot of brokerage firms, including Schwab, collect interest on margin loans. With interest rates so low, they don't make much. But if interest rates increase, then there's a huge earnings increase for Schwab. It's in the mid-20s now. It would go to the 40s.If our economy gets better, rates will go up and Schwab will take off.IBD: Intel's (INTC) EPS growth is speeding up. Where's the growth for their computer chips coming from?Dodson: They make chips for personal computers, smartphones and other applications. They also make chips for servers. Those sales are going up.They've been trying for years to get into the mobile (devices) market. They finally have semiconductors going into the iPhone. They're trying to get more into communications and other growth areas. With this Apple (AAPL) chip and other missions, that's what we're banking on to move Intel higher.IBD: Procter & Gamble (PG) is the classic defensive stock. But revenue per share has declined for eight quarters. Is this what you want?Dodson: You're right about revenue declining. They've got these amazing brands: Crest, Tide, Gillette, Head & Shoulders. But they need a new growth engine. We're looking at it. Does it have growth ahead? We haven't reached a conclusion.IBD: IBM (IBM) EPS is down four straight quarters. Sales are down 16 frames in a row. Why invest in it?
"
355,GILD,"Dodson: My only defense is that Warren Buffett owns a lot more than I do. I first bought it at the end of 2013. I expected it to turn around as they cut emphasis on hardware. At some point, growth in (consulting and) software will offset declines in hardware. But it hasn't happened yet. At 10.7 times (forward) earnings, we believe share price is on the bargain table.IBD: Is Buffett selling?Dodson: No. We look when there's a filing, but we've seen no sign of (Buffett selling). I'm sure he's having the same regrets I have.IBD: W.W. Grainger's (GWW) EPS and sales finally notched gains after declining for two quarters. But shares are not making headway.Dodson: Grainger makes everything under the sun (for maintenance). This in some sense is a play on the overall economy. If the U.S. economy can grow fast enough, Grainger will do well because its products touch almost every sector of the economy.IBD: Gilead Sciences' (GILD) EPS and revenue growth have slowed in recent quarters. Do you still like this stock?Dodson: I was expecting sales to increase quite a bit for their hepatitis C product. But they had to cut prices because of competition. Both AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK) make therapies for hep C. Gilead is a great lab. They will develop new therapies. In time, the company should do well.IBD: This fund began with a different name. Why the name change, Jerry?Dodson: The way we pick stocks hasn't changed. We started out as the Workplace Fund. We had good performance early on, but the name Workplace Fund was not getting the attention we thought it should.People on our staff said we got strange reactions from brokers and advisors, who weren't sure what the name meant. ""Why not pick a more general name?"" they said. They said that would get more shareholder money, more acceptance.IBD: And why is the fund concentrated?Dodson: Primarily because I can't find enough companies that are undervalued that meet the workplace and social criteria.IBD: The fund has 25 names. How typical is that?Dodson: We would like to have 35 to 40 names. We're looking for more. The last couple years we went down to 25 or so.IBD: The fund had an 11% cash weighting as of May 31. Was that because it's hard to find your kind of stocks?Dodson: That's correct. I try to stay as fully invested as possible.IBD: Jerry, make my day: Before running this fund, did you run a totally non-PC fund -- you know, one that only invests in ammo, tobacco, oil?Dodson: Before Endeavor, I managed each of six (including one that no longer exists) other Parnassus funds prior to finding a manager for each of them. I founded Parnassus Investments in 1984. Prior to that, I worked for six years as president of a small bank in San Francisco. Before that, I spent four years as a foreign service officer with the Department of State, serving in Panama and Vietnam.IBD: What was your investment style before you embraced ESG?Dodson: We've embraced ESG since the firm was founded. It was one of our founding principles.IBD: What got you into ESG?Dodson: My personal philosophy had always revolved around ESG, but I wasn't sure it could be used as a business philosophy. At Continental, I started a program to allow savers to put their money into special savings accounts that would be lent out for solar energy installations. Much to my pleasant surprise, the program was very popular.It convinced me that there was a market out there for investors who wanted to make a positive impact with their money. This led to the founding of Working Assets Money Fund (1983-1984), which took ESG factors into account in investing in money market securities.This, in turn, led to the formation of Parnassus Investments.I took the ESG from my experience, then added the value-oriented philosophy of Benjamin Graham, whose writings I admired. These two strains formed the basis of the Parnassus investment philosophy.IBD: How did you come up with the Parnassus name?Dodson: I lived on a street near Parnassus Avenue in San Francisco. I looked up the mythology around Mount Parnassus in Greece and discovered it was the site of the Oracle of Delphi. I liked the image of the oracle often going against the prevailing wisdom. It fit my contrarian, value-oriented investment philosophy.IBD: Since you're 73, do you have plans to retire?Dodson: I plan to retire as chief executive officer in 2018 at 75. However, I plan to stay on indefinitely as manager of Endeavor until I find someone well-qualified to take over.

362,GILD,"The Treasury Department's annual financial review of Medicare found that its growth rate won't trigger a cost-cutting panel this week, sending drug stocks higher Wednesday.Ahead of the report on Tuesday, speculation had broken out that growth could be high enough to trigger an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to come up with ways to cut spending. The Brookings Institution had scheduled an event Thursday to discuss the issue.""Last year's report projected that the hospital insurance trust fund would be depleted by 2030 -- just 14 years from now,"" Brookings' website said. ""The report also predicted a more immediate and controversial event: The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), famously nicknamed 'death panels,' would be required to submit proposals to reduce Medicare spending in 2018, with the reductions taking place in 2019.""The report of the Medicare Board of Trustees actually moved the depletion date two years earlier, but it said that there still wasn't enough growth in costs to trigger an IPAB. That seemed to turn around the major medical groups: biotech stocks had headed south Tuesday afternoon, but after the mid-morning announcement IBD's Medical-Biotech group rose 1.35%. The Ethical Drugs group was up 0.6%.Even if an IPAB had been triggered, analysts doubted the impact would have been that big, given the restrictions on the sort of cuts the panel could make. Late Tuesday, RBC Capital Markets' Michael Yee ran the numbers:""We note 8 million to 10 million 'dual eligibles' added to 50 million 60 million Medicaid patients, thus growing by 20%,"" Yee wrote in his research note. ""Taking Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) Medicaid exposure (10-20%) and growing it by 20% to get the larger Medicaid '23% rebate,' our calculations show that this would change revenues by no more than 1% or so if this happened.""Celgene stock, which fell 2.5% in heavy trading Tuesday, rose more than 3% intraday, closing 2.45% at 99.23 on the stock market today. Regeneron stock climbed 4% intraday, setting for a 2% rise to 351.92 after dropping 2.1% Tuesday. Amgen and Biogen shares rose fractionally after both sank nearly 1% Tuesday.Despite the timing of it all, though, hedge fund manager Leonard Yaffe wasn't convinced that the IPAB business was the actual reason for the stock moves, as biotechs had been trending downward since early June.""The rebound in biopharma stocks today is much more than offsetting the concerns mentioned yesterday, as well as the likelihood of fund redemptions; the stocks had become very attractive, and the prospects for several companies are bright,"" Yaffe wrote in an email.

363,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Apple (AAPL) led the S&P 500 with the largest amount spent on stock buybacks in the first quarter, which in total set a nine-year high as companies sought to boost their stock price in a slumping market, according to the S&P Dow Jones Indices.Gilead spent $8 billion, up from the $3.1 billion it spent in the prior quarter. Apple spent $6.7 billion, slightly down from its prior quarter's $6.9 billion.Companies in the S&P 500 spent a total of $161.4 billion in stock buybacks in Q1, up 12% from Q1 2015. It was the second-largest expenditure on record, following the $172 billion spent in Q3 2007, as reported by the S&P Dow Jones Indices.The information technology sector continued to dominate buybacks. Following Apple in the IT sector were Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and Alphabet (GOOGL). Microsoft spent $3.85 billion, with Oracle at $2.2 billion and Alphabet at $2 billion.Following Gilead and Apple as the biggest spenders, General Electric (GE) was No. 3 at $6.3 billion, then came Pfizer (PFE) at $5 billion and McDonalds (MCD) at $4.3 billion. Microsoft was No. 6 overall.For the ninth consecutive quarter, more than 20% of the S&P 500 companies reduced their year-over-year diluted share count by at least 4%, thereby boosting their earnings per share by at least 4%.""The pace of buybacks was partially driven by companies supporting their stock during the opening downturn of the year, which coincidentally started in early February when many earnings lock-ups ended,"" said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a statement announcing the Q1 tally.""The upswing in both expenditures and participation appears to persist in the market, meaning that the upturn in Q4 was not a single-shot,"" he saidAccording to Silverblatt, cash reserves set a record, increasing 1.6% to $1.347 trillion. That topped the prior record $1.333 trillion set at the end of 2014. Silverblatt adds that the current cash level is 86 weeks of expected 2016 operating income, giving corporations leeway in their expenditures.Among the two buyback leaders, Apple stock rose 3% in Q1, ending the quarter at 108.99, Apple stock was down a fraction to 95.55 at the close on the stock market today.Gilead shrank 9% in Q1, ending the quarter at 91.86.

365,GILD,"Drugmaker Medivation (MDVN) said late Tuesday that it has entered into confidentiality agreements with several potential buyers, including Sanofi (SNY), after the latter raised its bid for the company.Medivation had previously rejected Sanofi's bid of $52.50 a share in cash as inadequate, leading Sanofi in late May to propose eight candidates to take over Medivation's board. On Tuesday, Medivation said that the board had also rejected an offer of $58 a share plus a Contingent Value Right (CVR) on sales of Medivation's drug candidate talazoparib for up to $3 a share.Nonetheless, Medivation went ahead and entered a confidentiality agreement with Sanofi, along with an unspecified number of other unnamed parties.""The confidentiality agreements include customary six-month standstill provisions, subject to limited early termination events, and Medivation expects to provide each party the opportunity in the near term to review non-public information and meet with Medivation's management,"" said Medivation's press release.In early May, anonymously sourced reports said that Medivation had entered into confidentiality agreements with Pfizer (PFE) and Amgen (AMGN). Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and AstraZeneca (AZN) also have been leaked as prospective buyers.Tuesday's announcement was leaked to Reuters about a half an hour before the market closed, sending Medivation stock up 2.7% to 61.76. Shares were up a fraction after hours. The stock has been forming a flat base since it hit an 11-month high on May 9, the day the Pfizer/Amgen news came out. It holds the No. 50 spot on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks over the past 12 months.On Friday, Medivation scheduled a conference call for Wednesday after the market close, which it said will focus on talazoparib. The drug, in late-stage development for breast cancer, belongs to a class of drugs called Parp inhibitors, which got a boost last week when biotech Tesaro (TSRO) announced a surprise success for its Parp inhibitor for ovarian cancer.

366,GILD,"Drug pricing was on Wall Street's mind again Friday, as Wells Fargo tapped Mylan (MYL) as the next target for activists, while RBC considered the impact of a potential new law limiting prices in California.Wells Fargo analyst David Maris wrote that after Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Turing Pharmaceuticals were hauled in front of Congress and scrutinized by the press for their policies of drastically hiking the prices of recently acquired drugs, he's been keeping an eye out for other companies in his universe that have been doing a lot of price increases.""In the last six months, Mylan has raised prices more than 20% on 24 products, and more than 100% on seven products,"" Maris wrote in his research note late Thursday. ""Mylan has taken some exceptionally large price increases in 2016, including a 542% increase for ursodiol, a generic medication used to treat gallstones; a 444% increase in metoclopramide, a generic medication commonly used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and gastroparesis; and a 400% increase in dicyclomine, a medication used to treat irritable bowel syndrome.""Maris added that last month Mylan added 15% to the price tag of its biggest product, which contributed 11% of revenue in the most recent quarter. ""We believe that given the regulatory environment, these pricing actions could bring greater regulatory scrutiny and headline risk. Additionally, we wonder if aggressive price increases are being used to make EPS targets or to offset disappointing sales in other areas.""Mylan responded with the following statement:""Mylan has always been known to have one of the industry's broadest and most globally diversified business models and portfolios, which we have successfully managed by balancing numerous variables, including the natural price reductions that have always been inherent to the generics industry. A flawed analysis focusing on a small number of products out of the more than 1,400 products Mylan sells globally and the approx. 600 products we sell in North America is simply self-serving and misleading to investors. This is especially true given that these generic products represent an extremely small percentage of Mylan's approx. $4 billion North American generics business. Mylan's business model is not today, nor has it ever been, premised on price hikes.""Mylan stock fell 2.7% to 44.53 on the stock market today after falling as low as 43. Valeant retreated 5.3% Friday and 16.4% for the week.RBC Capital Markets biotech analyst Michael Yee was also pondering drug pricing Friday as he calculated the potential impact of the California Drug Price Relief Act (CDPRA) on the stocks in his universe, which include Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX).The CDPRA, which goes up for popular vote under California's proposition system this November, would require state health care payers like MediCal to buy drugs at similar prices to the Veterans Administration, which usually obtains large discounts.""We believe CDPRA creates a slippery slope: The measure would encourage other states to follow suit (e.g. Ohio has also proposed it and is getting signatures),"" Yee wrote. ""But we think such attempts to reduce drug costs would merely prompt drug makers to just raise VA drug prices, thus helping less people and not resulting in any real savings benefits.""Nonetheless, Yee estimated that if similar laws passed in all 50 states, it could shave 2% to 3% off the annual EPS of his covered companies. ""Our discussions with large-cap biotech companies suggest firms are aware and wouldn't be surprised if the proposal passed, so we note investors should at the very least be informed of the potential headline and model pricing risks,"" he wrote.Drug stocks were down Friday along with the rest of the market. Amgen fell 1.3%, Gilead 1.5%, Biogen 1.7% and Celgene 3%, and Vertex Pharma dipped 1.1%.

377,GILD,"Staying on top of the stock market involves more than knowing whether the stocks in your portfolio are rising or falling.What else is there to check? How about a sector count of the IBD 50?The IBD 50 is a computer-generated list of the stocks with the strongest fundamentals and technicals. Breaking down the IBD 50 with a sector count can give you an idea of where the strength resides in the stock market.In the list published in IBD Weekly for the week of June 13, the sector breakdown looked like this: Nine stocks from the medical sector; six in software; five each in retail, building and chips; and three for internet. Other sectors involved only one or two stocks.The first question we might ask is this: How does this compare with the IBD 50 lineup at the start of the year?At the end of 2015, there were eight medical stocks; six from the software sector; five in finance; four each in retail and business services; and three each from banks and chips.At first glance, there appear to be similarities. The medical, software, retail and chip counts stayed about the same.However, we need to ask a second question: Has rotation occurred within the sector?The medical sector shows the biggest change, despite an essentially unchanged count. For example, at the end of 2015, the biotechs were well into a downward trend. Former leaders such as Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) peaked in the first half of 2015. By the end of 2015, only three biotechs were in the IBD 50. And in the recent IBD 50, two biotechs made the list, but they were not the big winners of the previous up cycle. The two stocks are Medivation (MDVN) and Emergent BioSolutions (EBS).Could they be leaders of a biotech rebound? Possible but unlikely: Only four biotechs have a Composite Rating of 90 or better -- the two mentioned above, along with Anika Therapeutics (ANIK) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) .Software stocks have been a steady story. Four software stocks in the IBD 50 at the end of 2015 are still in the list. In the building sector, only one stock made the IBD 50 at the end of 2015. Now there are five, but none of them are homebuilders.Retail is a mix of fresh names and old names. Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) were in the IBD 50 at the end of the year and are in it now. Two stocks left the list -- Alibaba (BABA) and Starbucks (SBUX).Alibaba has a Relative Price Strength Rating of 65, meaning that a hefty 35% of the market is outperforming the China-based stock. Also, earnings growth decelerated over the past three quarters, and the Street has revised annual earnings lower for this year and next.Starbucks also has struggled since departing the IBD 50. The RS Rating is a miserable 37. Annual earnings revisions, however, are upward. Quarterly earnings growth has been steady, though revenue growth has stepped down.The other current retail stocks in the IBD 50 are Five Below (FIVE), Copart (CPRT) and Dollar General (DG).Sometimes a sector check won't lead to many big conclusions. Aside from the rotation in the medical sector and the increase in the building sector, the changes appear minimal.

378,GILD,"Small drugmaker Medivation (MDVN) continued to battle Sanofi's (SNY) hostile takeover bid Wednesday as the latter tried to replace its board, while big biotechs Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) were said to be thinking of joining the fray.Sanofi proposed eight candidates ""who are willing to fully and fairly evaluate all of Medivation’s strategic options,"" which it believes Medivation's current board did not do when it unanimously rejected Sanofi's unsolicited $9.3 billion bid on April 29. Medivation responded with a statement urging shareholders to reject the attempt, which it called ""a tactic for Sanofi to facilitate its substantially inadequate and opportunistically timed proposal to acquire Medivation.""While Sanofi is the only suitor that's gone public, anonymous sources have been telling the media that a variety of other companies are thinking of making a bid. On May 9, Medivation reportedly signed non-disclosures agreements with Pfizer (PFE) and Amgen (AMGN), implying that it is open to being bought by somebody other than Sanofi. On Wednesday Bloomberg said that Celgene and Gilead were talking to advisors about the idea, though they hadn't actually approached the company.Both Celgene and Gilead have been urged by investors and analysts to make a sizable acquisition -- especially Gilead, as its massive hepatitis C franchise is already eroding in the face of competition. Medivation's current $1 billion in 12-month sales wouldn't make that big of an impact on Gilead's $33 billion top line, but much of the interest comes from Medivation's future prospects: its prostate-cancer drug Xtandi is still ramping while the company studies its use in other diseases, and it also has a few earlier-stage drugs in the pipeline.Medivation stock, which has lately gone tight after a sharp run-up amid the buyout speculation, fell 0.7% to 61.48 on the stock market today. Sanofi climbed 1.8% to 40.94. Gilead edged up 0.8% to 86.51 and Celgene was up 1.4% to 105.11.

379,GILD,"Most stock mutual funds in May extended the rally that began in March. And some strategists are figuring ways to deal with expected stock market headwinds in the summer months.The average diversified U.S. stock fund in May rose 1.55% vs. setbacks in January and February, followed by a 6.50% rally in March and a 0.48% inch-up in April, leaving it 1.92% higher year to date. By comparison, the S&P 500 advanced 1.80% in May.Going forward, most investors who spoke with IBD expect market volatility into the summer. But they're ready.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersLew Piantedosi, manager of four Eaton Vance mutual funds with total assets of $1.2 billion, has a guardedly optimistic, glass-half-full outlook. ""We believe in a core portfolio of secular growers,"" he said. ""Those include names like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL).""Another such name he likes is NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). ""They provide semiconductor content to the automobile and industrial spaces,"" said Piantedosi, who is a manager of Focused Growth (ELCIX), Focused Growth Opportunities (EIFGX), Tax-Managed Growth (EITGX) and Tax-Managed Multi-Cap Growth (EACPX). ""There's a huge secular shift in those areas toward automation and other new technologies that are driving demand for new semiconductor content.""He added, ""In cars, the new features include crash avoidance, music, rear-view cameras, driver-assisted sensors, other safety systems and an overall trend toward electrical vehicles."" In industrial products, there's a comparable shift into robotics and other forms of automation, he said. ""In both areas, NXP is a leading provider,"" he said.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceAmong more cautious investors, with a glass-half-empty view, is James Wong, lead manager of $716 million Payden Equity Income Fund (PYVLX). ""I'm bracing for volatility,"" he said. ""We're entering the summer, when it does not take a lot of bad news to move the market. So, because I'm an equity income investor, I will drink my own Kool-Aid and say investors would be served well by focusing on companies that continue to provide income in a low-volatility manner.""Theme-parks operator Six Flags Entertainment (SIX) is the sort of stock he likes right now. ""They came out of bankruptcy at the start of this decade,"" Wong said. ""They're improving their revenue stream. Management has improved the quality of their parks and introduced new rides. They've increased membership rates, which means people go more often and spend more money. And they've introduced go-to-the-front-of-the-line passes that people gobble up.""The changes have helped. ""They've improved their recurring-revenue model,"" Wong said. ""So they're a steady-cash-generating company, able to maintain and grow their 4% dividend yield.""The market notched a modest gain in May because investors were emboldened by stock market news that turned out to be less scary than they had feared at the month's outset, Wong said.""Earnings season was negative, but not as bad as people had expected,"" Wong said. The prospect of a ""Brexit"" -- a U.K. exit from the European Union -- faded slightly, he added. And the price of oil rose, from just under $46 a barrel on April 29 to just over $49 on May 31.In addition, many investors grew more comfortable with the prospect of an interest-rate hike as soon as June or July.Small-cap growth funds led by tacking on 2.46% in May.Science and technology funds paced sectors by jumping 4.83%. ""When investors are optimistic, they gravitate toward growthier areas of the market,"" Piantedosi said. ""That's tech.""World equity funds fared far worse, losing 0.35%.Japanese funds did best abroad, gaining 2.38%.Taxable bond funds lost 0.14%. U.S. Treasury funds edged up 0.19%. Tax-exempt funds gained 0.55%.May capped a streak of three months in a row of market gains. ""The fear that dominated at the start of the year kept fading in May,"" Piantedosi said.He added, ""U.S. consumers have been strong. Housing was robust. Europe was looking better.""In the near term, investors will focus on day-to-day events such as the Brexit decision, Federal Reserve meetings, November's U.S. elections, monthly jobless reports and the monthly Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), an indicator of the health of the manufacturing sector.Amid all of that noise, remember that the Fed will raise rates because it sees signs of a strengthening U.S. economy. ""And that should help corporate earnings,"" said Karyn Cavanaugh, the senior market strategist for Voya Investment Management and a member of its multiasset strategies and solutions group. ""At the end of the day, stock buying boils down to buying corporate earnings.""Cavanaugh expects an uptick in corporate earnings in Q3 and Q4. Still, if that fails to occur, don't expect U.S. consumer spending to stay strong, warned Cavanaugh, who is also a manager of $39 million Voya Global Perspectives (IWPVX).Wong, for one, says the market's winning streak is likely to end. Valuations are high and earnings growth is weak, he noted.Piantedosi expects disruptive innovators to continue to grab market share. So he likes Amazon instead of brick-and-mortar department stores. Macy's (M), Dillard's (DDS) and Kohl's (KSS) all reported lower quarterly earnings per share in May. All suffered stock-price declines.Amazon reported a 992% EPS gain in April, accelerating from 122% and 118% in the prior two frames. Shares gained 10% in May.He likes Facebook and Google for similar reasons. ""The huge shift continues in advertising (spending) from traditional media to online and social media,"" he said.Ditto for health care. Despite political talk about potential drug-price regulation, he's bullish in the long term on big-cap biotechs like Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX). ""Who knows how the pricing issue will shake out,"" he said. ""But there's plenty of growth in these companies as they continue to innovate.""Piantedosi is not confining bets to high-flyers. ""In any diversified portfolio, you don't want to be pedal-to-the-metal at all times,"" he said. ""Some names in consumer staples, while not cheap, provide stability and predictability and yield.""Philip Morris International (PM) is a favorite. He said, ""It is 100% focused overseas, where the anti-smoking headwind is less than in the U.S. It has a lot of pricing power. The currency headwind is (diminishing) and likely to turn to a tailwind.""Its dividend yield is 4.1%.Pinnacle Foods (PF) is another he likes. ""It's a nice Steady Eddie food company with decent growth characteristics in a food group that doesn't show great characteristics,"" he said.Pinnacle's dividend yield is 2.4%.

380,GILD,"Specialty drugmaker Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) said Monday that it is acquiring small biopharma Celator Pharmaceuticals (CPXX) for $1.5 billion in cash, sending the latter's already-surging stock soaring.Celator went public in November 2013 and failed to make an impression on the stock market until last March 14, when it reported positive late-stage trial results for Vyxeos, its treatment for high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Vyxeos is a co-formulation of the chemotherapy drugs cytarabine and daunorubicin, using Celator's proprietary CombiPlex platform. In the trial, it extended overall survival for longer than the two drugs administered separately.The following day the stock popped from below 2 to near 9 and continued to climb after that, closing at 17.53 on Friday. Jazz agreed to a substantial premium on that, of 30.25 a share, noting that Vyxeos is set to have seven years' exclusivity through the FDA's orphan drug designation.""As Celator is currently preparing a regulatory submission in the U.S. for Vyxeos, this acquisition would add a new orphan product with the potential for short- and long-term revenue generation and expansion of our international commercial platform,"" Jazz CEO Bruce Cozadd said in a statement.Vyxeos is expected to hit the market in late 2017.""Assuming sell-side consensus forecasts of $220 million by 2021 are directionally accurate, Jazz is paying four times peak sales of $350 million to $400 million for the de-risked indication which looks relatively fair, but Jazz could generate upside either from (1) higher secondary AML sales or (2) through expanding the Vyxeos label into other AML patient populations and other blood cancers,"" wrote Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry in a research note.Celator stock closed up 71.6% on the stock market today, reaching 30.08. Jazz stock dipped 0.35% to 151.56.Jazz already has a small presence in blood cancer with Erwinase, a chemotherapy program for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but its main source of income is narcolepsy treatment Xyrem, whose aging patents are under challenge. With its Q1 earnings report this month, Jazz announced a settlement with two of its generic challengers, but other cases remain outstanding.Also in its 10-Q filing Jazz revealed that it had received a federal subpoena to investigate its relationship with co-pay support charities, a subject of growing interest to legal authorities lately, due to allegations that they support high drug prices. Big biotechs Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) have also been targeted with similar subpoenas.
"
381,GILD,"Big biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) agreed to license an immunology drug from smaller counterpart Galapagos (GLPG) Thursday in a deal that could be worth more than $2 billion.Galapagos' drug is filgotinib, which is due to start phase three trials in rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease next year. Gilead agreed to pay a $300 million license fee and buy $425 million in Galapagos stock upfront, and promised up to $1.35 billion in milestone payments should the drug succeed in clearing the regulatory process. If it launches, Gilead will pay a tiered royalty starting at 20% of sales and split the profits.Filgotinib is a JAK1 inhibitor, a class that AbbVie (ABBV) and several other drugmakers are developing. AbbVie once had its own licensing deal with Galapagos but in September opted out of its right to license filgotinib so it could focus on developing its in-house drug.At the time, AbbVie cited a rat study indicating that filgotinib could be toxic to the testicles, leading Galapagos into discussions with the FDA before it could proceed with the new trials. However, the phase two results in humans were positive and competitive with other rheumatoid arthritis drugs in development, wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a research note. He added that in Crohn's disease the results seem to lag Celgene's (CELG) GED-0301, ""although (it's) hard to compare cross-trial, different geographies.""Galapagos stock jumped 7% in early trading on the stock market today but by midafternoon was down more than 2%.

413,GILD,"The long-awaited report from the Senate Finance committee on Gilead Sciences' (GILD) pricing of its hepatitis C drugs came out Tuesday, and as expected, it was highly critical.Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said in the spring of 2014 that they would investigate Gilead's pricing policies after Gilead priced its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi at $84,000 for a 12-week regimen. Their criticism of the price led Gilead and nearly every other biotech stock into a brief nose-dive, though the group recovered until presidential candidate Hillary Clinton raised the drug-pricing issue more broadly this September.In Tuesday's report, the senators said they'd examined more than 20,000 pages of internal Gilead documents and interviewed dozens of health care experts to conclude that Gilead priced Sovaldi, and its successor Harvoni, for maximum profit rather than broad access. They said that, in fact, Gilead had underestimated how much health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers would restrict access.""When confronted with the widespread initiation of access restrictions, Gilead refused to offer substantial discounts and did not significantly modify its contracting strategy to improve patient access,"" the senators went on in their press release summarizing the report's findings. ""For example, Gilead offered Medicaid programs supplemental rebates of up to 10 percent; however, its offer came with the precondition that states had to drop some or all of their access restrictions.""For states already facing a steep financial burden, accepting that precondition in most cases would have increased the budgetary impact rather than easing it.""The senators admitted that the price of both Sovaldi and Harvoni had dropped after AbbVie (ABBV) launched its competing treatment last December, but said that ""concerns remain, particularly in the public payer community, about high costs for treating millions of people in the U.S. infected with Hepatitis C, as well as the budgetary effects of a future single source innovator that might not face competition as quickly.""Not surprisingly, Gilead disagreed with these conclusions.""Around the world, more than 600,000 individuals have been treated with Gilead's HCV medications since their introductions in 2013 and 2014,"" Gilead said in an emailed statement. ""Gilead responsibly and thoughtfully priced Sovaldi and Harvoni.""The products were initially priced in line with the previous standards of care. With the rebates and discounts now in place, the prices today are less than the cost of prior regimens, even though our therapies have significantly higher cure rates and very few side effects.""Gilead stock reacted little to the news, dipping a fraction in late-afternoon on the stock market today.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

414,GILD,"Investors in ETFs are starting to show appetite for risk after lavishing money on defensive, dividend-paying stocks for months on end. And few segments of the stock market have fed such cravings as much as biotech.SPDR S&P Biotechnology (XBI) jumped 6.7% in the past week through Thursday, as growth stocks began to act better. It's up 8.8% quarter to date. But after a steep sell-off for biotechs in the first quarter, XBI sits 38% below its 52-week high.Still, some market watchers think the biotech group could strike a winning note again.The flow of investor money is said to follow performance. XBI certainly needs it -- it has leaked $179.2 million in the second quarter so far, and assets have shrunk nearly 17% in 2016 to $1.88 billion.This biotech ETF is for the investor who's hungry for returns and not afraid to take on more risk.""The portfolio is skewed more toward smaller-cap, early-stage biotech firms, which have decidedly uncertain prospects but explosive upside potential,"" writes Morningstar analyst Robert Goldsborough.XBI holds three highly rated IBD stocks that are spearheading the recent rebound in the biotech group:Ligand has grown earnings at an annual rate of 113% in the past three years, with sales up 28%. It has a 97 IBD Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99, thanks in part to its 30% share price jump over the past three months and heavy institutional buying.While earnings growth slowed in the most recent quarter, it averaged 150% over the past three stanzas. Sales growth accelerated in the last three quarters.The drugmaker is embroiled in fending off Sanofi's (SNY) hostile takeover bid. Biotech giants Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) were also said to be possibly joining the fray.The company plans to separate into two publicly traded companies. One company will focus on biodefense products, while the other will revolve around oncology and hematology therapeutics.Emergent has a three-year EPS growth rate of 35% and a three-year sales growth rate of 29%. That helps it to a Comp Rating of 96.Ligand, Medivation and Emergent are among 88 stocks in the XBI portfolio.XBI is one of the cheapest biotech ETFs, with a 0.35% expense ratio.It has produced a 15.4% annual average gain over the past two years vs. 8.1% for the flagship iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB).IBB is cap-weighted and skews toward larger players in the biotech industry, including Celgene and Gilead.

""While management believes that HCV products have stabilized (the U.S. market share is at about 90%), we are not so sure.""Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges lowered his price target on Gilead to 123 from 127 but maintained an outperform rating. He noted that the company still has a huge reserve of cash, and wrote that the HCV franchise was eroding earlier then expected but it was presumed to decline in a few years anyway.""As a result, our EPS estimates fall 8%-10% through 2017, but only 3% beyond,"" he wrote in his research note.UBS analyst Marc Goodman also kept his buy rating while lowering his price target to 118 from 130, writing that he's ""willing to have a little patience.""""The (HCV) category still has years ahead of stable patients,"" Goodman wrote. ""The issue remains; what's next? ... At this valuation, we will try to remain patient.""Gilead stock was down 7.5% in afternoon trading on the stock market today, below 90.On the positive side for Gilead, the company said Friday that the EU's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, which advises Europe's equivalent of the FDA, had endorsed approving Odefsey, the company's newest four-drug combo pill for HIV. The combo includes TAF, known on Wall Street as ""son of Viread"" as it represents an upgraded version of Gilead's legacy blockbuster Viread, which is due to go off patent in the near future.
"
416,GILD,"Big-cap drugmakers Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Merck (MRK) were moving in opposite directions in Thursday trading after their Q1 earnings reports, though both companies raised guidance.Regeneron's quarterly revenue rose 38% over the year-earlier period to $1.2 billion, beating analysts' consensus by about $240 million, according to Thomson Reuters. Earnings of $2.57 a share were a penny short of estimates and down 11% from last year's Q1.But on the crucial metric of U.S. sales of flagship drug Eylea, Regeneron reported 44% growth to $781 million, beating consensus by $11 million, and the company raised its full-year growth estimate to 20% to 25% vs. its previous 20%.The earnings miss stemmed from higher spending for selling, general and administrative costs, though spending guidance for the year remained unchanged.Also, cholesterol drug Praluent, which was launched last July, missed consensus again, but its numbers remained small ($13 million) as the company awaited the results of a cardiovascular outcomes trial of both Praluent and rival Amgen's (AMGN) Repatha later this year. Regeneron said that payer coverage for Praluent is good so far, with 74% of the commercially insured and 91% of those on Medicare having access to the drug.Regeneron stock was up 5% in midday trading on the stock market today, near 380.Merck posted earnings of 89 cents a share, up 5% from the year-earlier period and beating consensus by 4 cents. Sales declined 1% to $9.31 billion, missing Wall Street's number by $150 million. Merck stock was down 1.5% midday Thursday, near 54.Merck added a few cents to its 2016 EPS guidance range, now $2.65 to $3.77, and also raised the low end of its revenue guidance, now $39 billion to $40.2 billion. Echoing a number of global pharmas this earnings season, Merck cited improving foreign-exchange rates.The revenue shortfall was spread around a number of different drugs, including blockbuster diabetes drug Januvia and immunology drug Remicade. More interesting to analysts was up-and-coming cancer drug Keytruda, which missed estimates in the U.S. but beat slightly worldwide, especially after rival Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo beat consensus last week.Bristol-Myers also moved up its reporting date for a trial of Opdivo as a first-line treatment for lung cancer to Q3 from its previously guided Q4, eroding the advantage for Merck, which expects to report results for a similar trial of Keytruda at midyear. Both drugs are now approved only for previously treated patients, so first-line approval could significantly expand the market.Merck also reported $50 million in sales for its hepatitis C drug Zepatier, which just launched in late January. Although that's tiny compared with the $2.1 billion reported by market leader Gilead Sciences (GILD), both Gilead and AbbVie (ABBV) said on their earnings calls last week that Merck's aggressive discounting had affected their own businesses.Nonetheless, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee wrote that this may not have been directly responsible for Gilead's miss.""(Merck) suggested negotiations for important parity access remain ongoing, with the exception of the Veterans Administration (10% of the market), which they have good access on ... but interestingly suggested many of the commercial payor access deals are for 2017 impact, since 2016 contracts were already completed,"" Yee wrote in a research note. ""So what Gilead said about their lower sales in U.S. (being) mostly due to just higher gross-to-net from healthier patients coming in (not so much from competition) could be true, realizing price competition is still ongoing and coming and needs to be watched.""

417,GILD,"After being one of the worst-performing sectors since last summer, biotechnology firms have shown a few encouraging signs since March.ETF flow into the sector was a positive $480 million in March, according to Mizuho Securities USA data. Then, the last two weeks of April saw an additional $454 million inflow, trimming outflow for the month to a net $239 million.""There are 14 biotech ETFs in total, controlling almost $10 billion of assets, and in the first two months -- because it was a risk-off momentum across the board -- $2.1 billion departed,"" said Monish Shah, Mizuho Securities USA executive director and head of ETF trading. ""In the last week (of April), which was again a risk-off momentum, biotech ETFs did not see a major outflow technically.""So is this a propitious time to start looking at biotech ETFs again?Flows into biotech ETFs were a positive $23 million in the second week of May, but that gave way to a $39 million outflow in the third week, through Thursday.Shah advises investors to be careful in the near term, even though the sector's long-term prospect is good. ""The trend seems to be holding up, but I advise near-term caution, because there are many positive as well as some negative factors.""The two largest biotech ETFs, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) and SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) were in the positive flow territory through the end of April, adding a net $221 million and $85 million, respectively. The $6.2 billion IBB is down 1.06% in the past three months, and the $1.7 billion XBI is up 5%. They are still a respective 35% and 42% below their 52-week highs.IBB has slipped below its 50-day moving average, a bearish sign, while XBI is testing resistance at its own 50-day line.Next in line are $821 million First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech ETF (FBT) and $511 million VanEck Vectors Biotech ETF (BBH). They're up roughly a respective 4% and 1% in the past three months. However, FBT experienced strong outflow each of the first four months of 2016, resulting in a net outflow of $1.75 billion. BHH saw some positive flow in April, but ended with a net $57 million outflow over the same period.As with the first two funds, FBT and BBH are also both testing resistance at their 50-day lines.A series of positive factors are, however, in the pipeline for biotechs. ""The P/E ratios have been coming down. That may suggest to some investors that stocks are more reasonably valued,"" said Michael Cohick, ETF product manager at Van Eck Global. He also notes that biotechs are poised to benefit from the continuing demographic factors of an aging population. Also, with the Affordable Care Act, more people are now covered by insurance and can afford some of the new therapies.""That, along with the incredible continued innovation that's coming out of the companies in the sector themselves, I think may point to potential entry points,"" said Cohick.That said, the sector is known for displaying very high volatility. ""From terrible terrible negative performance in January to slightly negative in February (to a positive performance in March and April for the VanEck Vectors Biotech ETF), ... the short-term performance story has returned,"" said Cohick. ""But I would suggest investors should always continue to monitor the biotech company earnings, as well as the M&A activity.""That's why he prefers a concentrated portfolio of the 25 largest and most liquid biotech stocks, such as represented in BBH. ""If you want the safety of the larger companies, it may be a better way to play the sector,"" he said.The fund's top holdings are Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Medivation (MDVN), together representing about 45% of the fund's assets.

418,GILD,"In factor investing with ETFs, the sum may be more than the parts.To be sure, single-factor exchange traded funds have dominated recently. Specifically, strategies to smooth the ride in a bumpy stock market.Investors have poured $5.28 billion in new money into iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA (USMV) so far this year -- or more than a third of the $12.97 billion in assets that it holds. That's made it the No. 1 equity ETF in terms of net inflow.However, the average investor may not fully grasp the risk-reward trade-off tied to single factors, says Rob Nestor, head of iShares smart beta.Low volatility ETFs have historically offered protection in down markets.  But they tend to underperform in market rallies, taking away from their returns over a full market cycle. An investor seeking to beat the market may end up feeling short-changed.Investors should not expect low volatility ETFs to outperform the market over a full market cycle. They should use low volatility strategies to reduce risk and to aim for a smoother ride, Nestor says.Nestor believes multifactor ETFs may be a good choice for many investors.""The multifactor approach is for the investor who wants to outperform, but not on a highly volatile path,"" Nestor said.Certain stock characteristics or ""factors"" -- such as size, quality, value and momentum -- have historically rewarded investors. They're also very lowly correlated to one another. So while the factors can be volatile individually, they help to reduce overall portfolio risk when combined, according to Nestor.Basically, multifactor ETFs aim to offer market risk with higher returns. Low or minimum volatility ETFs offer the market return with less risk.Multifactor ETFs have proliferated as investors seek to both outperform and manage risk. More than two dozen multifactor ETFs have launched within the past year from multiple issuers.IShares Edge MSCI Multifactor USA (LRGF) has racked up assets of $86.2 million in just over a year since its launch. LRGF focuses on financially healthy firms (quality), inexpensive stocks (value), smaller companies (size) and trending stocks (momentum).Its 141 large- and midcap holdings include Accenture (ACN), TJX Cos. (TJX) and Gilead (GILD).This month, iShares launched nine new multifactor ETFs focused on equity sectors such as technology and finance.John Hancock also offers a multifactor ETF suite.According to ETF firm Global X, the four multifactor funds in its ""Scientific Beta"" suite have all outperformed their market-cap-weighted benchmarks, with lower volatility, since launch. Global X Scientific Beta Japan (SCIJ) was down 0.3% year to date through May 19 vs. a 4.8% loss for iShares MSCI Japan (EWJ).""Multifactor funds are the latest evolution in smart beta investing,” said Jay Jacobs, director of research for Global X. “The rigorous research put into these strategies, combined with the low fees and increased tax efficiency associated with ETFs, represents an attractive alternative to expensive actively managed mutual funds.”Keep in mind that multifactor funds haven't much been tested in the real world. Jacobs also cautioned that not all multifactor ETFs are the same. He advised investors to assess the quality of the methodology. In particular, he noted that increasing a portfolio's factor exposure at the expense of diversification has been shown to result in lower risk-adjusted returns.""Multifactor ETFs backed by a methodology that adheres to academic research and seeks to maximize risk-adjusted returns are likely more appropriate as core portfolio holdings,"" he added.At CLS Investments, multifactor ETFs tend to be used in simple portfolios holding a handful of funds. Single-factor ETFs fit better in more complex portfolios.""That way we control exposures more to our liking,"" said Rusty Vanneman, CIO of the Nebraska-based firm, which manages north of $6 billion in assets.The firm emphasizes the use of factor-based, smart beta ETFs ""that will enhance performance relative to market benchmarks,"" according to Vanneman. In a low-growth climate, the firm favors high-quality stocks and accesses them through iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor (QUAL).Smart beta ETFs (also called strategic beta or alternative beta ETFs) include factor-based strategies. They typically tweak traditional indexes to boost returns, reduce risk or generate income.BlackRock projects smart beta ETF assets will reach $1 trillion globally by 2020, and $2.4 trillion by 2025. That's a 19% annual organic growth over the next five to 10 years, and double the rate of the overall ETF market.

419,GILD,"Big biotech Amgen (AMGN) beat Wall Street's Q1 estimates and raised guidance Thursday after the close, though its stock went sideways in after-hours trading. Its peer Gilead Sciences (GILD), however, was down sharply after a weak quarter.Amgen reported adjusted earnings of $2.90 a share, up 17% from the year-earlier quarter and 30 cents ahead of analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue increased 10% to $5.53 billion, more than $200 million above consensus.The company lifted its full-year guidance, though not by quite as much as the Q1 beat. Its EPS range is now $10.85 to $11.20, up from $10.60 to $11. The revenue guide is $22.2 billion to $22.6 billion, vs. $22 billion to $22.5 billion.Last year, Amgen made $10.38 in EPS on $21.66 billion in revenue.Amgen's best-selling drug Enbrel, for rheumatoid arthritis, beat expectations by growing 24% to $1.39 billion, almost $140 million above consensus, according to Evercore ISI. Its second-biggest drug Neulasta, for neutropenia, modestly beat estimates by gaining 4% to $1.18 billion.On the other hand, some of Amgen's newer drugs came up short. Cancer drug Kyprolis grew 43% but was still $19 million shy of consensus with $154 million in sales, while newly launched cholesterol drug Repatha continued its underperformance with a $16 million take.Gilead, meanwhile, reported earnings of $3.03 a share excluding one-time items, up 3% from last year's Q1 and 12 cents below Wall Street's average estimate. Revenue rose 2.6% to $7.79 billion, about $325 million below consensus.Gilead nonetheless made no change to its full-year guidance, calling for $30 billion to $31 billion in product sales and 88% to 90% gross margin.Gilead's blockbuster hepatitis C drugs Harvoni and Sovaldi accounted for most of the shortfall, though for opposite reasons: Harvoni missed badly in the U.S. but outperformed abroad, while Sovaldi did the opposite. Earlier in the day, AbbVie (ABBV) reported that Harvoni's chief competitor Viekira also came up short of consensus, which the company attributed to Merck's (MRK) unexpectedly aggressive pricing of recently launched rival Zepatier. (Merck will report its Q1 on May 5.)The quarter also brought a screeching halt to Gilead's two-year stretch of double- or triple-digit sales and profit growth, starting with the Dec. 2013 launch of Sovaldi. Analysts expect growth will totally flatten unless the company makes a transformative acquisition.Gilead stock was down more than 6% after hours Thursday, after it closed the regular session down 3.7%, at 97.

"
436,GILD,"The midstage trial, conducted by Intercept's Japanese partner Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma, divided 200 patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) into three different dosage groups taking obeticholic acid (OCA), along with a placebo group. The endpoint was an two-point improvement on a common scoring system for NASH symptoms and no worsening of liver fibrosis.
"
437,GILD,"After 72 weeks of treatment, only the highest dose of OCA (40 milligrams) met the primary endpoint. There was no difference in liver fibrosis among the different groups. There were a few patients who dropped out of the higher-dose groups because of intolerable itching.

447,GILD,"For clues about ways to fight the current up-and-down market, take a look at the investment strategy of mutual funds that have outperformed over the long haul.The $8 billion American Century Ultra Fund (TWCUX) beat 66% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past 52 weeks going into Friday. Over the past three years, the fund's 11.38% average annual gain topped 80% of its peers, which averaged 9.48%, while the S&P 500 averaged 10.41%.The fund seeks highly profitable companies that look poised to keep growing. It aims for large, industry-leading companies that have sustainable accelerating earnings growth and positive price momentum.Where does the fund expect the best odds of finding such companies? A look at the fund's portfolio weightings offers a clue: As of March 31, managers Keith Lee, Michael Li and Jeff Bourke had their key overweights in the information technology and health care sectors. In tech, the fund was finding opportunities in Internet software and services, IT services and communications equipment.The fund's top 10 holdings reflect that tilt toward tech and health care. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) were the top four as of Feb. 29. The top 10 also included health care names UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG).Social networking giant Facebook is still in a buy range from a 117.09 buy point after gapping up April 28 on strong earnings.Its recent action in the stock market is not perfect. Its IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to a C- from a worst-possible E, but the weak rating is still a sign of more recent selling than buying by mutual funds over the past 13 weeks.But earnings-per-share growth has sped up, going from 16% four quarters ago to 33%, 46% and 83% in the past three frames, respectively.And the stock's IBD Composite Rating is a solid 99. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings, with 99 being the highest.Managed health-care services provider UnitedHealth's EPS rebounded to 17% growth in the most recent stanza after falling 15% in the previous quarter.Shares are up 13% over the past 52 weeks, even after falling nearly 1% on Thursday as a federal judge ruled that the Obama administration is unconstitutionally spending federal money to fund ObamaCare.Shares of many key health care stocks went down after the decision. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer's ruling was a win for House Republicans who brought the legal challenge. The government was slated to pay $175 billion over 10 years to health insurers, lowering copayments for lower-income people.Robotic surgical system developer Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is a health care name that was unharmed by the ObamaCare ruling. Shares rose nearly 1% on Thursday. They're up more than 28% over the past 52 weeks.The stock's EPS grew a respective 34%, 20% and 24% over the past three quarters.Bank of America/Merrill Lynch recently said Intuitive was one of 16 S&P 500 stocks that could soon start paying a dividend. It cited the company's low debt compared with its industry, at least 2% of its market cap coming from cash, a stable earnings trend and EPS growth the prior fiscal year, as well as growth expected in the current year.

448,GILD,"On slate for Thursday are quarterly earnings reports from Amazon (AMZN), LinkedIn (LNKD), Baidu (BIDU) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) after the close. Before the market open, investors will get their first look at first-quarter economic growth.The e-commerce giant is expected to earn 58 cents a share in Q1, swinging to a profit from a 12-cent loss last year. Revenue is projected to climb 23% to $27.99 billion.Last quarter, Amazon fell well short of earnings estimates and came up light on revenue, sending shares down as much as 32% from their high in the following weeks. But its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, is a bright spot. It hauled in $2.4 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 69% year over year.Shares are flirting with being within the lower boundary of a buy range from a cup-with-handle base with a 603.34 buy point, which it initially broke out of a few weeks ago. Amazon fell 1.7% to 606.57 after falling to 601.28 intraday.The professional social network's earnings are projected to grow 5% to 60 cents ex items, a sharp drop from the 54% growth that it saw in the prior quarter. Revenue is expected to jump 30% to $828.5 million.Shares dropped 44% on LinkedIn's last quarterly report, which showed weak Q1 guidance. LinkedIn stock has climbed off of its low, reached in the following days, and is now trading 54% below its 52-week high.Social networking leader Facebook (FB) crushed Q1 earnings and revenue projections late Wednesday, sending shares up 9% in late trade.If Facebook's positive action continues into Thursday's session, the stock will likely be in buy range from a cup-with-handle base with a 117.09 buy point.China Internet giant Baidu is projected to see Q1 EPS ex items fall 11% to 5.96 RMB (92 cents). Revenue is estimated to rise 24% to 15.83 billion RMB ($2.4 billion).Baidu's mobile ecosystem is strong, according to ITG Research analyst Henry Guo. He said this week that his firm's data indicates “that Baidu’s Mobile Search app dominates the mobile search market with more than 23% installation penetration among Chinese mobile users, well ahead of its key competitors Sogou Search (1.7%) and Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU) Search (0.2%).”Baidu is trading just below buy range from a cup-with-handle base that it broke out of recently. It's trading 13% below its 52-week high.The biotech's earnings are estimated to rise 6% to $3.13 a share, slower than last quarter's 37% growth. Revenue is seen rising 7% to $8.1 billion, also a deceleration from the prior quarter. Comparisons are getting tougher after Gilead earnings and sales skyrocketed on hepatitis C treatments.Gilead retook its 200-day line last week but breached that level in Wednesday's session. Shares are trading 18% below their 52-week high.Fellow big-cap biotech Amgen (AMGN) also reports quarterly results Thursday, with analysts expected a 5% EPS gain. Amgen, which fell 1.1% to 161 on Thursday is near a buy point at 165.33 in cup-shaped base.Before the market open, biotechs Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Celgene (CELG) report, along with big pharma Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AbbVie (ABBV) makes a rival hepatitis C treatment.After Q4’s OK but not great 1.4% gain, coupled with ongoing issues regarding a strong dollar, weak energy sector and sluggish manufacturing, weak growth is expected in Q1. Wall Street expects a scant 0.7% annualized gain.

452,GILD,"AllianzGI Focused Growth Fund makes success look easy. In May, when fund lead manager Scott Migliori spoke with IBD, the now-$756 million portfolio was up about 8% for the year, topping 89% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the S&P 500's 4% gain.Now, going into Tuesday, the fund, which carries an A+ 36-Month Performance Rating from IBD, is up 11.1% for the year, outperforming 93% of its peer mutual funds and the S&P 500's gain, stuck at 3%.That good trend has required hard work and savvy moves.""If anything, the stock market today is more narrow,"" Migliori said. ""Fewer names are making newer highs. I wouldn't call it the Nifty 50. There are maybe 10 to 15 stocks that are consistently performing well, mainly in the tech and consumer discretionary spaces. We've owned enough of those to generate outperformance, but it's gotten tougher.""How? The health care sector has rolled over. ""It had been in leadership for a number of years,"" Migliori said. ""But it's fallen off the last few months because earnings revisions were not as strong as investors wanted, and because of potential political challenges over price controls.""The fund has cut exposure to drugmakers and biotechs, including Gilead (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB).Proceeds from those trims have been rotated into names like Palo Alto Networks (PANW).Trading around 187, shares in the next-generation firewall and security software maker are close to a 189.82 buy point.Since going public in 2012, revenue has swelled nearly 1,800% to $928 million. And the firm, which is on IBD's Leaderboard, has notched three quarters of triple-digit earnings per share gains.""The security area is fast growing, given the cyberattacks that governments and corporations are facing,"" Migliori said.The fund recently started its stake in Accenture (ACN), which performs consulting and provides IT services. Many investors were concerned that Accenture's business would be hurt as customers shifted to cloud-based software.""But what we've seen is fairly robust business for Accenture in integrating cloud-based services with (customers') existing IT infrastructures,"" Migliori said. ""The cloud has not only not been negative; it's been a positive growth driver.""Increasingly, amid a slow-growth economy and the prospect of rising interest rates, the fund looks for companies that can boost earnings in any market.Monster Beverage (MNST) is one of those. ""Energy drinks are taking share of the overall beverage market,"" Migliori said. ""Their partnership with Coke (KO) will let them grow more quickly. They'll be able to expand distribution more quickly.""Still Likes FacebookThe fund is high on Facebook (FB), yet recently took some profits. Why? Because the stock had enjoyed a big run and because its growth rate had slowed slightly.""But we still like it,"" Migliori said. ""They're just starting to monetize Instagram. The amount of their capital spending is not as bad as people had feared. They're consolidating after a big run, but there's nothing to fundamentally derail the story at this point.""Amazon (AMZN) is another name that Migliori thinks can carve out growth in any macro environment.Also, last year's spending on warehouse improvements is contributing to this year's operating efficiencies. ""And AWS (Amazon Web Services) is growing faster than people realize,"" Migliori said.

General Electric (GE) reported flat profit and a dip in sales.On the upside, about 80% of energy companies, including Exxon and Chevron, have beaten lowball earnings estimates. The health care, tech and materials sectors all have had 80% of their companies top views.Energy companies' earnings comparisons also should get much easier by Q2 2016.Though it's still early, the overall ratio of Q4 negative preannouncements to positive ones is 2.4. If that holds up, it will be the first quarter to be more upbeat than the historical trend since early 2012.Facebook (FB), Visa (V) and Walt Disney (DIS) are among the big-name results on tap in the coming week.

493,GILD,"Health care ETFs pumped out big gains Tuesday amid a slew of solid drugmaker earnings. Their technology-focused peers, which lagged, could get a boost tomorrow as Apple (AAPL) stock advanced after the close on better-than-expected earnings and revenue.On a sluggish day for stocks, health ETFs rose amid strong reports from Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).New York-based Pfizer gapped up 2.4% on its earnings beat. Its New Jersey peer, Merck, rose more than 1% as it reported that profit jumped in the latest quarter and it boosted its annual outlook.Medical equipment company Edwards Lifesciences (EW) grabbed a 3% gain as it beat on both the top and bottom lines in Q3.SPDR Health Care (XLV), the $13.73 billion ETF tracking the sector, rose 1.8% on the stock market today. Eight out of its 10 SPDR ETF peers that carve up the S&P 500 into sectors posted a loss Tuesday, with energy stocks leading the decline.XLV, the largest broad-based health care ETF, allocates roughly 18% of its assets to a combination of three stocks: Pfizer, Merck and Bristol-Myers. The ETF holds 55 stocks.Gilead Sciences (GILD), XLV's third-largest stock holding, fell 2% after hours despite reporting robust Q3 profits and raising its full-year outlook. The biotech giant has been rallying for four straight weeks.PowerShares Dynamic Pharmaceuticals (PJP) popped 1.9% as drugmakers advanced. The ETF holds 23 stocks, allocating 6% of assets each to Bristol-Myers and Pfizer, and 5% to Merck.PJP is the top-performing pharmaceutical ETF year to date, rising 5.4% vs. 4.7% for XLV.Meanwhile, Alibaba (BABA) leaped 4% as the China Internet giant easily cleared analysts' expectations for fiscal Q2 earnings and revenue. Mobile revenue surged 183%.Its gains failed to give much of a boost to ETFs with a big stake in the stock.KraneShares CSI China Internet (KWEB) and Renaissance IPO (IPO) eked out fractional gains Tuesday.

All three medical groups have staged recoveries off February lows. The biotech group is up more than 14% over the past four weeks. The outpatient group shows a 13% gain, with hospitals up slightly…
"
495,GILD,"Biotech stocks fell into one of the deepest craters in their history, starting last summer, but rumblings of a recovery are sounding.After a three-year bull run that more than quadrupled its value by its peak last July, IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech Industry Group plunged 50% by early February, hurt by backlashes against high drug prices and mergers that seek to lower corporate taxes.But the group has gained 12% since its Feb. 11 low, and some leading stocks have done better than that.3 Biotech Stocks Buoyed By Potential Blockbuster DrugsBioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) is up 30% from its Feb. 9 low. Incyte (INCY) has gained 29% from its low point that same week, while Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) has climbed 45%, and Medivation (MDVN), boosted by buyout talk, is up 127%.The group was up by even more before taking some hits over the past two weeks on negative earnings news from several industry players. But fund managers tell IBD the rebound is here.Why? For one, they say, the spate of bad news has already been factored into stock prices. But more than that, they see a climate favoring rejuvenated M&A, hot drugs in the new-product pipeline and pricing power for innovate products.Bottom line: The positive factors that drove the runup never went away, they say. They just got drowned out by the noise.""A very key point is that this group is a very high-beta group -- particularly the small- to midcap stocks. Since they don't have sales, they don't have earnings,"" said Tom Vandeventer, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management.""The history of this group is that elevated macro uncertainty definitely hits (it),"" Vandeventer said. ""My own opinion is this group trades more on sentiment than on fundamentals during those time periods.""Vandeventer points to troubles in China as emblematic of the macroeconomic concerns that hit biotech stocks.Another sentiment-driving factor is politics.Many of the candidates in the U.S. presidential race have bashed drugmakers for high prices and have proposed ways to clamp down. Wall Street has dismissed some of these ideas as impossible or ineffective. What seems to be generating the most concern are Democrats' proposals to let Medicare and Medicaid negotiate drug prices, which they are not allowed to do now.Already the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services has shown its teeth. It announced a pilot program changing the reimbursement for Medicare Part B, which covers drugs administered in hospitals and clinics. The Part B reimbursement scheme was long criticized for encouraging use of expensive drugs because it reimburses health care providers for the entire cost of a drug, plus 6% on top. The proposed scheme would reduce that premium and add a flat fee unrelated to the price of the drug. That, in theory, could encourage doctors to choose cheaper options.On the M&A front, the Treasury Department last month issued new guidelines on tax-inversion deals that derailed what would have been the drug industry's biggest-ever merger, between Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN). Tax inversions have become a popular way for drugmakers to boost their bottom lines and get access to cash. Allergan, after earlier mergers, is based in Ireland, which has low taxes.""We think that with the tax regulation -- I call this the 'inversion bottom' -- and the bad press associated with the health care industry, that created a bottom in our minds,"" said Robert Bombace, senior portfolio manager at Frost Investment Advisors. ""A lot of the bad news has already been baked into these companies.""In fact, a number of industry insiders say the breakup of the Pfizer-Allergan merger could turn out to be good for biotech stocks because it makes them acquisition targets for the two companies. Allergan has a long history of acquisitiveness, and Pfizer is thinking of splitting its innovative drug business from its other products. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum says Pfizer will want to bulk up its innovative business to make it valuable as a standalone, since its pipeline is modest compared to its big-pharma competitors.Schoenebaum has also said, though, that biotech boards are balking at buyout offers. They can't accept how much their valuations have dropped, so they've been unwilling to sell at market prices. He suspects this will lead to hostile takeover deals if the big players are willing to do them. This partly came to fruition in late April, when Sanofi (SNY) made an unsolicited $9.3 billion bid for Medivation, as rumors swirled that AstraZeneca (AZN) and Pfizer were also interested.Medivation's response reflected the attitude that Schoenebaum spoke of -- that the market was underpricing the stock.""Sanofi's opportunistically timed proposal, which comes during a period of significant market dislocation, and before several important near-term events for the company, is designed to seize for Sanofi value that rightly belongs to our stockholders,"" Medivation founder and CEO David Hung said in a statement rejecting the offer.Bombace, however, says the biotechs' reluctance might be for show.""I think that's just a bargaining chip,"" he said. ""The reality is that most of these companies will have to partner up anyway. ... The larger pharma and biotech names ... will reach a point where their pipelines are so dry, it will force their hands.""Bombace sees lots of exciting biotechnology science going on to fill out those pipelines. As he put it, we're ""going from the Model T stage to the space-shuttle stage.""Though he declined to name specific companies, he pointed to work in biomarkers -- which include PD-1 inhibitors such as Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo and Merck's (MRK) Keytruda. He also cited work in genetic mutations, the focus of many rare-disease firms such as BioMarin and Bluebird Bio (BLUE).These discoveries are keeping money flowing into and out of biotechnology, says Leonard Yaffe, who manages a health care hedge fund at Kessef Capital Management. He told IBD that specialty drugs -- the largely biologic drugs prescribed by specialists, as opposed to primary-care doctors -- contributed only 1% of prescriptions last year but 37% of dollars spent on drugs, up from 25% two years earlier.""One thing I think will drive the biotech stocks is that, if you look at drugs introduced in the last two years, 65% of the revenue derived from those drugs are from biologicals,"" Yaffe said. ""So it's the most attractive sector in the pharmaceutical area.""Also, while most publicly traded biotech stocks don't have earnings, those that have successfully launched drugs remain highly profitable. Of the top five biotechs in market cap -- Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB), and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) -- four have IBD EPS Ranks ranging from 89 to 96, putting them in the top 11% of all stocks in EPS growth. Regeneron has a 68 EPS Rank.Those numbers, however, reflect the pricing power of biologic drugs, which is precisely what's under political attack these days. Vandeventer says price uncertainty is the biggest risk to his bull thesis on the group right now. But he also points out that Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton attempted a previous overhaul of the health care system back in the mid-1990s, which depressed drug stocks in the short term but was followed by the late-1990s boom.That boom was driven by the first wave of biotech innovation, when companies like Amgen and Roche's (RHHBY) Genentech proved that biotechnology could produce blockbusters. Vandeventer says that innovation will remain the key in maintaining pricing power, even under political pressure. He points to Gilead's portfolio of hepatitis C drugs, which started in late 2013 with the launch of Sovaldi. Despite much political criticism of Sovaldi's high price, no one could stop it because the drug was so superior to anything else on the market.""Companies that have done the research -- they'll continue to get price increases,"" he said. ""Companies that are particularly in the rare-disease, orphan-disease arena, (or) the oncology space -- companies that have drugs in an era of targeted medicine that have higher efficacy rather than a shotgun trying to hit a disease -- are going to have pricing power.""The promise of such drugs can still make small stocks explode. Celator Pharmaceuticals (CPXX) has surged to over 13 from under 3 since March on favorable late-stage trial results for its acute myeloid leukemia treatment. The company also saw a hedge fund take a position in the stock and attracted favorable initial coverage from an analyst.There are signs that even generalist investors think biotech stocks have gotten cheap, says Yaffe. During the first quarter, a common lament was that every biotech stock got punished for bad news, but good news got no reward. But when Biogen issued a mixed earnings report that drew mostly negative reactions from Wall Street on April 21, its stock rose more than 5%.Biogen had fallen even harder than other big-cap biotechs, dropping 50% from its March 2015 high to its Feb. 12 low, so it was ready for a bounce, says Yaffe.""The overview comment is the sector had corrected 30%, and at some point it gets to the level where the stocks are very attractive,"" he said.

496,GILD,"Actively managed ETFs held a total $21.84 billion in assets through October, up nearly 30% from the end of 2014. While active exchange-traded funds are a speck in the roughly $2 trillion ETF landscape, they're growing fast.The first active ETF debuted in 2008. More than half are less than 2 years old.These ETF investment strategies often seek to outperform their benchmark indexes. Like most mutual funds, active ETFs have fund managers who decide which securities to include in the portfolio.Active ETFs usually ""don't take off like lightning"" but are seeing steady and significant growth nonetheless, says Noah Hamman, CEO of AdvisorShares, an active ETF sponsor that recently published an industry landscape report.""When performance is there, people are willing to use them in a portfolio,"" Hamman said.Here are five winners in 2015:• ARK Web x.0 (ARKW) has gained 15% year to date through Friday vs. 7% for the tech fund category.The ETF invests in innovative companies disrupting traditional business models. It focuses on businesses benefiting from the shift from hardware and software toward cloud computing, Big Data, wearable technology, social media and the Internet of Things.ARKW holds 38 stocks. The top five include AthenaHealth (ATHN), LinkedIn (LNKD), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Red Hat (RHT).However, the ETF's 0.95% expense ratio is higher than most indexed peers, and assets and trading volume are relatively meager.• SPDR MFS Systematic Growth Equity (SYG) has risen 9.4% year to date vs. 6.1% for the large growth fund category.The ETF screens for stocks based on fundamental and quantitative factors. Top holdings out of 50 include Amazon, Apple (AAPL) and biotech giant Gilead Sciences (GILD).SYG's 0.6% expense ratio is three times that of its passive peer, iShares Russell 1000 Growth (IWF). SYG holds $9.4 million in assets.• Columbia Large Cap Growth (RPX) is another solid choice for successful investing with actively managed ETF strategies. Its 9.9% gain this year —and 22% average annual the past three years — have beaten the large-growth category.• IShares Enhanced International Small-Cap (IEIS) is outpacing its segment so far in 2015. IEIS is up 7.9% in 2015 vs. 3.1% for the foreign small/mid-value fund category.• AdvisorShares WCM/BNY Focused Growth ADR (AADR) is ahead too.AADR is up 6.3% vs. 2.7% for the foreign large-growth category. It has also outperformed over three- and five-year periods of time.The ETF owns 31 stocks, including top holding Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). The concentrated portfolio holds only the fund managers' best stock investing ideas, Hamman said. Their ""stock selection really has added value,"" he added.IEIS has a 0.49% expense ratio, with AADR at 1.27%.• AdvisorShares Gartman Gold Euro (GEUR) is up 1.9% year to date vs. a 21.3% loss for the precious metals commodity fund category and a 9.3% loss for SPDR Gold Shares (GLD).GEUR uses a somewhat complex investing method. It invests in gold using euros, going long on gold futures and short on euro futures. That strategy has worked in a rising dollar environment.""Now investors can diversify themselves,"" Hamman said. ""They don't have to have just GLD. They can pair this up and balance that exposure a bit.""GEUR has a 0.65% expense ratio vs. 0.40% for GLD.

The Nasdaq composite's slightly better lift of almost 0.6% halted a two-day sell-off and took a decent bite out of Tuesday's 1.3% slide. But oil starred in the…

525,GILD,"What's the hardest thing for a champion to do? Win again. And again. And again. Just ask repeat Super Bowl titlists, or baseball and horse racing's Triple Crown winners, or tennis Grand Slam champs. And it's just as hard for the best mutual funds too.The relatively few funds that are able to pull off the feat deserve recognition. And they deserve consideration as additions to or replacements in your retirement accounts, like 401(k)s and IRAs, as well as your taxable accounts.To help you identify those special mutual funds, IBD is introducing its Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards. Stock mutual funds qualify for this exclusive recognition only if they have beaten the broad market over the past one, three, five and 10 years -- all four of those periods, not just one or two or three.  Awards were earned in 12 mutual fund categories. The top five ranked by 10-year performance (the top six in the case of sector funds) are highlighted as the best of the best, deserving special recognition.Being a four-time winner was no easy task. Of 2,702 mutual funds that met the criteria of having at least $100 million in assets and 10 years of operation, only 308 beat their benchmark in each period. Of 1,091 U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in business for the entire decade tracked by Morningstar Inc., only 101 pulled off the feat.Among 474 growth mutual funds, only 95 emerged as award winners.In some categories, it was much harder. Only three value mutual funds out of 292 beat their benchmark in all four time periods. Just four small-cap funds got awards.The winning stock mutual funds  -- including the categories of U.S. growth, blend and value, as well as large- mid- and small-cap -- were compared to the S&P 500 index in each of the four periods through Dec. 31, 2015.The international stock funds had to beat the MSCI EAFE index. The best U.S. taxable bond funds trumped the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond index. Tax-exempt funds conquered the Barclays Municipal index. Foreign taxable bond funds outperformed the Barclays Global Aggregate.Click Here To View Table With The Top Funds By CategoryWhether you are looking for mutual funds to strengthen your current portfolio or just starting out, the IBD awards list is a great place to start. Here you'll find top-performing funds run by the smartest portfolio managers. The award winners are arrayed in categories of stock and bond funds that are most often used in building core positions in diversified portfolios -- from large-, mid- and small- cap to growth blend and value U.S. stocks, foreign stocks, equity sectors and bonds.Whether you're in the market for a large-cap growth or foreign bond fund, check out those categories' award winners. Is it available in your 401(k) plan? Get the funds' prospectuses and quarterly reports and manager commentaries to see which choices make the best fit in terms of your investment horizon and risk tolerance.Start with the top five, but take some time to consider all the award winners in the categories you're interested in. You might already be familiar with a fund company that has a fund among the top mutual funds. This can add confidence to your selection.If a fund you own is not one of the award winners, you won't want to rush out and dump it. It might be a perfectly good fund run by competent portfolio managers and fit a unique need of your portfolio. You might consider whether it outperformed its benchmark in most periods but narrowly missed in one or two.How, exactly, did these funds outperform so consistently? After all, to achieve award status a fund has shown its ability to survive market corrections and bear markets without racking up losses that ruin long-term returns.Several managers claim their secret involves an ability to ignore the short-term zigs and zags of the market.""An individual who expects short-term performance would not be the type of person to invest in our fund,"" says Keith Lee, a manager of $2.5 billion Brown Capital Management Small Company Fund (BCSIX), in explaining his team's preference for stocks that provide their fund with consistently superior growth over the long run -- and which have also outperformed over the past one year, despite aiming for strong long-term returns.But what it really means is an ability to put together a portfolio that's built to weather market storms. For many funds, that means a focus on companies that are not in highly cyclical businesses -- such as those involving commodities. For many, it also means sticking to businesses with strong balance sheets and little if any debt.And for many it means looking for sustainable earnings, not short-term flashes in the pan. Gavin Baker, manager of $11.7 billion Fidelity OTC Portfolio (FOCPX), has a similar view. “We have a long-term time horizon where we are looking out over five, 10 and 15 years, which I think is a big advantage,"" Baker told reporter Billy Fisher for a profile of Gavin's fund, which is also among the best of the U.S. stock mutual funds and large-cap stock mutual funds.Many award-winning managers take it a step further: Not only do they ignore what some of them call short-term ""noise"" in the market, they also stick to their own long-term game plans.Tim Parton, manager of $5.7 billion JPMorgan Growth Advantage (VHIAX), one of the top five funds in the large-cap category, helms a team that looks for leading stocks regardless of market capitalization.Working closely with colleagues who run small- and large-cap funds, Parton's team mixes those names with the midcap stocks he himself focuses on.""The other beauty of this strategy is that we're never forced to sell a good stock just because it gets too big, which is a perennial problem for small- and midcap managers,"" Parton said.In the past, his fund has had bigger weightings of small and midcap stocks when his team was finding more growth opportunities at attractive valuations among those market caps.And while Parton thinks long-term, his team does not ignore the here and now. ""In tough periods we focus on fundamentals of companies,"" he said. ""We make sure our names are not too affected by the environment they're in. We may trim size of positions to reduce risk.""And when a volatile market, like the one we've been experiencing, makes names his team likes even more attractively priced? Parton nibbles, but only very cautiously. ""Only on the margins,"" he said, explaining his caution toward stocks that have been knocked down in price for any reason. ""We already have a slightly higher-risk portfolio than a value fund manager.""Parton invests stock by stock. Still, sector weights show where he expects to find leaders. His biggest sector was information technology, with a 35.5% weighting as of Feb. 29, nearly double his second-largest sector, consumer discretionary.Tech holdings range from small caps like medical-software maker Veeva Systems (VEEV), to midcap database software maker Splunk (SPLK), large-cap gaming software maker Electronic Arts (EA) and giant-cap Microsoft (MSFT).Winning managers in many diversified U.S. stock fund categories make a point of thinking long-term and basing investment decisions on individual stocks much more than on hot sectors. Sector-fund managers plumb their respective ponds to fish for hot trends and land the dominant sharks in those waters.As IBD's Nancy Gondo explains in her diagnosis of top-performing sector funds, biotech and and health sciences have been clear outperformers over the past 10 years.Stocks like Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) pop up in recent portfolio disclosures of the top-ranked sector funds.Another trait shared by the best of the best: a focus on well-managed companies able to maintain pricing power even during the toughest times, reports Scott Stoddard in his examination of the best of the best international stock funds.Like sector funds, success among bond funds often hinges on the ability to play the hottest part of the fixed-income market -- and to avoid segments that are out of favor.As Marie Beerens reports in this special report, TCW Total Return Bond (TGLMX) was a 10-year outperformer thanks in large part to surfing the recovery in mortgages since the credit crisis.TCW manager Bryan Whalen told Beerens that his fund also avoided a headwind in 2015 by having ""almost no exposure to the corporate credit market,"" which dramatically lagged similar-duration Treasuries.So, are these best-of-the-best mutual funds all that you need in your portfolio? ""It's not a stand-alone fund,"" Parton said about his portfolio. ""This is a growth fund. It does not give you holistic exposure"" -- that is, exposure to all parts -- ""to the market. For that, it should be used with others.""And for those others, what better choices to consider than the IBD award winners, which have proven their mettle over the years, in various market segments, again and again.

528,GILD,"Big biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) got a price-target increase Tuesday as big pharma Merck (MRK) released new data on its hepatitis C regimen that could be a rival to Gilead's blockbuster franchise.Oppenheimer analyst Wendy Lam lifted her price target on Gilead to 124 from 120, writing that after the stock's considerable sell-off — it's down 17% from its June 24 high — investors are due to revisit Gilead's strong fundamentals. She acknowledged that investors are nervous that the launch of Merck's grazoprevir/elbasvir ""doublet"" therapy for hepatitis C could result in another price war similar to that when AbbVie (ABBV) released its own rival therapy late last year. But she maintained a positive outlook on the hep C franchise.""In the near term, we expect continued growth in patient volumes as payers continue to lift restrictions on treatment,"" Lam wrote in her research note Tuesday. ""On the Merck threat, we believe Merck's entry will be less disruptive than thought, as we suspect Merck will be less incentivized than AbbVie to instigate another all-out pricing war. We expect Gilead to defend its share aggressively — as it already has been — and maintain the vast majority of payer contracts.""Merck Testing Hepatitis C Drug ComboMerck, meanwhile, is testing its next-generation combo of the doublet along with MK-3682, a drug in the same class as Gilead's blockbuster Sovaldi. On Tuesday the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) released the late-breaking abstracts for presentations at next month's annual Liver Meeting, which showed that the triple therapy had achieved cure rates above 90% in genotypes 1 and 2 of the hepatitis C virus after eight weeks of treatment, and a similarly high rate in genotype 3 after 12 weeks of treatment.Gilead's Harvoni is approved only in genotype 1, while its Sovaldi is also approved for types 2, 3 and 4 but with lower rates of success and typically a longer treatment duration than eight weeks. However, last month Gilead announced that a new drug combo had succeeded in treating six genotypes, so the field remains hotly competitive.""From the data in the abstract, the efficacy data for eight-week triple combo therapy in GT1, GT2 and to a lesser extent GT3 appears encouraging and potentially feasible although we await further details (including baseline patient characteristics) with the actual presentation,"" Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients.Neither stock was helped much by the news, though. By early afternoon on the stock market today, Gilead stock was down nearly 2% near 101, while Merck stock was down a similar amount near 50.30.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

536,GILD,"Big biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) beat analysts' Q4 estimates Tuesday but its guidance was soft, sending the stock up more than 1% in after-hours trading, in a day when several large drugmakers reported.Gilead's earnings rose 37% over the year-earlier quarter to $3.32 per share, topping analysts' EPS consensus by 32 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue increased 16% to $8.51 billion, vs. analysts' expectation of $8.13 billion.For the full year, EPS rose 56% to $12.61 while revenue gained 31% to $32.64 billion.Gilead guided 2016 product sales, which covers nearly all revenue, at $30 billion to $31 billion. Analysts had expected $30.68 billion in product sales and total revenue of $31.68 billion. Gilead does not provide total revenue or EPS guidance, but it did provide guidance on expenses, which were slightly above expectations on the R&D and sales, general and administrative lines. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum calculated that the implied EPS guidance for 2016 is $10.48 to $11.92, which would miss consensus of $12.23.In Q4, the hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni both beat estimates, though entirely due to sales outside the U.S., where analysts have less visibility. Next year's expected revenue decline is due to an anticipated decline in U.S. HCV market, which had an enormous lift-off when the two drugs were approved but has flattened as ever-larger numbers of patients have been cured of the disease.On the conference call with analysts, commercial-operations chief Paul Carter said that they could expect the HCV market in 2016 to behave similarly to how it did in the second half of 2015, essentially flat in the U.S. while growing in foreign markets where it is still being launched. He said that it might see some growth as payers seem to be loosening their restrictions on the drugs, which initially strained their finances due to their high prices and the enormous volume of patients. However, he acknowledged that revenue per patient was likely to fall as less-sick patients came aboard, requiring shorter treatments.Carter also sounded confident about Gilead's ability to fend off competition, which got a new entrant last week when Merck's (MRK) Zepatier was approved last week and priced well below both Gilead's and AbbVie's (ABBV) HCV drugs.""We're confident our label is very strong, and we're very much supported by the real-world data we've seen since the launch of Harvoni,"" Carter said.Earlier in the day, big pharma Pfizer (PFE) said Q4 revenue rose 7% over the year-earlier quarter to $14.05 billion, beating analysts’ consensus by about $45 million. Earnings, excluding one-time items, slipped 2% to 53 cents a share, beating estimates by a penny.For the year, EPS declined 3% to $2.20, while sales slid 2% to $48.85 billion.However, Pfizer’s 2016 profit guidance missed Wall Street’s expectations of $2.20 to $2.30 a share. Analyst Schoenebaum blamed foreign-exchange headwinds.“Excluding a roughly negative $2.3 billion top line ($0.8 billion of top line FX impact due to Venezuela currency impact alone) and $0.16 bottom line impact due to FX, both 2016 top and bottom line guidance would have bracketed the Street,” Schoenebaum wrote in an email. “We spoke with Pfizer, and they believe that the Street underestimated the FX impact in 2016.”S&P Capital IQ analyst Jeffrey Loo raised his rating on Pfizer to buy from hold, saying the valuation has become attractive after it, like almost every other drug stock around, has sold off in recent months.""We view growth within its Global Innovative Products unit positively, driven by Prevnar 13 and Ibrance,"" Loo wrote in a research note. ""We expect its pending acquisition of Allergan (AGN) to be completed in the second half of 2016.""Pfizer stock closed down 0.1% at 30.14.Mallinckrodt (MNK) rose 5.7% to close at 65.71, after the specialty drugmaker reported fiscal-first-quarter earnings of $2.09 a share, up 17% from the year-earlier quarter and topping consensus by 31 cents. Sales climbed 19% to $914.8 million, some $25 million above the Street’s average estimate.Mallinckrodt raised its full-year EPS guidance to $7.85 to $8.30, up from $7.70 to $8.20.Baxter International (BAX), a leader in dialysis products, also beat expectations in the most recent quarter, pulling off a sharp increase in earnings despite a decline in sales. Fourth quarter profit from continuing operations jumped 54% to 43 cents a share, 11 cents past Wall Street’s consensus. Revenue dropped 7% to $2.6 billion. Baxter stock rose 1.8% Tuesday to close at 37.95.Baxter said it expects EPS this year of $1.46 to $1.54, beating consensus of $1.42. Its forecast for the current quarter was below the Street, however, at 28 to 30 cents.

539,GILD,"One-hundred-forty characters can do a whole lotta damage. A Hillary Clinton tweet Sept. 21, deploring ""outrageous"" ""price gouging"" in the specialty drug market, saw the largest biotech ETF tank 5% on Sept. 21 on fears of pricing controls.At the end of the third quarter, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) had given up all its gains year to date on the back of roughly 11% losses in both September and August (it's since rallied a tad).But the unsettling decline in the health care sector belies its outlook, say S&P Capital IQ analysts.""Higher enrollments, cost management and prescription drug sales will continue to drive the best (earnings) growth"" for health care among 10 sectors in the S&P 500 index, analyst Lindsey Bell wrote Sept. 17.Indeed, IBB produced an annual average 30% gain in the past five years as of Oct. 2. In that period, out of 154 sector ETFs tracked by IBD, the top 10 each targeted the health sector.In fact, now more than ever, with biotech and pharma ETFs trading as much as 25% below their 52-week highs, S&P Capital IQ sees a buying opportunity in solid biotech names such as Gilead (GILD) and Celgene (CELG), an IBD 50 stock.Nearly 11.7 million people are newly insured through ObamaCare health exchanges, the firm noted in a recent report. That should drive sales for health care providers and services. A strong dollar is likely to weigh on large-cap pharmaceuticals, but the Big Four — Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Eli Lilly (LLY) — should ""once again post top-line growth in 2016 for the first time in five years as they pass the patent cliff,"" the report said.Plus, the health care index is nicely valued vs. its 15-year average.""Upside is especially attainable"" within the biotech, pharma and equipment subindustries, the report added.The big upside potential has seen sometimes-risky biotech and drug stocks make their way into many investors' ETF strategies. But now, with China and a global slowdown on their minds, investors are more focused on downside risk.They may be right to be cautious.""While value stocks are at risk should economic growth estimates continue to come down, momentum companies are exposed to more spikes in volatility,"" which has weighed on biotechs lately, Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, wrote recently.He suggested investors consider quality stocks — ""which generally have strong return on equity and low debt"" — for successful investing if the markets stay choppy.Analysts at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research agree.In a new report, they say health care rates as the most attractive sector based on measures that have historically been best at predicting results, such as EPS and sales revisions, guidance and the prior quarter's results.Stick with health care to stick with quality, BofA Merrill Lynch advised.

552,GILD,"Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison downgraded Gilead Sciences (GILD) while upgrading Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), based on where he sees near-term catalysts in the current volatile market.Harrison maintained his price target of 127 on Gilead, but lowered his rating to equal-weight from overweight based on ""relative attractiveness"" to the other two stocks. Harrison wrote in a research note that while it's true that Gilead has the cash to make a substantial acquisition, he doesn't think there's a really big one in the immediate future.""Management offered a few comments around M&A at our recent conference which suggests to us that management is focused on multiple deals for clinical stage assets awaiting derisking data, similar to the Bristol-Myers (BMY) string of pearls strategy,"" Harrison wrote. ""While we believe this is the smart strategy for Gilead and should generate above average long-term returns, we also do not see this strategy offering a single deal that could re-rate Gilead as some investors have suggested.""At the same time, Harrison wrote that the long-term outlook on the hepatitis C market will be unclear until next year, when the EU rollout is more advanced and after Merck (MRK) has unveiled more data on its own pipeline.Gilead stock was down 1.5% near 97 in midday trading on the stock market today.Picking The Big-Cap WinnersMeanwhile, Harrison liked the position of Vertex as it moves into what's expected to be its first profitable quarter in two years, thanks to the recent launch of cystic-fibrosis drug Orkambi.""We see a strong Orkambi launch based on physician feedback, suggesting 2015 revenue as much as $100 million above consensus,"" Harrison wrote. ""Biotechs transitioning to profitability have historically outperformed peers by 15 times in the 12 months following transition.""Harrison upgraded Vertex stock to overweight from equal-weight and set a price target of 148.Vertex stock was up 5%, near 113, midday Friday, after touching a nearly one-year low of 97.45 on Tuesday.Harrison also upgraded Alexion stock to overweight from equal-weight, with a price target of 211, writing that the recent sell-off in drug stocks has created an attractive entry point for the orphan-drug stock.""While Alexion has only declined 7% vs. 10% for its other large-cap biotech peers, Alexion has been an underperformer year-to-date, down 15%, the most of all large cap biotechs,"" Harrison noted. ""Thus, given the robust set of new product launches, potential pipeline upside and consensus now more aware of the competitive landscape for Soliris, we see the potential for Alexion to outperform out of the weakness generated by concerns around government pricing.""Alexion stock was up 4% in midday trading Friday, near 164.

That news compounded a spike in September layoffs reported Thursday by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, alongside a surprise jump in initial weekly unemployment claims.Just to keep the ugly ball rolling, the Commerce Department reported factory orders down 1.7% in August.

601,GILD,"The European Union's medical advisory committee endorsed several key drugs from leading stocks Friday, making EU approval likely for some potential blockbusters: The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, known by its French abbreviation, CHMP, adopted a positive opinion on Gilead Sciences ' (GILD) Genvoya to manage HIV infection. Genvoya is a four-drug combo pill identical to Gilead's popular treatment Stribild, except that in place of one ingredient, Viread, Gilead has put its new drug tenofovir alafenamide (TAF).TAF is known around Wall Street as ""son of Viread"" because it's a similar compound, but altered so that a lower dose can be used which in turn reduces side effects. Crucially for Gilead, it also won't hit Viread's patent expiries, which are due to start in 2018. As Stribild's sales passed $1 billion last year and are expected to top $2 billion next year, this is a key revenue driver even for a company as big as Gilead. The CHMP also endorsed two blood-cancer drugs from Amgen (AMGN). Kyprolis, which Amgen got when it acquired Onyx Pharmaceuticals in 2013, was first approved for multiple myeloma in the U.S. in 2012 but hasn't yet hit the market in the European Union. While it was first approved as a lone treatment, Amgen has been pushing a combo of Kyprolis with Celgene's (CELG) Revlimid and dexamethasone, based on a successful new trial in patients who've received at least one prior therapy. The FDA approved this combo in July.Kyprolis isn't a big revenue driver for the big biotech now, but analysts expect annual sales to hit $1.7 billion by 2020.The CHMP also backed a newer drug, Blincyto, for certain types of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Blincyto is a bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) antibody, which combine bits of two different antibodies to engage the body's T cells to attack cancer cells.Analyst expectations aren't huge for Blinctyo, but Amgen recently cut a licensing deal to use Xencor's (XNCR) longer-lasting BiTE technology to develop newer, better drugs. Vertex Pharmaceuticals' (VRTX) Orkambi for cystic fibrosis also got the CHMP thumbs-up Friday. Orkambi gained a fair bit of media attention when it won its U.S. approval in July, as cystic fibrosis is a devastating disease with few treatments, which gives Vertex considerable pricing power. The consensus calls for annual sales to pass $5 billion by 2020.""Our models already reflect an Orkambi launch in Europe in early 2016 for CF patients 12 and older (n=12,000),"" wrote Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert in a research note. ""However, we anticipate a slower launch trajectory than in the U.S. (n=8,500) due to the need to obtain reimbursement on a country-by-country basis."" Speaking of orphan diseases, Horizon Pharma's (HZNP) Ravicti also got a CHMP endorsement as a treatment for ultra-rare urea cycle disorders (UCDs). Ravicti was one of the drugs that Horizon acquired with its $1.1 billion of Hyperion Therapeutics this year, and one that Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem highlighted as a potential growth driver on March 31 when the deal was announced.""Ravicti was approved by the FDA in February 2013, and now has sales annualizing to around $105 million,"" Amsellem wrote. ""According to Hyperion, the U.S. prevalence of UCD is around 2,100. Hyperion has estimated that only around 1,100 UCD patients are actually diagnosed, and only around 675 are on treatment.""Ravicti costs $330,000 a year in the U.S., but Amsellem pointed out that's not that steep for an orphan drug and Horizon could price it higher. He did not estimate European pricing, however.Despite these endorsements, all the stocks were down on the stock market today as drug stocks continued their recent bumpy ride. In afternoon trading Friday, Gilead and Amgen shares were down 2%, and Vertex and Horizon stocks were both down 6%.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

Earnings grew 20% in Q1 '15 and 16% last quarter.The company also has generated several years of consecutive quarters of revenue growth, although it has slowed from the 72% growth in Q1 '14, a recent peak, to the still-robust 39% growth in Q2 '14.Currently, Facebook stock is attempting to get above its 50-day moving average amid continued market volatility. Shares closed up 3% to 89.88.The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99, meaning it trades better than 98% of other publicly traded businesses.Keeping A Mobileye On GrowthMobileye (MBLY), an Israeli tech company, is seeking to capitalize on the self-driving cars of the future by teaming up with many manufacturers, including Tesla Motors (TSLA).It makes automotive cameras and collision avoidance technology.The company has grown EPS in seven of the last eight quarters. Also growing revenue quarterly for years, Mobileye has accelerated sales growth for the last three periods to 57% in Q2.By the way, that reliable track record can only help it in its partnership with Tesla. Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, tweeted Wednesday that the Model 3, Tesla's smaller and lower-cost sedan, would be unveiled in March at $35,000 per car.Meanwhile, Tesla's Model X SUV will reach production on Sept. 29 at the company's factory in Fremont, Calif.Mobileye shares currently are stabilized under their 50-day line. Its IBD Composite Rating is 94. Shares closed up 1% to 54.85 Wednesday.Security's Accelerating GrowthPalo Alto Networks is a beneficiary of the need for greater cybersecurity, which it provides.The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has accelerated its earnings growth since flattening to 57% EPS improvement four quarters ago, reaching 109% growth last quarter.Palo Alto's shares have held below their 50-day moving average over the last month. They gained 1% to 163.59 Wednesday.Palo Alto Networks currently enjoys an IBD Composite Rating of 98.Gilead's Tough ComparisonsBiotech company Gilead Sciences (GILD), which develops treatments for hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, heart disease and other life-threatening illnesses, generated an EPS surge by triple digits in four out of the last six quarters, but growth slowed to a still-impressive 99%, then 33%, in the last two periods. The Foster City, Calif.-based company created some tough year-to-year comparisons.Gilead's revenue growth hit triple digits in three out of the last five quarters, though it too has slowed down to 26% in Q2 from 134% growth in Q4 '14.Shares are trying to return above their 200-day moving average, rising 2.7% Wednesday to close at 104.27.Gilead's IBD Composite Rating is 97.Tableau Still Grows BrisklyThe Seattle-based Tableau Software (DATA) is a victim of its own success, to a degree. It's 75% EPS growth in Q2 would be the envy of most companies.But the results disappointed investors who were expecting even better numbers.The 65% sales growth, though strong, was its slowest pace in nine quarters.The company's shares have been attempting to move above their 200-day moving average since falling beneath it Aug. 24. They jumped 4.1% Wednesday to 95.50.Tableau's IBD Composite Rating is 92.Follow Ciaran McEvoy on Twitter @IBD_CMcEvoy and on Facebook.

721,GILD,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: August Performance Report
"
722,GILD,"Sophomore slump? Not for Joe Fath. He took the helm of $47 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund a year and a half ago — on Jan. 16, 2014. In that first calendar year in charge, his fund's 8.83% gain topped only 35% of its large-cap growth rival mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
723,GILD,"This year — in which the broad market has imitated a bucking bronco — his fund has climbed 5.93% as of Aug. 31 , outperforming a whopping 96% of its peer investors.
"
724,GILD,"Fath is more concerned with the longer term. The broad market's rally of nearly 6-1/2 years has made it increasingly hard for him to find attractively valued growth stocks.
"
725,GILD,"The late-summer volatility has made it harder to find gainers.
"
726,GILD,"Fath, who is about to celebrate his 45th birthday, talked with IBD from his office in Baltimore about why his mutual fund is performing so much better this year than last year and about how he is searching for new market leaders.
"
727,GILD,"IBD: When you took charge of this fund, you cut the size of the overall portfolio and of its top 10 names. You initially trimmed to 100, down from 118, and more recently you're at 106 as of July 31. Is your initial retooling complete?
"
728,GILD,"Fath: I'm where I want to be. The tail end of the fund is half what it used to be. It's 10% of the fund now. The top 10 decreased a little bit. The middle is bigger.
"
729,GILD,"IBD: How does each segment differ?
"
730,GILD,"Fath: I describe my philosophy as an upside-down pyramid. The top slice is secular-growth names. That typically makes up 50% to 60% of the portfolio. Those are innovative disrupters that are the most dynamic growth companies.
"
731,GILD,"The middle section would be more cyclical opportunities. These would typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio. They're likely to be more opportunistic and have shorter holding periods in the fund than the average holding.
"
732,GILD,"The last section would be what I generally characterize as special situations. These are in three primary areas:
"
733,GILD,"First, stocks transitioning from value to growth.
"
734,GILD,"Second, companies underway in a lasting industry structural change, like what has been going on the last several years in the U.S. airline sector.
"
735,GILD,"Third, roll-ups, where strong management teams that are good capital allocators are applying discipline and efficiency in fragmented industries through acquisition.
"
736,GILD,"This bucket will typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio.
"
737,GILD,"The top 10 or 20 names are generally the most compelling secular ideas. The tail of my portfolio has the smallest holdings and are typically my farm team — earlier-stage growth names and private companies that I own.
"
738,GILD,"IBD: Give me some examples of special situations, please.
"
739,GILD,"Fath: Gilead Sciences (GILD) went through the value-to-growth transition when it bought Pharmasset and got into (treating) hep C in addition to its core HIV business.
"
740,GILD,"Airlines are in the industry structural change category, and I own American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL).
"
741,GILD,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is in the roll-up category, bringing capital allocation discipline to the pharma industry through an assertive allocation strategy.
"
742,GILD,"IBD: Name examples from your secular bucket, please.
"
743,GILD,"Fath:Amazon (AMZN) would be the poster child. Tesla (TSLA) is a bit more extreme. It's an on-the-come story. Other names include Priceline (PCLN), MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V).
"
744,GILD,"IBD: And name some from your cyclical bucket, please.
"
745,GILD,"Fath: Stuff in financials like TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to a degree, but it is also a shifting business model, looking more like a value-to-growth shift.
"
746,GILD,"In industrials, I hold names like FedEx (FDX), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Flowserve (FLS), an energy industrial for the most part.
"
747,GILD,"IBD: Why has fund performance zoomed up this year — at least until the broad sell-off?
"
748,GILD,"Fath: It was a drag last year when secular-growth names sold off. A lot of that was due to people wanting to see more transparency in big names. They wanted to see Amazon break out its core e-commerce business and Amazon Web Services. That company is becoming more disciplined on expenses and costs.
"
749,GILD,"And we're starting to see that in Google (GOOGL).
"
750,GILD,"This year I've taken up the health care weighting significantly. And I've taken down energy. Both moves paid off.
"
751,GILD,"I have a number of biotech and managed care and big-pharma names. That's played well. There's been some M&A activity in that space.
"
752,GILD,"IBD: So you have a bigger bet on growth this year, and that has paid off?
"
753,GILD,"Fath: The slowdown in growth happened prior to the sell-off in 2014.
"
754,GILD,"I was positioned for a cyclical recovery, but that didn't play out. It's been the reverse in 2015.
"
755,GILD,"We've been in a slow-growth environment. And the world has been thrown off by exogenous shocks like Greece and China, which is devaluing its currency.
"
756,GILD,"Those external factors help make growth more valuable. That bids up the valuations of companies that are delivering growth.
"
757,GILD,"But you've got to be disciplined about position sizes.
"
758,GILD,"Google, Priceline — their outlooks look good. They've gone through heavy investment cycles.
"
759,GILD,"Google has a new CFO, Ruth Porat, who came from Morgan Stanley. They're creating a new holding company called Alphabet, which will give more visibility to profitability of the core company going forward. People wanted more transparency there, and Google is starting to provide it.
"
760,GILD,"IBD: Let's talk about some of your interesting names, as of your latest disclosure. Do you share the concerns that some people have about Apple (AAPL)?
"
761,GILD,"Fath: It's done well. But I've been underweight. The stock peaked around 130. It's been sort of trading sideways. I'm guarded.
"
762,GILD,"The most constructive part is its valuation and capital structure.
"
763,GILD,"The worry has been about the company after this iPhone cycle.
"
764,GILD,"They've done well with iPhone. Now the issue is its replacement cycle. What we underestimated is how impactful the replacement cycle would be.
"
765,GILD,"I remain concerned about their ability to innovate, and does that drive enough of a replacement? They've done so well. Can they grow (as fast) off this base? It's hard to drive a higher multiple.
"
766,GILD,"We'll see where it will go. The watch doesn't look like it will be a success — or at least not move the needle enough. I do own it. I don't have it overweight.
"
767,GILD,"IBD: Why should anyone like Facebook (FB), whose earnings per share growth has slowed a lot for two quarters?
"
768,GILD,"Fath: They've done everything right. Right now things are in transition in mobile. As they get a big base (of users), revenue growth is slowing as they invest in new initiatives. And they want a lot of users before they turn on the monetization engine.
"
769,GILD,"They have 300 million users on Instagram, a lot on WhatsApp. They have 1.5 billion users on Facebook. They'll monetize over time, so profit will reaccelerate.
"
770,GILD,"IBD: What's your thesis for Facebook's Oculus, which is buying Israel's Pebbles Interfaces, which specializes in depth-sensing tools that can track hand movement?
"
771,GILD,"Fath: Oculus is a virtual reality play. It's interesting, but not a needle mover, but it's on the come. It's a green banana. It still needs to ripen. It shows (Mark) Zuckerberg is thinking multidecades.
"
772,GILD,"IBD: What's your Visa thesis?
"
773,GILD,"Fath: It ties in with durability of growth because it is at the center of online payments, the movement from cash and checks to digital and disruption.
"
774,GILD,"In the U.S., cards still use magnetic swipes, but they are moving to chips with a PIN. All cards will be reissued with chips imbedded. That makes it much harder to steal card information.
"
775,GILD,"A lot of retailers have been reluctant to make this change because they'd have to change their payment hardware at the register. But they're finally starting to change.
"
776,GILD,"Visa Europe is another potential driver for Visa. Visa's takeover looks like it's coming to fruition. Maybe there will be an announcement in October.
"
777,GILD,"IBD: You've built your stake in Celgene (CELG) for at least four quarters. What do you like?
"
778,GILD,"Fath: The biotechs I want to own are going after big markets.
"
779,GILD,"Over time, Celgene has built an arsenal where they can go after multiple things. Revlimid has been an anchor to what they do. But they've acquired companies and build their own franchise.
"
780,GILD,"Now they've got Otezla, an immunology drug, for psoriasis (and psoriatic arthritis).
"
781,GILD,"They've also got a cancer drug, Pomalyst, and chemotherapy treatment, Abraxane (acquired through Abraxis).
"
782,GILD,"Another drug they acquired is GD-301 for treatment of Crohn's disease. Early trials are promising.
"
783,GILD,"There's a patent cliff ahead for Revlimid. They'll protect it as long as possible.
"
784,GILD,"And there's their recent acquisition of Receptos, which was viewed as a pretty reasonable price relative to some other deals. It's attacked multiple indications, but the most promising appears to be in gastrointestinal (disorders like) colitis and Crohn's.
"
785,GILD,"IBD: Why have you been trimming your stake in Gilead Sciences?
"
786,GILD,"Fath: They're a victim of their own success. They turned what was a chronic disease into an acute disease that is treatable.
"
787,GILD,"Their treatment for hepatitis C is a monster drug. But its cure rate is almost 100% in eight to 12 weeks. Once someone is cured, they've got to find new patients.
"
788,GILD,"IBD: You've also pared your stake in Regeneron (REGN). What's your outlook?
"
789,GILD,"Fath: I probably shouldn't have trimmed. They've got a good core franchise in Eylea, which is used for treating wet age-related macular degeneration in the eye. Now it's also used for diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion.
"
790,GILD,"They've got a powerful pipeline.
"
791,GILD,"IBD: You've pared Starbucks (SBUX). What are your concerns?
"
792,GILD,"Fath: I still feel good about their core story. Our trims are just position-size management.
"
793,GILD,"They have a lot of presence, not just in the U.S., but globally. They've introduced nice food with their purchase of La Boulange. They're driving new traffic in the afternoon and evenings. They've got a good China story. Their menu is being broadened.
"
794,GILD,"Their next big thing is moving bodies through the line. They're rolling out a mobile order-and-pay system, where you pay through your cellphone and dictate the delivery time. Then you walk into the store and your coffee is ready.Best Mutual Funds 2015: August Performance ReportSophomore slump? Not for Joe Fath. He took the helm of $47 billion T.

In that first calendar year in charge, his fund's 8.83% gain topped only 35% of its large-cap growth rival mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.This year — in which the broad market has imitated a bucking bronco — his fund has climbed 5.93% as of Aug. 31 , outperforming a whopping 96% of its peer investors.Fath is more concerned with the longer term. The broad market's rally of nearly 6-1/2 years has made it increasingly hard for him to find attractively valued growth stocks.The late-summer volatility has made it harder to find gainers.Fath, who is about to celebrate his 45th birthday, talked with IBD from his office in Baltimore about why his mutual fund is performing so much better this year than last year and about how he is searching for new market leaders.IBD: When you took charge of this fund, you cut the size of the overall portfolio and of its top 10 names. You initially trimmed to 100, down from 118, and more recently you're at 106 as of July 31. Is your initial retooling complete?Fath: I'm where I want to be. The tail end of the fund is half what it used to be. It's 10% of the fund now. The top 10 decreased a little bit. The middle is bigger.IBD: How does each segment differ?Fath: I describe my philosophy as an upside-down pyramid. The top slice is secular-growth names. That typically makes up 50% to 60% of the portfolio. Those are innovative disrupters that are the most dynamic growth companies.The middle section would be more cyclical opportunities. These would typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio. They're likely to be more opportunistic and have shorter holding periods in the fund than the average holding.The last section would be what I generally characterize as special situations. These are in three primary areas:First, stocks transitioning from value to growth.Second, companies underway in a lasting industry structural change, like what has been going on the last several years in the U.S. airline sector.Third, roll-ups, where strong management teams that are good capital allocators are applying discipline and efficiency in fragmented industries through acquisition.This bucket will typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio.The top 10 or 20 names are generally the most compelling secular ideas. The tail of my portfolio has the smallest holdings and are typically my farm team — earlier-stage growth names and private companies that I own.IBD: Give me some examples of special situations, please.Fath: Gilead Sciences (GILD) went through the value-to-growth transition when it bought Pharmasset and got into (treating) hep C in addition to its core HIV business.Airlines are in the industry structural change category, and I own American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL).Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is in the roll-up category, bringing capital allocation discipline to the pharma industry through an assertive allocation strategy.IBD: Name examples from your secular bucket, please.Fath:Amazon (AMZN) would be the poster child. Tesla (TSLA) is a bit more extreme. It's an on-the-come story. Other names include Priceline (PCLN), MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V).IBD: And name some from your cyclical bucket, please.Fath: Stuff in financials like TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to a degree, but it is also a shifting business model, looking more like a value-to-growth shift.In industrials, I hold names like FedEx (FDX), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Flowserve (FLS), an energy industrial for the most part.IBD: Why has fund performance zoomed up this year — at least until the broad sell-off?Fath: It was a drag last year when secular-growth names sold off. A lot of that was due to people wanting to see more transparency in big names. They wanted to see Amazon break out its core e-commerce business and Amazon Web Services. That company is becoming more disciplined on expenses and costs.And we're starting to see that in Google (GOOGL).This year I've taken up the health care weighting significantly. And I've taken down energy. Both moves paid off.I have a number of biotech and managed care and big-pharma names. That's played well. There's been some M&A activity in that space.IBD: So you have a bigger bet on growth this year, and that has paid off?Fath: The slowdown in growth happened prior to the sell-off in 2014.I was positioned for a cyclical recovery, but that didn't play out. It's been the reverse in 2015.We've been in a slow-growth environment. And the world has been thrown off by exogenous shocks like Greece and China, which is devaluing its currency.Those external factors help make growth more valuable. That bids up the valuations of companies that are delivering growth.But you've got to be disciplined about position sizes.Google, Priceline — their outlooks look good. They've gone through heavy investment cycles.Google has a new CFO, Ruth Porat, who came from Morgan Stanley. They're creating a new holding company called Alphabet, which will give more visibility to profitability of the core company going forward. People wanted more transparency there, and Google is starting to provide it.IBD: Let's talk about some of your interesting names, as of your latest disclosure. Do you share the concerns that some people have about Apple (AAPL)?Fath: It's done well. But I've been underweight. The stock peaked around 130. It's been sort of trading sideways. I'm guarded.The most constructive part is its valuation and capital structure.The worry has been about the company after this iPhone cycle.They've done well with iPhone. Now the issue is its replacement cycle. What we underestimated is how impactful the replacement cycle would be.I remain concerned about their ability to innovate, and does that drive enough of a replacement? They've done so well. Can they grow (as fast) off this base? It's hard to drive a higher multiple.We'll see where it will go. The watch doesn't look like it will be a success — or at least not move the needle enough. I do own it. I don't have it overweight.IBD: Why should anyone like Facebook (FB), whose earnings per share growth has slowed a lot for two quarters?Fath: They've done everything right. Right now things are in transition in mobile. As they get a big base (of users), revenue growth is slowing as they invest in new initiatives. And they want a lot of users before they turn on the monetization engine.They have 300 million users on Instagram, a lot on WhatsApp. They have 1.5 billion users on Facebook. They'll monetize over time, so profit will reaccelerate.IBD: What's your thesis for Facebook's Oculus, which is buying Israel's Pebbles Interfaces, which specializes in depth-sensing tools that can track hand movement?Fath: Oculus is a virtual reality play. It's interesting, but not a needle mover, but it's on the come. It's a green banana. It still needs to ripen. It shows (Mark) Zuckerberg is thinking multidecades.IBD: What's your Visa thesis?Fath: It ties in with durability of growth because it is at the center of online payments, the movement from cash and checks to digital and disruption.In the U.S., cards still use magnetic swipes, but they are moving to chips with a PIN. All cards will be reissued with chips imbedded. That makes it much harder to steal card information.A lot of retailers have been reluctant to make this change because they'd have to change their payment hardware at the register. But they're finally starting to change.Visa Europe is another potential driver for Visa. Visa's takeover looks like it's coming to fruition. Maybe there will be an announcement in October.IBD: You've built your stake in Celgene (CELG) for at least four quarters. What do you like?Fath: The biotechs I want to own are going after big markets.Over time, Celgene has built an arsenal where they can go after multiple things. Revlimid has been an anchor to what they do. But they've acquired companies and build their own franchise.Now they've got Otezla, an immunology drug, for psoriasis (and psoriatic arthritis).They've also got a cancer drug, Pomalyst, and chemotherapy treatment, Abraxane (acquired through Abraxis).Another drug they acquired is GD-301 for treatment of Crohn's disease. Early trials are promising.There's a patent cliff ahead for Revlimid. They'll protect it as long as possible.And there's their recent acquisition of Receptos, which was viewed as a pretty reasonable price relative to some other deals. It's attacked multiple indications, but the most promising appears to be in gastrointestinal (disorders like) colitis and Crohn's.IBD: Why have you been trimming your stake in Gilead Sciences?Fath: They're a victim of their own success. They turned what was a chronic disease into an acute disease that is treatable.Their treatment for hepatitis C is a monster drug. But its cure rate is almost 100% in eight to 12 weeks. Once someone is cured, they've got to find new patients.IBD: You've also pared your stake in Regeneron (REGN). What's your outlook?Fath: I probably shouldn't have trimmed. They've got a good core franchise in Eylea, which is used for treating wet age-related macular degeneration in the eye. Now it's also used for diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion.They've got a powerful pipeline.IBD: You've pared Starbucks (SBUX). What are your concerns?Fath: I still feel good about their core story. Our trims are just position-size management.They have a lot of presence, not just in the U.S., but globally. They've introduced nice food with their purchase of La Boulange. They're driving new traffic in the afternoon and evenings. They've got a good China story. Their menu is being broadened.Their next big thing is moving bodies through the line. They're rolling out a mobile order-and-pay system, where you pay through your cellphone and dictate the delivery time. Then you walk into the store and your coffee is ready.

824,GILD,"The major index ETFs downshifted further Monday, as China and the Federal Reserve have continued to weigh on the stock market. On the last trading day of August, exchange traded funds tracking the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq 100 posted their largest monthly losses since 2012. Last week, turbulence in the stock market whipsawed investors even as it intensified worries about a global slowdown and raised doubts about the wisdom of a Fed rate hike next month.SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) slipped 0.7% on the stock market today.The ETF holds 30 blue-chip industrial leaders.Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE) and IBD Leaderboard stock Visa (V) were among DIA's lead decliners.No. 1 holding Goldman Sachs (GS) and Intel (INTC) were among only six stocks in DIA that advanced.DIA pegged a 6% decline for August, its worst monthly loss in 3 years.So did SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad market, and PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks in the Nasdaq Composite Index.SPY fell 0.9% Monday, with every sector besides energy in the red. QQQ gave up 1.2%.Among QQQ's top 25 holdings, biotech stocks Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) were among the hardest hit at Monday's close. They lost 2% to 4% each.IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) took a 3.2% hit and Market Vectors Biotechnology (BBH) 3.3%, the worst among sector- and industry-focused ETFs.The so-called ""death cross"" on SPY's daily chart is its first appearance in four years. The pattern occurs when a short-term moving average, like the 10-week moving average, slips below a long-term line like the 40-week moving average.

"
826,GILD,"The second half of August is usually a desert for business news, but the FDA schedule is year-round. Several important drugs are up for approval decisions this month, which could provide some upside for three biotech stocks that have recently been suffering.
"
827,GILD,"Getting the most attention will likely be Repatha, Amgen's (AMGN) cholesterol drug. It's expected to be approved by Aug. 27. Repatha is a PCSK9 inhibitor similar to Praluent, the drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) that was approved with much fanfare last month.
"
828,GILD,"Given the resemblance between the two drugs, Repatha is widely expected to be approved. In a July 30 research note, Nomura analyst Ian Somaiya wrote that Amgen's drug will probably also get a similar label, which doesn't cover quite as many patients as some had hoped but ""should be sufficiently broad to support our $2.5 billion peak sales estimate.""
"
829,GILD,"What will be especially interesting to investors will be the pricing dynamics that come with two drugs appearing on the market. Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) has said it hopes to start a price war between the two, similar to what happened when AbbVie (ABBV) launched a rival hepatitis C regimen to Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Harvoni late last year. Gilead has maintained dominant market share, but only by rebating near half the drug's list price.
"
830,GILD,"""We believe rebating may drive access, as Sanofi/Regeneron and Amgen will be directly competing for formulary position,"" Somaiya wrote. ""While our $750 Repatha net price per month estimate implies a 33% discount to Praluent's gross price of $1,120, we believe competition could result in above average discounting similar to what has been seen in hepatitis C.""
"
831,GILD,"Amgen stock hit a new high of 181.81 after its Q2 report, but has since shed about 7% in the larger biotech selloff. It retains an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 95.
"
832,GILD,"By Aug. 18, the FDA is due to decide on a label expansion for Adcetris, the sole marketed drug from Seattle Genetics (SGEN). Adcetris, marketed by partner Takeda, is already approved for patients with Hodgkins lymphoma who've relapsed after receiving a stem-cell transplant or after two chemotherapy treatments. The current filing followed a study of patients who'd received a transplant but hadn't relapsed, and found a significant improvement in progression-free survival.
"
833,GILD,"In a July 16 research note, RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt wrote that the chances of approval looked good since the FDA didn't convene an advisory committee before the approval date, which it normally does when it has issues with a drug.
"
834,GILD,"""The market opportunity in the post-transplant Hodgkins lymphoma setting could take Adcetris from $200 million to $250 million (a year) to $250 million to $350 million or higher in sales potentially,"" Butt wrote.
"
835,GILD,"Getting new indications for Adcetris is a key part of Seattle Genetics' strategy, because even though the drug launched four years ago it still hasn't made the company profitable. Adcetris is also being tested in T cell lymphoma and in the front-line setting in both kinds of lymphoma. In January, the company also announced a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) to test Bristol's hot new cancer drug Opdivo along with Adcetris in various kinds of lymphomas.
"
836,GILD,"Seattle Genetics stock is down about 14% from its July 20 high of 52.33, but retains a good Relative Strength Rating of 89. Analysts expect it to turn profitable in 2018.
"
837,GILD,"The FDA has an Aug. 22 deadline for deciding on Aristada, a schizophrenia drug from Alkermes (ALKS). Alkermes created the drug by taking aripiprazole, which under the brand name Abilify was a best-seller for Otsuka and Bristol-Myers before it went off patent this year, and adding its own technology that turns the dosing regimen from daily pill to a monthly injection. Since patient compliance is one of the biggest problems faced by anti-psychotic medicines, generally the less frequent dosing the better.
"
838,GILD,"Aristada won't be alone on the long-acting psychotic market, but Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt says it could do nearly as well as Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Invega Sustenna, which also uses Alkermes technology and is therefore providing royalties.

While it was a leading stock in 2012 and 2013, last year it sacrificed profit growth to invest in R&D and marketing its new drug Vivitrol, while in the most recent quarter revenue also flatlined.

"
842,GILD,"Connect with Amy Reeves: @IBD_Areeves and Facebook.The second half of August is usually a desert for business news, but the FDA schedule is year-round. Several important drugs are up for approval decisions this month, which could provide some upside for three biotech stocks that have recently been suffering.Getting the most attention will likely be Repatha, Amgen's (AMGN) cholesterol drug. It's expected to be approved by Aug. 27. Repatha is a PCSK9 inhibitor similar to Praluent, the drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) that was approved with much fanfare last month.Given the resemblance between the two drugs, Repatha is widely expected to be approved. In a July 30 research note, Nomura analyst Ian Somaiya wrote that Amgen's drug will probably also get a similar label, which doesn't cover quite as many patients as some had hoped but ""should be sufficiently broad to support our $2.5 billion peak sales estimate.""What will be especially interesting to investors will be the pricing dynamics that come with two drugs appearing on the market. Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) has said it hopes to start a price war between the two, similar to what happened when AbbVie (ABBV) launched a rival hepatitis C regimen to Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Harvoni late last year. Gilead has maintained dominant market share, but only by rebating near half the drug's list price.""We believe rebating may drive access, as Sanofi/Regeneron and Amgen will be directly competing for formulary position,"" Somaiya wrote. ""While our $750 Repatha net price per month estimate implies a 33% discount to Praluent's gross price of $1,120, we believe competition could result in above average discounting similar to what has been seen in hepatitis C.""Amgen stock hit a new high of 181.81 after its Q2 report, but has since shed about 7% in the larger biotech selloff. It retains an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 95.By Aug. 18, the FDA is due to decide on a label expansion for Adcetris, the sole marketed drug from Seattle Genetics (SGEN). Adcetris, marketed by partner Takeda, is already approved for patients with Hodgkins lymphoma who've relapsed after receiving a stem-cell transplant or after two chemotherapy treatments. The current filing followed a study of patients who'd received a transplant but hadn't relapsed, and found a significant improvement in progression-free survival.In a July 16 research note, RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt wrote that the chances of approval looked good since the FDA didn't convene an advisory committee before the approval date, which it normally does when it has issues with a drug.""The market opportunity in the post-transplant Hodgkins lymphoma setting could take Adcetris from $200 million to $250 million (a year) to $250 million to $350 million or higher in sales potentially,"" Butt wrote.Getting new indications for Adcetris is a key part of Seattle Genetics' strategy, because even though the drug launched four years ago it still hasn't made the company profitable. Adcetris is also being tested in T cell lymphoma and in the front-line setting in both kinds of lymphoma. In January, the company also announced a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) to test Bristol's hot new cancer drug Opdivo along with Adcetris in various kinds of lymphomas.Seattle Genetics stock is down about 14% from its July 20 high of 52.33, but retains a good Relative Strength Rating of 89. Analysts expect it to turn profitable in 2018.The FDA has an Aug. 22 deadline for deciding on Aristada, a schizophrenia drug from Alkermes (ALKS). Alkermes created the drug by taking aripiprazole, which under the brand name Abilify was a best-seller for Otsuka and Bristol-Myers before it went off patent this year, and adding its own technology that turns the dosing regimen from daily pill to a monthly injection. Since patient compliance is one of the biggest problems faced by anti-psychotic medicines, generally the less frequent dosing the better.Aristada won't be alone on the long-acting psychotic market, but Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt says it could do nearly as well as Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Invega Sustenna, which also uses Alkermes technology and is therefore providing royalties.""We model Aristada sales of $7 million, $91 million and $240 million in 2015-17,"" he wrote in a July 31 research note.Aristada is an important component in Alkermes' strategy to return to growth.

843,GILD,"Volatility is the word of the day in the stock market, and drugmakers with strong growth prospects and proven long-term stability, such as IBD 50 member Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), may be good stock watch list candidates. The IBD 50 spotlights the top performers among all U.S.-listed stocks, based on a combination of factors including sales and profit growth. Today's roster…
"
844,GILD,"While earnings reports have hammered some leading stocks, that hasn't been the case for most Big Cap 20 members. With most of the quarterly reports out of the way, the big capitalization leaders have sailed past earnings announcements.
"
845,GILD,"Most beat Wall Street's expectations. Also, most have climbed since their earnings press releases came out during the past couple of weeks.The medical sector, which has the largest share of the Big Cap 20, accounted for several earnings winners.Gilead Sciences (GILD) gapped up after it reported sales and profit that exceeded expectations for Q2. It also raised full-year guidance. The $3.15 a share beat analysts' consensus by 44 cents — one of the largest margins of victory in the earnings race.The stock has risen almost every day since the July 28 report and is forming the right side of a base.Better-than-expected sales and earnings also helped Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) break out of a base on July 23.Illumina (ILMN), however, was one medical leader that tumbled.The gene-sequencing company on July 21 beat earnings estimates but missed revenue expectations. Shares sold off 8% the day after its report, sinking back around a prior buy point at 213.46. Illumina dropped out of the Big Cap 20 after that.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) beat Q2 estimates Thursday, but its guidance fell short of expectations because of some costs. The stock has fallen modestly since the report but remains above a 191.10 entry.The market also had a cool reception for Edwards Lifesciences' (EW) results, even though sales and earnings were higher than analysts expected. The stock has been down each day since the numbers were released a week ago.Outside health care,eBay (EBAY)topped profit estimates on July 16 and charged to a new high following the news. Shares have receded a bit, but have held near highs.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) barely beat second-quarter views, as EPS rose 27% to $4.45 a share. Sales climbed 14% to $1.2 billion, below estimates.Yet Chipotle had the best post-earnings performance of the Big Cap 20. Shares soared 8% the day after the earnings report, as investors turned optimistic on third-quarter sales and traffic trends . Chipotle remains near new highs.Reynolds American (RAI) also has done well since its quarterly report. The tobacco company is up about 10% since its second-quarter earnings topped expectations and the company raised its full-year outlook. The stock is extended from a 76.20 buy point.A few Big Cap 20 companies have not reported results yet, including Monster Beverage (MNST) and HCA Holdings (HCA).

Its shares have climbed 19% this year.Celgene has been especially active in developing drugs for various cancers and immune-inflammatory diseases.Two drugs that fight at least one common disease, multiple myeloma, are among its fastest growing.The first, Revlimid, is Celgene's top-selling drug, with $1.44 billion in sales in the second quarter, 19% higher than a year earlier. The oral drug is used to treat anemia and multiple myeloma, a cancer of the blood that affects plasma cells.Sales of Pomalyst, similar to Revlimid but more potent, increased 46% over last year to $235 million, making it the fastest growing of the company's current lineup. The drug launched in Japan in June.Other drugs currently generating revenue for Celgene include Abraxane, which treats advanced cancers in the breast, lungs and pancreas; Vidaza, which helps bone marrow produce healthier blood cells; and Otezla, a pill for treating psoriasis and psoriasis arthritis.With sales in the second quarter up 13% from the prior year, to $244 million, Abraxane is one of Celgene's slower-growing drugs.Goldman Sachs analyst Terence Flynn noted that it ""continues to face competition in breast and lung cancer,"" though its share in treating pancreatic cancer in the U.S., now at 50%, has been growing.Analysts expect new indications and geographic expansion to keep Abraxane from petering out.Sales of Otezla, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved in March 2014, totaled $90 million in Q2, up 49% from Q1.Total revenue in the quarter rose 22% to $2.28 billion.

986,GILD,"When an uptrend comes under pressure, some stocks show action worthy of a drumroll, while others inspire eye rolls. The recent trouble for the uptrend started after the July 20 close. The S&P 500 suffered four distribution days in a row through Friday. The Nasdaq suffered just one distribution day, thanks to some narrow escapes that seemed more technical than reassuring.
"
987,GILD,"So, which Big Cap 20 stocks continued to score price gains?
"
988,GILD,"During this distribution cluster, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) has posted an 8% gain. Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) rose 7%. Monster Beverage (MNST) added 4%.
"
989,GILD,"Meanwhile, in the eye roll camp, Biogen (BIIB) careened 24% lower — a savage beating that kicked the stock off the Big Cap 20. Fellow biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) dropped 6%, twice as much as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.

990,GILD,"Do these successes and failures have anything in common? An investor might guess that earnings season explains it all. However, it isn't always that simple.
"
991,GILD,"Chipotle Mexican Grill reported quarterly results Tuesday after the close. The company beat earnings views by only a penny a share and it had a narrow miss on revenue. Same-store sales grew 4.3%, well off the year-ago pace of 15.5%.
"
992,GILD,"What explains the gain then?
"
993,GILD,"Positives include some improvements in the fundamentals. After-tax margin was 11.7%, topping the year-ago figure of 10.5%. Return on equity was 25.6%, above the year ago 22.9%.
"
994,GILD,"The company also reported improvements in its pork-supply situation. Chipotle dropped a pork supplier in January, but at the earnings call co-CEO Steve Ells reported progress on the matter.
"
995,GILD,"Chipotle also launched a new ad campaign and reported a partnership with Washington State University researchers to reinvent the way tortillas are made.
"
996,GILD,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals had a more straightforward driver. Before Thursday's open, the company reported quarterly results that topped the Street's views on earnings and revenue. Valeant also raised its 2015 forecast.
"
997,GILD,"Monster Beverage isn't expected to report quarterly results until early August. The firm is seen growing earnings 12% in Q2. About a week ago, Sterne Agee CRT began coverage with a buy rating.

998,GILD,"On the negative side, Biogen lost its place in the Big Cap 20 with a crushing loss. The stock gapped down 22% Friday in volume 855% above average after the company reported Q2 results. A small beat on earnings couldn't compensate for a miss on revenue and weaker-than-expected guidance.

1024,GILD,"Big biotech Gilead Sciences handily beat analysts' Q2 estimates and raised its full-year guidance Tuesday afternoon, led by sales of its blockbuster hepatitis C drugs.
"
1025,GILD,"Earnings, excluding one-time items, rose 33.5% over the year-earlier quarter to $3.15 a share, beating analysts' consensus by 44 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue climbed 26% to $8.24 billion, some $800 million above the Street's number.
"
1026,GILD,"Gilead (GILD) duly added another $1 billion to its 2015 guidance for product sales, now $29 billion to $30 billion. It did not forecast EPS, but did trim guidance for R&D and SG&A expenses as well as its tax rate. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum calculated that the implied full-year EPS guidance from these numbers is $10.47 to $11.63, up more than a dollar from earlier guidance and in line with consensus.

1047,GILD,"This week's list of leading stocks near buy points includes a healthy dose of medical names, from biotechs to managed care providers. The biotech revival began prior to Celgene's (CELG) 7% jump Wednesday on its $7.2 billion buy of Receptos (RCPT). Celgene is extended past a 121.57 cup-with-handle buy point.But Gilead Sciences (GILD) is still in play from a 116.93 entry after finding support at its 10-week moving average. The move didn't create a new buy opportunity, since it occurred below the buy point. But the stock is within the 5% buy zone.Also in buy range is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), trading just above a 554.10 flat-base buy point. The pattern is late stage, which is not surprising given the eye drug maker's 76% advance the past year.United Therapeutics (UTHR) hasn't yet broken out, but it's nearing a 190.39 buy point of a late-stage flat base. The IBD 50 stock, whose lead drugs are Orenitram and Remodulin, gets a 98 Composite Rating.Biotechs moved up to No. 2 among IBD's 197 industry groups, up from No. 5 six weeks ago. Hospitals claim the top spot vs. No. 10 six weeks back.Representing the No. 9-ranked generic-drug group, Allergan (AGN) is just above a 315.10 handle buy point cleared Monday. Formerly known as Actavis, the Botox makeradded double-chin injection Kybella with its June buy of Kythera.Mallinckrodt (MNK), also a generic-drug maker, is working on a four-month consolidation with a 132.70 buy point. The stock looks poised for a third straight weekly gain to close above its 10-week line.Among other medical stocks, ethical-drug maker Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is building a flat base with a 246.11 entry. The Canadian company is the leader in the No. 11-ranked group, with the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.Molina Healthcare (MOH), a provider of managed health care services to low-income families, is nearing a 74.08 flat-base buy point.

1048,GILD,"Biotechnology exchange traded funds can hold a hodgepodge of businesses with approved drugs and those focused on clinical trials. So ETF sponsor BioShares puts these companies into two distinct funds.
"
1049,GILD,"Biotechnology Clinical Trials (BBC) and Biotechnology Products (BBP) launched in December 2014. The ETFs started with a little over $5 million combined. They now together hold roughly $58 million. They're also outperforming bigger, more established ETF peers since launch.
"
1050,GILD,"Paul Yook, portfolio manager of BioShares Biotechnology Funds, takes IBD behind his firm's investment strategy and success.
"
1051,GILD,"IBD: What's the strategy that's setting BBP's performance apart?
"
1052,GILD,"Paul Yook: Equal weighting has resulted in greater weights for midcap biotech stocks. That has helped BBP's performance this year, as midcap biotech stocks have outperformed. In addition, BBP has exhibited smaller drawdowns during down markets, which we believe is a result of the fund holding only companies with existing product sales, as opposed to more speculative clinical trial stocks.
"
1053,GILD,"IBD: Which three stocks within BBP are you particularly bullish on and why?
"
1054,GILD,"Yook: We continue to be positive on Gilead (GILD), which trades at the lowest P/E multiple in the group with strong dividends and buybacks coupled with the potential for transformative acquisitions; Anacor (ANAC), which just recently announced positive data for a second drug and will likely become one of the rare breed of biotechs to have taken multiple compounds from discovery through to market; and Retrophin (RTRX) which recently became a product-stage company, but also focuses on unique rare diseases and operates as a specialty biotechnology company looking to acquire late-stage products to complement its product portfolio.
"
1055,GILD,"IBD: What are the trends driving biotechs?
"
1056,GILD,"Yook: Biotechnology companies are among the most innovative in the global economy — of the top 10 selling drugs globally in 2014, seven were discovered by biotechnology companies. This R&D productivity is accelerating with last year becoming one of the most prolific for Food and Drug Administration approvals. This is also resulting in record-breaking M&A — both for premiums and deal volumes. At the end of the day, the biggest driver for the biotechnology market is the continued discovery of innovative medicines that are helping to save lives.
"
1057,GILD,"IBD: What challenges or risks does the biotech industry face?
"
1058,GILD,"Yook: Many of the challenges of the last decade have been diminished — access to capital is now readily available, the FDA is more open and collaborative with the industry than ever, and basic science has created more in-depth understandings of diseases. But challenges remain, including greater pressure from insurance companies and governments on pricing, increased competition from existing and pipeline therapies, and the always-challenging odds of successfully moving a drug from concept to market. Fewer than 1 in 30 drugs in phase one eventually receive FDA approval.
"
1059,GILD,"IBD: What's the main difference between your two ETFs?
"
1060,GILD,"Yook: BBP contains biotechnology companies with FDA-approved products, while BBC contains only companies in the clinical trial stage, without any FDA-approved drugs. In practice, this means that BBP on average has larger, less volatile companies, with investors focusing principally on revenue growth. And BBC has smaller, more volatile companies with no significant product sales, but with their futures hinging on successful clinical trial results. We have found investors with different risk appetites gravitate toward these two funds with risks on different ends of the biotech spectrum.

In addition, BBP has exhibited smaller drawdowns during down markets, which we believe is a result of the fund holding only companies with existing product sales, as opposed to more speculative clinical trial stocks.IBD: Which three stocks within BBP are you particularly bullish on and why?Yook: We continue to be positive on Gilead (GILD), which trades at the lowest P/E multiple in the group with strong dividends and buybacks coupled with the potential for transformative acquisitions; Anacor (ANAC), which just recently announced positive data for a second drug and will likely become one of the rare breed of biotechs to have taken multiple compounds from discovery through to market; and Retrophin (RTRX) which recently became a product-stage company, but also focuses on unique rare diseases and operates as a specialty biotechnology company looking to acquire late-stage products to complement its product portfolio.IBD: What are the trends driving biotechs?Yook: Biotechnology companies are among the most innovative in the global economy — of the top 10 selling drugs globally in 2014, seven were discovered by biotechnology companies. This R&D productivity is accelerating with last year becoming one of the most prolific for Food and Drug Administration approvals. This is also resulting in record-breaking M&A — both for premiums and deal volumes. At the end of the day, the biggest driver for the biotechnology market is the continued discovery of innovative medicines that are helping to save lives.IBD: What challenges or risks does the biotech industry face?Yook: Many of the challenges of the last decade have been diminished — access to capital is now readily available, the FDA is more open and collaborative with the industry than ever, and basic science has created more in-depth understandings of diseases. But challenges remain, including greater pressure from insurance companies and governments on pricing, increased competition from existing and pipeline therapies, and the always-challenging odds of successfully moving a drug from concept to market. Fewer than 1 in 30 drugs in phase one eventually receive FDA approval.IBD: What's the main difference between your two ETFs?Yook: BBP contains biotechnology companies with FDA-approved products, while BBC contains only companies in the clinical trial stage, without any FDA-approved drugs. In practice, this means that BBP on average has larger, less volatile companies, with investors focusing principally on revenue growth. And BBC has smaller, more volatile companies with no significant product sales, but with their futures hinging on successful clinical trial results. We have found investors with different risk appetites gravitate toward these two funds with risks on different ends of the biotech spectrum.BBP rose to a new high of $37.25 on the stock market today.Follow Aparna Narayanan on Twitter: @IBD_ANarayanan.

1063,GILD,"Tuesday's announcement that Celgene (CELG) agreed to acquire Receptos (RCPT) pleased investors in those two stocks, but for investors in Gilead Sciences (GILD), which was rumored to be interested in Receptos, it means waiting on the edges of their seats.""Literally the only question I'm getting on Gilead is, 'When and who are they going to buy?'"" said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum Monday in a video recorded for clients. ""The stock has moved because of broker meetings a month or two ago where they said, 'We're ready to do a deal.'""It's a crucial question for Gilead's future, because signs are that its blockbuster hepatitis C franchise is already hitting the ceiling in the U.S. after a record launch 18 months ago. However, that launch did give Gilead an enormous pile of cash to buy its next major drug line, which has set Wall Street's collective imagination into overdrive about what the target could be.Here are some of the most prominent suggestions that have come out in the last few months: Incyte (INCY): This was suggested on Tuesday by Nomura analyst Ian Somaiya in a note mainly about the Celgene-Receptos deal. Incyte's drug Jakafi treats a rare form of bone-marrow cancer as well as a blood disease called polycythemia vera. Gilead recently entered the blood-cancer market with Zydelig, which launched just shy of a year ago for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and two kinds of lymphoma. Somaiya noted that Incyte also has a promising pipeline that includes drugs for solid tumors.Incyte's 12-month revenue totaled $581 million, mostly from Jakafi, but the company has had inconsistent quarters on the bottom line. Analysts expect it to record its first annual profit next year, however, and grow rapidly after that. The stock has reflected these bullish expectations, with a Relative Strength Rating of 98 and an accumulation/distribution grade of B+. Incyte stock hit a new high of 121.70 early on the stock market today before retreating back near yesterday's close. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX): Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges caused a minor commotion when he endorsed this combination back in April. Vertex, whose own hepatitis C blockbuster was stomped out of existence by Gilead, is positioning itself as the dominant player in cystic fibrosis, as it's the only company that's proven to have a disease-altering treatment for the devastating condition. Porges pointed out that Gilead already sells a product to this market called Cayston, so it has its foot in the door.Gilead ""needs the promise or high probability of an incremental $5 billion to $7 billion of revenue to reassure investors about their future outlook,"" Porges wrote at the time, and in fact $5 billion a year is what many predict Vertex's CF drugs are going to do eventually. However, some other analysts doubted whether such a deal would happen, on the grounds that Vertex is expensive (market cap is hovering near $33 billion, and Porges' suggested price was $45 billion) and Gilead prefers to buy development-stage assets that it can then launch itself.Vertex's stock has been in a flat base since Porges floated his idea. Achillion Pharmaceuticals (ACHN): Buying Achillion would be going in the opposite direction in terms of size, as Achillion is a startup whose market cap is just over $1 billion. However, it has been the subject of speculation, given that it has a promising hepatitis C drug candidate of its own, which could potentially help Gilead extend its franchise through the coming next generation of treatments.In November, after Achillion's candidate ACH-3102 yielded excellent six-week results in a clinical trial when combined with Gilead's Sovaldi, FBR Capital analyst Andrew Berens argued that buying Achillion could get Gilead onto ""(the) expected trend in HCV intervention towards shortened treatment durations from the currently available eight-week and 12-week courses."" Then in May, a Twitter-storm of speculation erupted when Achillion abruptly pulled out of an investor conference, suggesting that it was about to announce something big. As it turned out, it was: Achillion had actually signed a licensing deal with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which diminished the chances of a Gilead buyout. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY): What, a biotech buying a big pharma? Well, actually Gilead is bigger than Bristol now — it did almost $25 billion in sales last year, vs. Bristol's $16 billion — and Bristol's hottest new drugs are biologics, like its cancer drug Opdivo. Which was what TheStreet.com's Adam Feuerstein was thinking when he proposed the idea back in January: ""I'm not sure exactly which company Gilead will buy, but the acquisition focus will be oncology, and it will be transformative, just as Pharmasset was for its hepatitis C business.""The potential is certainly vast, given that Opdivo alone is expected to pass $6.5 billion in annual sales by 2020. However, the price would be even more staggering than Vertex's, and Bristol's market value has continued to go up since Feuerstein's prediction; it's now over $115 billion. The stock hit a new 14-year high of 70.42 Wednesday before closing down more than 1%.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

(That's allergy-related swelling.)Valeant shares, which eased 0.6% Tuesday, are 61% extended past a cup-with-handle base buy point of 147.39, initially cleared last December. Actavis, along with its partner Perrigo (PRGO), announced on Tuesday that its new drug application for guaifenesin/pseudoephedrine tablets, a Mucinex D alternative, was given FDA approval.Last week its eluxadoline drug, Viberzi, for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, also received FDA approval.Actavis is trying to stay above a cup-with-handle base buy point of 305.87, initially cleared last Wednesday. It closed off 1% Tuesday to 305.66. Actavis has a 99 Composite Rating, the best. Gilead has an IBD Composite Rating of 98. The biotech announced on Sunday that the phase-three trial results for its idelalisib drug, Zydelig, in combination with ofatumumab, showed the improvement of progression-free survival in previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).Last week, the European Medicines Agency validated Gilead's marketing application for its emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide combination for HIV treatment. The investigational combination is now under evaluation by the European Medicines Agency.Shares, which barely closed off 0.1% Tuesday at 113.94, are 2% below a 116.93 buy point from a 7-month-long price consolidation. Celgene is another biotech with a 98 Composite Rating. BMO Capital last week reiterated its outperform rating on Celgene in part because of future prospects for its pleiotropic modulator, CC-122.The stock is forming a price consolidation with a 129.16 buy point. Biogen, a biotech that earns a 97 Composite Rating, is now trading 19% off its March 20 peak of 480.18. That price was reached in a nearly four-month-long, 38% run out of a price consolidation. Regeneron broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 486.10 buy point in mid-May and gained as much as 7% from that level. In Tuesday's session, the biotech's shares dipped back into the 5% buy range. Regeneron boasts a 99 Composite Rating. Shire cleared a 258.54 buy point from a flat base on May 21, but the ethical-drug maker's stock is now trading back below that level. Shire has a 97 Composite Rating. Illumina, which makes gene sequencing systems, is working on a price consolidation with a 213.43 buy point. Last week, shares got within 1.4% of that pivot, but are now trading 3% below that level.Follow Alissa Williams on Twitter: @IBD_AWilliams.

All the figures were non-GAAP, while the analyst estimates available to IBD used GAAP, so it wasn't clear how they compared to expectations.Regeneron stock rose nearly 3% intraday but reversed, along with the overall market, to close down 1.7% at 406.49, below its 50-day moving average.Separately at the conference, robotic-surgery systems maker and former star stock Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) released preliminary Q4 sales of $605 million, up 5% from a year earlier and more than $17 million above consensus. The firm also sees 2015 procedure growth at 7% to 10%, which RBC Capital Markets analyst Brandon Henry wrote is in line with his expectations.""We expect ISRG shares to move higher this morning, and we continue to believe the worst is behind ISRG,"" Henry wrote in a note before the market opened.He was right about the first part, with Intuitive Surgical rising to 534 intraday. But the stock retreated in the afternoon to close down 0.7% at 521.66.

1277,GILD,"Novo's stock rose 1.2% to 56.27.Biotech Gilead Sciences handily beat first-quarter expectations and raised its revenue guidance Thursday, capping off a busy day for big-cap drugmaker earnings. Gilead (GILD) reported earnings minus one-time items of $2.94 a share, up 99% from the year-earlier quarter and beating analysts' consensus by 62 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue jumped 52% to $7.59 billion, more than $600 million above Wall Street's estimate.Gilead doesn't give EPS guidance, but it added $2 billion to its full-year product-sales target, now $28 billion to $29 billion. That's up 14% to 18% from 2014.Essentially the entire revenue beat came from the hepatitis C drug Harvoni. In its first full quarter on the market, Harvoni notched $3.5 billion, well above analysts' $2.2 billion estimate. Its predecessor Sovaldi, however, missed expectations at $972 million. Gilead's HIV franchise, once the mainstay but now a minority of revenue, also came in below forecasts.Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum said the guidance raise is especially significant.""This company tends to be conservative, so for them to raise revenue guidance this early in the year speaks volumes,"" he wrote in an email to clients.On the conference call with analysts, commercial-operations chief Paul Carter said that the U.S. HCV patient base seemed to be ""somewhere north"" of the 250,000 that Gilead had predicted last year. He added that Q1 was the first in which the franchise has picked up significant numbers of patients in Europe, which reached about 20,000.Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges, who last week said that Gilead ought to buy fellow big-cap biotech Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), delicately brought up what it might be doing with all its cash.CFO Robin Washington said that Gilead does keep an eye out for M&A; opportunities, but said it prefers ""phase-two or earlier-stage assets."" That would seem to cut against Vertex, which already has commercial products.Gilead's stock rose about 2% in after-hours trading.

1337,GILD,"Massive EPS gains one year might mean that a company tops out the next. While the five IBD 50 stocks in today's screen are set to show 2014 EPS growth that leaves 2013 in the dust, the years beyond might not be as bountiful.Shares of Gilead Sciences (GILD) have launched upward since its hepatitis C drug Sovaldi debuted last year. The company's full-year 2014 EPS is expected to grow 290% year over year to $7.95, partly on Sovaldi and Harvoni — which combines Sovaldi with a non-interferon treatment. Harvoni won FDA approval in October.However, the drugs have faced headwinds this year despite their effectiveness. Concerns from government and patient-advocacy groups over the drugs' steep costs in the U.S. have persisted. Many have argued that the drug is far too costly for low-income hepatitis C patients.What's more, Express Scripts (ESRX), citing concerns about the costs of hep C drugs, said Monday that it would dump Sovaldi and Harvoni from its preferred formulary list in favor of AbbVie's (ABBV) Viekira Pak for the treatment of genotype 1 hepatitis C. Gilead's stock plunged 14% that day and fell 13% for the entire week.Gilead shares have risen 24% since the beginning of the year. But they have struggled to find support at their 50-day line since October, and their relative strength measures have fallen as well. And while massive EPS growth is expected for 2014, analysts project that growth to shrivel into the low-double and single digits over the four years to follow.The stock closed up 2.8% at 93.83 in the stock market today.Generic drug-maker Akorn (AKRX) maintains top-shelf IBD Composite and Relative Strength ratings, and the company is poised to see EPS gains of 105% from a year ago.However, a price hike for its drug clobetasol, a topical rash treatment, weighed on its Q3 results, reported in November. And as with Gilead, analysts forecast Akorn's earnings growth to slow dramatically over the next few years.Shares dropped 9% on its Q3 earnings results, continuing a consolidation that the stock began in October and has remained in since.Facebook's (FB) full-year EPS is expected to grow 90% to around $1.69 a share, driven by Facebook and its still-cool-with-teens Instagram photo-sharing app. The social-media site has snapped up a variety of companies this year in an attempt to anticipate shifts in the online social landscape, and many forecast the company to gain big on online and mobile advertising.As part of their effort to strengthen its position in online advertising, Facebook recently announced a deal to show NFL video clips and Verizon (VZ) ads on its site.Facebook has warned that costs will rise as it steps up spending. Analysts currently expect Facebook's full-year EPS growth to dip to 13% in 2015 but then reaccelerate for the two years after. Shares hit an all-time intraday high of 82.17 on Dec. 23 after clearing a cup base a day earlier. Shares closed up one cent on Friday at 80.78.BitAuto (BITA), the auto-information and advertising website based in China, has benefited from being in the world's largest auto market and China's expanding car culture.Analysts expect the company to grow EPS by 74% this year. In November, the company beat Q3 views on the strength of its ads and gains in the ever-crucial mobile space.Despite near-best IBD fundamentals, the stock has dipped below its 50-day line this month, cooling from a 16% rise after the company reported Q3 results. Still, shares closed up 1.4% on Friday at 73.58 — more than double their value at the beginning of the year.Analysts expect the company's EPS growth to decelerate through 2016 but remain solidly in the double digits.Finally, Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) is forecast for full-year EPS growth of 69% from 2013 on the strength of its only marketed drug, Soliris, which treats two rare blood diseases.The company has years of double-digit quarterly sales and EPS growth under its belt. Shares cleared an 8-month consolidation in October and jumped 7% after a strong Q3 report. But the stock has since seen more sellers enter the picture, bringing its Accumulation/Distribution rating down to a D- .Analysts expect only 14% EPS growth in 2015 but stronger growth after that.The stock has rattled around its 50-day line over the past two weeks.

1356,GILD,"Biotech United Therapeutics (UTHR) received Food and Drug Administration approval for its first cancer drug Tuesday and was also awarded a priority-review voucher, which could turn out to be just as lucrative.The agency approved Unituxin, a monoclonal antibody that treats an ultra-rare childhood cancer called neuroblastoma. With only about 650 new cases a year, consensus estimates expect only $73 million in annual sales from the drug by 2019.To encourage more such rare-disease treatments, however, the FDA awarded the company a Rare Pediatric Priority Review Voucher. United Therapeutics can sell this to another company if it wishes, which will expedite review once the buyer files a new drug application.The demand for such a drug could be considerable. Last July, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and partner Sanofi (SNY) paid $67.5 million to acquire a similar voucher from BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN), which it then used to catch up to Amgen (AMGN) in their race to bring the first cholesterol-busting PCSK9 inhibitor to market. Currently, the FDA's deadline to make a decision on Regeneron's alirocumab is July 24, while for Amgen's evolucumab it's Aug. 27.In November, Gilead Sciences (GILD) paid $125 million to Knight Therapeutics for a priority-review voucher, which it hasn't used yet.The market seemed pleased. Though United Therapeutics stock opened down on the stock market today, it rallied after the news got out in the late morning and touched a record high of 164.82. By mid-afternoon, shares were up more than 1%, near 162.50.United Therapeutics is No. 22 on the IBD 50 , with a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

1373,GILD,"Gilead Sciences has been on a winning streak in recent years. But competition and price pressure may push the biotech pace-setter to go for acquisitions to continue the momentum.Gilead's (GILD) Q1 revenue climbed 52 percent from the year-earlier period, while the company's per-share earnings more than doubled. The Foster City, Calif.-based Gilead's annual sales total more than $27 billion, and through the past three years, market value has risen more than fivefold to reach an impressive $177 billion. The stock earns the best possible IBD Composite Rating, 99, which means that the stock has outperformed 99% of all other stocks in a combination of factors including Earnings Per Share and Relative Strength Ratings.Gilead has flourished by focusing on treating HIV and hepatitis patients. Hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni have chalked up more than half of the company's product sales.But a backlash has been building about Sovaldi, because Gilead has priced the drug at $1,000 per pill or $84,000 for the 12-week life of the treatment.""Any time you get a major move like that one, it's very hard for people to completely forget about it,"" said Michael Holland, head of New York money management firm Holland & Co. ""Management has the task of showing people that the biotech boom isn't ready to end yet — and that Gilead will continue to be a major player in the industry. They have to show the world that they have a strong and long-lasting growth strategy, just in case this kind of bad news surfaces again.""""Consumerism is growing in health care, and Gilead will surely feel pressure because of the prices it charges,"" said Paul Carroll, a partner with Devil's Advocate Group, a consulting firm for CEOs. ""This pressure will take some time to build, because any attempt to deny the use of medicine based on the cost brings people out of the woodwork shouting, 'Death panels!' Gilead needs to be preparing a 'doomsday scenario' to imagine what life will be like in a world when it can no longer charge $1,000 per pill.""Not everyone agrees. ""Despite the rhetoric surrounding Sovaldi, Gilead is in a very strong position strategically,"" says Dan Mendelson, CEO of health business advisor Avalere Health. ""It's in a strong position globally because Hep C is one of the big public health issues of our time.""As Dr. Barnett Mennen, a physician of long experience with the pharmaceutical industry, has said, Sovaldi ""has changed the game for many patients. They've offered a cure. How much is that worth to someone who is suffering?""Where Gilead Is VulnerableFactors other than price may put pressure on Gilead. The company's shares plunged about 15 percent last Dec. 22, reaching a four-month low, after the FDA approved rival AbbVie's (ABBV) hepatitis-C product.Around the same time, AbbVie forged an agreement with Express Scripts (ESRX) to offer its drug at a lower price. It became the only hepatitis-C product that the big pharmacy-benefit entity sanctioned.Industry observers say that Gilead can handle the pressure. ""It may be looking at a few acquisition targets"" as a way to lock in its continued solid growth, Brian Skorney, an analyst with Baird in Milwaukee, told IBD.Jacob Plieth, senior editorial analyst at EPVantage, also expects Gilead to pursue acquisitions. ""It's hard to know how else they can proceed. ... when you have a competitor coming in.""In a recent earnings conference call, Gilead COO and President John Milligan said, ""We typically like (acquiring companies) where we can have impact on phase three (drug trials) and where we can accelerate those products either into the approval process or integrator indications after the approval process. And I tend to think still we're looking for things where we feel we can catalyze the development of those products and have a greater utility over them overall.""Acquisition TargetsIn early May, Gilead acquired Danish drugmaker EpiTherapeutics. But which other companies would Gilead buy?Skorney is eyeing such potential takeover targets as South Boston, Mass.-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), a global biotech entity that has drawn praise for its work in cystic fibrosis.Vertex could ""fit in nicely with Gilead,"" Skorney said, pointing out that Vertex has put its stamp on treating cystic fibrosis, much as Gilead has focused on hepatitis C. Also, Vertex has more than a dozen continuing programs targeted at other life-threatening diseases.Acquisitions are nothing new to Gilead. In 2011, the company announced an $11 billion acquisition of Pharmasset, giving it further range in treating hepatitis sufferers. The acquisition turned out to be a huge success.But not all acquisitions succeed. ""M&A remains dicey, and there is a long history of bad acquisitions in the pharmaceutical world,"" noted Carroll of Devil's Advocate.Nevertheless, EPVantage's Plieth said, ""Gilead is in a very strong position right now. It has been one of the most amazing biotech stocks, looking back over the past 10-12 years.""

1501,GILD,"AbbVie's hepatitis C regimen won FDA approval Friday, becoming the second entrant in what is already a huge market for interferon-free HCV treatments. The Viekira Pak will cost $83,319 for 12 weeks, in line with forecasts and undercutting Gilead Sciences'  (GILD) $94,500 for the same treatment length. The AbbVie (ABBV) regimen consists of three drugs: ombitasvir, paritaprevir (first developed…

The catalyst was the announcement by Express Scripts (ESRX), the nation's largest benefits manager, to use AbbVie's (ABBV) hepatitis C drug exclusively. That hurt Gilead Sciences (GILD), whose stock has soared on sales of its own ground-breaking hepatitis treatment. Gilead was hammered for a 16% loss on the week so far,…
"
1504,GILD,"The subject of drug pricing keeps getting hotter, though for most people it's a mysterious process.
"
1505,GILD,"On Nov. 25, pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) said that to rein in costs it's upping the number of drugs excluded from its 2015 formulary to 66 from 48, with new targets including Amgen's (AMGN) popular blood boosters Epogen and Aranesp. And Express says it intends to provoke a price war once competitors to Gilead Sciences' (GILD) hepatitis C drug Sovaldi start coming out, in hopes of bringing down the treatment's $84,000 price tag.Will any of this work? And what will it mean for drugmakers and their investors?To explore these questions, IBD spoke with Ed Schoonveld, managing principal at consulting firm ZS Associates and author of ""The Price of Global Health,"" now launching its second edition.IBD: What's the biggest misconception people have about how drug pricing works?Schoonveld: It's a very complex environment. One of the reasons why there are so many misunderstandings is that the buying process is so different.I like to call it ""dinner for three."" Imagine you go to a restaurant. One person is ordering the meal, one person is eating the meal, and the other person is paying. You can imagine the conversation that's taking place: The one who's paying (says), ""Well, I'm not sure that caviar was necessary."" But then again, the payer might be a little too demanding as well, and say, ""I think a hot dog is good enough.""The patient, of course, is interested in their health, (and is) paying only indirectly for it. The physicians want to make sure the patient is doing well, and the payers may be overly concerned with costs. This is why a lot of people are saying the market mechanism is not there, and they feel they need to interfere, and in many cases are over-interfering.Another reason why it's different is because it's such a capital-intensive industry. It requires a lot of investment, so the cost structure is quite different. It's sometimes hard to explain to patients why they need to pay something for R&D — people (just) want a cure for their disease.What's even more important in that context is that it's changing so much. The combination of the rising cost of health care (and) an economy that's not doing too great (is) putting a lot of pressure on (governments) to cut costs, to reform the system.Then at the same time we have things like Ebola popping up. So we do need the strong development arm, because some of these diseases are actually very scary. And technology is advancing as well, which is probably leading to more expensive solutions.That all comes together in a perfect storm, where payers are faced with tough decisions.IBD: When Sovaldi came out, it seemed a lot of insurers were unprepared and wound up paying out more than they expected. Did the industry learned anything from that?Schoonveld: Obviously, it's raised a lot of debate. Interestingly, there's not been a lot of debate over the value of the drug. Honestly, I wish we had more problems like the Sovaldi problem, where we have a cure for the disease.The big challenge in this case is that in the time horizon, it's difficult for (insurance companies) to fund it. There are tremendous cost offsets that are going to take place, but that's a number of years down the line. That doesn't tend to help them in their short-term perspective.In addition, many health care plans in the U.S. are still pharmacy-only plans (that) really are not getting any benefit from the reduction in the occurrence of liver disease, cancer, everything else. That makes it a little harder for them to make a decision like this, particularly when it's impacting their budgets.In this case, it's more a matter of making sure we find the appropriate ways to treat the patients, and make sure there's additional budget available. For example, in Germany they've done that. It is a temporary budget increase, because it's a curative treatment.IBD: Are pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts getting more powerful in all this?Schoonveld: That's one of the examples of a plan that's only seeing the cost of a drug treatment, as it doesn't get rewarded with any of the benefit. It's a limitation in using PBMs to manage formularies. They don't see as much value in a treatment like this as a more intergrated health care system would see.Taking a step back, what this does is requires the (drug) industry to engage, to make sure we know what our value proposition is. It seems like we have some societal objective to bring these treatments to patients, and so (to clear) a hurdle of financing — which this mainly is — we should make sure we find solutions.IBD: What sort of alternatives are you thinking of?Schoonveld: This is not easy, but there are cost offsets in the long term. So finding a way to make sure that (cost offsets) are being recognized — even to make sure they (drugmakers, payers, PBMs, government agencies) talk to each other, rather than through the media — would be helpful.But this (Sovaldi) is a very specific case. There are many other drugs where insurance companies (and) physicians are looking at how they judge value, how it should be used appropriately. You see a lot of medical societies, like ASCO (the American Society of Clinical Oncology), have been pretty vocal about how they're going to take cost more into consideration in their clinical guidelines.This puts the pharmaceutical industry in a position where they, even more than before, have to make sure that they realize and provide evidence of how new treatments are providing value to patients, to physicians and to payers, and make sure there is guidance in how this can best be used in treatment. And that's sometimes hard to do at launch, but that's where this all leads.

1506,GILD,"Two of the world's biggest drugmakers issued a mixture of Q4 reports Friday in what continues to be a tough earnings season.AbbVie (ABBV) said profit excluding one-time items rose 8.5% over the year-earlier quarter to 89 cents, beating analysts' consensus by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales climbed 5.1% to $5.37 billion, $11 million ahead of consensus.For the full year, profit increased 5.7% to $3.32 a share, with sales gaining 6.2% to $19.96 billion.AbbVie affirmed the 2015 guidance it issued earlier this month, which called for earnings of $4.25 to $4.45 but didn't set out a revenue range.However, on the conference call with analysts, CEO Richard Gonzalez said he expects the newly launch hepatitis C combo Viekira Pak to achieve a run rate of $3 billion by the end of this year. In the midst of AbbVie's hepatitis C battle with Gilead Sciences (GILD) to land exclusive deals with payers, Gonzalez said he expects about 40% of insured patients will have access to Viekira Pak.RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee calculated that this will mean about $2 billion this year, which is below consensus of $2.8 billion.""On the positive, ABBV announced their '2nd generation' regimen (improved possible single pill w/ no booster or ribavirin) and will have data soon and plan to go to Phase III later this year. .. . This is one way they may maintain some share as an alternative to GILD,"" Yee wrote in a research note Friday.Still, AbbVie shares fell 2.7% to 61.41 in afternoon trading in the stock market today. The stock fell to a three-month low intraday of 60.12.Eli Lilly (LLY), still in the shadow of the patent cliff, reported that sales shrank 12% to $5.12 billion, missing consensus by nearly $80 million. Earnings rose 1% to 75 cents a share, beating the Street's average estimate by 2 cents.For the full year, profit dropped 33% to $2.78 a share while sales slid 15% to $19.61 billion.Lilly also affirmed its earlier profit guidance of $2.40 to $2.50 a share, but shaved $800 million off its revenue guidance, which is now $19.5 billion to $20 billion. Singing a familiar tune for this earnings season, Lilly blamed the lowered guidance ""solely to reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared with several other currencies.""However, S&P Capital IQ analyst Jeffrey Loo was heartened that the EPS guidance stayed the same, as it pointed to better-than-expected gross margin. He raised his price target to 74 from 66, saying that ""2014 was the low point for sales and (we) see improving growth over the next few years.""Lilly's stock rose 0.9% to 72.73 in afternoon trading.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

But first, it has to deal with the 110 level, which acted as upside resistance a few times last month. The stock's Relative Strength line has already hit a new high.On Tuesday, Gilead regained its 50-day moving average but did so in weak turnover. While the stock has bounced back in recent sessions along with the market, it still has a poor Accumulation/Distribution Rating. But funds have been buying. In the third quarter, Fidelity's Contrafund and Balanced Fund added to their positions. CGM Focus Fund started a new position.Gilead will report third-quarter results Tuesday after the close. Analysts see earnings surging 269% to $1.92 a share, which would mark a third straight quarter of triple-digit growth. Sales are expected at $5.99 billion, up 115% from a year ago. Solid demand continues for Gilead's Sovaldi, a hepatitis C treatment that costs $84,000 for a 12-week course.Vipshop Holdings (VIPS) is in a consolidation with a 229.59 buy point. During a recent pullback, the March 2012 new issue found support just above its 40-week line, as it did in late June of 2013. On a down note, Vipshop is in a late-stage structure even if you start counting bases when the stock was above $10 a share. Late-stage patterns are generally riskier.On Wednesday, the stock climbed back above its 50-day line in 19% above-average volume. And on Thursday, Vipshop stretched its winning streak to eight straight sessions.The Chinese online retailer, which uses the flash-sale model, has delivered triple-digit gains in earnings and sales in recent quarters. Another is expected in its third quarter. Profit is expected to surge 173% to 71 cents a share. Revenue is slated at $857.6 million, up 124%.

1562,GILD,"Flemming Ornskov has been at Shire for only 18 months, but his term has been quite an adventure already.
"
1563,GILD,"In January, he closed the Anglo-Irish drugmaker's biggest acquisition, buying U.S. biotech ViroPharma for $4.2 billion.
"
1564,GILD,"That brought Shire (SHPG) deeper into the growing field of rare-disease drugs, helping it diversify from its core business in attention-deficit treatments. It has also made a number of smaller buyouts.
"
1565,GILD,"This year, Shire's biggest drama was its role in what would have been the biggest tax-inversion deal in the drug industry.
"
1566,GILD,"North Chicago-based big pharma AbbVie (ABBV) successfully wooed Shire back in July with a nearly $55 billion offer, with which AbbVie planned to cut its taxes by relocating its headquarters to Britain.
"
1567,GILD,"After the Treasury Department proposed new rules in September that would limit the benefits of such deals — and since AbbVie was legally unable to renegotiate terms — the big pharma backed out, leaving Shire with a $1.63 billion breakup fee.
"
1568,GILD,"Undaunted, on Oct. 24, Shire reported Q3 results that beat expectations.
"
1569,GILD,"Ornskov recently spoke with IBD about the AbbVie adventure and Shire's strategy.
"
1570,GILD,"IBD: When AbbVie first made its bid, you initially resisted. Apart from the issue of price, was becoming part of a big pharma ever in your plans? Is it now?
"
1571,GILD,"Ornskov: No, the situation (when AbbVie made its bid) was that we went out and put a strong case to the investors for us staying independent. We laid out the plan called 10-by-20 — achieving $10 billion in (annual) sales by 2020. AbbVie increased their offer a number of times, and eventually I think the board of Shire felt that the number they were offering was of such a magnitude that they had to recommend it. That's also the feedback they got from the investors.
"
1572,GILD,"The deal did not happen, and there can be a lot of speculation about tax deals and the importance of that. I think for us right now, the most important thing is we have a strong opportunity as an independent company.
"
1573,GILD,"We have very strong growth — we grew 33% in the third quarter compared with the similar quarter in 2013 — and I think we progressed profitability very strongly, and we progressed the pipeline. I think we now have to focus on being an independent company.
"
1574,GILD,"For the long term, I think we've made really good progress on business development. We've made at least three deals during this period of time — Lumena, Fibrotech and a company called Bikam, in the ophthalmic area. I quickly put the AbbVie situation behind me, and I think so will the team.
"
1575,GILD,"IBD: Speaking of the tax issue, Shire is domiciled in Dublin even though a lot of your operations are elsewhere. Do you see any of the proposed changes in Irish laws, or the political pressure it's been under, as affecting your business?
"
1576,GILD,"Ornskov: No, Shire's been based in Ireland for quite some time. I think we've seen that tax is a complex issue, and now for U.S. companies with the Treasury notice, people are interpreting and trying to figure out what that means for them.
"
1577,GILD,"I think at the end, tax is one of the things you have to manage in a complex environment with high demand for growth and efficiency. But for us, really, the key thing is to focus on innovation and growth, and our people and pipeline.
"
1578,GILD,"IBD: You've been diversifying away from your core ADD business. How did you wind up with the mix of therapeutic areas you're in, and what are you most focused on at this point?
"
1579,GILD,"Ornskov: Since I've come on board, we've shifted the strategy to be more focused on becoming a biotech company. We have aspirational peers, like Celgene (CELG), like Gilead (GILD), like Biogen Idec (BIIB). We find that these companies are characterized by innovative pipelines, high growth, high profitability, and very strong research focus and patient focus.
"
1580,GILD,"We like that, and we put out a strategy to take us in that direction. We have a plan to achieve 10-by-20, which is an ambitious but, I think, achievable goal, even if you exclude business development.
"
1581,GILD,"More and more of our business is in rare diseases. It is now our largest and fastest-growing business. It's true that historically we've been more ADHD, but now rare disease is a focal point going forward with investments and business development and acquisitions.
"
1582,GILD,"IBD: What size of acquisitions might we expect?
"
1583,GILD,"Ornskov: Well, Shire has always been an acquisitive company. We've made quite a number of them since I came on board. The largest we made was the $4.2 billion acquisition of ViroPharma, and I think that's been incredibly successful.
"
1584,GILD,"Not only did we acquire a product, Cinryze (used to prevent attacks of angioedema, or swelling of the face and body), with excellent growth, but also we've significantly increased the growth since we've taken it over. A product in the same disease area, Firazyr, which we already had, picked up in growth significantly. That's a good pattern for us: building on domain expertise we have, making a targeted acquisition, the performing very well with the acquired asset and the spillover effect on our existing asset.

1588,GILD,"The current list of IBD Big Cap 20 features more stocks that are relatively old than relatively new. That's not a big surprise. After all, it takes years, if not decades, for even a fast-growing company to achieve the earnings, sales and size of a large cap within the U.S. equity market. IBD defines a large cap for this screen as $15 billion in market value or higher.

1589,GILD,"The surprise found within the Big Cap 20 lies in how numerous companies have come back from truly severe declines.

""I tell our people, 'The next tablet we make will be consumed by your family, your friend.'""Papa views Perrigo as ideally suited to capitalize on health care reforms. He says, ""There are two winners"" in the current environment: companies such as Gilead Sciences (GILD), which makes Sovaldi, an $84,000 treatment for hepatitis C; and, on the opposite side, Perrigo and its commitment to ""quality, affordable health care products.""""It's like a barbell where there'll be growth at the two extremes,"" Papa said. ""And I think there will be even more growth on our end of the barbell.""

1702,GILD,"Even as the market chops back and forth, some Spotlight leaders are working on long weekly winning streaks. When a stock closes higher for multiple weeks in a row, especially five or more, it's a noteworthy sign of steady accumulation by big funds.This is a useful trait to spot while a stock is basing and even after it has broken out and is moving higher. When a stock breaks out of an early-stage base and is able to climb many weeks in a row, it signals that its shares are in big demand and have a good chance to continue even higher in the future.One such stock is PRA Health Sciences (PRAH), which closed higher for the eighth straight week on Friday. The stock is extended about 10% from a 32.09 buy point and has nearly doubled from its IPO price of 18.PRA debuted in November and is one of the world's largest contract research organizations (CROs). PRA offers traditional, project-based trial services as well as what it calls embedded and functional outsourcing services, where PRA integrates with a client's internal developing operations to manage drug development.PRA operates from more than 70 offices worldwide with approximately 11,000 employees. It's part of the highly ranked medical research and equipment industry group. INC Research Holdings (INCR) and Icon (ICLR) are other highly-rated contract research organizations from the group. Both stocks are working on new base patterns.Other Spotlight stocks showing weekly win streaks include medicals Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Illumina (ILMN). Both stocks are in buy range after breaking out this week from lengthy consolidations.Chip play Inphi (IPHI) has also climbed for seven straight weeks. Inphi shares are holding just above a 24.69 three-weeks-tight buy point. The stock is also near a 20% profit target for those who bought a 21.43 breakout in late April.

""If we were to assume 10% market share for ABBV among non-exclusive/preferred lives, we see overall share for ABBV at 14% and US sales at $1.25 billion in 2015.""With added revenues from Europe, where the drugs in Viekira Pak are expected to launch this year both as a set and as separate products, Karnauskas arrived at total HCV sales of $2 billion vs. $2.7 billion consensus. However, she also expects Gilead is going to low-ball consensus due to the price discounts it's had to negotiate to compete with AbbVie.""At worst case, we expect discounts in commercial channels to be 15% for Harvoni (5% Sovaldi) which coupled with government discounts (40% Harvoni, 30% Sovaldi) calculates to 22% overall discount for HCV franchise,"" she wrote, explaining that this could result in revenue guidance $1 billion lower than the present consensus of $28.6 billion. ""If guidance comes $2.5 billion lower that would validate what PBMs (pharmacy benefit managers) are telegraphing regarding discounts.""AbbVie is due to report Q4 and 2015 guidance on Jan. 30. Gilead hasn't yet set a date for its report.Despite these lowered estimates, Karnauskas maintained a buy rating on both stocks due to their pipelines full of other promising drug candidates. The stocks didn't react much on the stock market today: In afternoon trading, Gilead was down 0.5% while AbbVie was down 1.4%.

"
1733,GILD,"Miss out on a stock that broke out of its base and climbed out of buying range, or wishing you had bought more? Don't chase it — you may soon get another chance. Leading stocks sometimes rush above their buy points and go into a holding pattern for a few weeks or more.A three-weeks-tight pattern, in which the second and third weekly price close is no more than 1% to 1.5% away from the prior week's close, gives investors a chance to buy a small number of shares. The buy point is found by adding 10 cents to the highest price in the pattern.Three-weeks-tight patterns form in between a stock's bases. A stock should clear its base buy point in heavy volume because that's a sign that institutional investors are piling in to push the stock higher.But turnover should cool off as the stock forms the three-weeks-tight pattern. The reason: It's a sign that those big funds are holding onto their shares — and maybe even picking some up — as smaller holders take profits.Gilead Sciences (GILD) started shaping a three-weeks-tight pattern with a buy point at 46.47 in the week ended March 8, 2013. Price changes in the following two weeks were down 0.6% and up 0.8%. Volume during the tight phase was about average.The pattern formed after Gilead broke out above a 35.25 flat-base buy point (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in late January 2013) in heavy volume during the week ended Nov. 16, 2012. It then rallied 32%.Ideally, you'd like the pattern to form before a stock has risen 20% to 25% above its buy point, as most stocks correct at that point to form new bases.However, Gilead was still showing characteristics of a true leader. The market was in a confirmed uptrend and the stock had risen for 10 straight weeks in leading up to the three-weeks-tight pattern.Furthermore, Gilead had a 98 Composite Rating, a tick below the best-possible 99, which put it at the top of the highly ranked biotech industry. Also, its SMR Rating — sales, profit margin and return on equity — was a top-notch A.Gilead removed any doubt about its ability to rise further when it jumped above the 46.47 three-weeks-tight buy point on March 27, hitting a new high in volume that was 94% above average.In less than two months, it rose 25% from the three-weeks-tight entry to a fresh peak of 58.07 — a good time to take profits. Gilead then corrected to form a new base.Investors can use the three-weeks-tight pattern to add shares to an existing position or start a new position. In either case, buy only a small amount of shares when a stock clears a three-weeks-tight pattern — maybe 5% of a full-size position.That smaller purchase helps minimize risk, as the pattern forms after the stock has already risen beyond the 5% limit that defines a buy area from a base.Since three-weeks-tight patterns represent pauses within a stock's strong uptrend, avoid follow-on patterns that form on stocks that typically don't move very much, such as lumbering big cap stocks. Some slow-moving big caps don't usually show strong prior uptrends. They also trade tightly week to week.

In U.S. terms, profit dropped 27% to 51 cents per American depositary receipt. Revenue was in line with estimates at 5.62 billion pounds, a 1% increase at constant exchange rates, though in U.S. dollars it dropped 11% to $8.32 billion.

The firm said 2015 earnings are off due to the dilutive effect of its massive asset swap with Novartis (NVS), in which Glaxo bought Novartis' vaccines for $7.1 billion while Novartis acquired Glaxo's cancer business for $14.5 billion.

1804,GILD,"CVS Health (CVS) on Monday said it would select Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Sovaldi and Harvoni as the exclusive treatments for hepatitis C patients who use some of its benefit plans, the latest development in what could become a price war among hepatitis C drugmakers.The decision, which takes hold Wednesday, comes after Express Scripts' (ESRX) move last month to dump Gilead's drugs from its preferred formulary list for genotype 1 hepatitis C patients, in favor of AbbVie's (ABBV) rival drug Viekira Pak. AbbVie agreed to discount the drug to get on the list, amid concerns that the hep C drugs from both AbbVie and Gilead are too expensive for many low-income patients.Harvoni costs $94,500 for 12 weeks of treatment, compared to Viekira Pak's $83,319. Sovaldi costs $84,000 for a 12-week treatment.""Our goal was to create the lowest net-cost solution for the entire population of patients with all genotypes of hepatitis C,"" CVS said, according to Bloomberg. It was unclear if Gilead and CVS agreed to any kind of discount.Express Scripts, in announcing its decision to add AbbVie's drug to its preferred list, cited concerns about a lack of sufficient price competition in the hepatitis C drug space. The company's clients have also warned about costs.""If the specialty drug trend continues to increase by double-digit percentages, payers will be forced to implement even more narrow management tools, thus limiting the number of patients who can afford to receive the drug therapy,"" Paula Jakub, CEO American Foreign Service Protective Association, said last month. ""It only makes sense for manufacturers to work with payers on pricing decisions.""Gilead's shares tumbled 15.5% on Dec. 22, the day of Express Scripts' announcement. They were up 2.8% on the stock market today . AbbVie shares fell 2%, below their 50-day line for the first time since October.CVS said Sovaldi and Harvoni will be the exclusive treatment for its list of standard commercial drugs, as well as its Medicaid, Medicare Part D and health-exchange formularies.The Wall Street Journal reported that patients could get AbbVie's Viekira Pak only if they obtained approval or a medical exception in advance.RBC Capital Markets reacted favorably to CVS' decision in an analyst note.""We view this as positive because it removes near-term uncertainty for many investors who feared CVS would also strike a deal with ABBV and further put more pressure on GILD,"" RBC said.
"
1805,GILD,"Monday brought a surprising turn to the twisting story of hepatitis C treatments, as pharmacy giant CVS Health said it will offer exclusive coverage for Gilead Sciences' hep C drugs.
"
1806,GILD,"But the key issue of price remained unanswered.The deal seemed to counterattack one cut two weeks ago between pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) and AbbVie (ABBV), days after the FDA OK'd AbbVie's four-drug Viekira Pak for genotype 1 of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Express Scripts said that at the start of 2015 it would cover only the Viekira Pak for genotype 1 patients, unless they'd already started a course with another drug.Although both firms were tight-lipped on the details, CVS' (CVS) deal appeared to mirror Express Scripts'. Starting Wednesday, CVS, which also operates as a pharmacy benefit manager, will cover Gilead's (GILD) Sovaldi and Harvoni exclusively on its CVS/Caremark Standard Commercial, Exchange (Marketplace), Medicare Part D and Medicaid formularies. Viekira Pak would be covered only for patients who got an exception or prior approval.What they didn't say was how much CVS will pay for the drugs.Price was the big motive behind Express Scripts' deal, as it had objected to the cost of the new hepatitis C drugs ever since Sovaldi launched in December 2013 at $84,000 for a 12-week round of therapy.Harvoni, which for most patients eliminated the need for companion drugs, launched in October at $94,500 for 12 weeks.However, there wasn't much anyone could do about it as long as there were no competitors of equal quality on the market.When the Viekira Pak was approved on Dec. 19, a price war seemed to have been averted as the treatment priced at a modest discount to Harvoni — $83,319 for 12 weeks — which most analysts thought accounted for the fact that it's more complicated to take than one-pill-a-day Harvoni, though it's equally effective.Price Subject To HagglingAs Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum has observed, the official list price of a drug is a lot like the sticker price on a car, just a starting point for haggling.AbbVie acknowledged that Express got Viekira Pak at a discount, though it declined to reveal how much. Analysts think it could have been 25% to 30%.Gilead's stock fell more than 17% the day Express disclosed the deal, and some analysts cut their ratings or lowered their targets.Monday's news helped Gilead's stock rally 2%. AbbVie fell 2%.""Gilead is not a biotech start-up,"" Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert said Monday. ""This is a savvy, marketing-driven company that understands how to launch and manage a product life cycle. .. . Don't underestimate Gilead's ability to manage the competitive environment.""In his own research note Monday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee pointed out that he and most of the Street had already assumed a Gilead price cut once Viekira Pak came out.""We already have a steep 15% gross to net and moving to 18% over the following few quarters,"" Yee wrote. ""So it's not like we think the average price to CVS is going to be drastically different than a 15%-20% discount.""

1851,GILD,"In whatever you do, sometimes conditions don't go according to plan. Rain or other bad weather can kill your plans for a weekend picnic or stop you from going out on a cross-country bike ride.In the CAN SLIM investing method, one key thing that IBD always stresses is before you invest in stocks, they should have big volume breaking out of bases.While heavy volume is the ideal situation, it doesn't always come just when an excellent stock takes out the buy point in a well-constructed base.Exceptions Can OccurWhile a lot of fundamental, technical and market factors should be in place before you buy a stock, it's rare that every single aspect is perfect before the stock proves to be a good breakout. But you definitely want to see far more positives than failing factors.Regarding volume, daily turnover should be at least 40% to 50% above average when a stock clears a buy point in a base. IBD computes a stock's average over the past 50 trading sessions. In the data tables, the ""Volume Percentage Change"" figure reflects the change in the prior day's volume vs. its 50-day average.Big turnover signals that professionals such as mutual funds and hedge funds are buying shares. So at a critical point such as a breakout, a big volume spike (along with a healthy price gain) is the best evidence of big turnover. The higher the volume, the bigger the conviction in a move.Sometimes, though, trade will rise only slightly — not quite 40% or more — above average. Other times, volume may be well below typical levels.It's not an automatic game over, and it's not a sell signal, either. Heavy volume can come a few days later to validate a breakout. It can happen when a stock takes out a base's buy point before an earnings report.In other cases, overall market volume may be light, affecting the level of turnover among emerging market leaders.If a stock has solid leadership qualities, such as high top- and bottom-line growth, and showed increasing accumulation before staging a low-volume breakout, you may want to give it more leeway.While strong volume is the best evidence of institutional buying, price is the final arbiter.Remember: Always cut losses if a stock falls 7% or 8% below your buy point. This is key whether a breakout occurs in overwhelming or underwhelming turnover.Market leader Gilead Sciences (GILD) staged a breakout in weak turnover during late June but has gone on to post nice gains.On June 30, the biotech passed an 83.80 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. Trade ended 14% below average that day (1), and the stock closed below 83.80, down 4 cents at 82.91, both of which are uninspiring. But volume may have been slow ahead of the July 4 holiday.In the first quarter, Gilead's profit jumped 208%, the biggest jump in years, on a 97% rise in revenue to $5 billion.The stock rose 6% from July 1 through 3. Trade was only modestly above average July (2). Big volume didn't come in until July 23 2. By that time, the stock had already climbed 8% past the 83.80 trigger.

Shares of the restaurant operator have been on a tear since coming off a low in October, rising more than 80%. But the stock has yet to form a proper base. In February, Red Robin reported a 17% rise in fiscal Q4 sales, marking the biggest gain in two years, as well as the second straight period of acceleration.Avago Technologies (AVGO) cooled off from a new high, trimming a 2% gain by more than half.

1913,GILD,"Big-cap biotech and IBD 50 stock Gilead Sciences (GILD) reported good late-stage trial data for its new HIV drug Wednesday. Analysts nicknamed the drug ""son of Viread"" and expect it to be a blockbuster. The stock was up about 2.2% by afternoon trading on the stock market today.
"
1914,GILD,"The two trials compared a standard combination of four drugs that are combined in Gilead's (GILD) most advanced marketed product, Stribild, to one in which one of the components (sold individually as Viread) was replaced with tenofovir alafenamide, or TAF.

He was senior VP of technology at Salesforce.com, charged with building its software-as-a service, or SaaS, platform.CRM Software Drives RevenueVeeva's core Customer Relationship Management, or CRM, software is built on the Salesforce.com platform.""Veeva is Salesforce.com's preferred partner for pharma and biotech,"" Gassner said. ""We are a sales channel for Salesforce.com and a partner.""CRM software accounts for about 90% of Veeva's revenue, which is expected to top $300 million this year.According to research firm Gartner, CRM software revenue worldwide grew in double digits in 2012 and 2013. Moreover, vertical or industry-specific software comprised the largest segment of the enterprise software market, at $107 billion, or 26% of the total.Most of that software is still focused on client servers rather than the cloud, or Internet, Gassner says. ""We're bringing it from client servers to the cloud. There's tremendous opportunity and we're just at the early stage of it.""Veeva's revenue in fiscal 2013 grew 111% to $129.5 million and 62% in to $210.2 million in fiscal 2014, which ended in January.Revenue in the second quarter, which ended July 31, rose 53% to $75.7 million.Net income in the quarter jumped 69% to $12.4 million, or 9 cents per share. Though the company went public in October 2013, it figured EPS in the earlier period amounted to the equivalent of 6 cents a share.Veeva's stock is up more than 40% from its IPO price of 20. After rising at first, shares dipped to 17 in May. But they rebounded sharply after Q2 results were announced on Aug. 28. That day, the company raised its forecast for the full year to $300-$303 million from $277-$282 million previously.Per-share earnings guidance for the year was upped to 30-31 cents from 26-28 cents. Analysts expect Veeva's earnings to come in at 31 cents, for a 35% gain over last year. They see growth of 23% and 32% the next two years, according to Thomson Reuters.Managing Clinical TrialsManagement said the firm made ""great progress"" in the quarter on a second product category called Veeva Vault.Veeva built its own infrastructure for Vault, which focuses on content management for processes such as clinical trials, quality management, manufacturing and sales and marketing.More than 10 new Vault customers were added in Q2, including the second top-10 drug company that signed on for Vault's clinical trial product.""It's the fastest part of the business,"" Barnicle said of Vault. Similar to how Veeva's CRM software replaces Siebel's, Vault is replacing the ""old content management systems"" used in life sciences, Barnicle says.Tracking More DataVeeva's third and newest product line is called Network, a cloud-based solution integrated into the firm's CRM platform to help customers track data on their health care customers.William Blair analysts estimate that Vault and Network offerings could expand Veeva's market opportunity from roughly $700 million to as much as $3.8 billion. The upper target was based on expansion potential of its Network database to other regions of the world beyond the U.S. and China.Veeva's largest market is in the U.S., followed by Western Europe and Asia — especially China and Japan.William Blair analysts expect Veeva's revenue to reach $1 billion by the end of 2020.Veeva is far from the only company offering health care-specific technology. But the William Blair analysts said in their recent initiation report on Veeva that the ""vast majority"" offer on-premises products or use an isolated or single-client hosting model.""We believe these legacy vendors will lose the innovation, speed to market and price battles,"" they wrote.One chief rival is Cegedim, a global tech and services firm focused on health care. Cegedim's CRM business is being acquired by IMS Health (IMS). William Blair estimates that around 40% of Cegedim's seats use on-premises technology.Gassner sees the pending acquisition as a positive for Veeva. ""There will be disruption and we will benefit from that,"" he said.

"
1958,GILD,"For decades, Charlotte Stewart was carrying around a virus that was like the houseguest that refused to leave: hepatitis C.
"
1959,GILD,"Stewart was first diagnosed with HCV in 1998, but she believes she contracted it as much as 20 years earlier, when she received two blood transfusions and three injections with blood-related products.
"
1960,GILD,"By the time the virus was detected, her liver was already showing the scarring, known as cirrhosis, that appears in the more advanced cases of the disease.
"
1961,GILD,"""Fortunately, that didn't get much worse, because I did do the treatment,"" Stewart, now 66, told IBD. ""I did six rounds of treatment, with the sixth being Harvoni.""
"
1962,GILD,"Harvoni is the new pill just launched this month by Gilead Sciences (GILD), which Stewart got early because she participated in its clinical trials. Harvoni is a combination of the novel drug ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, which for nearly a year has been sold alone under the brand name Sovaldi.
"
1963,GILD,"High Hopes
"
1964,GILD,"Sovaldi's launch smashed all previous new drug launches. Since it came out in December 2013 it has racked up nearly $6 billion in sales — and that's before Gilead's third-quarter report, which is due on Oct. 28. Since Harvoni is the new-and-improved Sovaldi, analysts expect it to treat even more patients.
"
1965,GILD,"Stewart's previous treatment experience shows just why Gilead is rolling in money right now.
"
1966,GILD,"Her first four treatments were variations on the combination of interferon and ribavirin, which was the standard at the time. She credits those treatments with slowing her liver damage, but they didn't get rid of the HCV and they did make her feel sick.
"
1967,GILD,"In fact, her third treatment round, which involved daily injections of interferon, drove down her blood-cell counts so low that she nearly landed in the hospital.
"
1968,GILD,"""It was very difficult going through those treatments,"" she said. ""I always developed anemia. Achiness, fevers, chills and no energy.""
"
1969,GILD,"In contrast, when she was in the Harvoni trial, she took one pill a day for 12 weeks and suffered no side effects. After 12 weeks, her viral load was undetectable — and still is, more than a year later.
"
1970,GILD,"""Physically, I have more energy, and just overall better health,"" Stewart said. ""Mentally and emotionally, it's like having a huge weight taken off you.""
"
1971,GILD,"More than 90% of patients in the trial responded that way. Yet Gilead's stock fell 2% the day Harvoni was approved, and it kept falling the next three days after that.
"
1972,GILD,"In a way, that's been the story of Gilead's life since the Sovaldi launch. Though the company scores high by IBD metrics with a perfect Composite Rating of 99, its price/earnings multiple is more like that of a big pharma than a booming biotech, say drug analysts. And just about every hint of bad news seems to trigger a sell-off.
"
1973,GILD,"The biggest cause of concern has been price. Sovaldi's price of $1,000 a pill — which adds up to $84,000 for a 12-week course — came under fire from advocacy groups, insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and even members of Congress. However, nobody could really do anything about it so long as Sovaldi was so clearly superior to everything else on the market.
"
1974,GILD,"Gilead priced Harvoni basically at parity with Sovaldi. Since most patients still had to take interferon and ribavirin along with Sovaldi — and those drugs are generic and therefore cheaper — Gilead marked Harvoni up 12.5% from Sovaldi to cover for the cost of the two absent drugs.
"
1975,GILD,"However, Harvoni's official label allows that an eight-week treatment ""can be considered"" for patients without cirrhosis who haven't been treated before. Gilead estimates that 45% of patients may be eligible for this.
"
1976,GILD,"Given this, FBR analyst Andrew Berens estimates that the average cost of Harvoni treatment will be about $80,000.
"
1977,GILD,"However, he also pointed out that cirrhotic patients whose previous treatments have failed — patients like Charlotte Stewart — are recommended to take Harvoni for 24 weeks. He also says patients whose Sovaldi treatments have failed may represent an underrated opportunity.
"
1978,GILD,"""Using our HCV patient flow model, we calculate over 250,000 total patients needing re-treatment over Sovaldi's viable patent life, over $12 billion in the U.S. alone,"" Berens wrote in an Oct. 13 note, in which he raised his estimate of 2015 U.S. Harvoni sales to $8.9 billion from $8.1 billion.
"
1979,GILD,"But the longer-term threat to Gilead's pricing power is competition. The next few months will bring a lot more clarity on what that competition will look like.
"
1980,GILD,"The first real peer to Harvoni is expected to be AbbVie 's (ABBV) 3D regimen, which the FDA is due to make an approval decision on by Dec. 22.
"
1981,GILD,"In clinical trials, the 3D regimen has been comparable to Harvoni in safety and effectiveness, but it does involve three different drugs, which makes it easier for patients to mess up.
"
1982,GILD,"Discount Price?
"
1983,GILD,"AbbVie's management has been tight-lipped about how it will price the drug, leaving Wall Street to speculate about how much it will be willing to undercut Harvoni.
"
1984,GILD,"ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum expects that it will probably price comparably and perhaps offer rebates to certain customers, but he estimates there's a 1% to 15% chance that AbbVie will price at a significant discount.
"
1985,GILD,"Before that happens — on the second weekend in November, to be precise — Merck (MRK) will report mid-stage trial data on its own HCV program, which could potentially cut down the treatment time to four weeks.
"
1986,GILD,"That wouldn't launch for a few more years, but the drug industry tends to think in long time frames. When Gilead acquired sofosbuvir with its buyout of Pharmasset in Nov. 2011, it was already thinking about the fact that its legacy HIV franchise — such blockbusters as Viread, Truvada and Atripla — will start going off patent in 2018.
"
1987,GILD,"The HCV franchise is filling that space now, but Gilead hasn't exactly given up on HIV either. On Sept. 25, Gilead reported positive late-stage trial results for a drug that analysts have dubbed ""son of Viread,"" because it's a similar compound but with fewer side effects.
"
1988,GILD,"Whatever the long-term future may hold, Gilead's near-term success is expected to roll on. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Gilead to report Q3 earnings of $1.92 a share, up 269% from the prior year. Sales are seen more than doubling to just less than $6 billion.For decades, Charlotte Stewart was carrying around a virus that was like the houseguest that refused to leave: hepatitis C.Stewart was first diagnosed with HCV in 1998, but she believes she contracted it as much as 20 years earlier, when she received two blood transfusions and three injections with blood-related products.By the time the virus was detected, her liver was already showing the scarring, known as cirrhosis, that appears in the more advanced cases of the disease.""Fortunately, that didn't get much worse, because I did do the treatment,"" Stewart, now 66, told IBD.

And Citigroup Tuesday raised its price target on Actavis to $310 from $250, citing potential synergies and growth prospects for Actavis.Investors seemed pleased that Valeant will not have to go through the merger process with Allergan, and took its stock up more than 4% in more than double usual volume, after rising nearly 2% on Monday. Valeant, under a deal with Ackman, will get 15% of the profit from Pershing Square's Allergan holding.Allergan rose 2.1% to 213.50 as Actavis' higher stock price means a higher deal valuation.Valeant, which is also on the IBD 50 list of top-rated stocks, can now focus on its broad line of drugs, mainly in dermatology, neurology, eye health and branded generics. Its portfolio includes antidepressant Wellbutrin XL and Liposoniz, Thermage and Fraxel in the professional skin-care sector.Gilead Sciences (GILD) climbed 3% in higher volume after the European Union granted the company permission to market Harvoni, the first once-daily single tablet regimen to treat hepatitis C, a highly infectious disease that primarily affects the liver and can lead to cirrhosis, a potentially fatal disease. It combines the blockbuster Sovaldi with another drug.Israel-based Taro Pharmaceutical (TARO) continued to recover from an 11% drop in three days after the company on Nov. 9 reported strong earnings and revenue gains for the Sept. 30-ended quarter, partly on price increases, but said it also had a marginal decline in volume.Its stock was on track Tuesday afternoon to post its third straight daily rise, and was trading up 1% in more than twice normal volume.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

2010,GILD,"Shares of big-cap biotech Vertex Pharmaceuticals fell Monday after the results on its latest cystic fibrosis drug disappointed investors. Vertex (VRTX) reported data from a mid stage study combining drug candidate VX-661 with the al ready-marketed ivacaftor, branded Kalydeco, in patients with cystic fibrosis caused by homozygous F508del mutation. Vertex's other products already treat this population, but the firm hopes VX-661 can be expanded into the harder-to-treat heterozygous F508del mutation population.
"
2011,GILD,"""Consistent with prior Phase 2 studies that evaluated 4 weeks of treatment with VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor, this study showed a rapid improvement in lung function within four weeks of treatment, and after patients completed treatment, lung function returned to baseline,"" Vertex's press release summarized.

2014,GILD,"The 12-week data was an average of weeks two through 12, and Vertex told analysts that the numbers actually didn't smoothly tail off after four weeks but bounced up and down over the course of treatment.

"
2022,GILD,"Progress was measured by performing a liver biopsy at the beginning and end of the 52-week treatment course, and measuring it on the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) as compared to a placebo group. The company's press release, however, argued that the problem was that the placebo group turned unexpectedly healthy.

2056,GILD,"Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.
"
2057,GILD,"Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500. Its performance ranks in the top 30% of its large-cap growth peers, tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
2058,GILD,"Weiner has used the same approach for most if not all of his tenure, he says. He seeks undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, avoiding overly costly names.
"
2059,GILD,"Weiner, 45 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Boston about how he invests.
"
2060,GILD,"IBD: Jason, if you ever had a mentor, who was it?
"
2061,GILD,"Weiner: I've had tons of mentors. On the rare occasions when (Fidelity) rolls me out to meet MBAs visiting Fidelity, I tell them they should find a mentor, either outside their workplace or inside, or preferably both.
"
2062,GILD,"It's super important, going back to when I was 15 and had my first job. I got it from a family friend, Lou, who was a great influence. It was Lou Nargiso, and he owned a gas station-auto repair shop. He was a World War II vet, and he learned auto repair in the army.
"
2063,GILD,"He was a very well-educated person and philosophical. He liked to debate things. Everyone who worked for Lou was very loyal to him, as was he to them. His shop was also kind of a clubhouse for his World War II vet buddies, and I hung out with them. Good times!
"
2064,GILD,"IBD: And at Fidelity?
"
2065,GILD,"Weiner: At Fidelity, Will Danoff (manager of Fidelity's $111.1 billion Contrafund , $28.9 billion Advisor New Insights , $6.4 billion Series Opportunistic Insights and $884.8 million Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights has been a great mentor.
"
2066,GILD,"I don't remember exactly when it kicked off. It might have been around 1993. We were both on a train. Will was going to southern Connecticut, visiting his parents. We sat next to each other. I worked for him later. I gained a lot of wisdom. Will is super focused on studying each decade, understanding monster stocks in each decade, and being in the elephant-hunting business — hunting stocks that go on to make monster gains.
"
2067,GILD,"If you owned Dell in 1990, for the next 10 years nothing else mattered. It's the beauty of incredible growth stories. Will was focused on that, and I have adopted that strategy.
"
2068,GILD,"IBD: Overall, you look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, right?
"
2069,GILD,"Weiner: You only get paid for two things with growth stocks. First, for P-E expansion. Second, for underlying earnings growth of the companies you invest in.
"
2070,GILD,"Typically, I focus on the growth rate of companies. That's where fundamental research can bring value. And I try to leverage Fidelity's research engine a lot.
"
2071,GILD,"It's a little harder to predict P-E.
"
2072,GILD,"IBD: And you try to avoid valuations that are too high, correct?
"
2073,GILD,"Weiner: If you can enter a name you like when there's controversy or doubt that casts its P-E lower, that's a great opportunity.
"
2074,GILD,"IBD: Give me an example, please.
"
2075,GILD,"Weiner: The best in recent years is Facebook (FB), after Facebook botched its IPO.
"
2076,GILD,"The stock had gone public (at 38) and traded down immediately. It bottomed around 17 even though the company was doing great. But there were clouds of controversy that pummeled the stock.
"
2077,GILD,"I bought after the IPO. I didn't buy it all on one day. My (average price per share) was in the 20s.
"
2078,GILD,"While the stock was going down, the company was rolling out newsfeed ads. It seems like ancient history, but newsfeed ads are relatively new. About the time of the IPO, they stopped relying on ads for PC-based service and shifted to newsfeed ads that appeared on mobile devices. It was a fundamental transformation of their business model. That's Facebook's story today.
"
2079,GILD,"IBD: Should people think of Growth Discovery as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy?
"
2080,GILD,"Weiner: A lot of the fund would be recognizable as a GARP basket. That's OK. But in addition, I try to buy the best growth names in the market, the ones that are going to turn into big, sustainable, valuable franchises. That's a little different from GARP.
"
2081,GILD,"My top 40 names are 65% of my assets. Not every name will become a brand-new, unbelievable franchise. Some already have great franchises. Some will become great. But if you look at every decade — and I know this from some of the publications that William O'Neil sends me — in the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s and so on, and look at the monster stocks, there are never that many. I try to buy those sorts of names.
"
2082,GILD,"IBD: You are allowed to invest in any market-cap size, but the fund has been large-cap oriented for a long time. Its heaviest weighting was in megacaps as of Sept. 30. Why those, why U.S. ones?
"
2083,GILD,"Weiner: Let's take the U.S. piece first. The U.S. economy is doing better than the average developed nation's, so it's fortuitous to be U.S. investors in this day.
"
2084,GILD,"And why so many megacaps? If you look at Internet models, the (successful) ones are global, scalable, enjoy incredible network effects and are viral. That's what we want.
"
2085,GILD,"I point to Facebook. The biggest companies, like that, enjoy increased returns as they get bigger.
"
2086,GILD,"If you were a manufacturer 50 years ago, you might have experienced decreasing returns for every single additional widget you made. They had to be sold at lower margins to incent the market to buy your product. In the Internet age, it's the opposite: increased returns.
"

2089,GILD,"IBD: Why did you boost your Apple (AAPL) weighting to 5.8% as of Oct. 31 from less than 1% as of March 31 and 2.3% as of June 30?
"
2090,GILD,"Weiner: Full disclosure: I have not done a great job trading Apple in the last five years. I give myself low marks on that one. I can make a long list of Apple's positives and negatives. I've focused on the negatives in the last five years. I'm not going to do that any more.

2094,GILD,"Weiner: One of the key buckets of stock I've avoided is large-cap tech legacy players: Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Microsoft (MSFT) and on and on. I generally underweight them. I'm mindful that they have secular challenges. When that happens, you never know if they will catch up. IBM (IBM) for years faced them but somehow always punched out good earnings. But that may be changing. Last quarter was terrible for them.

2095,GILD,"When secular challenges catch up to a company, it's all over. In the 1990s, I was a tech analyst covering Compaq, Tandem, Digital, Stratus, Data General. They faced secular challenges. When the wave hit, they fell over. They don't exist now (as independent companies).

2101,GILD,"Weiner: My Alexion thesis (as of my latest disclosure) was this: they are a super orphan-drug company. They only go after indications with small patient populations, where they get a lot of money for life-saving drugs.

2113,GILD,"Weiner: What I like about Ulta is that beauty has high emotional content for women. Ulta gives them the ability to walk into a mall-based, completely dedicated beauty retailer and not have to walk halfway across a department store to get to a beauty counter.

2121,GILD,"Alibaba's gross merchandise value is larger than Amazon (AMZN) and eBay's (EBAY) combined.Jason Weiner is like Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500. Its performance ranks in the top 30% of its large-cap growth peers, tracked by Morningstar Inc.Weiner has used the same approach for most if not all of his tenure, he says. He seeks undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, avoiding overly costly names.Weiner, 45 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Boston about how he invests.IBD: Jason, if you ever had a mentor, who was it?Weiner: I've had tons of mentors. On the rare occasions when (Fidelity) rolls me out to meet MBAs visiting Fidelity, I tell them they should find a mentor, either outside their workplace or inside, or preferably both.It's super important, going back to when I was 15 and had my first job. I got it from a family friend, Lou, who was a great influence. It was Lou Nargiso, and he owned a gas station-auto repair shop. He was a World War II vet, and he learned auto repair in the army.He was a very well-educated person and philosophical. He liked to debate things. Everyone who worked for Lou was very loyal to him, as was he to them. His shop was also kind of a clubhouse for his World War II vet buddies, and I hung out with them. Good times!IBD: And at Fidelity?Weiner: At Fidelity, Will Danoff (manager of Fidelity's $111.1 billion Contrafund , $28.9 billion Advisor New Insights , $6.4 billion Series Opportunistic Insights and $884.8 million Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights has been a great mentor.I don't remember exactly when it kicked off. It might have been around 1993. We were both on a train. Will was going to southern Connecticut, visiting his parents. We sat next to each other. I worked for him later. I gained a lot of wisdom. Will is super focused on studying each decade, understanding monster stocks in each decade, and being in the elephant-hunting business — hunting stocks that go on to make monster gains.If you owned Dell in 1990, for the next 10 years nothing else mattered. It's the beauty of incredible growth stories. Will was focused on that, and I have adopted that strategy.IBD: Overall, you look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, right?Weiner: You only get paid for two things with growth stocks. First, for P-E expansion. Second, for underlying earnings growth of the companies you invest in.Typically, I focus on the growth rate of companies. That's where fundamental research can bring value. And I try to leverage Fidelity's research engine a lot.It's a little harder to predict P-E.IBD: And you try to avoid valuations that are too high, correct?Weiner: If you can enter a name you like when there's controversy or doubt that casts its P-E lower, that's a great opportunity.IBD: Give me an example, please.Weiner: The best in recent years is Facebook (FB), after Facebook botched its IPO.The stock had gone public (at 38) and traded down immediately. It bottomed around 17 even though the company was doing great. But there were clouds of controversy that pummeled the stock.I bought after the IPO. I didn't buy it all on one day. My (average price per share) was in the 20s.While the stock was going down, the company was rolling out newsfeed ads. It seems like ancient history, but newsfeed ads are relatively new. About the time of the IPO, they stopped relying on ads for PC-based service and shifted to newsfeed ads that appeared on mobile devices. It was a fundamental transformation of their business model. That's Facebook's story today.IBD: Should people think of Growth Discovery as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy?Weiner: A lot of the fund would be recognizable as a GARP basket. That's OK. But in addition, I try to buy the best growth names in the market, the ones that are going to turn into big, sustainable, valuable franchises. That's a little different from GARP.My top 40 names are 65% of my assets. Not every name will become a brand-new, unbelievable franchise. Some already have great franchises. Some will become great. But if you look at every decade — and I know this from some of the publications that William O'Neil sends me — in the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s and so on, and look at the monster stocks, there are never that many. I try to buy those sorts of names.IBD: You are allowed to invest in any market-cap size, but the fund has been large-cap oriented for a long time. Its heaviest weighting was in megacaps as of Sept. 30. Why those, why U.S. ones?Weiner: Let's take the U.S. piece first. The U.S. economy is doing better than the average developed nation's, so it's fortuitous to be U.S. investors in this day.And why so many megacaps? If you look at Internet models, the (successful) ones are global, scalable, enjoy incredible network effects and are viral. That's what we want.I point to Facebook. The biggest companies, like that, enjoy increased returns as they get bigger.If you were a manufacturer 50 years ago, you might have experienced decreasing returns for every single additional widget you made. They had to be sold at lower margins to incent the market to buy your product. In the Internet age, it's the opposite: increased returns.The other thing about the Internet is that it's a winner-takes-the-most dynamic. Google (GOOGL) is the leader in search. That is a winner-takes-all battle, and they won.It's to be determined in the OTA (online travel agency) space. You've got Facebook, Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and a bunch of other ones.

2122,GILD,"Sometimes, drug launches take a while to get off the ground. Incyte's only approved drug, Jakafi, has been on the market three years, but it's really only just getting started.Jakafi, sold in some markets as Jakavi, is approved for a rare bone-marrow cancer called myelofibrosis (MF). Thanks to that indication, Incyte's (INCY) revenue is expected to pass $530 million this year, compared with just $94 million in 2011, the year Jakafi launched.It's the other indications in the pipeline, however, that could really push the drug into blockbuster territory.The first of these, expected to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration by Dec. 5, is for polycythemia vera (PV), a similar but somewhat milder disease, which has a potentially larger market.Meanwhile, clinical trials are going on for the really big-name cancers: pancreatic, breast, lung and colon.Current consensus estimates have Jakafi's annual sales in the U.S. hitting $1.3 billion by 2020. Abroad, where Incyte splits the take with marketing partner Novartis (NVS), sales are expected to pass $900 million by that year.""Incyte is based on the idea that research in cancer is a good investment,"" CEO Herve Hoppenot told IBD in an interview.Opportunity SeizedJakafi is a Janus associated kinase (JAK) inhibitor, regulating the signaling mechanisms in cells that play an important role in cell growth and immune response.Jakafi was the first JAK inhibitor on the market and so far the only one approved to fight cancer. Pfizer's (PFE) Xeljanz, approved in 2012, is also a JAK inhibitor but is used against rheumatoid arthritis.Hoppenot says that Incyte was originally aiming at the big cancers first, but the MF opportunity unexpectedly came up when scientists found that the JAK signaling played an important role in the disease.""At that point, the company decided to move the development program very quickly to myelofibrosis and try to prove that the JAK pathway was having an impact on the outcome for these patients,"" he said. ""We were able to get the pivotal studies done and the approval for myelofibrosis in a very rapid way.""Another advantage that the MF market brought to the firm was a small patient pool that had no other treatment options, so Incyte has been able to market it domestically without bringing in a big-pharma partner. It can thus keep all the domestic revenues for itself.Pursuing PV was the next logical step, Hoppenot says, because the diseases are so similar. Both of them are myeloproliferative disorders, which means that excess cells are produced in the bone marrow.PV, however, is much milder and can sometimes have no symptoms at all. Hoppenot estimates that only about 25% of the roughly 100,000 PV patients in the U.S. are eligible for Jakafi. He expects the liftoff to be fairly slow, because treating PV isn't as urgent as treating more malignant cancers.But the eventual market could be larger than that of MF, which has fewer than 14,000 sufferers, according to Leerink's estimate.These two diseases should bring Incyte its first annual profit next year, according to a consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Incyte turned a profit of 33 cents a share in the most recently reported quarter, but only because of two milestone payments that Incyte collected from Novartis on winning reimbursement for Jakafi in Europe and marketing approval in Japan.Starting in the second half of next year, analysts expect Incyte to start turning an operating profit in a more consistent way.Rivalry In The WingsThe year after that, however, new competition could threaten Jakafi. Gilead Sciences' (GILD) JAK inhibitor momelotinib is in a late-stage trial for MF, designed to compare momelotinib with Jakafi head to head. The results are expected to come out sometime next year.A couple of smaller players, CTI BioPharma (CTIC) and Geron (GERN), also have competitors in late-stage testing. On Nov. 13, the latter licensed its candidate, imetelstat, to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) for development in multiple diseases, under a deal potentially worth $935 million if all the milestones are realized.Although only the data will tell how competitive these products will be, Incyte has other tools in its garage.INCB24360, a candidate from another drug class called IDO1 inhibitors, is being tested in combination with some of the most anticipated cancer drugs in the pipeline, the PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. Incyte has partnered with all four of the leading contenders in the field — Bristol-Myers (BMY), AstraZeneca (AZN), Roche (RHHBY), and Merck (MRK) — to test their drugs together for a variety of cancers.These are not licensing deals, says Hoppenot. But they do mean that if and when the drugs are approved, the companies can recommend a successful combination on the drugs' labels.INCB24360 also garnered some attention at this summer's American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, when it performed well in a trial combining it with a different though related Bristol-Myers drug, Yervoy, to treat melanoma.Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt wrote at the time that while the combo didn't appear to be as effective as Yervoy combined with Bristol's in-house anti-PD-1 Opdivo, it did suggest promise for combinations of INCB24360 with other anti-PD-1s.This news, along with a better-than-expected third quarter report last month, induced Goldman Sachs analyst Navdeep Singh to lift his rating on Incyte to neutral from sell and nearly double his price target to 62.""Our sell thesis was based on our more cautious view on Jakafi's launch for myelofibrosis (MF) given safety and competition, but this call has not worked as the narrative has shifted to INCY's pipeline,"" Singh wrote in his Oct. 31 research note. He added that following the newly out Q3 results and ASCO 2014, ""we are more encouraged by: (1) strong underlying growth for Jakafi in MF and (2) early data and partnership interest for IDO1 inhibitor.""

2124,GILD,"Here is why shares of biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) and three four other highly rated stocks are rallying in heavy volume today.Gilead began running up in premarket trading after drug giant Merck (MRK) said Sunday it would not move forward with development of a drug combination aimed at shortening treatment time for hepatitis C, citing disappointing clinical data. The treatment would have used Gilead's Sovaldi, but also would compete with the current, longer-term regimen based on Sovaldi.Gilead, whose stock tops the IBD Leaderboard list of best-performing stocks, was up 0.7% in above-average volume in Monday afternoon trading in the stock market today. Gilead shares had risen further. Merck pared losses for a 0.6% decline.General acute care hospital operator HCA Holdings (HCA) rebounded from Friday's selloff, which came after the Supreme Court said it will hear a case challenging the legality of ObamaCare's premium subsidies in 36 states.Shares of hospitals sold off heavily Friday on fears they could lose patients who pay if the court strikes down the subsidies. HCA sank nearly 5% on Friday, but was up 2% Monday afternoon. Community Health System (CYH), which operates 135 hospitals, fell 5.5% Friday and was up nearly 3%.Ambarella's (AMBA) stock climbed 3.5% intraday Monday. The chipmaker supplies chips to camera makers, including popular sports enthusiast on-body camera maker GoPro (GPRO). GoPro shares fell 3% after it said it will sell about $800 million worth of shares to raise funds, which will dilute its stock price.Until Monday, GoPro and on-body camera rivals Taser International (TASR) and Digital Ally (DGLY) had seen strong sales in the wake of the Ferguson shooting in August that led to a surge of orders from police departments for on-officer camera systemsYY (YY) climbed 4% ahead of its third-quarter earnings release Tuesday after the market closes. The Chinese social network lets users connect via voice, text and video real time to play games and interact in the world's largest consumer market.Consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for YY to report a 62% rise in earnings per share to 76 cents on a 92% hike in revenue to $152.5 million.Homebuilder Lennar (LEN) was up 2.6%, hitting a fresh seven-year high. The homebuilder group, which has been range-bound since early spring, on Monday was trading near the top of that range.Lennar also got a boost Tuesday from the Toll Bros. (TOL) preannouncement of a 29.3% rise in Q4 revenue as the average price of homes delivered rose 6.3% year over year to $747,000. Toll Bros., which will announce full earnings on Dec. 10, was up 3.4%. Toll shares rose nearly 4%.Meanwhile, builder D.R. Horton (DHI) rose more than 2%. Horton is slated to release fiscal Q4 earnings results Tuesday before the market opens.

2125,GILD,"Gilead Sciences beat third-quarter sales estimates and issued cautious guidance late Tuesday, as its bottom line was hit by an ObamaCare-related fee.
"
2126,GILD,"The stock slipped 4% after hours following a new record high during the regular session.
"
2127,GILD,"Gilead (GILD) revenue rose 117% to $6.04 billion, beating analysts' consensus by about $50 million. Earnings leapt 254% to $1.84 a share, but 8 cents short of the Street's estimate. But Gilead said that the number included ""a cumulative catch-up of $337 million"" (21 cents per share) due to an ObamaCare-related Branded Prescription Drug Fee.
"
2128,GILD,"This was an accounting move ordered by the IRS after it issued final rules on the fees on July 28.
"
2129,GILD,"Gilead raised the low end of its full-year sales guidance, now $22 billion to $23 billion, though it's still shy of analysts' $24.3 billion. Its expense guidance was lifted to account for the BPD fee already mentioned, but its gross-margin guidance was also raised at the low end, so it's now 86% to 88%. As usual, the company did not offer EPS guidance.
"
2130,GILD,"Gilead's lead drug, hepatitis C fighter Sovaldi, came in almost $300 million below consensus, at $2.8 billion. Its HIV drugs all outperformed, more than making up the difference. Apart from Sovaldi, Gilead's product sales grew 8% sequentially.
"
2131,GILD,"Sovaldi's sales contracted 20% vs. Q2, as doctors delayed treatment before the launch of Harvoni, the new-and-improved combo pill that won FDA approval on Oct. 10. Harvoni combines Sovaldi with a novel drug, eliminating the need for other drugs.
"
2132,GILD,"Harvoni's first week of prescription data from IMS Health (IMS), which came out Friday, numbered 445 prescriptions filled vs. 151 in Sovaldi's first week.
"
2133,GILD,"Commercial Operations head Paul Carter warned against comparing those numbers too directly. Since Sovaldi launched just a few weeks before last Christmas, doctors likely were more reluctant to start patients on a 12-week medication program than they would be in mid-October, he said on the conference call with analysts.
"
2134,GILD,"""We are seeing a broader group of physicians writing scripts than with Sovaldi,"" he added. ""Several physicians we know have written scripts that never wrote one for Sovaldi, and I think this reflects the simplicity of the Harvoni regimen. We're also seeing the rate of adoption a little bit faster this time.""
"
2135,GILD,"Carter added the caveat that it might take longer for insurers to approve Harvoni prescriptions, since many were unprepared for the sheer volume of demand for Sovaldi and wound up missing their own quarterly financials.
"
2136,GILD,"""This time, insurance companies are more organized and prepared around the Harvoni launch, so there may be some more constraints initially,"" he said. However, he says it's really too early to know for sure.

2138,GILD,"""If we determine that the final rules will impact Gilead, we believe that our worldwide revenue base and operations in Ireland will provide us with options for structuring alternatives in the future,"" CFO Robin Washington said on the call.Gilead Sciences beat third-quarter sales estimates and issued cautious guidance late Tuesday, as its bottom line was hit by an ObamaCare-related fee.The stock slipped 4% after hours following a new record high during the regular session.Gilead (GILD) revenue rose 117% to $6.04 billion, beating analysts' consensus by about $50 million. Earnings leapt 254% to $1.84 a share, but 8 cents short of the Street's estimate. But Gilead said that the number included ""a cumulative catch-up of $337 million"" (21 cents per share) due to an ObamaCare-related Branded Prescription Drug Fee.This was an accounting move ordered by the IRS after it issued final rules on the fees on July 28.Gilead raised the low end of its full-year sales guidance, now $22 billion to $23 billion, though it's still shy of analysts' $24.3 billion. Its expense guidance was lifted to account for the BPD fee already mentioned, but its gross-margin guidance was also raised at the low end, so it's now 86% to 88%. As usual, the company did not offer EPS guidance.Gilead's lead drug, hepatitis C fighter Sovaldi, came in almost $300 million below consensus, at $2.8 billion. Its HIV drugs all outperformed, more than making up the difference. Apart from Sovaldi, Gilead's product sales grew 8% sequentially.Sovaldi's sales contracted 20% vs. Q2, as doctors delayed treatment before the launch of Harvoni, the new-and-improved combo pill that won FDA approval on Oct. 10. Harvoni combines Sovaldi with a novel drug, eliminating the need for other drugs.Harvoni's first week of prescription data from IMS Health (IMS), which came out Friday, numbered 445 prescriptions filled vs. 151 in Sovaldi's first week.Commercial Operations head Paul Carter warned against comparing those numbers too directly. Since Sovaldi launched just a few weeks before last Christmas, doctors likely were more reluctant to start patients on a 12-week medication program than they would be in mid-October, he said on the conference call with analysts.""We are seeing a broader group of physicians writing scripts than with Sovaldi,"" he added. ""Several physicians we know have written scripts that never wrote one for Sovaldi, and I think this reflects the simplicity of the Harvoni regimen. We're also seeing the rate of adoption a little bit faster this time.""Carter added the caveat that it might take longer for insurers to approve Harvoni prescriptions, since many were unprepared for the sheer volume of demand for Sovaldi and wound up missing their own quarterly financials.""This time, insurance companies are more organized and prepared around the Harvoni launch, so there may be some more constraints initially,"" he said. However, he says it's really too early to know for sure.Gilead also said it's still evaluating the impact of the changes to Ireland's tax laws in that country's 2015 budget, which includes closing the ""double Irish"" loophole that allows companies to shift profits through Irish subsidiaries into zero-tax havens.

2152,GILD,"Biotech stocks continued to slide Thursday, prompting analysts to weigh in on the causes and prognosis for the sector.Piper Jaffray's Joshua Schimmer noted that the same thing happened about a year ago, sparked by the price debate over Gilead Sciences' (GILD) hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, but also by valuation concerns after a long runup.""Obviously 2014 turned out to be a stellar year for biotech, and we believe industry fundamentals remain strong,"" he wrote in his research note. ""2015 should still be a good year for the industry, once we pass through this latest round of selling.""Schimmer wrote that profitable big caps such as Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) are ""attractively valued relative to peers.""On the other hand, he said money-losing big caps such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN) are more difficult to value.RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, in his report, wrote that ""it's reasonable and makes sense to us that some correction and profit taking has been possible given the significant outperformance in the first 3 months of 2015.""Yee noted that there were some ""over-exaggerated"" moves by some of the smaller biotechs last week, such as the CAR-T stocks (Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) jumped 24% and Kite Pharma (KITE) rose 14%), which in turn revived long-running concerns about a biotech bubble.Kite stock was down 10% in midday trading in the stock market today, while Juno stock was down 2% after falling more than 7% Wednesday.Yee added, however, that real bear markets are driven by poor fundamentals, which he says aren't evident yet in biotech.""We're watching our '3 pillars of risk': biosimilars (in flux), pricing/rebating, and IP risks, but these seem to be risks to individual companies but not to the whole sector,"" he wrote.Thursday marks the fifth straight trading-day decline for IBD's 368-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech group, which has slumped nearly 12% in that span. For now, though, it still ranks No. 1 out of 197 groups tracked by IBD.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.RELATED:Biotechs On Track For Worst Week In A Year.

"
2178,GILD,"Growth stocks show strength in a down market in many different ways.They can show tight weekly closes after a breakout, refusing to give up much ground.Or, when they do pull back, they show supporting action at their 10-week moving average.Another way great stocks show strength, either in a weakening market or in a bull market, is by forming a flat base.The price structure has been seen for decades in model-book studies of past stock market winners by IBD. Hilton (HLT) formed one in 1967 before a 232% advance in little more than a year. And Starbucks (SBUX) formed one in the second half of 2003 in the early stages of a new bull market. It more than doubled in 70 weeks.If you miss an initial breakout, watch for a potential flat base to form. It often appears after a stock breaks out of a cup with handle or a double bottom. In a flat base, the stock moves sideways in a tight price range for at least five weeks, showing a pullback of no more than 10% to 15%.Flat bases that show wide-and-loose, erratic swings should generally be avoided. Some might work, but plenty of others won't. If institutional support is truly strong for a stock, trading should be tight and orderly.The buy point in the flat base is 10 cents above the high of the left side of the base. A future Investor's Corner column will teach you how to identify earlier buy points in a flat base.Current Sector Leader Gilead Sciences (GILD) formed a flat base in 2012 that spawned a bullish upward move. It first cleared a consolidation in late July. The flat base that followed formed in five weeks and showed tight trading with a pullback of 9%.As the base formed, it paid a visit to its 10-week moving average (1).Gilead gapped out of the base at 35.25 (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in early 2013) in the week ended Nov. 16, helped by news that a combination of its experimental hepatitis C therapies cleared the virus in all patients in a trial.Weekly volume in the breakout week totaled about 166 million shares (2), nearly double its average at the time.Buying a stock when it gaps out of a base is counterintuitive, but those who bought Gilead on the Nov. 12 breakaway gap up in price have been rewarded nicely. Gilead is up 163% from the 2012 breakout.

2196,GILD,"December is usually a quiet month for medical tech news, but this year will bring a few potentially stock-moving events worth keeping an eye on.As you digest your Thanksgiving turkey, here are the top five in chronological order:By Dec. 5, biotech Incyte (INCY) is looking to get an important expansion of the label on its sole marketed drug, Jakafi. As explained in the recent Incyte profile in The New America, Incyte and its partner Novartis (NVS) have been pulling in respectable income on Jakafi as a treatment for a rare bone-marrow cancer called myelofibrosis. The FDA is pondering whether to add an indication for polycythemia vera, a milder but more common condition. While uptake for that condition is expected to be fairly slow, it's expected to help push Incyte into more consistently profitable territory next year.Two days later, hot medical-device company Edwards Lifesciences (EW) will hold its annual investor day, in which it is expected to give 2015 guidance for the first time. The company impressed the Street last month with its strong Q3 report and Q4 guidance, on the strong launch of its latest Sapien artificial heart valve. Currently, analysts are forecasting 2015 sales of $2.47 billion, up 7% from this year's estimate. Earnings per share are expected to rise 17% to $3.95.Then, sometime before Dec. 21 (which likely means Dec. 19), the FDA is due to issue its verdict on AbbVie's (ABBV) hepatitis C combo of Viekirax and Exviera. The clinical-trial data was so good, the Street would probably be less surprised if a meteor hit Manhattan than if the FDA rejects the drug, but what has analysts all on pins and needles is what the price will be. A price significantly lower than Gilead Sciences ' (GILD) recently launched Harvoni, which costs $94,000 for a 12-week treatment, would help AbbVie gain market share and certainly please pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts (ESRX), which has been hoping to start a price war to drive down the suddenly high cost of hepatitis C treatment. However, most analysts are expecting AbbVie to price only a little bit lower. Also affected by all this will be Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA), which licensed a component of Viekirax to AbbVie.Speaking of hepatitis C, sometime before the end of the year the Street is expecting to hear phase one clinical-trial data on Achillion Pharmaceuticals' (ACHN) ACH-3422. The drug belongs to the coveted nucleoside inhibitor class, to which Gilead's mega-blockbuster Sovaldi (also a component in Harvoni) belongs, but which has otherwise shown enough safety issues that there are few left in development. Especially since Merck (MRK) acquired Idenix Pharmaceuticals for its ""nuc,"" speculation that Achillion could be the next target has driven up its stock price, but the Street has seen little real data about the safety and effectiveness of ACH-3422. The data would help analysts determine just how much the company is worth.Speculation exists about whether two aborted takeover attempts earlier this year will be re-upped. The Street seems to have mostly given up on the possibility that Pfizer (PFE) will make another bid for AstraZeneca (AZN) after the six-month cooling-off period mandated under U.K. takeover rules expired on Wednesday. Astra's CEO Pascal Soriot threw more cold water while appearing on CNBC Thursday, saying the deal would have fallen apart even if it had been made because of proposed restrictions on tax-inversion deals in the U.S. However, RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro is still holding out hope for a union of orthopedics firms Stryker (SYK) and Smith & Nephew (SNN). Stryker didn't bid for the company, but since a news report leaked that it was working on one, it got slapped with the U.K.'s six-month cooling-off period anyway, which expired Nov. 28.""We believe a SYK/SNN deal could provide more recon (reconstructive surgery) scale, particularly in international markets, expand SYK's presence in trauma/sports medicine, and bring cost synergies,"" Novarro wrote in a note Friday.

2221,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) stock was rebounding in afternoon trading on the stock market today, as an analyst lifted his Q3 forecast for sales of blockbuster hepatitis C drug Sovaldi.FBR analyst Andrew Berens raised his estimate to $2.24 billion from $1.94 billion after examining August prescription data from health industry research firm Symphony Health Solutions. After a record-breaking launch following U.S. approval last December, Sovaldi's sales have slowed down over the summer. This has been generally interpreted as doctors ""warehousing"" patients ahead of the launch of another Gilead hep C drug, expected in October, as well as possible price competition from AbbVie's (ABBV) therapy, expected to launch in December. Berens, however, says he found less warehousing than he expected.""An analysis of the first two months of 3Q14 and a projection for the remaining month show U.S. Sovaldi prescriptions tracking above our previous estimates, suggesting that the formation of a second warehouse ahead of anticipated launches of all-oral therapies in 4Q14 may be slower than anticipated,"" he wrote in his research note Tuesday.The report helped arrest the decline of Gilead stock, which fell 2.6% Monday on news that it's allowing generic Sovaldi in poor countries.

""People are really, really scared for anything that causes volatility.""But ""there's a lot of discounting going on already,"" he said, and Sovaldi likely has a 20%-plus discount already applied to its retail value of $84,000 per 12-week course for those in prisons and governmental health programs.Gilead intends to retail Sovaldi in less affluent countries for only $900 for the same course, reported Bloomberg.""(Investors) are worried that the U.S. government is going to say, 'Why are you going to give it away in India while we're paying $65,000 per patient?' "" said Berens. ""It makes it more of a foil . . . for what they're charging in the U.S.""The recent media attention regarding Sovaldi may be causing shares to dip, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a note, but making pharmaceuticals available to lower income countries at a discount is ""nothing new.""""(This) is something they already do with HIV pills and (is) already expected,"" said Yee.What will be worth looking at, said FBR's Berens, is AbbVie's (ABBV) anticipated hepatitis C treatment, as investors will be keeping an eye on the drug's pricing.""This is going to become a very interesting market once AbbVie launches their drug,"" he said.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter at IBD_Elow.

2332,GILD,"Big-cap biotech and IBD 50 stock Gilead Sciences (GILD) said Monday that it's licensing its megablockbuster hepatitis C drug Sovaldi to seven Indian generic-drug companies to improve access in 91 developing countries. Gilead's stock fell about 2% on the stock market today.
"
2333,GILD,"The Sovaldi licensing deal includes the big names in the Indian drug business, such as Ranbaxy Labs and Cipla, as well as U.S.-based Mylan (MYL). The drugmakers will be able to set their own prices for their versions of sofosbuvir, as Sovaldi is called generically, presumably at a serious discount to its U.S. price of $84,000 for a 12-week course of treatment. Gilead has already priced the drug much lower in different markets — for instance in Egypt, which is both poorer and has a severe hepatitis C problem, a round of treatment only costs about $1,800. Gilead pointed out in its press release that this strategy was first developed for Gilead's HIV drugs such as Viread and Truvada, which made Gilead's original fortune but were otherwise priced out of reach of many people throughout the world who need them.
"
2334,GILD,"The release also said that the companies are authorized to make sofosbuvir in combination with other medicines, including Gilead's ledipasvir. Gilead is currently awaiting U.S. approval of a sofosbuvir/ledipasvir pill, which has shown to be better than sofosbuvir alone for treating patients with the most common genotype of the virus. Also, Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Daklinza has been approved in Europe for use in combination with sofosbuvir, although the Indian companies would presumably have to make their own deal with Bristol to manufacture those together.
"
2335,GILD,"The news wasn't a surprise since rumors of a generic Sovaldi deal were circulating earlier this month, adding volatility to the stock. However, analysts have been less concerned, based on the long experience of doing the same thing with HIV drugs.

2395,GILD,"Since Jerry Sullivan took over in mid-2008, the fund's average annual gain is 10.84% through Sept. 30. It tops the S&P 500's 10.02%. And it beats 91% of large-cap blend funds tracked by Morningstar.
"
2396,GILD,"In the same-length period prior to Sullivan's taking charge, the fund's 5.32% average annual gain lagged the S&P 500 and 88% of its large-cap blend peers.
"
2397,GILD,"Sullivan credits his outperformance to an appetite for both growth and value stocks. Also, he targets three types of stocks: ones he's followed for years, those pushed up and down by smart money, and special situations. And he focuses on valuation.
"
2398,GILD,"In addition, he applies lessons learned from his mentor and former boss, former Fidelity Investments superstar Peter Lynch, who ran the now-$16.7 billion Magellan Fund when it sat atop the fund world with strong performance and rapid growth.
"
2399,GILD,"Putnam Investors Fund assets peaked at $16.2 billion in August 2000 and shrank to a low of $1.2 billion by September 2011. Assets have been rising since then.
"
2400,GILD,"Sullivan, who is 54 years old, spoke with IBD from his office in Boston's financial district about how he invests.
"
2401,GILD,"IBD: Is it OK if I mention that you have a distinct Brooklyn accent?
"
2402,GILD,"Sullivan: I was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Long Island. My dad grew up a Brooklyn Dodgers fan. I grew up a New York Mets fan because the Dodgers had just moved to L.A. We hate the Yankees. I would relish your mentioning my accent.
"
2403,GILD,"IBD: You have a flexible style, right? You invest in both growth and value stocks.
"
2404,GILD,"Sullivan: I'm the core manager here at Putnam. Investors Fund is a mix of value and growth. So is my Multi-Cap Core Fund (with $109 million in assets), which is four years old. It's the same style, but even more flexible, because it can go up and down the market-cap spectrum. Investors Fund must have at least 75% of its securities in large caps. Multi-Cap cannot have more than 75% in any one category — large, mid or small cap. Stylewise, they're the same.
"
2405,GILD,"IBD: And what are the three types of stocks that Investors Fund buys?
"
2406,GILD,"Sullivan: I call the first bucket my legacy stocks. They're large caps that I researched earlier in my career or even recently. It was in-depth research. Then I gave each one three minutes of research every week for five, 10, 30 years. I refined my understanding of what factors move each stock up or down. That helps me understand when to make a move. It's my most boring bucket but the most important to me.
"
2407,GILD,"The second bucket has to do with smart money. The main factor is insider buying. I follow that closely and have for many years.
"
2408,GILD,"In the early to mid-1980s, when I worked for Peter Lynch, it was the No. 1 factor that he deferred to when looking for the right timing to buy a stock.
"
2409,GILD,"IBD: What was your role at Fidelity?
"
2410,GILD,"Sullivan: In 1985, I was doing research on European chemical stocks like BASF, Imperial Chemical and (Holland's) Akzo Nobel. Big stocks. It was important for Magellan to look for big, liquid stocks.
"
2411,GILD,"It was also much harder to follow insider transactions. You had to check SEC filings on paper. And they could be six to eight weeks old. The rules were looser about when insiders had to file.
"
2412,GILD,"Sarbanes-Oxley moved it to a 48-hour rule. And now you can watch the information flow in on the Internet in real time.
"
2413,GILD,"It doesn't tell me what to buy, but it gives me ideas.
"
2414,GILD,"The third bucket is special situations. One of the most common are follow-on stock offerings. They used to be called secondary offerings. It might be filed at 4 o'clock on a typical day. XYZ company is doing a follow-on. And you've got 45 minutes to decide if you want to play it or not. They'd file at 4:15 and close their books at 5 p.m.
"
2415,GILD,"IBD: What's a recent one you did?
"
2416,GILD,"Sullivan: The latest was HD Supply (HDS), which was part of Home Depot (HD). (Former CEO) Bob Nardelli started building a distributor of big equipment. They IPO'd it after he left. I bought on the IPO, and they did a secondary offering. I put in offers below the asking price.
"
2417,GILD,"IBD: How often does that work?
"
2418,GILD,"Sullivan: CDW (CDW) is a technology distributor. They sell to midsize companies that don't have big IT departments. They went public last year. Please specify that I still own it but I sold a lot of it.
"
2419,GILD,"I was maybe the first institutional investor to meet with them. They were never fast-growing. The underwriter was asking 22, maybe 24. I said, ""I want to buy a lot at 18."" The underwriter said, ""Maybe you missed the (detail) that we're selling at 24."" I said, ""No, I didn't miss it. I like it at 18, not 24."" At 18 it was trading at 12 times earnings. At 18 times earnings it's not warranted.
"
2420,GILD,"Anyway, they went on a road show, had difficulty getting an audience because a lot of guys thought it was overpriced. After two weeks, they came back and said 18 would work. I said, ""OK, but now I only want it at 17."" They went public at 17. Since then, they've met their meager expectations. As they did, they grabbed a larger audience (of investors). The stock has slowly migrated to 30-ish. That's a great special situation.
"
2421,GILD,"IBD: You like to buy stocks on price weakness. Give me an example, please.
"
2422,GILD,"Sullivan: Buying on weakness was an old Peter Lynch rule.
"
2423,GILD,"I bought Southwest Airlines (LUV) two, 2-1/2 years ago, when it was (trading around 8 or 9).
"
2424,GILD,"The rest of the airlines were doing well. They charge for everything. But Southwest didn't, so it got depressed. It was selling below the replacement costs of all their airplanes. I figured it had to climb. And they could always start charging (for individual services like baggage). I loaded up as much as I could. It's gone to around 34.
"
2425,GILD,"IBD: You've added to your Apple (AAPL) stake. Why?
"
2426,GILD,"Sullivan: I started buying Apple again in the June quarter. It had pulled back from its highs. I took it to my biggest position.
"
2427,GILD,"A year and a half or two years ago, both Apple and Google (GOOGL) went to 700. Then they separated. Apple pulled back. Google shot up. When everyone fell in love with Google, I used it as a source of funds. Apple had hair on it because it hadn't come out with anything new. Now it's coming through again. But it's not expensive on earnings. It's a quasi-value name with meaningful growth.
"
2428,GILD,"IBD: Celgene (CELG) is trending up again. Did investors decide this biotech was oversold?
"
2429,GILD,"Sullivan: This was one of several large biotechs that I started positioning in more than three years ago. They looked like value names with growth. Now their pipelines are still meaningful. They've got good top- and bottom-line growth. Big pharmaceutical firms don't have that. And on a P-E-to-growth basis, it's still attractive. It's been stronger since the (Q1) sell-off than some biotechs like Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead (GILD). I added to Celgene during the weakness (earlier in) the year.
"
2430,GILD,"IBD: Facebook (FB) has had a nice run-up since mid-2013. Is it still attractive?
"
2431,GILD,"Sullivan: I'm underweight now. (My weighting is) less than 50 basis points. It's had a good move. It's the place where the eyeballs are. They were slow to get their mobile application to work. But they've done that. It's still a growth story. But it's trading at 40 times next year's (estimated) earnings, so at this point I'm neutral. I don't want to (make my position) bigger unless the stock pulls back.
"
2432,GILD,"IBD: What's your thesis for CBRE Group (CBG)?
"
2433,GILD,"Sullivan: They're a play on a commercial real estate rebound. They're not expensive.
"
2434,GILD,"They're big brokers, maybe the biggest. They manage big office buildings. It's been a dead area, but it's coming back. Nonresidential construction is coming back, and occupancy rates are getting better. We've got them earning $1.70 (per share) this year and $1.80 next year. They're not a fancy name. They're a bit of a sleeper.
"
2435,GILD,"IBD: Gilead's earnings per share growth has exploded. Is Sovaldi, its hepatitis C treatment, the entire story?
"
2436,GILD,"Sullivan: The real attraction is more than that. They've got drugs for liver and heart disease. And a good platform for AIDS. But the real nice thing is that this stock is inexpensive on earnings. They're expected to earn $8 a share this year and $9.50 next year.
"
2437,GILD,"That's very attractive: 11-1/2 times next year's earnings on a company growing in the teens. And we're fans of their whole pipeline.
"
2438,GILD,"IBD: Is Spirit Airlines' (SAVE) driver its no-frills approach?
"
2439,GILD,"Sullivan: Yes, their no-frills approach is their key.
"
2440,GILD,"The interesting thing is that they're not targeted as competition by larger airlines, which is important. It avoids a price war.
"
2441,GILD,"The larger airlines see them as an ultralow-cost carrier. When they go into a new market, they actually expand the market. Big competitors see that. They get people to fly who don't normally: college students, people on tight budgets, people who don't mind flying at midnight, people who don't mind being charged for extra bags or maybe overhead compartments.
"
2442,GILD,"When will the airlines go after each other to get market share? They're not doing it now. The old managements (that engaged in price wars) have disappeared. Airline bankruptcies are fresh in (airlines managers') heads.
"
2443,GILD,"IBD: Where is railcar-maker Trinity Industries (TRN) in its economic cycle?
"
2444,GILD,"Sullivan: Its cycle still continues to work. We're only halfway through.
"
2445,GILD,"They make all kinds of railroad cars. One of the most interesting on margin is cars that carry sand for fracking. The typical well takes 75 to 80 rail cars of this stuff.
"
2446,GILD,"Trinity is one of the few players in this business. The stock is not expensive.The $1.8 billion Putnam Investors Fund is an old geezer.

2465,GILD,"Stocks looked poised to end the week on a positive note Friday.
"
2466,GILD,"The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.6%; the S&P 500 rose 0.5% and the Nasdaq picked up 0.4%. NYSE was tracking lower than Thursday's level. Nasdaq volume was tracking close to Thursday's gauge.
"
2467,GILD,"Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 still have their 50-day moving averages to conquer. The Nasdaq is about 6 points below the line. Same with the S&P 500.
"
2468,GILD,"In the stock market today, Procter & Gamble (PG) was the standout performer in the Dow, rising 3%. Earnings of $1.07 a share met expectations, but sales of $20.79 billion slightly missed. The company also said it would prefer to split off its Duracell battery business into a separate company but hasn't reached a decision yet.
"
2469,GILD,"Constant Contact (CTCT) gapped up and rose 8% after the online marketing company reported earnings late Thursday. It's been consolidating gains for 13 weeks and is now 7% off its 52-week high. Growth prospects are solid with 2014 profit seen rising 36% from 2013. In 2015, earnings are expected to rise 24%.
"
2470,GILD,"Edwards Lifesciences (EW) gapped up to an all-time high, rising 11%. Strong earnings late Thursday were the catalyst. Third-quarter profit rose 14% to 80 cents a share, nicely above the consensus estimate. Sales rose 23% from a year ago to $607.4 million, nice acceleration from 11% growth in the second quarter. Strong sales of its heart valves fueled the results and also prompted the company to raise its prior full-year earnings and sales guidance.
"
2471,GILD,"Drugmakers in the IBD 50 outperformed Friday. Gilead Sciences (GILD), Salix (SLXP), Jazz (JAZZ), Alexion (ALXN) and Celgene (CELG) all scored gains of 2% to 4%.

2665,GILD,"Stocks continued to add to broad gains in late trading Friday and were on pace to end modestly higher on the week.The Nasdaq stretched its gain to 1.5%. It has erased all of Thursday's loss and then some. Meanwhile, the S&P 50 rallied 1%, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.7%.Turnover was again running mixed in the stock market today . NYSE trade was tracking sharply higher, while Nasdaq volume was running about 10% lower compared to the same time Thursday.AerCap Holdings (AER) reversed an early loss and rallied 4% in fast trade. The stock is getting close to resistance at its 50-day line as it works on a potential flat base. AerCap last broke out from a double-bottom base in early May. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see profit rising 27% to 75 cents a share. That would mark a second straight quarter of acceleration.Gilead Sciences (GILD) stepped up its gain to more than 4% and was on pace to end a three-day pullback. The stock is now 6% past an 83.80 buy point from a first-stage, cup-with-handle base.The biotech will report second-quarter earnings Wednesday. Profit is expected at $1.73 a share, up 246% from a year ago. That would mark a second straight quarter of triple-digit growth. Gilead's Sovaldi hepatitis treatment is expected to drive growth.AutoNation (AN) rallied 3% but also met resistance at its 50-day line. Shares of the auto dealer tumbled 8% and sliced the line Thursday on a disappointing earnings report.Seagate Technology (STX) shaved early losses, but was still off by 1%.

"
2666,GILD,"Leading stocks took their licks in the past week, with only a small clique of IBD 50 stocks posting weekly gains.Among those, China-based TAL Education (XRS) hauled in an 11% gain to end the week at a new high.That left the chain of tutoring centers for kindergarten through 12th grade well extended after its first test of 10-week support since a breakout from an undefined, late-stage base in June.Another China issue, online automotive-data provider BitAuto (BITA), shaved a 6% loss to a slightly positive finish for the week. It marked BitAuto's eighth straight weekly advance. The stock is 21% above a 47.02 buy point in a late-stage base.China stocks were not immune to the selling, though.The diversifying Internet play Qihoo 360 (QIHU) took a 9% hit, ending the week at the bottom of its trading range. That left it flush with its converged 10- and 40-week moving averages, throwing another challenge in front of its late-stage, base-building effort. Qihoo and other stocks fell off the IBD 50 list amid the broad market weakness.From an industry standpoint, the most resilient stocks were drugmakers and other medical stocks.At the head of that list, Team Health Holdings (TMH) rattled off a 5% gain for the week. The outsourced health care staffing firm ended the week in the middle of its trading range and 7% above a 52.28 buy point from a second-stage, base-on-base pattern.Salix Pharmaceuticals (SLXP) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) each rose 2%, the largest gain among the biomed plays. Salix is consolidating just below a July 2 high and 19% above a 113.13 buy point in a late-stage base.Gilead's gain extended its advance to seven weeks, putting it 8% above an 83.80 buy point after clearing a first-stage base early in July.Drug distributor AmerisourceBergen (ABC) ticked up a fraction, holding on to its 4% gain from the prior week's breakout above a flat-base buy point of 73.91. As a side note, AmerisourceBergen's revenue, at $87.9 billion, is by far the largest on the IBD 50 list.Medical plays also figured into the week's hardest-hit leaders. Spain-based Grifols (GRFS) crumbled 14% after the blood-plasma distributor reported second-quarter results Thursday.Grifols' drop dragged its shares out of a second-stage-base-building effort and below key levels of support.Other hard-hit plays on the list included Emerge Energy (EMES).
"
2667,GILD,"Big-cap biotech leaders Biogen Idec (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) easily beat second-quarter earnings estimates and received product approvals Wednesday, but their stocks reacted very differently.
"
2668,GILD,"Biogenearnings rose 52% vs. a year earlier to $3.49 a share, topping analysts' consensus by 66 cents. Sales grew 40% to $2.4 billion vs. the Street's $2.16 billion.
"
2669,GILD,"The company increased its full-year revenue range for 38%-41% growth from 26%-28% and analysts' average of 28.5%. It now sees EPS of $12.90-$13.10, more than $1.50 above its prior guidance. Analysts expected $11.53.
"
2670,GILD,"The upside came largely from Tecfidera, the oral multiple-sclerosis drug approved in the U.S. last year and in Europe in early February. Management and analysts expected a slow European launch because Novartis (NVS) entered the market first with its MS pill Gilenya. However, executives said the uptake in the European countries where it has gained reimbursement (mainly Germany) is proceeding at a similar pace to the U.S.
"
2671,GILD,"Sales of Tecfidera outside the U.S. were $115 million vs. consensus of $75 million. Domestic sales rose to $585 million, topping estimates by $100 million.
"
2672,GILD,"Biogen in Q2 reached a deal with Italy that eliminated that country's reimbursement limit on older MS drug Tysabri, retroactive to February 2013.
"
2673,GILD,"The recognition of this revenue added 15 cents to Q2 EPS.
"
2674,GILD,"CEO George Scangos disclosed that the EU had approved Biogen's interferon-based MS drug Plegridy, which is still awaiting approval in America. The launch of this drug, along with hemophilia drugs Alprolix and Eloctate, led Biogen to guide sales, general and administrative expenses above expectations at 22%-23% of revenue .
"
2675,GILD,"Biogen slightly disappointed the Street by saying phase two trial results for anti-LINGO, which could be the first disease-altering treatment for MS, will be reported in 2016, not next year as hoped. The company wants to wait for 18-month results rather than 12-month. Still, Biogen stock rose 11% to 337.60.

"
2680,GILD,"Gilead for the first time gave full-year guidance that included Sovaldi sales: $21 billion to $23 billion vs. $6.9 billion last year. Subtracting its prior guidance, that implies Sovaldi will rake in $11.5 billion in 2014.

"
2683,GILD,"Perhaps for that reason, Gilead stock fell fractionally late, largely erasing a 1% regular-session gain.

"
2685,GILD,"In its budding field of cancer medicine, Gilead also said the FDA approved its drug idelalisib, now branded Zydelig, for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma.

Sales grew 40% to $2.4 billion vs. the Street's $2.16 billion.The company increased its full-year revenue range for 38%-41% growth from 26%-28% and analysts' average of 28.5%. It now sees EPS of $12.90-$13.10, more than $1.50 above its prior guidance. Analysts expected $11.53.The upside came largely from Tecfidera, the oral multiple-sclerosis drug approved in the U.S. last year and in Europe in early February. Management and analysts expected a slow European launch because Novartis (NVS) entered the market first with its MS pill Gilenya. However, executives said the uptake in the European countries where it has gained reimbursement (mainly Germany) is proceeding at a similar pace to the U.S.Sales of Tecfidera outside the U.S. were $115 million vs. consensus of $75 million. Domestic sales rose to $585 million, topping estimates by $100 million.Biogen in Q2 reached a deal with Italy that eliminated that country's reimbursement limit on older MS drug Tysabri, retroactive to February 2013.The recognition of this revenue added 15 cents to Q2 EPS.CEO George Scangos disclosed that the EU had approved Biogen's interferon-based MS drug Plegridy, which is still awaiting approval in America. The launch of this drug, along with hemophilia drugs Alprolix and Eloctate, led Biogen to guide sales, general and administrative expenses above expectations at 22%-23% of revenue .Biogen slightly disappointed the Street by saying phase two trial results for anti-LINGO, which could be the first disease-altering treatment for MS, will be reported in 2016, not next year as hoped. The company wants to wait for 18-month results rather than 12-month. Still, Biogen stock rose 11% to 337.60.Sovaldi BoomsGilead earnings, released after the close, vaulted 372% to $2.36 a share, beating by 58 cents. Sales leapt 136% to $6.53 billion, topping views by $67 million.Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, just launched in December, generated $3.48 billion in sales, well above consensus of $2.58 billion.Despite political and industry protests over the $1,000-a-day pill, Gilead said 47 state Medicaid programs cover Sovaldi.Gilead for the first time gave full-year guidance that included Sovaldi sales: $21 billion to $23 billion vs. $6.9 billion last year. Subtracting its prior guidance, that implies Sovaldi will rake in $11.5 billion in 2014.But Gilead's whisper numbers seemed to be much higher.""GILD reported a 2Q that soundly beat SELL side consensus, but was roughly in line with what I perceive to be buy side expectations,"" wrote ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email to clients. He added that the new revenue guidance agrees with analysts' estimates.Perhaps for that reason, Gilead stock fell fractionally late, largely erasing a 1% regular-session gain.Gilead's other major drugs — HIV medicines Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Complera and Stribild — modestly topped consensus, except for Atripla.In its budding field of cancer medicine, Gilead also said the FDA approved its drug idelalisib, now branded Zydelig, for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma. Analysts expect this to be a blockbuster of more modest proportions than Sovaldi, with sales peaking at $1.5 billion in 2020.Two other major biotechs report on Thursday: Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Celgene (CELG).
"
2687,GILD,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals sailed through one of the most crucial tests in its 25-year existence when its cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment hit goals in a late-stage study. Upon disclosure Tuesday, Vertex stock soared to a 14-year high, closing up 40.4% to 93.53.
"
2688,GILD,"Vertex (VRTX) pooled results from two phase three clinical trials looking at patients with a homozygous pair of genes with the F508del genetic mutation, the most common cause of cystic fibrosis. Patients taking a combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor for 24 weeks showed a statistically significant improvement in lung function as well as a significant reduction in the rates of pulmonary exacerbations and improvements in body mass.
"
2689,GILD,"""These pivotal results validate our strategy of using a combination of a corrector, lumacaftor, and a potentiator, ivacaftor, to treat the underlying cause of CF,"" Vertex CEO Jeffrey Leiden told analysts Tuesday.
"
2690,GILD,"The company plans to file for approval in both the U.S. and Europe in Q4. Analysts say it will probably launch in mid-2015.
"
2691,GILD,"Wall Street Hesitated
"
2692,GILD,"The size of the stock move reflects how uncertain Wall Street was that the treatment would work, as well as how significant the news is for Vertex. In 2011, Vertex enjoyed what was, at the time, the biggest drug launch in history with its hepatitis C treatment Incivek. But a year later, sales fell sharply as competition came online, especially Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Sovaldi, which has already surpassed Incivek's launch record since it was approved in December.
"
2693,GILD,"In 2012 ivacaftor, one of the two drugs in the latest study, was approved for sale as Kalydeco. But it was approved only for patients with the G551D mutation. They represent only 4% of CF sufferers in the U.S., according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.
"
2694,GILD,"Thanks partly to controversially aggressive pricing — around $300,000 a year — Vertex still has been able to pull hundreds of millions in annual revenue off a patient base of just a few thousand. But being able to treat the 50,000 or so patients with the F508del mutation, whether homozygous or heterozygous, would turn ivacaftor into a blockbuster.
"
2695,GILD,"Nonetheless, prior trial results didn't inspire full confidence. Just last week, Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges warned of a high risk of failure, based on talks with scientists at a CF conference.
"
2696,GILD,"On Tuesday, ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote that while the results were ""not a home run"" due to the modest rate of lung-function improvement (the mean improvement was 2.6% to 4%), the lack of better alternatives means that peak annual sales could hit $3 billion.
"
2697,GILD,"A $4.5 Billion Franchise?
"
2698,GILD,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee pointed out that Vertex is also testing a third drug, VX-661, and has a whole library of other correctors that could work in a wider range of genetic types. He estimates peak annual sales of $4.5 billion for the whole CF franchise.
"
2699,GILD,"""The big picture that investors should remember is this is a major improvement for sick CF patients (typically kids), and all our doc feedback is that, if the drug is FDA approved, the patients will get access to it,"" he wrote.
"
2700,GILD,"Yee raised his price target to 120 from 95, maintaining an outperform rating.
"
2701,GILD,"One question still up in the air is how the combo will price. Vertex could get away with pricing Kalydeco so high because its patient pool was so tiny and because its efficacy was so good, but analysts generally expect the combo to price much lower. Yee estimates $225,000 but writes that the Street is mostly thinking of $150,000 to $175,000.
"
2702,GILD,"Either way, Vertex will likely have the only disease-altering CF treatments on the market for quite a while, says Morningstar analyst Stefan Quenneville. ""We also believe that these results may have longer-term moat implications for the company by positioning it as the dominant player in cystic fibrosis,"" he wrote in a research note Tuesday.Vertex Pharmaceuticals sailed through one of the most crucial tests in its 25-year existence when its cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment hit goals in a late-stage study.

However, on the conference call to discuss results, executives said the uptake in the European countries where it has gained reimbursement (mainly Germany at this point) is proceeding at a similar pace to the U.S.Total sales of Tecfidera outside the U.S. in the quarter were $115 million vs. consensus of $75 million. Domestic sales also outperformed, with a take of $585 million topping estimates by $100 million.Q2 also benefited from a one-time event. During the quarter, Biogen came to an agreement with the Italian National Medicines Agency that eliminated that country's reimbursement limit on Tysabri, an older MS drug, retroactive to February 2013. The recognition of this revenue added 15 cents to Q2 EPS.Amid all the good news, two items disappointed analysts. One was that sales, general and administrative spending was guided higher than expected, at 22%-23% of revenue. On the call, CFO Paul Clancy said this was necessary because of the unprecedented amount of drug launching underway. Not only is Tecfidera still rolling out, but also in Q2 Biogen launched its long-acting hemophilia drug Alprolix (which also beat expectations, with $10 million in sales vs. analysts' $4 million estimate) and just last week launched its hemophilia A counterpart Eloctate. The company is also preparing to launch a new interferon-based MS drug, Plegridy. On the call, Biogen CEO George Scangos said he'd just gotten word that Plegridy has been approved in the EU.The other disappointment was a delay in reporting results from a key clinical trial. For months, the Street has been buzzing about a Biogen pipeline product called anti-LINGO, which could be the first disease-altering treatment for MS. Analysts had expected 12-month results from a phase two trial to be out next year, but management said it will wait until 2016 to report 18-month results.Nonetheless, ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum was generally impressed, pointing out that this was the largest beat that Biogen had reported in 10 years.""Overall a really good call with no new disclosures that diluted the quality of the EPS/sales beat on the quarter,"" he wrote in an email to clients after the conference call.Biogen kicks off earnings for several top-rated biotechs. After Tuesday's market close, Gilead Sciences (GILD) is expected to report a 258% earnings per share on sales of its blockbuster Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Celgene (CELG) are on tap for Thursday.In other biotech news, Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) shot up 287% to 228.10 after the company reported surprisingly strong Phase 3 trial results for its breast cancer drug.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.RELATED:Biogen Shares Rebound As Street Has A Change Of Heart.

2801,GILD,"Analysts were singing the praises of life-science giants Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Illumina (ILMN) Wednesday morning after both surged above Q1 estimates late Tuesday. Shares of both companies were up on the stock market today.
"
2802,GILD,"Gilead's $2.3 billion in sales for its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi was called ""one of the most impressive beats in biopharma history"" by Piper Jaffray's Joshua Schimmer, although he increased his price target by only a dollar to 105. Gilead was up 3% in morning trading Wednesday, near 75.
"
2803,GILD,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee lifted his 2014 sales estimate to $9.5 billion from his previous $7.4 billion, and added $1.05 to his full-year EPS estimate, now $6.15. He expects Sovaldi sales to hit $11.5 billion next year, with EPS reaching $7.
"
2804,GILD,"Nomura's Ian Somaiya lifted his price target to 130 from 121. He wrote that Gilead's position in the HCV market is sustainable, and he says Sovaldi and the new Sovaldi-based combo pill expected to launch later this year are superior to competing products from AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK).
"
2805,GILD,"Cowen's Phil Nadeau was also impressed, but noted that lengthy discussion of ""payor pushback"" on Tuesday's earnings call provided ""probably not nearly enough resolution to satisfy investors."" Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) and insurer United Health (UNH) have both criticized Sovaldi's $84,000 price.
"
2806,GILD,"""Gilead did discuss pharmacoeconomic arguments that support the price of Sovaldi, such as the value of a cure to the health care system, and the cost of treating patients with end stage liver disease ($42k/yr),"" Nadeau wrote. ""While we found Gilead's discussion and datapoints encouraging, we suspect that investor concerns over payors' ability to limit access to Sovaldi and shuttle patients to competing regimens will linger until ABBV's pricing strategy is known (presumably after approval) and payor strategies are defined in early 2015.""
"
2807,GILD,"Meanwhile, gene-testing company Illumina was up 6% Wednesday morning, near 156, after it beat estimates and raised guidance. Sales rose 27% over the year-earlier quarter to $421 million, nearly $30 million above consensus. Earnings climbed 15% to 53 cents a share, topping estimates by 9 cents.
"
2808,GILD,"The company now expects full-year sales growth of 21% to 23%, with EPS of $2.10 to $2.15. Both ranges are above consensus.
"
2809,GILD,"Leerink analyst Dan Leonard wrote in a note Tuesday that the report ""exceeded even what we would have considered a best-case scenario in the face of multiple new instrument launches,"" and lifted his price target to 180 from 160. He wrote that the launches of the new HiSeq and MiSeq gene-sequencing systems did not appear to be cannibalizing from older versions. He added that orders for the HiSeq X Ten system, which Illumina announced in January with some fanfare due to its claim that it can sequence genomes for $1,000 apiece, were double the initial target.
"
2810,GILD,"ISI Group's Ross Muken noted that demand was up across Illumina's entire sequencing portfolio, and raised his price target to 162.50 from 152.50 to reflect increased EPS forecasts. However, he maintained his neutral rating on the stock, saying that the current price already reflects 20% annual revenue growth.

2833,GILD,"Big pharma Merck (MRK) reported stellar results for its phase-two hepatitis C (HCV) drug trials Thursday, sparking debate among analysts over its potential to take market share from leader Gilead Sciences.
"
2834,GILD,"At the International Liver Congress in London, Merck reported a 98% cure rate in patients with hepatitis C genotype 1 who took a combination of its drug candidates MK-5172 and MK-8742.
"
2835,GILD,"With the two potentially combined in one pill taken once per day, the pairing could rival the convenience and effectiveness of Gilead's (GILD) combo of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir, which is currently awaiting an FDA approval expected by October.
"
2836,GILD,"Gilead launched sofosbuvir alone, as Sovaldi, in December. Though it is still recommended to be combined with interferon for genotype 1, which accounts for 70% of all HCV infections, it is already enjoying the biggest launch in drug history.

2838,GILD,"Facing The Competiton
"
2839,GILD,"ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients that consensus peak-sales estimates for Merck's regimen will almost certainly go up from the current $400 million. Nonetheless, he wrote, the rise should present no real danger to Gilead.
"
2840,GILD,"""Most analysts (me included) have assumed GILD will capture perhaps 60%-75% genotype 1 share at peak,"" he wrote. ""The open question, however, has been which company grabs the other 25%-40% of the market. I would propose to you that perhaps MRK is now the leading contender for this position.""
"
2841,GILD,"Because Merck still has a way to go through clinical trials before it can file for approval, it won't have the first competing regimen. That's expected to be AbbVie's (ABBV) and Enanta's (ENTA) cocktail, also expected to launch late in the year.
"
2842,GILD,"However, in a research note Thursday, Nomura analyst Ian Somaiya wrote that a symposium with hepatologist Stefan Zeuzam brought up Gilead's higher efficacy than AbbVie's with certain patients, as well as the risk of drug interactions with patients who also have HIV.
"
2843,GILD,"Zeuzam also raised the issue of higher alanine aminotransferase levels in a small percentage of patients in Merck's regimen, which ""point to acute liver injury that could motivate many physicians to avoid the regimen."" Somaiya raised his estimate on Gilead's total HCV franchise to $5.8 billion this year and $9 billion next year.

2867,GILD,"Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) hepatitis C drug daclatasvir, now branded Daklinza, was endorsed by the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for use in combination with other hep C drugs, notably Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Sovaldi.
"
2868,GILD,"Sovaldi and daclatasvir performed outstandingly when combined in a clinical trial, but Gilead decided to substitute a similar drug of its own making, ledipasvir, in a combo that's expected to be approved in the U.S. later this year. Nonetheless, a Bristol executive told IBD in March that he still sees a role for the drug in the marketplace, especially the tough-to-treat cases.

2875,GILD,"Biotech Achillion Pharmaceuticals (ACHN) got another boost Monday when Maxim Group more than tripled its price target on the stock, sending shares up 21% on the stock market today.After having dinner with company executives, analyst Jason Kolbert hiked his target to 22 from 6, while maintaining his buy rating. He cited the potential of all three of Achillion's hepatitis C drug candidates, with the ultimate goal of creating a regimen that will cure all genotypes of the virus in four weeks. The current industry leader, Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Sovaldi, is normally given for 12 weeks.Kolbert added that ""acquisition potential for Achillion remains high."" That potential has more than doubled the stock price in the last week, after Merck's (MRK) deal to buy Idenix (IDIX) for its hepatitis C pipeline sparked speculation that Achillion would also make an appealing target. The stock was also helped last week when the FDA lifted a clinical hold on sovaprevir, which is Achillion's most advanced hepatitis C candidate in phase-two testing.Achillion stock rose 21% to close at 7.82 after trading as high as 8.05 intraday.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves

W. Baird's Brian Skorney noted that Merck's (MRK) official tender offer statement Friday indicated that there was another bidder for Idenix Pharmaceuticals (IDIX), which accepted Merck's $3.85 billion bid last week. In Skorney's view, this means that somebody's still on the prowl for a nucleoside hepatitis C drug, which Achillion has.""The company draws many similarities to Idenix from an asset perspective and has the only unpartnered nuc left in development, which makes it an attractive target,"" he wrote in his research note Friday.Skorney also wrote that Achillion's prospects of developing an oral hep C cure all by itself are dimming, since its pipeline has been slowed down by various issues even as Gilead Sciences (GILD) and AbbVie (ABBV) steam ahead with their own regimens. He maintains an outperform rating and set his price target at 12, reflecting a more modest expectation than Maxim's target of 22 set earlier this week.

"
2895,GILD,"As managed-care organization Centene readied its first-quarter report in April, investors were getting very nervous.
"
2896,GILD,"This year brought the first quarter when the managed-care industry faced a new health-insurer fee imposed under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The fee will continue to rise through 2018.
"
2897,GILD,"It was also the first full quarter of sales for Gilead Sciences' (GILD) mega-blockbuster hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. While Sovaldi has far greater efficacy and lower toxicity than the traditional regimen of interferon, the $84,000 price tag for a full round of treatment — combined with the sheer volume of infected patients — led some insurers to grumble that it would break the bank.
"
2898,GILD,"Centene's (CNC) largest competitor, UnitedHealth (UNH), seemed to confirm some of those fears when it reported its Q1 a week before Centene. Its results missed estimates, and one reason it gave was the $100 million in hepatitis C payouts.
"
2899,GILD,"Centene seemed especially vulnerable to a similar impact, given the nature of its user base. Centene's specialty is the Medicaid managed-care business, which it conducts under state contracts. It also has a growing presence in ""correctional health care"" — that is, prisons. Thus its customers are largely poor and/or imprisoned,making them more likely to have hepatitis C.
"
2900,GILD,"Consensus Crushed
"
2901,GILD,"So it came as an enormous relief to Wall Street when Centene came out and crushed the consensus Q1 numbers and raised its full-year outlook. Profit jumped 36% over the year-earlier quarter to 57 cents a share, beating estimates by 14 cents, while revenue rose 37% to $3.46 billion, more than $200 million above the Street's consensus.
"
2902,GILD,"Centene's chief strategy was to be well prepared, especially on the Sovaldi front, says Leerink analyst Ana Gupte.
"
2903,GILD,"""They have been on watch far more than the commercial payers,"" Gupte told IBD. ""They've been trying to make sure they get some public-policy attention (so) they get some support from the broader health-care community with state Medicaid negotiation, so they get the reimbursement that they're seeking.""
"
2904,GILD,"If the state does not put Sovaldi on its preferred formulary — such as in Texas, where Centene does a large amount of business — then Centene just won't pay out. This result has made Sovaldi even more controversial, as some regard it as inhumane to deny people such a superior drug. Centene CEO Michael Neidorff said on the Q1 conference call that the company has to follow state policy, but remarked, ""It is important to note these new therapies are curative; thus it is possible that longer-term savings will be realized from reducing other medical costs associated with hepatitis C.""
"
2905,GILD,"At the same time, Centene has also been playing the other side of the market through the other segment of its business, specialty services. In April last year it acquired AcariaHealth, one of the largest independent specialty pharmacies in the U.S., which also happens to be one of the largest managers of hepatitis C care. That business actually makes more money from the purchase of expensive drugs.
"
2906,GILD,"In his April 16 initiation report on Centene, UBS analyst A.J. Rice cited the specialty business as a key differentiator from Centene's peers.
"
2907,GILD,"""The specialty services complement CNC's core Medicaid Managed Care business, diversify the company's revenue stream, provide higher-quality health outcomes to CNC's membership and others, and assist in controlling costs,"" Rice wrote. ""We believe the company's ability to cross-sell specialty products, including behavioral health, disease management, and pharmacy, has helped CNC to reprocure existing or win new business in the recent years.""
"
2908,GILD,"Centene's rate of new business wins — it has captured 89% of the contracts it has bid on — has especially caught Wall Street's attention and driven its growth. When the company went public in 2001, it was operating in just three states. Today, it is in 20, and is the largest pure-play Medicaid MCO in the country.
"
2909,GILD,"Analysts are expecting more growth as Medicaid coverage expands due to the ACA rollout. Rice said that new eligibility rules that went into effect at the start of this year could bring 80,000 new members to Centene, coming to about $240 million in revenue. The company is also expanding its membership rolls through buyouts, most recently when it acquired Community Health Solutions' contract with Louisiana, bringing 200,000 lives aboard.
"
2910,GILD,"ObamaCare Exchanges
"
2911,GILD,"Centene has also jumped into the ACA's new health insurance exchanges in nine states through its Ambetter brand. Neidorff said in April that its financial impact on 2014 would be minimal, but he said that by the end of the current quarter enrollment should reach about 70,000.
"
2912,GILD,"""In the long run, we view this initiative positively,"" FBR analyst Steven Halper wrote in a May 19 note, but he added, ""Initial enrollment figures have been lackluster, and the company has indicated that it will reach the low end of its previous membership expectations from this segment.""
"
2913,GILD,"Some analysts' investment theses on Centene include the possibility that it will be bought. In early June, in fact, there were rumors that non-profit hospital chain Ascension Health was looking to buy a health insurer active in 18 states, leading Gupte to speculate that Centene or WellCare Health Plans (WCG) was the target. That drove the stock to a new high until Citigroup debunked the rumor, but Centene may still be an attractive candidate in a consolidating industry.
"
2914,GILD,"""Ascension was a long shot, particularly with Centene,"" Gupte said. ""But it's hardly the only company that's interested.""

2926,GILD,"Nowadays, Amgen is a gray eminence among biotechs. With more than $18 billion in sales last year, it's the kingpin in an industry that's turned into one of America's biggest innovation machines, and one of the highest-returning stock groups of the last few years.
"
2927,GILD,"It's hard to believe now, but back in the 1980s biotech was still a largely unproven business model. And Amgen (AMGN), founded in 1980 and public in 1982, was one of the first to show what could be done.
"
2928,GILD,"""When I think of the forefathers of biotech, I think of Amgen and Genentech,"" said Les Funtleyder, author of ""Healthcare Investing: Profiting from the New World of Pharma, Biotech and Health Care Services."" ""(They were) able to go public early on and able to show a lot of success early on.""
"
2929,GILD,"Industry watchers give much of the credit to Amgen's first chief executive, George Rathmann. Rathmann worked as a research chemist at old-school giants 3M (MMM) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) before being recruited by venture capitalists for their new biotech startup.
"
2930,GILD,"Rathmann died in 2012, but in 1992 he spoke with IBD for a Leaders & Success profile. He emphasized the importance of investing in good science as the key to business success.
"
2931,GILD,"""The person who leads a good scientific team has to have tremendous respect for science. He has to be able to differentiate good science from bad. And then from there on, it's mostly a support function,"" Rathmann said at the time. ""Get the guy the money, get him the facilities, and get him the resources to make it possible to sustain the effort all the way to the marketplace.""
"
2932,GILD,"Rathmann was particularly interested in genetic engineering, which was then cutting-edge science. Pharmaceutical technology, then the dominant platform for drug development, is based on chemistry. But biotechnology is based on manipulating biological processes. Rathmann eventually zeroed in on the goal of cloning the erythropoietin gene, which stimulates production of red blood cells. He saw the potentially huge market in treating severe anemia brought on by kidney failure or chemotherapy.
"
2933,GILD,"The eventual result was Epogen, which launched in 1988 and became one of biotech's first blockbusters. Not surprisingly, it also launched a big stock run-up. From July 1988 to January 1992, the stock — which was already up sharply from its levels several years earlier — increased more than 17-fold.
"
2934,GILD,"Amgen shares have staged other big runs since then. Last month they hit an all-time high of 128.96 — up 165,233% from their 1984 low. That gain puts Amgen near the top of the greatest stocks of the past 30 years.
"
2935,GILD,"Amgen wasn't the only company interested in erythropoietin in its early days — in fact, there was something of a race to get a viable product out first. Rathmann was so conscious of the time pressure that he reportedly threatened to shut down the research of the eventually successful scientist unless he isolated the gene.
"
2936,GILD,"""He was resolute in his determination to be first to market with Epogen,"" said Michael King, a biotech analyst at JMP Securities. ""I was a salesperson at the time, and I used to call on him and try to convince him, when the stock was exploding to new highs, to sell some of the stock and diversify. His answer was constantly no — and he was right. He built a great fortune for himself and his family by maintaining his vision and his focus on what Amgen could be.""
"
2937,GILD,"Despite that commitment, in 1988 Rathmann decided to hand the reins over to his CFO, Gordon Binder, who shepherded Amgen through its greatest period of financial growth before leaving in 2000. Binder oversaw the launch of another blood-cell-stimulating blockbuster, Neupogen, in 1991, and rheumatoid-arthritis treatment Enbrel in 1998. Those three drugs together, along with a pegylated version of Neupogen launched in 2002, still provide more than two-thirds of revenue.
"
2938,GILD,"While all that was going on, biotechs started breaking out like measles all over the market. Funtleyder says Amgen not only helped prove the science of biotechnology but also the business model, whereby a company could lose money for nearly a decade, most of that time publicly traded, before bringing a product to market that eventually would earn investors a handsome return.
"
2939,GILD,"Amgen ""sent a clear message that you could be a pure biotechnology company and succeed,"" said King. ""In some ways, it also set expectations a bit too high. A lot of the early biotech companies picked the low-hanging fruit.""
"
2940,GILD,"Nonetheless, the era produced a number of winners that went on to become big caps such as Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Biogen Idec (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), or were acquired by big pharmas. Although getting in on the ground floor of a young biotech is still risky, King says that ""(the) model works much better now"" due to the long years of experience.
"
2941,GILD,"In a 2009 interview with IBD, former CEO Binder pointed out that innovations in research technology have also helped speed biotech innovation.
"
2942,GILD,"""In the early days of Amgen, if you wanted to make a piece of DNA with 100 base pairs, it was a major project. Now a robot can make thousands a year without a human being doing anything except setting it up and turning it on,"" Binder said. ""Over the years, we could make DNA faster, easier and cheaper. With that continuous improvement, our knowledge grew. It built on itself.""Nowadays, Amgen is a gray eminence among biotechs.

"
3066,GILD,"""I think we'll have Gilead representing 50% of the hep C market,"" he told IBD. ""AbbVie will take the lion's share of what's remaining.""Though still in the early days since its Dec. 6 approval, Gilead Sciences' hepatitis C drug Sovaldi may be enjoying one of the most massive drug launches of all time. Current consensus calls for sales of $4.6 billion this year — and the whisper numbers are running even higher.This doesn't surprise Wall Street, as Sovaldi provides a faster, safer and stronger alternative to a punishing yearlong regimen of interferon. But as analysts obsessively watch the weekly prescription numbers grow, they're also eyeing data from Sovaldi's potential challengers in a market that's estimated at $20 billion a year and growing.Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) daclatasvir grabbed headlines last April when a phase two trial combining it with Sovaldi scored a 100% cure rate.But Gilead (GILD) elected not to pursue the combo further. Instead, it's studying Sovaldi in combination with its similar drug ledipasvir, so that it can co-formulate the two into a single pill and not share the market.Bristol, however, filed in the European Union for approval of daclatasvir ""for use in combination with other agents, including sofosbuvir"" (the generic name for Sovaldi), and was granted accelerated review there in early January. The firm plans to submit a similar filing to the Food and Drug Administration soon.Sovaldi Sets New StandardIn October, Bristol filed to approve a combo of daclatasvir with another of its drugs, asunaprevir, in Japan, which has an unusually high rate of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection due to a formerly tainted blood supply.Douglas Manion, Bristol's vice president of development, virology and Japan, says that the dual regimen scored good results, but its 24-week duration is looking like yesterday's news now that Sovaldi has set a 12-week standard. He hopes that will be resolved by a triple therapy involving daclatasvir, asunaprevir and a drug dubbed BMS-791325, co-formulated into one pill to be taken twice a day, now in phase three testing.Ultimately, however, he does not expect a single regimen to conquer the others because not all patients are the same.Treating Toughest Patients""Daclatasvir has been studied with so many different drugs, it's used in all genotypes (of the hepatitis C virus) and all patient populations — especially the toughest-to-treat populations,"" Manion said. ""These are going to be liver-transplant patients, genotype 3 patients, patients with cirrhosis, and ultimately patients with decompensation.""Decompensated cirrhosis, the worst form of liver damage that can result from HCV, usually results in liver transplant or death.The decompensated group was one population not included in AbbVie's (ABBV) six phase three trials of its ""3D"" regimen combining three antiviral agents. AbbVie also stuck to the most common genotype, genotype 1. It did very well in the trials, with cure rates ranging from 90% to 100%. The company plans to file in the U.S. during the second quarter and hit the market late this year.In one respect it will have nearly caught up with Gilead, because current FDA guidelines on Sovaldi recommend that it be used with interferon in genotype 1, unless the patient can't tolerate interferon. Gilead is banking on its sofosbuvir-ledipasvir combo to be its first official interferon-free genotype 1 treatment — also expected to launch later this year after a Feb. 10 filing.Barry Bernstein, AbbVie's vice president of infectious disease development, touted 3D's strong safety profile and the fact that it cured upward of 92% of patients with compensated cirrhosis.""We believe that the regimens will provide an option for any genotype 1-infected patient,"" Bernstein told IBD.AbbVie, Bristol-Myers and Gilead are all expected to report final study details at the International Liver Congress, meeting in London April 9-13. Company officials are keeping mum on which studies will be presented, but abstracts will go online March 24. (Late-breaking abstracts, which appear right before the conference, often have the hottest data.)Next-Generation RegimesFurther down the road, even more drugs are on the way.AbbVie and partner Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA) are already working on a next-generation regime that will treat more genotypes and also be simpler to take. (A common criticism of the 3D is that it's more complicated than Gilead's promised pill-a-day routine.)Earlier this month, Merck (MRK) also reported very strong phase two results for its two-drug combo for genotype 1 patients, some of whom were co-infected with HIV.

3146,GILD,"One of the hottest research fields in biotech is for a disease most people have never heard of. But as data on potential treatments roll out this year, it's bound to become a lot more famous on Wall Street.Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, afflicts as much as 10% of U.S. adults, but most don't realize it. It's completely unrelated to viral hepatitis, but they share the name because of the shared symptom of inflamed liver. ""Steato"" means ""fat,"" and so steatohepatitis is what happens when fat accumulates around the liver.For reasons that aren't clear, over the years this can result in scar tissue building up on the liver, which can cause the organ to fail and even kill the patient. While this can be induced by alcoholism, the non-alcoholic variety is caused by a more common problem: obesity.If investors never heard of NASH before, it likely crossed their radar screens on Jan. 9, when Intercept Pharmaceuticals ' (ICPT) stock vaulted 281% in one day after its drug obeticholic acid (OCA) did so well in a phase two trial that it was stopped early. Other biotechs with NASH drugs in the pipeline — Raptor Pharmaceuticals (RPTP), Conatus Pharmaceuticals (CNAT) and Galectin Therapeutics (GALT) — also saw their stocks jump as investors pounced on good news after chronic disappointment.""NASH has been a hot area for years,"" said Liisa Bayko, biotech analyst with JMP Securities. ""However, nothing ever has worked. It's been one of those areas that investors salivate over, because it's such a big market.""As a result, NASH research has been left mostly to small, unpartnered biotechs. The only big cap in the field is Gilead Sciences (GILD), which acquired a monoclonal antibody called simtuzumab with its buyout of Arresto Biosciences in 2011, but there are little data on the NASH indication as yet. The small caps don't have the resources for large clinical trials, so both Intercept and Raptor have been leaning on the National Institutes of Health to conduct their R&D.They also have pursued ""safer"" indications for their drugs before NASH. One reason most everyone was so surprised by Intercept's NASH data, in fact, was that the market was more focused on OCA's lead indication of primary biliary cirrhosis.Raptor's drug Procybsi was first approved last year for an orphan disease called nephropathic cystinosis. It's also in late-stage testing for Huntington's disease. For the NASH indication, the company focused on adolescents, looking to carve out its market niche.""Fundamentally it addresses what I consider to be the most significant public health issue, which is obesity in kids,"" Raptor CEO Christopher Starr told IBD in a January interview. ""If not treated, a lot of these kids will suffer significant liver problems by the time they get into their adult years.""Raptor is expecting a readout from its phase two trial this year.Conatus also is pursuing other liver-related indications first, but just announced on March 3 that it's starting a phase-two trial of its drug emricasan with NASH patients. Conatus CEO Stephen Mento told IBD he's looking to other companies that are further down the road to define a clinical pathway, because previous attempts have been so aborted that it's not even clear exactly how the Food and Drug Administration is going to measure success.Mento says his philosophy is to focus on the sickest patients first, but as awareness rises the mission will likely creep toward prevention. He sees a possible analogy in the rise of the cholesterol drugs.""These patients don't think about the liver as part of their sickness,"" Mento said. ""It's not like a headache — you don't have a liverache.""The statins were originally developed for patients who have genetic predispositions for these astronomically high levels of cholesterol, where there was a perception that if they didn't (lower their cholesterol), they would have heart disease. Nobody would have developed statins initially (if they) thought about reducing cholesterol from 230 to 160 as the primary endpoint.""Doctors will be more likely to talk with at-risk patients about the disease once they have an actual treatment to offer, he says.Galectin is the only company making fatty liver disease its Plan A, but its drug GR-MD-02 is just in early testing. It's focusing on the most advanced cases with serious liver scarring. Data from its phase one trial, which will be the first results with human subjects, are expected by the end of the month.With little hard data and even less past experience to go on, predicting how the market is going to play out is difficult. The products being tested are also all quite different from each other, using different mechanisms to attack the disease, so there might be room for more than one of them in the potentially giant field.

3326,GILD,"""Ibrutinib is following other transformational drugs like (Celgene's (CELG) Revlimid and (Biogen Idec's (BIIB) Rituxan that achieved blockbuster sales with poorer efficacy, less durability of response, and poorer safety profiles compared to Ibrutinib,"" she said.
"
3327,GILD,"Karnauskas set her 2017 sales estimate at a blockbuster $2.5 billion, saying Wall Street's $1.3 billion estimate is too low. Consensus has been rising over the past six months, however, along with the stock.

3329,GILD,"It was near the stock's nadir, in September 2008, that Duggan took the helm of the company from co-founder Richard Miller.
"
3330,GILD,"Miller was highly respected in biotech for founding Idec (now merged into Biogen Idec), but Pharmacyclics' lead drug candidate, Xcytrin for brain cancer, was turned down by the FDA.
"
3331,GILD,"Duggan, who started investing in Pharmacyclics in 2004 after selling his own startup, Computer Motion, to Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), had by 2008 become board chairman. He told IBD in a recent interview that he favored turning away from Xcytrin and focusing on a class of drugs called Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which Pharmacyclics had acquired from struggling genomics firm Celera in 2006.
"
3332,GILD,"""I said I think it's entirely possible in this world and this time, on the strength of drugs we've in-licensed from Celera, to usher in a new era where medicines truly become allies for a) the patient and b) the clinician ... where you don't hurt them in the process of helping them,"" Duggan said.

"
3334,GILD,"This is especially important for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), where the median age at diagnosis is 72 years.
"
3335,GILD,"According to Karnauskas, current treatments (which include Rituxan) offer patients a trade-off between toxicity and effectiveness — and in old age, the body has a lot more trouble handling toxicity. She noted that in the phase-two study of the drug, only 12% of newly diagnosed patients and 6% of relapsed patients had to drop out due to ""adverse events,"" even though treatment went on for about two years.
"
3336,GILD,"All the good data were still in the future when Duggan took over Pharmacyclics. In fact, it was so hard to raise capital that in December 2008 and March 2009 he lent the company $6.4 million of his own money.

If all goes as Wall Street expects, it will be sweet vindication for CEO Robert Duggan and his turnaround plan.In August, the Food and Drug Administration accepted Pharmacyclics' application for ibrutinib to not only be approved but designated a ""breakthrough therapy."" The agency created that designation earlier this year as a way for drugs that represent a ""substantial improvement"" over existing therapies for serious conditions to get through the approval process faster than usual.No Deadline For ApprovalDespite this promise of speed, the FDA still hasn't set a deadline for deciding whether to approve ibrutinib.But analysts are generally expecting the decision to come in the first quarter, and they overwhelmingly expect the answer to be yes.""We believe the drug will transform the treatment of many blood cancers,"" analyst Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank wrote in a Sept. 26 report in which she initiated coverage of the stock.""Ibrutinib is following other transformational drugs like (Celgene's (CELG) Revlimid and (Biogen Idec's (BIIB) Rituxan that achieved blockbuster sales with poorer efficacy, less durability of response, and poorer safety profiles compared to Ibrutinib,"" she said.Karnauskas set her 2017 sales estimate at a blockbuster $2.5 billion, saying Wall Street's $1.3 billion estimate is too low.

3385,GILD,"A smart beta exchange traded fund, the Invesco Zacks Multi-Asset Income ETF (CVY  -  Free Report) debuted on 09/21/2006, and offers broad exposure to the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.Market cap weighted indexes work great for investors who believe in market efficiency. They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies.Non-cap weighted indexes try to choose stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, which is based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a mix of other such characteristics.While this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexCVY is managed by Invesco, and this fund has amassed over $287.33 M, which makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Zacks Multi-Asset Income Index.The Zacks Multi-Asset Income Index is comprised of approximately 125 to 150 stocks selected, based on a multi-factor proprietary model, from a universe of domestic and international companies, including U.S.-listed common stocks, ADRs paying dividends, REITs, MLPs, closed-end funds and traditional preferred stocks.Cost & Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.79% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.93%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.When you look at individual holdings, Darden Restaurants Inc (DRI  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.25% of the fund's total assets, followed by Citigroup Inc (C  -  Free Report) and Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 11.12% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskCVY has gained about 1.68% so far this year, and as of 07/10/2018, was up about 11.09% in the last one year. In the past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $20.64 and $23.39.The ETF has a beta of 0.86 and standard deviation of 12.67% for the trailing three-year period. With about 149 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

3386,GILD,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) was a star performer in Friday’s trading session, as the stock rallied as much as 23.1% but closed a little lower, rising 19.6% in the day’s trade. The massive gain for the biotech firm came from encouraging Phase 2 clinical study data for Alzheimer’s treatment.The final analysis at 18 months of the 856-patient Phase 2 clinical study of BAN2401 in early Alzheimer’s disease demonstrated statistically significant slowing in cognitive decline and reduction of amyloid beta accumulated in the brain, per the company press release. Amyloid beta or protein fragments are found in the brains of patients suffering from the disease and that some believe cause it.Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia and affects about 50 million people worldwide, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. Currently, there is no treatment for the disease or way to stop its progression. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved some medications to treat symptoms related to memory loss, language and other thought processes (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).As such, the result marks an important milestone in the companies' quest to tackle Alzheimer's disease. In fact, analysts welcomed the news as the first trial study for the drug was disappointing. This resulted in a risk-on environment, with many investors pulling in capital to this high growth and high beta sector.Other large-cap biotech stocks also gained with Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) up 3.3%, Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) up 2.5% and Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) up 1.9%. This suggests that investors are pinning their hopes on these fast growing companies, which could see smooth trading in the coming days.ETF ImpactThe smooth trading in the stock world also sent biotech ETFs space into green on the day. In particular, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB  -  Free Report) stole the show climbing 3.8% o, followed by more than 3% gains each for First Trust Amex Biotechnology Index (FBT  -  Free Report), Invesco Dynamic Biotechnology & Genome ETF (PBE  -  Free Report) and VanEck Vectors Biotech ETF (BBH  -  Free Report).IBBThis fund provides exposure to 192 firms by tracking the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, with Biogen taking the top spot at 9.1%. IBB is the most popular fund is the biotech space with AUM of $9.3 billion. Expense ratio comes in at 0.47%. IBB has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a High risk outlook (read: Why These Small Cap Biotech ETFs are Soaring).FBTThis fund follows the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index, which measures the performance of companies in the biotechnology industry that are primarily involved in the use of biological processes to develop products or provide services.

It has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a High risk outlook.What Lies Ahead?The uptrend in the sector is likely to continue this year on tax reform, rising M&A and positive regulatory backdrop (read: Top-Ranked Sector ETFs to Buy for Q3).The new tax legislation has enticed large pharmaceutical companies to bring offshore cash back home at reduced tax rates of 8-15.5% instead of the prior 35%. The repatriated money led to an increase in mergers and acquisitions activity, share buybacks and dividends. Additionally, the slower growth in mature drugs has also compelled prominent biotechs to acquire smaller ones, even at hefty premiums, with promising pipelines.Further, Trump’s most-awaited plan to lower drug prices has added to the strength. If these were not enough, the sector’s non-cyclical nature is an advantage in the current market, which is ruffled by trade war fears between China and United States as well as geopolitical tension.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

3387,GILD,"Several major biotech stocks rallied on Friday after Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) reported positive results from a Phase 2 study of its Ban2401 therapy, which seeks to reduce toxic amyloid proteins associated with cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease.Shares of Biogen were up more than 17% through afternoon trading hours Thursday. Japan’s Eisai Co. (ESALY  -  Free Report), a partner in the Ban2401 development, saw gains of nearly 20%. This momentum was enough to lift the rest of the biotech space, evidenced by the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index Fund (IBB  -  Free Report) adding about 3.2%.Biotech giants like Biogen, Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report), Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), and Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) have all underperformed the broader Nasdaq index over the past year, and the industry likely needed positive news to spark some optimistic trading.Speaking to The Street’s “Real Money” column, Atlantic Equities analyst Steve Chesney said that investors might finally be noticing the value of R&D efforts from these companies.“This is all about believing innovation and when a company like Biogen comes and reports positive clinical results for a disease like Alzehimer's the implied probability for success for the rest of the industry's pipeline moves a little bit higher,” Chesney told The Street.Celgene shares added about 2.3% to touch an intraday and one-month high of $82.34. Meanwhile, Amgen moved about 2% higher, and Gilead gained more than 3.3%.Biogen’s latest test included 856 patients with early Alzheimer’s disease. The company shared positive results from this group over a period of 18 months. Nevertheless, the trial is still only in Phase 2, and the challenges of Phase 3 and its additional regulatory hurdles are still looming.Still, Biogen will hope that it can commercialize Ban2401 in a timely manner. A new product would likely inspire positive analyst sentiment and lift growth prospects for the coming years.Within the past two months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Biogen’s 2018 earnings has dropped from $23.90 per share to $23.85 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 9.4%.Early estimates for 2019 have the company’s earnings pegged at $26.19 per share, which would represent a 9.8% increase from this year’s projected totals.BIIB is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its “Medical – Biomedical and Genetics” industry is sitting in the bottom 38% of the Zacks Industry Rank.Want more market analysis from this author?

3388,GILD,"It’s been a pretty low-key week for the biotech sector, with not too many major updates. Among the key news, Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) CAR-T therapy won CHMP positive opinion, while Keryx Biopharmaceuticals (KERX  -  Free Report) plunged on merger news.Recap of Important Stories:Gilead’s CAR-T Therapy Gets Positive CHMP Opinion: Gilead announced that European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (""CHMP"") has issued a positive opinion on the company’s Marketing Authorization Application (""MAA"") for CAR T therapy, axicabtagene ciloleucel, as a treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (""DLBCL"") and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (""PMBCL""), after two or more lines of systemic therapy. Axicabtagene ciloleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy, modifies a patient’s own T cells to recognize and attack cancer cells.The agency had granted PRIME status to axicabtagene ciloleucel in May 2016. A tentative approval is in the cards as the EMA generally takes the CHMP recommendation into account while reviewing any MAA. We note that axicabtagene ciloleucel was approved by the FDA in October 2017 as Yescarta.An approval in Europe will boost the growth prospects of the therapy, given the market potential. Per the information provided by the company, there are estimated 7,700 patients with DLBCL, who are refractory to or have relapsed after two or more lines of the therapy and may be eligible for CAR T therapy in Europe. (Read more: Gilead's CAR T Therapy Gets Positive CHMP Opinion)Amgen Announces Results on Remicade Biosimilar and Migraine Drug: Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced results from a phase III study, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of biosimilar candidate ABP 710 to branded drug Remicade. The results confirm ABP 710 was non-inferior compared to Remicade based on its primary endpoint, which was an assessment of ACR20 at week 22.The ACR (American College of Rheumatology) criteria are used to measure the effectiveness of various arthritis medicines in clinical studies.  An ACR20 score means that a person's RA has improved by 20%. Remicade is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, chronic severe plaque psoriasis, moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. We note that Amgen has a broad portfolio of 10 biosimilars, of which two are approved in the United States and three are approved in the European Union.In addition, Amgen announced encouraging results from two open-label extension (OLE) studies on migraine drug, Aimovig. Results from a one-year study in chronic migraine patients reinforced the established safety and efficacy profile of Aimovig in long-term use. Moreover, a three-year interim analysis from an ongoing five-year study of episodic migraine patients also reinforced the long-term safety and tolerability of Aimovig.Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Celgene Reports Positive Data on Luspatercept: Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) and partner Acceleron Pharma (XLRN  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line results from a phase III, multi-center study (MEDALIST) which evaluated the efficacy and safety of luspatercept versus placebo in patients with very low, low or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with chronic anemia and refractory to, intolerant of, or ineligible for treatment with an erythropoietin-stimulating agent (ESA), ring sideroblast-positive and require frequent red blood cells (RBC)  transfusions.The study showed that luspatercept achieved a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence of at least eight consecutive weeks during the first 24 weeks compared to placebo. The candidate also met the key secondary endpoint of demonstrating a highly statistically significant improvement in RBC transfusion independence of at least 12 consecutive weeks during the first 24 weeks.The study also achieved modified hematologic improvement-erythroid (IWG mHI-E), a meaningful secondary endpoint. Regulatory submissions are planned in the United States and Europe in the first half of 2019.  (Read more: Celgene's Luspatercept Meets Primary Endpoint in the Study)Keryx Plunges on Merger Deal with Akebia: Shares of Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. plunged following announcement of a definitive merger agreement with Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. (AKBA  -  Free Report). Both companies have agreed to combine in an all-stock merger and form a new, fully integrated company focused on chronic kidney diseases (or CKD) called Akebia Therapeutics.The deal is expected to close by the end of 2018. While Keryx already has an FDA approved drug Auryxia in its kitty, Akebia has a late-stage candidate in its pipeline. However, investors were not much impressed with the merger news and shares of both companies fell. (Read more: Keryx Inks Merger Deal With Akebia, Shares Fall)Cara Therapeutics Rallies On Positive Results: Shares of Cara Therapeutics, Inc. (CARA  -  Free Report) soared after the company announced positive top-line data from the adaptive phase II/III trial of intravenous (IV) CR845 in patients undergoing abdominal surgeries. The IV form of CR845 achieved statistical significance for the study’s primary endpoint of pain relief over the 0 to 24-hour (AUC 0-24) period post-surgery for combined surgeries at the 1.0 mcg/kg dose (p=0.032).In addition, the treatment with the same also resulted in statistically significant reductions in the secondary endpoint of incidence of nausea and vomiting at 24-hours post-surgery for both the 0.5 and 1.0 mcg doses (p=0.006; p<0.0001 respectively). The data demonstrate the overall benefit of CR845 in both providing pain relief across surgery types up to 24 hours post-surgery and reducing post-operative nausea and vomiting, a significant medical need in the post-operative setting. The brand name for the drug is Korsuva.The company had earlier inked a licensing deal with Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma Ltd. whereby it licensed worldwide rights, to commercialize Korsuva (CR845/difelikefalin) injection for the treatment of chronic kidney disease.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 1.10% over the last five trading sessions.

3389,GILD,"Biotech bigwig Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) develops drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (“HIV”), liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) infection and chronic hepatitis B virus (“HBV”) infection, cardiovascular, hematology/oncology and inflammation/respiratory diseases.The HCV franchise boasts drugs like Sovaldi and Harvoni and the recently launched Epclusa. However, the HCV franchise continues to grapple with competitive and pricing pressure leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales. Harvoni and Sovaldi have been facing competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Merck‘s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier, among others.Gilead is a dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive portfolio for the same. The company was the first to bring to market a single-tablet regimen (“STR”) for the treatment of HIV — Atripla. STRs for HIV in the market include Complera/Eviplera and Stribild among others.The newly launched tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)-based products Genvoya, Odefsey and Descovy are performing well with strong adoption in both the United States and Europe. Genvoya has already become the most-prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch in November 2015.Also, Genvoya has been listed as a preferred regimen in several HIV treatment guidelines. The TAF-based regimens now represent 62% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and the launches of Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Genvoya is $1074 million.Truvada, for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting, also put up a strong performance. The company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with approximately 153,000 patients using Truvada by the end of 2017.  We note that HIV is one of the primary areas of focus for Gilead and the company is working to bring new HIV treatments to market to further boost sales of the franchise.The company received a major boost when the FDA approved the company’s once-daily STR, Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25mg, BIC/FTC/TAF) for HIV-1 infection. The approval provides a major boost to Gilead’s HIV franchise.Biktarvy combines the novel, unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor (“INSTI”) bictegravir, with the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of the Descovy, (FTC/TAF) dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (“NRTI”) backbone and is the smallest INSTI-based triple-therapy STR available. The approval of this new HIV therapy will pose stiff competition to GlaxoSmith’s (GSK  -  Free Report) existing therapies, Tivicay and Triumeq.Gilead’s stock has returned 10.9% in the last twelve months compared with the industry's  loss of 8.9%. Gilead has a decent track record, with the company’s earnings beating estimates in three of the last four while missing in one. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings beat expectations by 4.7%. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 7.5%. We expect the strength in the HIV franchise to offset the HCV franchise weakness making it highly likely for the company to beat on earnings in the first quarter.

3390,GILD,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Gilead Sciences has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9.3, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.1x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Gilead Sciences’ current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 37.6. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Gilead Sciences has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.8, which is tad higher than the current level. So it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near term.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Gilead Sciences has a P/S ratio of about 3.8. This is marginally above the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3x right now. However, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, GILD is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Gilead Sciences currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Gilead Sciences a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Gilead Sciences might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of D. This gives GILD a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been stable with no significant revisions in the current quarter and the full year estimate in the last two months.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate remained stable in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched upper by 0.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and Consensus   Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and Consensus | Gilead Sciences, Inc. QuoteThe stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineGilead Sciences is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 36% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below: So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3391,GILD,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that it intends to spinoff its ophthalmology division, Alcon, into a separately-traded standalone company in order to grow as a medicines company solely.Why Is Novartis Spinning Off Alcon?The Alcon business wasn’t performing as per management’s expectations. While it did revive in between, the company decided to spin- off the same in order to focus better on its legacy drug business.  We remind investors that Novartis acquired Alcon in 2011. The business then comprised surgical, vision care and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals.In January 2016, Novartis undertook a strategic review of its business and consequently transferred Alcon's ophthalmic pharmaceuticals to the Novartis Innovative Medicines Division. The business generated sales of $4.6 billion in 2017 and also holds the potential blockbuster candidate, RTH258 (brolucizumab), which is being evaluated for neovascular AMD and diabetic macular edema.  Novartis plans to retain the ophthalmic pharmaceuticals as part of its pharmaceuticals portfolio.Novartis has been contemplating upon Alcon’s future for quite some time now, considering a divestment or a spin-off.The Alcon Division now comprises only surgical and vision care, and generated $7 billion in 2017 sales. The new company will employ more than 20,000 employees. Mike Ball will become the chairman-designate of Alcon, effective Jul 1, 2018. Ball will report to Vas Narasimhan, CEO of Novartis. Ball will focus on preparing Alcon for the intended spin-off.In addition, he will start the process of recruiting a board of directors (BoD) for Alcon, and meeting Novartis’ shareholders and other potential investors, in preparation for a potential spin-off.  David Endicott, chief operating officer (COO) of Alcon since July 2016, will be promoted to CEO of Alcon, also effective Jul 1, 2018.The transaction is expected to be tax neutral to Novartis. The spin-off is expected to be completed in the first half of 2019, subject to general market conditions, tax rulings and opinions, final Board endorsement and shareholder approval at the AGM in February 2019.How Will Novartis Gain?Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu and Kisqali, which continue to boost its sales. However, it is facing the loss of patent protection for some of the key drugs. Consequently, the company has refocused its business and plans to focus on building its portfolio in markets, which promise potential.Novartis’ shares have declined 6.9% in the year so far compared with the industry’s decline of 3.2%. Novartis is looking to solidify its presence in the gene therapy space. It recently acquired U.S.-based clinical stage gene therapy company, AveXis, Inc. Earlier in 2018, Novartis announced a licensing agreement with Spark Therapeutics (ONCE  -  Free Report) covering development, registration and commercialization rights to voretigene neparvovec, outside the United States.Planned Share BuybackConcurrently, the company announced that it will initiate a share buyback program of $5 billion. The buyback is conducted to use the proceeds of the divestment of the consumer health joint venture stake to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report), after making the payment for the AveXis acquisition.Other NewsConcurrently, Novartis announced that it obtained positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommending approval of  CAR-T therapy, Kymriah, for two B-cell malignancies — B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory, in relapse post-transplant or in second or later relapse in patients up to 25 years of age; and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that is relapsed or refractory (r/r) after two or more lines of systemic therapy in adults.Kymriah is a novel one-time treatment that uses a patient's own T cells to fight cancer. It is already approved in the United States. Rival company Gilead Sciences’ (GILD  -  Free Report) CAR- T therapy had also won CHMP positive opinion for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), after two or more lines of systemic therapy.Zacks RankNovartis carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3392,GILD,"Immune Design Corp. (IMDZ  -  Free Report) isscheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results after the market closes on May 2.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 25.64%. Immune Design topped earnings estimates in all of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat 19.84%.Immune Design’s shares have lost 10.2% year to date, compared with the industry’s fall of 3.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayBeing a development-stage biopharmaceutical company, Immune Design has not generated any product revenues yet. It earns revenues from collaboration and licensing agreements, and product sales.Investors remain focused on the company’s progress based on its pipeline candidates. Immune Design is developing multiple candidates using two discovery platforms — ZVex and GLAAS — for the treatment of various types of cancers. The company’s key pipeline candidates are CMB305 for solid tumor and G100 for merkel cell carcinoma (“MCC”).CMB305 has been designed under a prime-boost approach, involving the sequential dosing of two complementary agents — LV305 and G305.Currently, this candidate is being evaluated in soft tissue sarcoma patients both as monotherapy (phase I) and in combination with Roche Holding’s (RHHBY) Tecentriq (phase II). The company plans to initiate a pivotal phase III trial studying CMB305 as monotherapy in synovial sarcoma patients in mid-2018. If the progression free survival endpoint is met, the company intends to file a Biologics License Application and seek approval for CMB305 for the treatment of synovial sarcoma.The discussion with the FDA was positive regarding CMB305. Consequently, the company had planned to initiate a pivotal phase III trial studying CMB305 as monotherapy in synovial sarcoma patients. The study is expected to start in mid-2018. It will enroll 248 patients aged 12 and older with NY-ESO-1+ synovial sarcoma who will either receive CMB305 monotherapy or placebo. If the progression free survival endpoint is met, the company intends to file a Biologics License Application and seek approval for CMB305 for the treatment of synovial sarcoma. Meanwhile, G100 is being evaluated in multiple clinical trials, including as a monotherapy with local radiation in a completed phase I study in patients with MCC and in an ongoing investigator-sponsored trial in patients with sarcoma.It is also being developed as a monotherapy and combination therapy in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (“NHL”), in a randomized phase Ib/II study. In October 2017, G100 received Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of follicular NHL from the European Medicines Agency.A potential approval of these pipeline candidates will be a boost for the company.During the earnings call, we expect Immune Design to shed light on the progress of these ongoing trials.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not show an earnings beat for Immune Design this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to be able to beat estimates. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Immune Design has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 29 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Immune Design has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Immune Design Corp.

3393,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Hookipa Biotech AG. Per the agreement, Gilead will own exclusive rights to Hookipa's TheraT and Vaxwave arenavirus vector-based immunization technologies for two major chronic infectious disease indications, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). While research work will be carried out by both, Hookipa will manufacture arenavirus-based vectors for clinical development by Gilead.In exchange, Gilead will provide an upfront payment of $10 million. In addition, Hookipa will be eligible to receive payments up to a total of more than $400 million based upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones. Moreover, Gilead will fund all research and development activities. Hookipa will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales.The agreement further expands the relationship between Hookipa and Gilead following Gilead's participation in Hookipa's Series C financing in Dec 2017.  Hookipa’s unique therapeutic vaccine technology demonstrated excellent safety and immunogenicity in phase I studies.Gilead is banking on its HIV franchise to drive growth in future, given the persistent decline in HCV sales. Gilead’s stock has lost 3.0% in the last six months as against the industry's loss of 5.2%. Gilead’s HCV franchise witnessed slowdown across key markets, including the United States and Europe, reflecting lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi as a result of competitive and pricing pressure. The franchise saw a significant plunge in sales due to new competition and fewer patient starts. Pricing has largely stabilized and market share will stabilize by mid-2018, while patient starts are expected to decline further. We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa face competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Mayret, and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier among others.Meanwhile, Gilead is looking to newer avenues to help its top line by solidifying its presence in the gene therapy space. The initial uptake of Yescarta is also encouraging. Gilead is also intending to foray into the NASH market with pipeline candidates — selonsertib and filgotinib.During the first quarter, Gilead announced an agreement with Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (SGMO  -  Free Report) to use Sangamo’s zinc finger nuclease technology platform for the development of next-generation ex vivo cell therapies in oncology.Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3394,GILD,"We expect Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, after market close.Vertex’s shares have increased 5.9% so far this year while the industry has recorded a decrease of 9%.Vertex’s track record has been impressive so far. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the last four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise for the last four quarters is 25.31%. In the last reported quarter, Vertex came up with a positive surprise of 5.17%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayVertex’s cystic fibrosis (""CF"") drugs — Kalydeco & Orkambi — performed consistently in 2017, with sales rising almost 30%. We expect this positive trend to continue in the soon-to-be reported quarter.However, the company announced on its last quarter earnings call that first-quarter revenues will be unfavorably impacted by higher gross to net revenue adjustments and buildup of channel inventory in the fourth quarter of 2017.In January 2018, Vertex announced that an extension of the marketing application for Orkambi was approved in Europe. With the approval, Orkambi’s marketing label in EU will now include use in children with CF aged between six and 11 years and have two copies of the F508del mutation, expanding patient population by about 3,400. The expanded patient population is expected to boost sales of the drug. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Orkambi’s sales in the first quarter is $368 million.In 2017, Kalydeco received approval for two line extensions including in patients 2 years and older with certain residual mutations in CFTR gene. The drug generated significant sales last year due to rapid uptake in expanded patient population and we expect the trend to continue. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Kalydeco sales is pegged at $228 millionIn a boost to Vertex’s CF franchise, the FDA approved Vertex’s third CF drug, Symdeko, which is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor, in February 2018. The drug is under review in Europe. However, we expect the new drug to contribute minimally to first-quarter sales. We expect the company to provide update on Symdeko’s commercialization plan and its initial uptake.The company remains focused on development of its triple-combination regimens. During the quarter, Vertex advanced VX-659 and VX-445 for phase III development. Also, two phase III studies were initiated, evaluating VX-659 in combination with tezacaftor and Kalydeco (ivacaftor) in CF patients.Investor focus on the call will be on these triple combination CF regimens, which are crucial for long-term growth of Vertex. The company is also likely to provide full year revenue guidance including Symdeko sales on the call.However, operating expenses are likely to be on the higher side due to initiation of two pivotal studies and launch of Symdeko.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that Vertex is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (62 cents) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (57 cents), stands at +8.28%. This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Vertex has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are some biotech stocks that you may also want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release its results on May 4.

3395,GILD,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the opening bell.In the last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, Alexion’s track record is excellent as it has consistently topped estimates in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 15.21%.Alexion’s shares have underperformed the industry in the past  year. The stock has lost 9.9% compared with the industry’s decline of 8.3%. What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Alexion is likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — which have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates.Zacks ESP: Alexion has an Earnings ESP of +2.09% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.51 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.48. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Alexion’s Zacks Rank #2, when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Note that Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Impact Q1 ResultsAlexion’s blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well. Alexion continues to identify and treat a consistently high number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) with Soliris, across its 50-country operating platform.Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label into additional indications. The FDA recently approved the drug for the treatment of refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive. The drug was approved in Europe for this indication. Approximately 60,000-80,000 patients are expected to have gMG in the United States.Additionally, a phase III study (PREVENT) on Soliris in patients with relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is ongoing with enrollment was completed and data expected in mid-2018. Label expansion in additional indications will give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Soliris hints that the drug’s sales will increase to about 8.2% from the year-ago quarter to $803 million.Alexion recently announced that it will acquire Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutics for $855 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter. The acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, WTX101 to Alexion’s pipeline. The candidate is currently in phase III for the treatment of Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder.Alexion is looking to diversify its portfolio and reduce its dependence on its blockbuster drug Soliris. The deal will strengthen Alexion’s rare disease pipeline with a late-stage candidate.The company plans to focus on rare diseases businesses in core areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders to enhance productivity. Alexion will reduce spending and headcount associated with the previously announced de-prioritized pipeline programs as well as optimizing additional R&D expenses.The company plans to relocate its headquarters to Boston, MA by mid-2018 with approximately 400 positions. As a result of the restructuring plan, the company will reduce its global workforce by approximately 20%. The company expects that the increased financial flexibility will allow it to reinvest approximately $100 million annually into R&D. Alexion expects pretax savings of approximately $250 million by 2019.In the meantime, the company’s efforts to develop its pipeline are impressive, particularly in case of ALXN1210. Currently, it is evaluating ALXN1210 (a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody that inhibits terminal complement) in phase III studies for both PNH and aHUS. A tentative approval for PNH is expected in 2019.Patients are also being dosed in a phase III trial with ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks in complement inhibitor treatment-naive adolescent and adult patients with aHUS.  The company is expected to complete enrollment in the second quarter and announce the results in the fourth quarter of 2018.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

3397,GILD,"Investors in the biotech sector were glued last week to the highly awaited 54th annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), which overshadowed the usual regulatory and other updates from the space. The meeting, held in Chicago (Jun 1-Jun 5) provides companies with a platform to showcase their data to scientists, physicians, the investment community and others. While the focus was mainly on ASCO data, companies like Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) remained in the limelight on pipeline updates.Recap of Important Stories:Biogen/Eisai Report Encouraging Data on Elenbecestat: Biogen along with partner Eisai announced encouraging results on its Alzheimer's candidate, elenbecestat, a BACE inhibitor, from a phase II study (Study 202). The study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group 18-month study among patients (n=70) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s disease, or mild-to-moderate dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease with confirmed amyloid pathology by PET ((positron emission tomography) screening. All the patients were randomized to four treatment arms receiving elenbecestat (5, 15, or 50 mg) or placebo daily. More than half the patients in the elenbecestat 5 mg and 15 mg arms were switched to the 50 mg arm for three months or more. The data showed elenbecestat was generally safe and well tolerated. Results demonstrated a statistically significant difference in amyloid beta(Aβ) levels in the brain measured by amyloid-PET and suggested a delay of clinical symptom decline in exploratory endpoints. Eisai and Biogen are jointly developing elenbecestat since March 2014. Both companies are currently conducting two global phase III studies (MISSION AD1/2) on early Alzheimer’s disease.Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Vertex/ CRISPR Sickle Cell Disease Candidate Put On Hold: Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated and CRISPR Therapeutics announced that the FDA has placed a clinical hold on the Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for CTX001 for the treatment of sickle cell disease pending the resolution of certain questions raised by the FDA. Both the companies had submitted the IND to the FDA in April to support the planned initiation of a phase I/II trial in the United States in adult patients with sickle cell disease. CTX001 is an experimental, gene-edited autologous hematopoietic stem cell therapy which is also being evaluated for patients suffering from β-thalassemia along with sickle cell disease.  Despite the FDA clinical hold, both the companies plan to initiate a phase I/II trial on CTX001 in Europe in adult patients with transfusion dependent β-thalassemia. CRISPR and Vertex will equally share all research and development costs and profits worldwide for CTX001. (Read more: Vertex/CRISPR's Sickle Disease Candidate Put on Hold by FDA)Sarepta Gets Negative CHMP Opinion For Exondys: Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT  -  Free Report) announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), has adopted a negative opinion for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) candidate, Exondys (eteplirsen). A negative opinion was expected following the oral explanation trend vote. Consequently, Sarepta will request a re-examination of the opinion, which will result in the assignment of a new rapporteur and co-rapporteur. Additionally, Sarepta will request a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) on DMD be called. This in turn will allow neuromuscular specialists to provide expert guidance and insight into, among other things, the validity of the external controls used and the importance of certain functional endpoints. The re-examination will be completed by the end of 2018.And finally a look at some ASCO results: Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) had multiple presentations on its oncology drugs Revlimid, Pomalyst along with other experimental therapies at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago, IL. Results from the TRANSCEND study on experimental CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy candidate, lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel; JCAR017), in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) were encouraging. (Read more: Celgene Presents Data on CAR T Therapy, Revlimid&Pomalyst).Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi also announced data from two trials evaluating cemiplimab in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma at the ASCO. The data from the study showed that patients treated with cemiplimab experienced robust anti-tumor effects. Cemiplimab-treated patients showed a 47.5% response rate with a median observed time to response of two months as of the data cut-off date.Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Kite also announced results from an ongoing phase I study at the ASCO which showed that clinical responses were observed with investigational T cell receptor (TCR) cell therapy targeting human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 in solid tumor cancers caused by HPV. Meanwhile, Gilead has also collaborated with Hookipa Biotech AG and obtained exclusive rights to Hookipa's TheraT and Vaxwave arenavirus vector-based immunization technologies for two major chronic infectious disease indications, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

3398,GILD,"We expect Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before market open.Bristol-Myers’ shares have decreased 16.5% so far this year compared with the industry’s decline of 4.7%.Bristol-Myers’ track record has been mixed so far. The company delivered positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters and missed expectations once. The average positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters is 4.23%. In the last reported quarter, Bristol-Myers delivered a positive surprise of 1.49%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter. What Will Drive Growth in Q1?Bristol-Myers’ blockbuster immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo is expected to remain the main sales driver in the first quarter, following several line extensions in 2017. In the soon-to-be reported quarter, the company announced encouraging results from a phase III study evaluating Opdivo in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. Opdivo in combination with Yervoy significantly improved progression free survival in patients compared to chemotherapy. A potential approval in this indication will be a significant boost for the drug, given the immense scope in the lung cancer market. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the drug’s sales in the first quarter is pegged at $1.38 billion.In January 2018, the European Commission approved the label expansion of Yervoy injection in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The FDA approved the drug for this indication in July 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the drug’s sales in this quarter is $291 million.In November 2017, the FDA approved line extension of Sprycel in pediatric patients with Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase. The drug, which registered growth of 6.7% in the previous quarter, is expected to receive a boost this quarter due to the expanded label. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sprycel sales stands at $507 million. Cardiovascular drug, Eliquis, came up with a strong performance in 2017, with sales growing 44% year over year. Sales are expected to remain robust in the first quarter too. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Eliquis sales is pegged at $1.43 billion.On the other hand, the decline in Hepatitis C franchise is expected to continue due to intense competition from multiple drugs including Epclusa as its label was expanded to include HIV co-infection in August. Moreover, the HIV business continues to face competitive pressure. Recent launches by other companies in the same space are expected to further impact the Sustiva franchise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hepatitis C franchise sales is pegged at $52 million this quarter, down 67.9% from the year-ago quarter actual figure.ConclusionSeveral label expansions of Bristol-Myers’ blockbuster cancer drug, Opdivo, drove the company’s sales last year and are expected do so this year as well. Moreover, cardiovascular drug, Eliquis, also demonstrated strong performance in 2017. We expect this trend to continue this quarter. Label expansion of leukemia drug, Sprycel, approved in November 2017, should bring in more sales for the drug. Moreover, continued strong performance of Yervoy and Orencia will have a favorable impact.However, genericization of Plavix, Avapro/Avalide and Baraclude in the United States due to loss of exclusivity is significantly hurting the company’s top line. The company also faces stiff competition in the immuno-oncology space. The HIV business continues to face competitive pressure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for Q1 is pegged at $5.17 billion and 84 cents, respectively.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that Bristol-Myers is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP:Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +0.82%. This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:Bristol-Myers has a Zacks Rank #3.

3399,GILD,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) entered into a research collaboration agreement with Harvard Fibrosis Network of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.Both companies have teamed up to discover and develop potential new therapies for fibrotic diseases, including fibrosis of the liver and heart.Per the terms of the agreement, leading academic investigators of hepatic and cardiac fibrosis from the Harvard Fibrosis Network will collaborate with leading scientists from Bristol-Myers Squibb on four projects over three years. These projects will focus on applied fibrosis biology, identification of noninvasive biomarkers, and novel targets for potential anti-fibrotic therapies, in the areas of hepatic and cardiac fibrosis.Bristol-Myers is building a robust pipeline of investigational candidates to address areas of high unmet need in fibrosis, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (“IPF”).Bristol-Myers’ blockbuster drug Opdivo continues to perform well. Several label expansion applications for Opdivo are under review in the United States and Europe. Potential approval will boost the prospects of the drug further.   Shares of the company have rallied 14.3% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 10.8%.However, with generic competition looming large over the company, Bristol-Myers’ pipeline needs to deliver.  Hence, the company is looking to diversify its portfolio in the promising space like NASH.In 2017, Bristol-Myers extended its strategic partnership with TARGET PharmaSolutions, Inc. The partnership has been extended for TARGET-NASH for a multi-year deal.We note that both companies announced two new collaborations in November 2016 for the treatment of NASH and HCC.Bristol-Myers already has a mid-stage candidate in the NASH space. BMS-986036, an investigational pegylated analogue of human fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a key regulator of metabolism, in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH (F1-F3) achieved its primary endpoint of significant reduction in liver fat versus placebo in April. The company was entitled the rights to research, develop and commercialize BMS-986036 from Ambrx, Inc.Other major companies with promising candidates for NASH are Intercept Pharma (ICPT  -  Free Report), Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) and Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report).Zacks RankBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3400,GILD,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (""CHMP"") has issued a positive opinion on the company’s Marketing Authorization Application (""MAA"") for CAR T therapy, axicabtagene ciloleucel, as a treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (""DLBCL"") and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (""PMBCL""), after two or more lines of systemic therapy.Axicabtagene ciloleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy, modifies a patient’s own T cells to recognize and attack cancer cells.The agency had earlier granted PRIME status to axicabtagene ciloleucel in May 2016.A tentative approval is on the cards as the EMA generally takes the CHMP recommendation into account while reviewing any MAA.We note that axicabtagene ciloleucel was approved by the FDA in October 2017 as Yescarta.An approval in Europe will boost the growth prospects of the therapy, given the market potential. Per the information provided by the company, there are an estimated 7,700 patients with DLBCL, who are refractory to or have relapsed after two or more lines of the therapy,  and may be eligible for CAR T therapy in Europe.Concurrently, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) also obtained positive opinion from the CHMP for its CAR-T therapy, Kymriah, for two B-cell malignancies — B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and DLBCL.Gilead’s stock has gained 0.4% in the year so far as against the industry's decline of 6.9%. We note that Gilead is looking to newer avenues to help its top line by solidifying its presence in the gene therapy space. The initial uptake of Yescarta in the United States is also encouraging. Gilead is also intending to foray into the NASH market.Gilead’s HCV franchise is experiencing slowdown across key markets, including the United States and Europe, reflecting lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi as a result of competitive and pricing pressure. The franchise saw a significant plunge in sales, due to new competition and fewer patient starts. We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa face competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Mayret, and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier, among others. Nevertheless, the HIV franchise continues to maintain momentum.Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3402,GILD,"bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Lenti-D for the treatment of patients with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD). We note that the Breakthrough Therapy designation expedites the development and review of drugs intended as a standalone therapy or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease when preliminary data suggest that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.The designation is supported by positive preliminary data from the ongoing phase II/III Starbeam Study (ALD-102) evaluating Lenti-D investigational gene therapy in boys with CALD, 17 years of age or less who do not have a matched sibling donor.  The two-year study has assessed the safety and efficacy of this investigational gene therapy. CALD is a hereditary neurological disorder.We note that Lenti-D investigational gene therapy enjoys orphan drug status in the Unites States and Europe. The drug was also granted Rare Pediatric Disease designation by the FDA for the treatment of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD).Per the FDA’s Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, a sponsor who receives a marketing application approval for a rare pediatric indication is generally eligible for a Priority Review Voucher, which can be redeemed to obtain Priority Review for a subsequent marketing application for a different product.bluebird bio has built a diverse pipeline with its lentiviral-based gene therapies, T cell immunotherapy expertise and gene editing capabilities. bluebird bio’s gene therapy clinical programs include Lenti-D for the treatment of cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, and LentiGlobin for the treatment of transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia, also known as β-thalassemia major, and severe sickle cell disease.The oncology pipeline primarily focuses on developing novel T cell-based immunotherapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR T) and T cell receptor (TCR) therapies.  The lead oncology programs include bb2121 and bb21217.

Juluca combines two approved HIV drugs — Tivicay (50 mg) and Edurant (25 mg) — into a single, once-daily pill for the treatment of virologically suppressed HIV-1 infectionJuluca gained approval in the United States in November last year and generated sales £10 million in the first quarter of 2018.Tivicay, a novel investigational integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), is marketed by ViiV Healthcare, an HIV company majorly owned by Glaxo and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report). Edurant is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) marketed by Janssen, J&J’s pharma arm. Juluca has been developed under a partnership between ViiV Healthcare and Janssen.The approval in the EU was expected as in March this year the Committee for Human Use of Medicinal Products (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) had given a positive opinion recommending approval of Juluca.This year so far, J&J’s shares have declined 11.4% while that of Glaxo have gone up 13%. In the said time frame, the industry has witnessed a decline of 3.7%.Juluca, the first two-drug regimen to be approved, reduces the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen.Juluca’s approval was based on data from two phase III SWORD studies. Data from these studies showed that the combination of Tivicay and Edurant antiretroviral was as effective as a three- or four-drug antiretroviral regimen as a maintenance therapy in HIV patients who have already achieved viral suppression.We remind investors that Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) also gained FDA approval for a single tablet HIV regimen (triple therapy) this year.  Biktarvy gained FDA approval in February this year while a regulatory application is under review in the EU.

3404,GILD,"It has been a pretty ho-hum first-half of 2018 for the biotech sector. The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (^NBI) has lost 1.2% so far in 2018.The performance of biotech bigwigs has been affected by the slowdown in growth of key drugs. Competitive pressure will continue to impact sales. Nevertheless, new drug approvals boosted investor sentiment. Key approvals so far this year include Gilead Sciences’ (GILD  -  Free Report) HIV regimen, Biktarvy; Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ Symdeko (tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF), Amgen’s Aimoviq for the treatment of migraine, and BioMarin’s Palynziq for the treatment of phenylketonuria, among others. The approval of these drugs should boost their respective companies’ top line as a few of them are struggling with decline in sales of legacy drugs.Increase in M&AMergers and acquisitions picked up pace in the sector as the slowdown in mature products has forced companies like Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) to eye lucrative acquisitions to bolster their pipeline. Celgene acquired Juno Therapeutics to gain traction in the promising CAR-T space. In February 2018, the company acquired Impact Biomedicines and added a late-stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to its pipeline.Alexion will acquire Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutics and add a late-stage candidate, WTX101, to its pipeline, which is currently in phase III for the treatment of Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder. Most recently, Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. and Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. announced a merger agreement under which both the companies will combine in an all-stock merger. We expect many more such deals in the latter half as well.What Lies Ahead?The Medical - Biomed/Genetics sub-industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #153, which places it at the bottom 40% of the 255 plus Zacks industries. Although issues like drug pricing and threat of biosimilars loom large on the healthcare sector in large, we expect a better performance in the second half of 2018. New drug approvals, label expansion of existing high-profile drugs, pipeline progress, growing demand for drugs, especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should positively impact performance.Our ChoicesHere we list a few biotech stocks backed by a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) and increase in share price, which look fairly placed for a good run in the second half of 2018:Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) is one of the leading biotech companies in the world. Amgen’s newer drugs – Prolia, Xgeva, Blincyto, Vectibix, Kyprolis – are performing well.  The recent approval of migraine candidate, Aimovig was a huge boost. The biosimilars portfolio looks solid too with approved products like Amjevita, Mvasi, and a deep pipeline. While Amgen’s key drugs are facing biosimilar competition, we expect the newer drugs to offset the decline. The company has already undertaken a restructuring plan, which should lower costs and aid the bottom line. Amgen’s shares have gained 7% so far this year against a 8.6% decrease registered by the industry.Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Athersys, Inc. (ATHX  -  Free Report) is primarily focused on regenerative medicine. The company’s patented and proprietary allogeneic stem cell product, MultiStem cell therapy, is its lead platform product. It is currently in advanced stages of clinical development for treating neurological conditions, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory and immune disorders, certain pulmonary conditions and other conditions in which the current standard of care is limited or inadequate for many patients, particularly in the critical care segment. Stem cell therapy has gained a lot of investor attention of late and companies with such candidates are in the spotlight.Athersys carries a Zacks Rank #2. Shares of the company have gained 7.1% in the year so far against the industry decline of 8.6%. Celsion Corporation (CLSN  -  Free Report) is another company whose prospects look good.  The company is focused on developing a portfolio of innovative cancer treatments, including directed chemotherapies, immunotherapies and RNA- or DNA-based therapies. Its pipeline progress has been encouraging so far. ThermoDox, the company’s lead program, is a proprietary heat-activated liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin, which is currently in phase III development for the treatment of primary liver cancer.  Other candidates in the pipeline include, GEN-1, a DNA-based immunotherapy for the localized treatment of ovarian and brain cancers.  Celsion has two platform technologies for the development of novel nucleic acid-based immunotherapies and other anti-cancer DNA or RNA therapies. Immunotherapy holds a lot of potential as of now and the company’s impressive pipeline progress is a big positive for investors.Celsion carries a Zacks Rank #2. Shares of the company have returned 15.7% in the year so far against the industry decline of 8.6%. Aeglea BioTherapeutics, Inc.  (AGLE  -  Free Report) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company, which focuses on innovative human enzyme therapeutics for patients suffering from rare genetic diseases and cancer. The lead experimental therapy, pegzilarginase, is being evaluated for the treatment of Arginase 1 deficiency, as monotherapy in arginine-dependent cancers and in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, Keytruda, for small cell lung cancer. The company is also developing a pipeline of additional product candidates targeting key amino acids and other metabolites, including homocysteine (and the oxidized form homocystine), a target for another rare genetic disease as well as cysteine, and its oxidized form cystine, and methionine, for cancer indications.Aeglea carries a Zacks Rank #2.

3405,GILD,"The biotech sector was in focus with regular pipeline updates. The key stories include bigwig Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) getting approval for its HIV drug Biktarvy in Europe and Puma Biotechnology (PBYI  -  Free Report) soaring on positive CHMP recommendation, while Merrimack (MACK  -  Free Report) plunged on the failure of its phase II study in pancreatic cancer.Recap of Important StoriesGilead’s Biktarvy Gets EC Approval: Gilead announced that the European Commission has granted Marketing Authorization to HIV combination therapy Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg; BIC/FTC/TAF). Biktarvy is approved as a once-daily single tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults without present or past evidence of viral resistance to the integrase class, emtricitabine or tenofovir.The approval was supported by positive data from four ongoing phase III studies, namely Studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults, and Studies 1844 and 1878 in virologically suppressed adults. With this approval, BIC/FTC/TAF becomes Gilead’s third FTC/TAF-based STR approved in the European Union in three years. BIC/FTC/TAF met its primary objective at 48 weeks in all four studies.The regimen was earlier approved by the FDA in February 2018. The approval in Europe will further strengthen the company’s HIV franchise. (Read more: Gilead's Biktarvy Gets EC Nod for HIV- 1 Infection)Merrimack Plunges on Study Failure:  Shares of Merrimack plunged after the company reported disappointing results from the phase II study in front-line metastatic pancreatic cancer. The phase II trial, CARRIE, evaluated the addition of MM-141 to standard-of-care treatment in patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer and high serum levels of free Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1).  The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival, while secondary endpoints included objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response, and overall survival and safety.Merrimack reported that the study did not meet its primary or secondary efficacy endpoints in patients, who received MM-141 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and Gemzar, compared with nab-paclitaxel and Gemzar alone. Subsequently, Merrimack has terminated the development of MM-141. With the sale of Onivyde, the company was back to being a development-stage biopharmaceutical company and was banking on its three pipeline candidates to boost its growth prospects. Hence, the failure of the CARRIE study came as a huge disappointment for its investors, given the limited number of candidates in the pipeline. Consequently, the company now plans to focus on the other two candidates in its pipeline, MM-121 and MM-310. (Read more: Merrimack Crashes as Phase II Pancreatic Cancer Study Fails)Amgen's Presents Encouraging Data on Repatha: Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced encouraging data from the phase III study, BANTING, which showed that its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, significantly reduced bad cholesterol in patients, with type II diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, who have already undergone moderate/high-intensity statin therapy. The study evaluated monthly subcutaneous administration of a 420 mg dose of Repatha over a period of 12 weeks in patients with type II diabetes and hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, who are on optimized background statin therapy. The results from the study showed that the addition of Repatha to background statin therapy significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C).Data from the BANTING study also revealed that 84.5% of patients in the Repatha arm achieved LDL-C levels of less than 70 mg/dL, which is the recommended level by the American College of Clinical Endocrinologists for patients with type II diabetes compared with 15.4% of patients in placebo arm at week 12.

The MAA is seeking approval of the drug as extended adjuvant treatment of early-stage HER2-positive hormone receptor positive breast cancer. The news boosted investor sentiment as the CHMP had adopted a negative opinion on the MAA in February 2018. The positive opinion from the CHMP indicates an imminent tentative approval. The drug was approved by the FDA in July 2017 for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early-stage HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer, following adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy.Incyte Announces Positive Results on Jakafi for GVHD: Incyte (INCY  -  Free Report) announced that the phase II trial, REACH1, evaluating lead drug Jakafi in combination with corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), met its primary endpoint. The data from the study showed that Jakafi demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 55% at day 28.Moreover, the number of patients showing a response at any point of time, during the study, was 73%. Propelled by positive data from the REACH 1 study, Incyte now plans to file a Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) with the FDA, for the label expansion of Jakafi, for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute GVHD, during the third quarter of 2018.

3406,GILD,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission has granted Marketing Authorization to HIV combination therapy Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg; BIC/FTC/TAF).Biktarvy is approved as a once-daily single tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults without present or past evidence of viral resistance to the integrase class, emtricitabine or tenofovir.The approval was supported by positive data from four ongoing phase III studies, namely Studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults, and Studies 1844 and 1878 in virologically suppressed adults.With this approval, BIC/FTC/TAF becomes Gilead’s third FTC/TAF-based STR approved in the European Union in the past three years. BIC/FTC/TAF met its primary objective at 48 weeks in all four studies.The regimen was earlier approved by the FDA in February 2018. The approval in Europe will further strengthen the company’s HIV franchise.Gilead is a dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive portfolio for the same. HIV is one of the primary areas of focus for Gilead and the company is working to bring new HIV treatments to market to further boost sales of the franchise. The company was the first to bring to market a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV — Atripla. The TAF-based products, Genvoya, Odefsey and Descovy, are performing well with strong adoption in both the United States and Europe.Biktarvy combines the novel, unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor (“INSTI”) bictegravir, with the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of the Descovy, (FTC/TAF) dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (“NRTI”) backbone, and the smallest INSTI-based triple-therapy STR is produced. The approval of this new HIV therapy will pose stiff competition to GlaxoSmith’s (GSK  -  Free Report) existing therapies, Tivicay and Triumeq.Meanwhile, Gilead is banking on its HIV franchise to drive growth in future, given the persistent decline in HCV sales. Gilead’s stock has gained 0.8% in the last six months as against the industry's decline of 6.8%.Gilead’s HCV franchise is experiencing slowdown across key markets, including the United States and Europe, reflecting lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi as a result of competitive and pricing pressure. The franchise saw a significant plunge in sales, due to new competition and fewer patient starts.Pricing has largely stabilized and market share will stabilize by mid-2018, while patient starts are expected to decline further. We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa face competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Mayret, and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier among others.Meanwhile, Gilead is looking at newer avenues to help its top line, by solidifying its presence in the gene therapy space.

3407,GILD,"By far the most exciting real-time revolution unfolding in Biotechnology is CRISPR gene editing. And the past few months have provided plenty of excitement for Biotech investors as the three public companies who are pure-play manifestations of the technology have made some dramatic moves -- on good news and bad.For instance, on June 11, two scientific research studies were published that suggested CRISPR gene editing could actually enable cancer growth. Shares of the biggest of the three companies, CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP  -  Free Report), dropped over 20% on that scary news of ""gene editing gone wrong.""After reading scientist, analyst, and company reactions to understand the controversy and its implications, I decided it was actually a buying opportunity for investors who follow my picks in Zacks Healthcare Innovators, where we also own the other two players Editas Medicine (EDIT  -  Free Report) and Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA  -  Free Report).For a good explanation of why I saw that fear-driven reaction as an excellent opportunity for investors who appreciate a good calculated risk, check out the video I made on June 18...Why I Bought More CRSP Under $55From ""Revolutionary Breakthrough"" to ""Dangerous Science""And this is not the first time a news or research scare has made the stock go from over-loved to well-hated. In January, there were papers being debated about whether CRISPR could cause ""off-target"" edits, accidentally modifying other genes not related to a given targeted disease.But this ""collateral damage"" view was found within a few months to be based on inconclusive research.Beyond the scientific unknowns of this ""power of God"" technology, there is another landmine for investors: the three companies, and their respective partner research institutions or universities, are all in a giant patent dispute over who discovered what, and when, and who lays claim to which new developments.What Exactly is CRISPR?In the video that accompanies this article, I go over some of the basic scientific facts and assumptions of CRISPR that make it such a revolutionary discovery for potentially curing thousands of genetic diseases.What's so fascinating about CRISPR is that it wasn't invented in a lab like some pharmaceutical drug. It was discovered in nature.Rather than try to explain it in my own words and probably butcher it, let's hear from one of the experts, CRISPR Therapeutics (from their website)...CRISPR/Cas9 is a rapid and easy to use gene editing technology that can selectively delete, modify or correct a disease causing abnormality in a specific DNA segment.CRISPR refers to Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats occurring in the genome of certain bacteria, from which the system was discovered; Cas9 is a CRISPR-associated endonuclease (an enzyme), the “molecular scissors” that are easily programmed to cut and edit, or correct, disease-associated DNA in a patient’s cell.The clustered repeats of CRISPR were discovered by accident in 1987 by researchers studying bacterial defense mechanisms, specifically how bacteria deal with foreign plasmids and phages. Bacteria have the ability to open and alter the genomes of invading viruses with a nuclease called Cas9, inactivating them in the process. The clustered repeats were given the name CRISPR in 2002 and multiple CRISPR-associated (Cas) genes were discovered adjacent to the repeat elements in that same year.A New Science for Treating Disease, Courtesy of Good Ole BacteriaCRISPR could be summed up as simply as this: a protein named Cas9 found in the streptococcus bacteria attacks the DNA of an invading virus by slicing it up. In essence, the prey becomes the predator. Mother nature worked on this for billions of years. She must know something.That is the crux of what you want to remember here about CRISPR-Cas: scientists have learned from bacteria -- nature's warriors of survival and her ninjas of adaptation -- how they utilize proteins to alter the genetic structure of invading viruses, and thereby how we can use Cas9 to ""edit"" genetic material.Because of its ability to modify a cell's DNA with amazing precision, CRISPR and its evolving variations -- a new enzyme called Cas13 was recently discovered that could be less error-prone -- will be a hot arena for science and medical innovation for decades to come.Mother nature indeed knows things. In fact, most scientists believe we are just scratching the surface of what will be discovered this century. So it may be premature to call CRISPR ""the discovery of the century"" when we've got over 80 years left.And investors should also be aware of different types of gene editing. Last July, I gave Zacks Confidential subscribers a special report on ""Gene Editing: How to Invest."" There we picked Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO  -  Free Report) as a potential winner with its technology called zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN). We rode SGMO to 155% gains this year after Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) and its KITE subsidiary created a $3 billion R&D partnership with Sangamo.For my latest report on gene editing from April titled CRISPR Science and Investing, you can email Ultimate@Zacks.com and one of our account reps will help you out.That report gives more background on all the companies plus a peek at the new Cas13 threat.Disclosure: I own shares of CRSP, NTLA, EDIT, SGMO, and GILD for the Zacks Healthcare Innovators portfolio.

3408,GILD,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced encouraging results from the JULIET trial on Kymriah after 14 months, wherein it was observed that ongoing durable responses are achievable with Kymriah when administered to adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).These data were also presented at the 23rd Annual Congress of the European Hematology Association.The results from the trial showed overall response rate (ORR) of 52% among 93 evaluable patients, who were followed for at least three months or discontinued earlier. In addition, a complete response (CR) was achieved in 40% of patients and 12% achieved a partial response (PR). Of the total patients who had experienced CR at three months, 83% remained on the same at month 12. Moreover, the relapse-free probability at 12 months, after a patient's first response, was 65%, which was encouraging.The results further emphasize Kymriah’s efficacy with durable responses, and a predictable and consistent safety profile for more than a year, after infused in patients with advanced DLBCL.With eight months of additional follow up, response rates remained consistent with previous reports with no emergence of new safety signals.Kymriah, formerly CTL019, is the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy, approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse. The FDA also approved Kymriah for the treatment of adult patients with r/r large B-cell lymphoma, after two or more lines of systemic therapy including DLBCL, high grade B-cell lymphoma and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma, based on data from the JULIET study in May 2018.Meanwhile, Novartis’ Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Kymriah, for the treatment of children and young adults with r/r B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and for adult patients with r/r DLBCL, is currently under review in Europe.Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu and Kisqali, which continue to boost its sales. The approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost, given the potential in the CAR-T therapy space. Novartis’ shares have declined 7.7% in the last six months compared with the industry’s decline of 2.6%.Earlier in 2018, Novartis announced a licensing agreement with Spark Therapeutics (ONCE  -  Free Report), covering development, registration and commercialization rights to voretigene neparvovec, outside the United States.Competition is increasing in the gene therapy space. Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta was another CAR-T therapy, approved to treat adult patients with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma, who have not responded to or have relapsed after at least two other kinds of treatment.uniQure (QURE  -  Free Report) is another gene therapy company, which is advancing a pipeline of proprietary and partnered gene therapies to treat patients with liver/metabolic, central nervous system and cardiovascular diseases.The approval of new drugs bode well for Novartis as the company is facing the loss of patent protection for some of the key drugs.Novartis also announced results from a new comparison study showing that Jakavi -treated patients with polycythemia vera (PV), who were resistant or intolerant to hydroxyurea (HU), had a significantly reduced risk of thrombosis (blood clots) and death compared to PV patients, who received best available therapy.Zacks RankNovartis carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3409,GILD,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is taking desperate attempts to bolster its portfolio and reduce dependence on lead drug, Revlimid.  However, things do not seem to be working in favor of the company.  Celgene’s stock has lost 17.8% in the last three months, worse than the industry’s decline of 5.6%.Last month, Celgene suffered yet another setback when it received Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding its New Drug Application (“NDA”) for multiple sclerosis candidate ozanimod. The candidate is being developed for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (“MS”). The FDA stated that the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections in the NDA were inadequate to allow a complete review. Hence, Celgene will request a Type A meeting with the FDA to ascertain the additional information needed for resubmission of the NDA. The news comes as a great disappointment for investors given the potential the MS market holds.Notably, things have been on the downturn for the company since last October after Celgene announced a phase III trial, REVOLVE, (CD-002) on pipeline candidate GED-0301 in Crohn’s disease and the extension trial, SUSTAIN (CD-004) have been discontinued following a recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee, which assessed overall benefit/risk during a recent interim futility analysis.In December 2017, a late stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan failed. The study evaluated Revlimid plus Rituxan (R2) followed by R2 maintenance compared with the standard of care featuring Rituxan plus chemotherapy (R-CHOP, R-bendamustine or R-VN CVP) followed by Rituxan maintenance for previously untreated follicular lymphoma. However, the R2 treatment arm could not achieve superiority in the co-primary endpoints of complete response or unconfirmed complete response CR/CRu) at 120 weeks and in terms of progression-free survival observed during the pre-planned analysis.Celgene’s key growth engine is Revlimid. While Revlimid sales continue to be impressive, we are concerned about the company’s dependence on the product for growth. The drug is set to lose patent exclusivity soon and hence Celgene is desperately trying to revive its portfolio.Celgene was on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions given a lacklustre 2017 just like Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) which acquired Kite Pharma.  The Juno acquisition added JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel) to Celgene’s lymphoma pipeline. JCAR017 is a best-in-class CD19-directed CAR-T candidate, currently in a pivotal program for relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  The candidate is expected to obtain regulatory approval in the United States in 2019 and generate sales of approximately $3 billion.  While the acquisition of Juno will surely boost Celgene’s growth prospects given the immense potential in the CAR-T therapy space, it might be a risky proposition for Celgene as Juno has faced setbacks with its pipeline candidate, JCAR015.Hence, we expect investors to stay on the side-lines for the time being and observe how the revival story for Celgene plays out.Zacks Rank & Key PickCelgene currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock from the same space is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Regeneron’s earnings per share estimates have moved up from $18.65 to $18.68 for 2018 in the last 30 days. The company pulled off a positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 9.15%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

3410,GILD,"Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CNAT  -  Free Report)is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, after the market closes.The company’s earnings history has been disappointing so far, having missed expectations on two occasions, missed in one and registered in-line results in another with an average negative surprise of 55.24%. Last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 11.76%.Shares of Conatus have plunged 61% in a year’s time versus the industry’s 12.6% rally. Let’s see, how things are shaping up for the upcoming release.Factors at PlayWith no approved product in Conatus’ portfolio at the moment, the company is yet to generate revenues. Hence, investors’ focus will be on the company’s progress with respect to the lead candidate, emricasan, an orally active pan-caspase protease inhibitor.Emricasan is under evaluation in various phase IIb studies for the treatment of chronic liver disease including NASH fibrosis. There are now four ongoing emricasan phase IIb trials, which consist of three other ENCORE programs on patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis caused by nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in various patient populations. Data from these analyses are expected between 2018 and 2019.The company also plans to initiate a new study called ENCORE-XT, a planned extension trial on patients, who completed the ENCORE-PH or ENCORE-LF studies with continued monitoring for efficacy, safety, clinical outcomes and a healthy quality of life.Apart from emricasan, the company’s portfolio has IDN-7314, presently undergoing a phase II study for treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis. We expect an update on the same on first-quarter conference call.Emricasan has also been extensively profiled in in-vitro tests and studied in many preclinical models of human disease. In April, Conatus announced positive results from both in-vitro and in-vivo studies, demonstrating reductions of hepatic tissue factor-driven coagulation.It is important to note that Conatus has an exclusive option, collaboration and license agreement with Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) for the worldwide development and commercialization of emricasan. With Novartis sharing half the development costs related to Conatus’ phase IIb studies on emricasan, the company now anticipates lower spending on in-licensing and internal pipeline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Conatus is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Conatus has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 17 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Conatus carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company’s 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.  We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc.

3411,GILD,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) reported core earnings of 68 cents per American depositary share in the first quarter of 2018, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents. However, earnings were up 11% at constant exchange rate (CER) compared with the year-ago figure.Shares of Glaxo were down almost 4% on Apr 25 in after-hours trading due to lower-than-expected results in the reported quarter. Moreover, the stock has lost 2.4% in a year’s time against the industry’s 3.7% growth. Quarterly revenues rose 4% at CER to $10.0 billion (£7.2 billion), driven by a strong performance at the Vaccines segment. The top line however, marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.3 billion.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at CER.Quarterly HighlightsSales were up 7% in the United States and 4% in the International markets. On the flip side, sales in Europe were flat year over year.Glaxo reports financial figures under three segments: Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare.The Pharmaceuticals division registered 2% revenue growth, driven by HIV drugs and respiratory disease drugs, namely Nucala and the Ellipta portfolio. This upside was partly offset by a decline in sales of older respiratory products including Seretide/Advair, Ventolin and Established Pharmaceuticals.HIV sales increased 14% on the back of 15% and 12% growth in the United States and Europe, respectively. International sales were also up 11% year over year. These encouraging numbers were driven by continued market share growth for both Triumeq (sales up 20%) and Tivicay (sales up 24%). However, sales of another HIV drug Epzicom/Kivexa tumbled 52% due to a more severe generic competition, particularly affecting the European market.Notably, the company’s latest product from the HIV portfolio is Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine), the first two-drug regimen, once-daily, single pill for HIV. The drug was approved in the United States last November and generated first quarterly sales of £10 million compared with £5 million registered in the previous quarter.However, last November, Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) triple combination, once-daily single tablet regimen, Biktarvy (bictegravir /emtricitabine /tenofovir alafenamide), was approved by the FDA for HIV-1 infection treatment. This nod from the regulatory agency might pose a competitive threat to Juluca in the future quarters.Respiratory sales were flat at CER year over year. Though in the International markets, sales increased 6%, the metric declined 4% and 1% in the United States and Europe, respectively, during the quarter under review. The sales rise from the Ellipta portfolio and Nucala, were offset by a fall in sales of older products like Seretide/Advair and Ventolin.Sales of new respiratory portfolio grew at 42%, including the first quarterly contribution from the newly launched Trelegy Ellipta.Trelegy Ellipta (only once-daily single inhaler triple therapy for COPD) yielded sales of £10 million in the United States and £1 million in the EU during the first quarter.Notably, in April, GSK announced that Trelegy Ellipta gained the FDA approval for an expanded indication. The new indication is for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema.The Ellipta products recorded a 34% surge in sales, driven by market share gains with the global roll-out continuing. However, this upside was offset by weak sales of Seretide/Advair (down 20%). Ventolin sales dropped 9% year over year.Immuno-inflammation drugs like Benlysta rose 21% in the quarter under discussion.The new grouping of Established Pharmaceuticals comprises the previous Established Products, Cardiovascular, metabolic and urology plus other Pharma products. Established Pharmaceuticals sales decreased 5% in the quarter under review.Sales in the Consumer Healthcare segment nudged up 2% despite a slowdown in market conditions. The power brands, particularly in Pain relief and Oral health categories, saw a sturdy performance in the quarter.Sales from the Vaccines segment were impressive, having increased 13% year over year, primarily driven by sales of the newly launched Shingrix vaccine (prevention of shingles) in the United States. Shingrix recorded sales of £110 million in the reported quarter, driven by a favorable recommendation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices over Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zostavax.Moreover, the company stated that it is rapidly building a coverage for Shingrix vaccine. Presently, more than 90% patients has access to the vaccine via both Medicare and commercial channels.It is important to note that Shingrix was approved in the EU as well as in Japan last month for the given indication.In the United States, Vaccine sales soared 50% while in Europe and the international markets, the metric decreased 3% and 6%, respectively. Sales of the meningitis vaccine Bexsero increased 26% in the United States and 7% in the Europe market. While Menveo in the United States posted higher sales, the same was offset by a soft performance of the Established Vaccines, thanks to fierce competitive pressures on Infanrix and Pediarix in Europe.2018 OutlookThe company continues to expect 4-7% EPS growth at CER in 2018, if no Advair generics are launched further this year.However, in the probable event of Advair generics being introduced in the U.S. market by mid-2018, Glaxo anticipates its adjusted EPS to be flat to down 3% year over year at CER.The three companies, namely Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report), Hikma Pharmaceuticals and Novartis, trying to bring a generic version of Advair to the market have received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA. While Mylan and Hikma got a CRL last year, Novartis was forwarded the same this year, delaying the entry of generics in the U.S. market.GlaxoSmithKline plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise GlaxoSmithKline plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | GlaxoSmithKline plc Quote Zacks RankGlaxo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3412,GILD,"Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter results on May 1, after the market closes. Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Gilead Sciences, Inc. Quote Gilead, a leader in the hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) space, has a decent track record, with the company’s earnings beating estimates in three of the last four while missing in one. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings beat expectations by 4.7%. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 7.5%.   Gilead’s stock has rallied 10.5% over a year outperforming the industry's decline of 10.8%.Why A Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that Gilead is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates which is what the case is here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Gilead is +0.32%.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayConcurrent with the fourth-quarter earnings call, Gilead provided guidance for 2018. Gilead now expects net product sales in the range of $20-$21 billion.Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (“TAF”) based products — Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the first quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch. The TAF-based regimens now represent 62% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume. Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting also put up a strong performance as the company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with approximately 153,000 patients using Truvada by the end of 2017. Moreover, the franchise received a further boost with the FDA approval of once-daily single tablet regimen (“STR”), Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25mg, BIC/FTC/TAF) for HIV-1 infection in February 2018. Hence, sales should get a further boost.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Genvoya is $1074 million. However, Gilead lost exclusivity for Viread in some countries outside the United States which might impact sales.On the other hand, the HCV franchise continues to be under competitive and pricing pressure leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales. Harvoni and Sovaldi has been facing competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others.  The franchise suffered a significant plunge in sales due to new competition and fewer patient starts.  Both pricing and market share are expected to stabilize by mid-2018 while patient starts are expected to decline further. HCV revenues are projected to decline further and will constitute a smaller portion of the top-line going forward.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of lead HCV drug Sovaldi and Harvoni are $98 million and $466 million, respectively.Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are projected in the range of $3.4-$3.6 billion and $3.4-$3.6 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 85-87%.Meanwhile, the Kite acquisition was a step in the right direction with the FDA approval of its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. However, management stated that Yescarta launch will be a controlled launch to ensure patient safety as CAR-T therapy is complicated and can sometimes be associated with severe side effects.Gilead is also looking to build up a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis franchise. We expect the management to throw more light on the same during the first-quarter’s call. Investors are also likely to keep an eye on other pipeline updates.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.GW Pharmaceuticals plc (GWPH  -  Free Report) is expected to report earnings on May 8.

3413,GILD,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3.35 % in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is GILD due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Gilead’s HCV Sales Weak, Earnings BeatGilead reported fourth-quarter 2017 results wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations. However, management issued a bleak view for 2018.The company’s fourth-quarter earnings of $1.78 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.70. However, earnings were below the year-ago quarter figure of $2.70 per share.Moreover, total revenues of $5.9 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.8 billion. However, revenues declined 18.7% year over year.Harvoni & Sovaldi Plunge FurtherProduct sales came in at $5.8 billion, down 19.1% year over year. The decline was due to lower HCV sales, partially offset by higher sales across HIV and other therapeutic areas.Antiviral product sales, which include Gilead's HIV and liver disease portfolio, came in at $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 21.2%.HCV product sales, which include Harvoni, Sovaldi, Epclusa and Vosevi, were $1.5 billion, down from $3.2 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was mainly attributed to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets.Sales of Harvoni declined 60.7% year over year to $644 million in the quarter. Further, Sovaldi sales recorded a steep year-over-year decline of 78.4% to $117 million.Epclusa garnered sales of $565 million in the quarter, down from the year-ago figure of $1.0 billion.Meanwhile, HIV and HBV product sales came in at $3.7 billion, up 8.8% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by continuous strong uptake of tenofoviral afenamide (TAF)-based products such as Genvoya, which generated sales of $1,060 million, up from $563 million in the year-ago quarter, Descovy, which recorded sales of $365 million, up from $149 million, and Odefsey, which registered sales of $325 million, up from $155 million. HIV treatments like Stribild and Complera/Eviplera sales declined 42.6% and 25.2% respectively. Viread sales were down at $212 million, down 34.6%.Atripla sales tanked 27.5% to $440 million, while Truvada sales fell 8.2% to $797 million.Other products like Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig recorded sales of $233 million (up 3.1%), $200 million (down 4.7%), $90 million (down 4.4%) and $39 million, respectively.Research & development (R&D) expenses declined 11.9% to $845 million due to the 2016 impact of ongoing milestone payments. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased 1.6% to $923 million.

3414,GILD,"We expect Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) to surpass expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on May 4, before the market opens. Last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 9.70%.Shares of Agios have soared 67.7% in a year’s time, comparing favorably with the industry’s increase of 12.5%. The company’s earnings track record shows mixed results with the company having outpaced estimates twice in the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other two. Overall, Agios came up with an average negative surprise of 1.34%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayAgios’ only marketed drug is Idhifa (enasidenib), which received an FDA approval last August for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) having an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation. Per the last report, the drug generated strong sales and we expect encouraging revenues in the first quarter as well.Moreover, Agios’ progress with the pipeline has been quite impressive. In fact, investors’ focus will remain on the same in the to-be-reported quarter. Two interesting candidates in the company’s cancer portfolio are IDH1 mutant inhibitor, AG-120 (ivosidenib) and a pan-IDH mutant inhibitor, AG-881.Ivosidenib is under priority review in the United States for treating patients with R/R AML with an IDH1 mutation. An approval for ivosidenib is expected in the third quarter of 2018. Additionally, the company anticipates a regulatory filing for the candidate in the EU during the fourth quarter of 2018 for the same indication.Ivosidenib is also being evaluated in phase I study for addressing advanced hematologic malignancies and combined with Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Vidaza, it is under assessment in phase I/II, for the cure of newly diagnosed AML patients, who are not eligible for an intensive chemotherapy.Meanwhile, Agios is conducting phase I programs on AG-881 for treating patients with advanced IDH1 or IDH2 mutant-positive solid tumors including glioma. In the second half of 2017, the company announced positive findings from the study.Notably, the company also plans to initiate a perioperative window trial to analyze ivosidenib and AG-881 in low grade glioma for investigating the effects on brain tumor tissue in the first half of 2018.The company has another interesting candidate in its portfolio. Its lead rare genetic diseases candidate, AG-348, is under evaluation in a phase II trial on adult, transfusion-independent patients with Pyruvate kinase deficiency. Agios reported positive data from the program in June 2017. The FDA granted a fast track designation to the candidate for the given indication. As the RGD market still remains unexplored, newer therapies in this area hold huge potential.Nonetheless, this March, Agios announced commencement of a phase I study, evaluating its first-in-class methionine adenosyltransferase 2a (MAT2A) inhibitor, AG-270, for patients with solid tumors or lymphoma with deletion of the MTAP. We expect management to produce an update on the same in first-quarter earnings release.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Agios is likely to beat on earnings this reporting cycle because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Agios has an Earnings ESP of +1.72%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate (loss of $1.57 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (loss of $1.60). A positive ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Agios has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and together with a positive ESP, chances of an earnings beat in the stock’s upcoming release are pegged higher.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

3415,GILD,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced encouraging 48-weeks results from a phase III study (Study 1961) among 470 virologically suppressed adult women with HIV infection at the International Workshop on HIV and Women and at the 2018 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (“CROI”) in Boston (Poster 2539).The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of switching from a boosted protease inhibitor (bPI) or boosted elvitegravir-containing regimen to Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25mg), a once-daily single tablet regimen (“STR”).    Biktarvy was found to be statistically non-inferior to regimens containing a bPI or boosted elvitegravir and demonstrated no treatment-emergent resistance at 48 weeks in the ongoing study.The study data showed that women who switched to Biktarvy maintained high levels of viral suppression, comparable to those who remained on a baseline regimen of either Genvoya, Stribild or ATV+RTV+FTC/TDF. Moreover, none of the participants on Biktarvy developed treatment-emergent resistance.Biktarvy, Gilead’s latest triple therapy, was approved by the FDA in February 2018 as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults who have no antiretroviral treatment history or to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen for at least three months with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of Biktarvy.Meanwhile, the HIV franchise continues to gain traction on the back of rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens in the United States and EU. The TAF-based regimens now represent 62% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya along with Odefsey and Descovy in 2016.A marketing authorization application for Biktarvy is under review in the European Union. Meanwhile, additional clinical trials of Biktarvy are ongoing, including a study in adolescents and children with HIV. The approval of this new HIV therapy will pose stiff competition to GlaxoSmith’s (GSK  -  Free Report) existing therapies, Tivicay and Triumeq.  Gilead’s stock has lost 4.8% in the last six months compared with the industry's  decline of 9.8%.Gilead is banking on its HIV franchise which has been under tremendous pressure for a while due to lower patient starts and increased competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) therapies.Zacks Rank & Key PickGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the health care sector is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Regeneron’s earnings per share estimates have moved up from $17.13 to $18.65 and from $20.37 to $21.56 for 2018 and 2019, respectively in the last 30 days. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 9.15%.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3416,GILD,"The NASH or the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis space is back in focus as Israel-based Galmed Pharmaceuticals (GLMD  -  Free Report) reported positive data on its candidate, Aramchol. The candidate demonstrated statistically significant reduction in liver fat at 52 weeks. A larger number of patients treated with Aramchol 600mg showed NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis in the 52-week biopsy.  This encouraging data boosted investor sentiment, leading to the stock’s significant surge.Of late, the NASH space has been under the spotlight given its market potential.  The market for NASH is poised to witness rapid growth unlike other lucrative yet saturated markets like cancer.What is NASH?A chronic liver disease, NASH is caused by excessive fat accumulation in the liver, known as steatosis. Per records, it has affected up to 15 million people in the United Stated and could cause inflammation, hepatocellular injury, progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis. The ailment is anticipated to be the leading reason behind liver transplantation by 2020. Currently, NASH induces the biggest basis for liver transplants in people under 50 in the United States. Such patients also suffer obesity and type II diabetes.With no treatments currently approved to address this disease, the market opportunity is substantially huge and many companies are investing a major chunk of their R&D spend in the same.Let us consider the companies with potential candidates presently being evaluated for the treatment of NASH.5 Stocks With Promising NASH Candidates in Their PipelineMadrigal Pharmaceuticals (MDGL  -  Free Report): Shares of Madrigal Pharmaceuticals soared last month after the company reported positive top-line, 36-week results from a phase II trial on patients with biopsy-proven NASH. The program evaluated the lead pipeline candidate, MGL-3196, a first-in-class, oral, once-daily, liver-directed, thyroid hormone receptor (THR) β-selective agonist. Data from the study showed that MGL-3196 achieved higher reduction in NAFLD activity score (NAS) and greater NASH resolution in patients with 30% or more liver fat reduction achievement at week 12. The candidate had met the primary endpoint of 30% or more reduction in liver fat at week 12 last December. The company will advance the candidate to a phase III study following a regulatory agreement on its design.Madrigal’s stock has skyrocketed 303.3% in the last six months, outperforming the industry’s rise of 9.2%. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  Gilead Sciences Inc. ((GILD  -  Free Report)): Biotech bigwig Gilead is also foraying into the emerging NASH domain with its late stage candidate, selonsertib, to combat the persistent decline in its one-time lucrative HCV business. In April 2018, the company announced encouraging data from a proof-of-concept study of experimental combination therapies for patients with advanced fibrosis due to NASH. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibitor, selonsertib, was combined with either the Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitor, GS-0976, or the selective, non-steroidal Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist, GS-9674, as therapies. Gilead’s NASH pipeline includes selonsertib, GS-9674 and GS-0976, alone and in combination with one other. Favorable results suggest that the combination therapy with selonsertib and either GS-0976 or GS-9674 can be evaluated further in patients with NASH and F3 and F4 fibrosis. Gilead’s stock has lost 3.5% in the last six months compared with the industry's decline of 6.2%. Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ICPT  -  Free Report): Intercept is another company, pumping its resources into the NASH space. The company is evaluating its lead candidate, obeticholic acid (OCA), for treating NASH. OCA achieved the primary endpoint in a phase IIb trial (FLINT). Currently, a phase III study, REGENERATE, among non-cirrhotic NASH patients with liver fibrosis is ongoing. Top-line results from its interim analysis are expected in the first half of 2019. Intercept also initiated a phase III trial, REVERSE, on OCA.  The randomized phase III study will examine the efficacy and safety of OCA on subjects with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH in approximately 540 patients with a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of cirrhosis. Intercept expects to submit marketing authorization for OCA as a treatment option for NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis in the United States and international markets on the basis of the positive results from the study. A subsequent outcome trial is also in the cards to confirm the clinical benefit on a post-marketing basis across a broader population of NASH patients with cirrhosis. OCA is already approved as Ocaliva in combination with ursodeoxycholic (UDCA) for the therapy of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as a monotherapy in adults unable to recuperate with UDCA.Intercept’s stock has surged 32.6% over a year versus the industry's decline of 6.2%. Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CNAT  -  Free Report): Conatus also has a promising NASH candidate in its pipeline. The company is developing emricasan, a first-in-class, orally active pan-caspase protease inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with chronic liver disease. Conatus currently has three ongoing studies, namely ENCORE-PH, ENCORE-NF and ENCORE-LF, evaluating emricasan for NASH patients. The company has a collaboration agreement with Swiss major Novartis for the global development and commercialization of products containing emricasan either as a single active ingredient or in combination with other Novartis compounds for liver cirrhosis or liver fibrosis. Although emricasan failed in a phase IIB study — POLT-HCV-SVR — when it did not achieve the primary endpoint in patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis undergoing liver transplant, investors will still keenly follow data from multiple NASH studies.  Data from the ongoing trials are likely to be received by this year-end and 2019. A positive outcome will surely boost growth prospects for the company.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Conatus’ stock has rallied 25.7% in the last six months, outperforming the 11.3% increase recorded by the industry.  Galectin Therapeutics Inc. (GALT  -  Free Report) is another company with a late stage NASH candidate, GR-MD-02. The candidate is a carbohydrate-based drug inhibiting the galectin-3 protein, directly involved in multiple inflammatory, fibrotic and malignant diseases. The lead development program is in NASH with cirrhosis, the most advanced form of NASH related fibrosis. In May, the company announced that it will initiate a phase III trial with its galectin-3 inhibitor GR-MD-02 in NASH cirrhosis, incorporating advice and guidance obtained from a meeting with the FDA.  The target population of the trial comprises patients with NASH cirrhosis without esophageal varices.Galectin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its stock has gained by a staggering 227.2% in the last six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 9.4%. Bottom LineRiding high on the vast market potential, other big multiple pharma and biotech companies too produce pipeline candidates for the treatment of NASH. Hence, we expect a lot of activity in this specific space going forward. A potential approval of any drug for NASH will attract more players.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

3417,GILD," (0:15) - Drug Stocks: Value Traps or Opportunity? (1:30) - Tracey’s Top Stock Picks(11:45) - Health Service Industry(14:20) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome to Episode #96 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.Recently, investors on Stocktwits and Twitter have been asking about some of the drug stocks.If you look at the valuations, you can see why.Many are dirt cheap, with some trading with single digit P/Es.Problem is, the Street hates them (which makes them perfect for value investors.)Retail and energy stocks were hated over the last several years too but have staged big turnarounds in 2018.Will the drug stocks be the next big turnaround success story?Definition of a Value TrapRemember, a value trap is a stock that looks cheap based on basic value fundamentals like the P/E ratio.Who doesn’t like a company trading at 5x earnings?But sometimes there’s a reason for the cheapness. Investors have to look beyond the value fundamentals at earnings.Are they rising or falling?Rising earnings with a low P/E tells you that something right is going on at a company. But an earnings decline can be a sign that the company has lost its way.Value Stock or a Trap?1.       Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) has a forward P/E of just 11.8. Shares are down 13.3% over the last 2 years while the S&P 500 has gained 34.5% in that time. What are the earnings expected to do in 2018?2.       Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) is trading with a forward P/E of 12.9. Year-to-date, the shares are down 8.4% but they’ve gained 28.5% over the prior 2 years. Estimates for 2018 have been cut in the last 60 days, but is there earnings growth?3.       Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) has taken a beating this year with shares falling 27% year-to-date. It’s now trading with a forward P/E of just 9.2. That’s cheap. But is it a trap?4.       Lannett (LCI  -  Free Report) is the cheapest among this group. It has a forward P/E of only 5.3. Should you take a chance? Shares are down 31% year-to-date and have fallen 35% the prior 2 years.5.       Valeant (VRX  -  Free Report) has had its problems the last few years but the shares have rebounded in 2018 and are up 22% compared to the S&P’s return of 3.4%. It’s also cheap, with a forward P/E of just 8. Is this the bottom of the earnings decline?There are lots of categories in the healthcare sector including the insurers, hospitals, device manufacturers, staffing and others.But the drug companies have been hit especially hard.Just because they’re cheap, however, doesn’t mean they’re a good buy. Investors need to do their homework.Value stock or a trap?Find out on this week’s podcast.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3418,GILD,"Shares of Israel-based Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (GLMD  -  Free Report) soared 149.5% after the company announced positive top-line results on its lead candidate, Aramchol, for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) at 52 weeks.Consequent of this gain, Galmed shares have gained 94.5% in the last six months compared with the industry’s growth of 8.0%. Shares are up in pre-market trading as well. Patients enrolled in the phase IIb study, ARREST, underwent Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and biopsy at baseline and week 52. Patients with biopsy-proven NASH, who were overweight or obese and had pre-diabetes or type II diabetes mellitus, were randomized in a ratio of 2:2:1 (600mg, 400mg and placebo).The primary endpoint of the study was the change from baseline to end of study, in liver triglycerides ratio as measured by MRS (Aramchol 600mg compared to placebo).A statistically significant reduction in liver fat was demonstrated by MRS, in patients who had completed 52 weeks of treatment with Aramchol 400mg as compared to placebo. In addition to this, the post hoc analysis of MRS responders (defined by a reduction of ≥5% absolute change from baseline) also demonstrated a clinically and statistically significant effect of Aramchol 600mg compared to placebo.Moreover, a larger number of patients treated with Aramchol 600mg showed NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis in the 52-week biopsy. Aramchol 600 mg also resulted in at least one-point improvement in fibrosis score without worsening of NASH, in a higher proportion of patients, as compared to placebo.Further, statistically significant reductions in live enzymes alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) were also seen in both Aramchol arms as compared to placebo (p≤0.0002) and (p≤0.001), respectively.These results indicate that Aramchol 400mg is probably sufficient for fat reduction but, biologically, a higher dose is needed for achieving more stringent histological endpoints, such as NASH resolution and fibrosis reversal. The data strongly support advancing Aramchol 600mg to phase III.Per estimates, NASH impacts approximately 3-5% of people in the United States and approximately 2-4% globally. NASH is also one of the fastest growing causes of liver cancer and liver transplant in the United States, due to the rise in obesity.Hence, the successful development and commercialization of Aramchol will be a significant boost for the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Galmed, given its potential in the market.Other companies like Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report), Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT  -  Free Report) and Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) also have promising NASH candidates in their pipelines.Zacks RankGalmed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3419,GILD,"There is no approved therapy that can completely cure autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. The development of new treatment technologies is ongoing. Meanwhile, it is difficult to control autoimmune diseases in the majority of patients. The newest class of medications to treat these diseases is janus kinase (“JAK”) inhibitors, which are providing patients a better treatment option. This class of therapies has generated significant interest due to their better efficacy compared to tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) inhibitor therapies.Autoimmune DiseasesIn patients with autoimmune diseases, the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the healthy cells. Scientists are yet to find the reason behind this abnormality. However, the incidence of autoimmune diseases is on the rise. There are multiple types of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”), psoriasis, multiple sclerosis (“MS”), inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”), etc. Several companies are dedicated to bringing better drugs for the treatment of these diseases. The symptoms include fatigue, muscle aches, swelling, and redness in the affected body parts.The most common and first-line treatment for autoimmune disease is disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), especially methotrexate. Apart from methotrexate, there are several classes of DMARDs including TNF inhibitor therapies approved for these diseases that are performing well. AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel are blockbuster TNF inhibitor drugs among others. However, these treatments have serious safety issues which include increased risk tuberculosis and lymphoma among others.JAK InhibitorsSeveral pharma companies are developing JAK inhibitors, which work by blocking a particular signal of a body’s immune response, cytokines, instead of suppressing the immune system as done by DMARDs. Patients treated with JAK-inhibitors in clinical studies have shown faster and better response to the disease. However, the safety concern still looms large. The segment is attractive for companies as there are only two JAK inhibitors, presently approved for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, especially RA. However, several companies are developing their candidates, which is likely to increase competition going forward.The segment was in news recently as Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Olumiant, a JAK inhibitor, received approval in the United States and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced top-line data from a late-stage study evaluating its JAK inhibitor candidate,upadacitinib.4 Pharma/Biotech Companies in FocusGiven the growing interest in JAK inhibitors, let’s take a look at some pharma and biotech companies that are looking to change the way autoimmune diseases are treated.Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xeljanz (tofacitinib) is the first approved JAK-inhibitor in the United States for the treatment of RA. It has been available in the market since 2012. The drug is also approved for psoriatic arthritis. It generated sales of $326 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 30.4% year over year. A regulatory application seeking line extension of the drug in ulcerative colitis was approved late last month in the United States. Regulatory applications seeking approval in the above three indications are under review in Europe.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Eli Lilly’s JAK-inhibitor, Olumiant (baricitinib), is the second drug to receive approval for treating RA in the United States. The drug was approved early this month. However, it was launched in certain European countries in 2017. We note that the FDA rejected the company’s new drug application seeking approval of Olumiant in April 2017 citing safety concerns. Lilly develops and commercializes the drug in partnership with Incyte Corporation. The drug generated sales of $32.2 million in the first quarter, sequentially up 40%. Lilly is currently evaluating the drug in another autoimmune indication, atopic dermatitis (eczema), in a late-stage study.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).AbbVie is another company, which is focused on developing JAK inhibitor based treatments. The company’s JAK inhibitor, upadacitinib, showed promising results in late-stage studies evaluating the candidate in RA patients. It is also being developed for atopic dermatitis in a late-stage study for which it enjoys breakthrough therapy status in the United States. Another late-stage study is evaluating the candidate in Crohn’s disease.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Galapagos NV (GLPG  -  Free Report) is developing its JAK inhibitor candidate, filgotinib, in collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report). Separate late-stage studies are evaluating the candidate in RA, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Moreover, several mid-stage studies are evaluating the candidate in multiple autoimmune indications including ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and cutaneous lupus erythematosus among others. Data from a mid-stageI study evaluating filgotinib in psoriatic arthritis showed significant improvement in patients.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Prospects of JAK Inhibitors With several blockbuster DMARDs nearing patent expiration, this new class of drugs holds potential to replace the existing treatments. This boosts the prospects of the companies that have these drugs/candidates in their pipeline or commercial portfolio.However, JAK inhibitors also have several side effects, which may delay their approval. We note that a lower dose of Lilly’s Olumiant was approved along with a boxed warning stating risk of serious infections, malignancies and thrombosis.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

3420,GILD,"Agenus Inc. (AGEN  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 on May 3.In the last reported quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 25%. In the last four quarters the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 7.44%.Notably, Agenus’ shares have outperformed the industry over a year. The stock has rallied 10.4%, as against the industry’s fall of 8.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayAgenus’ collaboration agreements with several companies, not only help it to procure funds in the form of upfront and milestone payments and future royalties but also validate its proprietary product platform. Agenus has collaborated with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Incyte to discover and develop multiple checkpoint antibodies. Under the Incyte collaboration, Agenus is evaluating the latter’s anti-GITR checkpoint antibody — INCAGN1876 — in a phase I/II study, its anti-OX40 agonist antibody — INCAGN1949 — in a phase I/II study and its anti-CTLA-4 antibody — AGEN1884 — in a phase II study. All three candidates are being evaluated for the treatment of solid tumors. In January 2018, the company announced the launch of its combination phase I/II study with AGEN1884 and anti-PD1 (AGEN2034) antibodies. Agenus has no approved product in its portfolio. With only a few candidates in mid-stages of development, including Prophage Series vaccine, the company is still a few years away from bringing a product to market. Any hiccup in the development process of these candidates may weigh on the stock.In October 2017, Agenus established a separate business entity to advance its cell therapy program which is designed to be self-funded. The cell therapy company, AgenTus, will focus on the discovery, development, and commercialization of breakthrough “living drugs” to advance cures for cancer patients. The company took this decision to form smaller teams that can entirely focus on getting the products approved. The company expects the combined value of the separate companies to exceed the perceived value under one roof.In the first quarter the company will focus on its pipeline candidates and provide updates on them.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not show an earnings beat for Agenus this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Agenus has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 28 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Agenus has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which decreases the predictive power of ESP.

3421,GILD,"Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ICPT  -  Free Report) reported disappointing results for fourth-quarter 2017 on account of drab Ocaliva sales. The company reported a loss of $4.43 per share in the fourth quarter, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.57 but narrower than the year-ago loss of $4.84.Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Quote Quarterly revenues were $37.7 million, up significantly from $13.8 million in the year-ago quarter but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.3 million.Quarter in DetailIn fourth-quarter 2017 Ocaliva recorded $37.3 million of sales, down from $40.9 million recorded in third-quarter 2017. Revenues from international markets were $5.3 million. Ocaliva was approved in the United States, in combination with ursodeoxycholic (“UDCA”) for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (“PBC”) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults who are unable to endure UDCA in 2016. The drug was also granted conditional approval by the European Commission.Sales from the United States markets came in at $32.0 million, down from $36.2 million recorded in the third quarter as prescriptions continue to grow.Research and development expenses increased 6.8% year over year to $57.5 million primarily driven by increases in clinical development programs for Obeticholic acid (“OCA”) and infrastructure to support such programs.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $84.3 million, up from $73.9 million in the year-ago quarter.2017 ResultsSales came in at $130.9 million in 2017, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $132.4 million. Ocaliva sales came in at $129.2 million in 2017. Loss per share came in at $14.38, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.52.2018 OutlookIntercept expects operating expenses in the range of $390-$410 million in 2018. The company believes that continued commercialization of Ocaliva in PBC in the United States and other markets. Pipeline UpdateOCA is being evaluated for other indications including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (“PSC”).The FDA has earlier approved a redesign of the phase III trial, REGENERATE on OCA for the safety and efficacy in treating NASH patients with liver fibrosis. The company now needs to achieve only one co primary endpoint, either fibrosis improvement or NASH resolution as compared with the earlier target of achieving both. Enrolment of the interim analysis cohort was completed in the trial and results are expected in the first half of 2019.Earlier in the month, Intercept initiated a phase III trial, REVERSE, on OCA. The randomized phase III study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of OCA, in subjects with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH in approximately 540 patients with a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of cirrhosis. The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage of subjects with histological improvement in fibrosis by at least one stage using the NASH Clinical Research Network (“CRN”) scoring system after 12 months of treatment. Patients enrolled in the trial are being randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment arms — once-daily dosing of OCA 10 mg, once-daily OCA 10 mg with titration to 25 mg at three months, or placebo. The patients who successfully complete the double-blind phase of REVERSE will be enrolled in an open-label extension phase for up to 12 additional months.Intercept expects to submit marketing authorization for OCA as a treatment option for NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis, in the United States and international markets based on the positive results from the study. A subsequent outcome trial is also in the cards to confirm the clinical benefit on a post-marketing basis in a broader population of NASH patients with cirrhosis.The company also announced an updated label for Ocaliva in the United States, reinforcing appropriate dosing in PBC patients with Child-P Class B or C or decompensated cirrhosis.Our TakeIntercept’s fourth-quarter results missed expectations as sales of Ocalive declined due to safety issues reported earlier. While the updated label should help the stock turn around, it might be a while before the sales start to recover. First-quarter 2018 is expected to be a transitional quarter.  Intercept’s stock has tumbled 57.8% over a year compared with the industry’s decline of 2.5%.  The company’s stock has been bearing the brunt of the safety guidelines issued regarding the approved drug Ocaliva.Given the challenges faced by the drug in recent times, the label expansion of OCA will boost the growth prospects.Per estimates, NASH is expected to surpass hepatitis C as the leading reason for liver transplants in the United States and Europe. NASH market has huge potential and a tentative approval will boost Ocaliva’s prospects.  However, bigwigs like Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) and Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) have FXR agonists in phase II or earlier stages of clinical or preclinical development that can be used to treat PBC, NASH and the other liver diseases.Zacks Rank & Key PickIntercept currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Exelixis (EXEL  -  Free Report) which currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Exelixis’ earnings per share estimates increased from 72 cents to 77 cents for 2018 over the last 60 days.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

3422,GILD,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announced that it will acquire Impact Biomedicines for an upfront amount of $1.1 billion.Per the terms of agreement, Impact Biomedicines’ shareholders will receive contingent payments based on regulatory approval and sales-based milestones. The maximum aggregate amount payable for such milestone payments is $1.4 billion.  The aggregate tiered sales-based milestone payments could total to a maximum of $4.5 billion if global annual net sales exceed $5.0 billion.The acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to Celgene’s pipeline.  The candidate is being developed for the treatment of myelofibrosis (MF) and polycythemia vera. Fedratinib demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the primary and secondary endpoints of splenic response and total symptom score, respectively in a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III pivotal trial (JAKARTA-1) for treatment-naïve MF.In addition, a multi-center, single-arm phase II trial (JAKARTA-2) evaluated fedratinib in MF patients who were found to be resistant or intolerant to Incyte Corporation’s (INCY  -  Free Report) Jakafi which is another a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor. Fedratinib demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in splenic response and total symptom score in this second-line setting.However, we remind investors that JAKARTA-2 was stopped prematurely as the FDA put a clinical hold on the fedratinib program. The hold was put after potential cases of Wernicke’s encephalopathy were reported in eight out of 877 patients receiving one or more doses (less than one percent of treated patients). The FDA withdrew the clinical hold in August 2017. Based on the reported benefit risk profile of fedratinib from the JAKARTA-1 and JAKARTA-2 clinical trials, regulatory applications in MF are planned beginning the middle of 2018.Celgene was on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions given a lacklustre 2017.Celgene’s stock has declined 20.4% of its value in the last six months compared with the industry’s loss of 1.9%.Celgene suffered a series of setbacks over the last few months. The company suffered a setback last week when a late stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Rituxan failed.The study evaluated Revlimid plus Rituxan (R2) followed by R2 maintenance compared with the standard of care featuring Rituxan plus chemotherapy (R-CHOP, R-bendamustine or R-VN CVP) followed by Rituxan maintenance for previously untreated follicular lymphoma.Celgene’s key growth engine is Revlimid. In 2016, the drug’s worldwide sales increased 20% to $7.0 billion and contributed almost 62.1% of the total revenues. Revlimid, an oral immunomodulatory drug, is currently approved for several indications including MM, myelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma.The failure of the study is disappointing. The drug’s label expansion would have boosted its sales potential.In addition, in October 2017, the company announced a phase III trial, REVOLVE, (CD-002) on pipeline candidate GED-0301 in Crohn’s disease and the extension trial, SUSTAIN (CD-004) were discontinued following a recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee, which assessed overall benefit/risk during a recent interim futility analysis.Meanwhile, the deep, yet persistently slow growth of the psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis markets, especially during the entire third quarter, has led to a weak performance of Otezla. Consequently, the company also reduced its annual guidance. The challenging market conditions were driven by an increasingly restrictive PBM formulary control.On a positive note, in August 2017, the company obtained an FDA approval for Idhifa for treatment of relapsed and/or refractory acute myeloid leukemia with isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutation. The drug was developed in partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc (AGIO  -  Free Report).Big biotechs are looking for strategic acquisitions to bolster their portfolio and pipeline.

3423,GILD,"There is no doubt that 2017 will go down as one of the most remarkable years in the history of U.S. stock trading. The market touched more than 60 daily all-time highs, and the S&P 500 closed higher in every single month for the first time in history. That hot streaked has continued into the first days of the New Year, with our major indexes once again surging to new peaks in 2018.Another trend we have also seen move into 2018 is speculation over major mergers and acquisitions. Total M&A activity was actually relatively quiet in 2017—deals were down about 35% through mid-November—but several Wall Street titans either announced major deals or found themselves at the center of deal-related rumors throughout the year.From industry-shifting moves like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) buyout of Whole Foods and CVS Health’s (CVS  -  Free Report) tie-up with Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), to future-focused acquisitions like Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) purchase of CAR-T researcher Kite Pharma and Intel’s INTC deal to buy computer vision firm Mobileye, 2017 had plenty of huge M&A headlines to soak in (also read: 15 of the Best Mergers & Acquisitions of 2017).And so far in 2018, the headlines have continued. The entertainment industry is still reacting to Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) acquisition of several major 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets, and giants like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) have already caused the rumor mill to swirl.With this in mind, let’s take a look a three huge M&A deals that might happen this year:1.       Apple (Finally) Buying NetflixPeople have been arguing that Apple should use its massive cash pile to make a major media acquisition for years now, and video streaming giant Netflix is typically the first choice among speculators.But Apple has defied these speculators time and time again, opting instead to invest in itself. Indeed, the company recently promised $1 billion to its Apple Music division for the purposes of building out original video content, and its first in-house produced shows are starting to debut now.However, the GOP’s tax reform bill, which includes a one-time allowance for companies to repatriate overseas cash, could be the catalyst needed to inspire a major Apple deal.Earlier this week, shares of Netflix surged after a note on this very topic from Citigroup analysts emerged. The firm’s Jim Suva and Asiya Merchant wrote that Apple is gearing up to make a major acquisition of a car company, video game company, or entertainment company. The analysts suggested that there is as high as a 40% likelihood of Apple acquiring Netflix soon.But is Apple even interested in the company, or will its attention turn elsewhere? 2.       Amazon Targets… Target?As if Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods was not enough to satisfy the retail deal rumors, the latest batch of industry whispers point to the e-commerce king going after big-box retailer Target (TGT  -  Free Report).The rumors were sparked by Loup Venture co-founder Gene Munster, who recently published a report highlighting eight predictions for the technology industry this year.“Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count,” Munster argued. “Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy.”Amazon burned a lot of its cash with its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017, but if the financials work out, Target certainly makes sense within the context of the online retailer’s ongoing war with Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, another brick-and-mortar acquisition could be a lofty move for the e-commerce company, especially considering how fresh the Whole Foods deal is. Can the internet giant really adapt to traditional retail that quickly? 3.       Time Warner and Comcast Snatch HuluAs mentioned, the entertainment industry is still figuring out what to do next after Disney decided to shell out more than $50 billion in stock for many of Fox’s most important assets. Disney has certainly beefed up the library for its upcoming streaming services, and ESPN’s grasp on the sports world is even tighter with the acquisition of Fox Sports Regional Networks.But one thing that remains unclear is the fate of Hulu, a budding video streaming platform co-owned by Fox, Disney, Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), and Time Warner . Disney bought Fox’s 30% stake in the brand, giving it a controlling 60% stake, but it is unlikely that Comcast and Time Warner will give up on the promising streaming platform just yet.Comcast still owns 30% of Hulu, and through its NBCUniversal subsidiary, it could certainly whip up a Hulu-NBC-Universal streaming service that could compete with Disney and Netflix. Teaming up with Time Warner and its HBO division could add even more firing power.Of course, we have yet to see any indication that Disney is looking to shed its new controlling stake in Hulu, but one would imagine that it could become a bargaining tool in what is sure to be a complicated regulatory approval process.With Netflix, Disney, and Amazon poised to be video streaming leaders in five years’ time, might Comcast and Time Warner look to toss a fourth hat into the ring? Want more stock market analysis from this author?

3424,GILD,"Per the latest Earnings Preview, the Q1 earnings season which has already crossed the half way mark is gaining strength with earnings and revenue growth on track to reach its highest level in seven years.Total earnings for the 267 S&P 500 members that have already reported results are up 25.1% from the same period last year on 10% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating top-line estimates and 73.8% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of companies beating both earnings and revenue estimates is 61.4%.The ongoing earnings season seems to have started off on a solid note for the Drug/Biotech sector. Among the major large cap players that have reported results, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings as well as sales.Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) also surpassed both earnings and revenue expectations this quarter.Higher demand is expected to boost new product sales. Also, innovation and successful product line expansion along with positive clinical study results, FDA approvals, and consistent performance of key products, growing demand for drugs, especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an ageing population as well as an increased healthcare expenditure are some of the factors that are expected keep the sector on a growth trajectory.Also, according to the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is likely to record 7% year-over-year growth in revenues and witness a 12.9% rise in earnings in the quarter under review.Four pharma/biotech giants are scheduled to report Q1 earnings results on May 1. Let's see, how things are shaping up for the companies in the upcoming releases.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is slated to releaseresults before the market opens. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.71% in the last reported quarter. The company’s performance has been impressive in the recent past with its earnings surpassing expectations in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.97%.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.  The combination of the company’s Zacks Rank #2 and +1.36 Earnings ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings for the quarter under review is pegged at 74 cents per share.In the Innovative Health segment, new products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain), Chantix (smoking cessation) and Eliquis (blood thinner) are expected to drive the top line. In the Essential Health, biosimilars and emerging markets are expected to support sales.

The consensus mark for the quarter to be reported is pegged at $1.66 per share.The company’s Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (“TAF”) based products — Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the first quarter as well. The franchise received a further boost with the FDA approval of once-daily single tablet regimen (“STR”), Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25mg, BIC/FTC/TAF) for HIV-1 infection in February 2018.

3425,GILD,"Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (KERX  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the market opens.Last quarter the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 44.44%. Keryx’s performance over the last four quarters has been disappointing. The company reported a wider-than-expected loss in the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 25.57%.Keryx’s shares have lost 0.9% year to date, compared with the industry’s 9.9% decline. Factors Influencing This QuarterApart from license fees, Keryx’s top line comprises revenues generated by its only marketed product Auryxia (ferric citrate). Auryxia is used to treat patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis.In November 2017, the FDA granted an approval for an additional indication of Auryxia to treat adults with iron deficiency anemia (“IDA”) and chronic kidney disease, not on dialysis. Moreover, Keryx claims that Auryxia is the only oral treatment option available for this indication. Auryxia is already approved to control serum phosphorus levels in adults with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. With the latest approval, this drug can treat two complications of chronic kidney disease.  It also represents a significant opportunity for physicians to treat their patients at an earlier stage of the disease before their anemia becomes more severe. Hence, the approval should significantly boost Auryxia’s sales.Meanwhile, the company is looking for potential partners to commercialize the drug in the EU. Ferric citrate has been considered as a new active substance by the European Commission. This provides it with 10 years of data and marketing exclusivity in the region.The company also remains focused on creating rapid awareness for the new indication and differentiating Auryxia from existing treatment options along with communicating the favorable insurance access to Auryxia that prescribers and patients can expect to see.Further, the company supports a number of ongoing trials, including several investigator-sponsored clinical studies, and one new phase IV study called COMPASS. The COMPASS study will continue to expand the clinical dataset for Auryxia as a treatment for iron deficiency anemia by studying it in people who haven't been treated previously with low iron and in different dosing regimens such as twice-a-day.However, with Auryxia being the only approved product in Keryx’s portfolio, the company is entirely dependent on Auryxia for growth. What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not show an earnings beat for Keryx this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

3426,GILD,"Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (MDGL  -  Free Report) shares skyrocketed 145% yesterday on encouraging top-line data from a phase II study evaluating its thyroid hormone receptor beta-selective agonist, MGL-3196, in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”). The candidate demonstrated sustained reduction in liver fat of 30% or more over nine months.Madrigal successfully completed the mid-stage study and will advance the candidate to a phase III study following a regulatory agreement on its design.The candidate had met the primary endpoint of 30% or more reduction in liver fat at week 12 in December last year.Shares of the company have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. While the stock has surged 189.4%, the industry has lost 6.5%.Data from the study showed that MGL-3196 achieved higher reduction in NAFLD activity score (“NAS”) and greater NASH resolution in patients who have achieved 30% or more liver fat reduction at week 12. Moreover, 35% of the patients treated with MGL-3169 who had NASH resolution achieved a reduction of 5% or more in NAS compared to zero for placebo. The candidate also resolved fibrosis in half of patients with NASH resolution and led to statistically significant reduction in fibrosis compared to placebo.Mean relative reduction in fat was 37% for MGL-3169 compared to 8.9% for placebo at week 36.Per the press release, NASH is a common form of liver disease which is spreading gradually in the United States. There is no approved treatment for this disease.Moreover, the company believes that the high degree of NASH resolution achieved by the candidate also increases the likelihood of its success in the advanced study. Also, MGL-3169 can resolve NASH in 30-40% patients in just nine months.However, there are several other companies developing their candidates for this indication. Viking Therapeutics, Inc. , which is developing a thyroid receptor beta agonist, VK2809, in a mid-stage study for fatty liver, also gained more than 100% following the strong results of MGL-3169. Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ICPT  -  Free Report) is developing its cholestatic liver drug, Ocaliva, in NASH in a late-stage study. The company’s stock however fell 4.6% as the drug has safety concerns, which may help MGL-3169 to get a lead over Ocaliva.Big players like Gilead Sciences, Inc.

3427,GILD,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) and Galapagos NV (GLPG  -  Free Report) announced that the phase II study, EQUATOR, on pipeline candidate, filgotinib achieved its primary endpoint of improvement in the signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis at Week 16, as assessed by the American College of Rheumatology 20 percent improvement score (ACR20).The EQUATOR trial, initiated by Galapagos in April 2017, is a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the selective JAK1 inhibitor filgotinib in adult patients with moderately to severely active psoriatic arthritis.The data from the study depicted an ACR20 response of 80% for filgotinib versus 33% for placebo. Additionally, the ACR50 and ACR70 responses at Week 16 were also significantly higher for filgotinib than placebo.  Filgotinib was generally well-tolerated in the trial and no new safety signals were observed. However, there was one serious infection in the filgotinib group where a patient who experienced pneumonia with a fatal outcome and one other patient receiving filgotinib developed herpes zoster.Both the companies plan to report the detailed results from the EQUATOR trial at a future scientific conference.Concurrently, Gilead and Galapagos also announced that an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) conducted a planned interim futility analysis of the phase IIb/IIII study, SELECTION, on filgotinib for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. The analysis was conducted after 350 patients completed the induction period in the phase IIb portion of the study. The DMC recommended that the study should go on as planned into phase III at both the 100 mg and 200 mg once daily dose level in biologic-experienced and biologic-naïve patients. The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of the selective JAK1 inhibitor filgotinib in adult patients, with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis was initiated by Gilead in late 2016. Consequently, Gilead will pay $15 million to Galapagos for this progression from phase II to phase III in the SELECTION trial.  The trial will enroll a total of 1,300 patients, targeted to be randomized to receive filgotinib 100 mg, 200 mg, or placebo once-daily administered for 58 weeks. The primary objective of SELECTION is to evaluate the efficacy of filgotinib as compared to placebo in establishing EBS (endoscopy, bleeding, stool) remission at Week 10.Both Galapagos and Gilead entered into a global collaboration for the development and commercialization of filgotinib in inflammatory indications. The candidate is also being evaluated in the ongoing phase III program, FINCH in rheumatoid arthritis, the phase III trial, DIVERSITY for Crohn’s disease (also small bowel and fistulizing Crohn’s disease phase II studies) among others.Given the persistent decline in HCV sales, Gilead is looking to newer avenues to help its top line.  Gilead’s stock has lost 8.2% in the last six months as against the industry''s loss of 8.1%. Gilead’s HCV franchise witnessed slowdown across key markets, including the United States and Europe, reflecting lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi as a result of competitive and pricing pressure. The franchise saw a significant plunge in sales due to new competition and fewer patient starts.  Pricing has largely stabilized and market share will stabilize by mid-2018, while patient starts are expected to decline further. We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa face competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Mayret, and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier among others.Gilead is looking to solidify its presence in the gene therapy space. The initial uptake of Yescarta is also encouraging. Gilead is also intending to foray into the NASH market with pipeline candidates — selonsertib and filgotinib.Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

3428,GILD,"Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ICPT  -  Free Report) initiated a phase III trial, REVERSE, on obeticholic acid (""OCA"").The randomized phase III study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of OCA, in subjects with compensated cirrhosis due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) in approximately 540 patients with a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of cirrhosis.The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage of subjects with histological improvement in fibrosis by at least one stage using the NASH Clinical Research Network (“CRN”) scoring system after 12 months of treatment. Patients enrolled in the trial are being randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment arms — once-daily dosing of OCA 10 mg, once-daily OCA 10 mg with titration to 25 mg at three months, or placebo. The patients who successfully complete the double-blind phase of REVERSE will be enrolled in an open-label extension phase for up to 12 additional months.Intercept expects  to submit marketing authorization for OCA as a treatment option for NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis, in the United States and international markets on the basis of the positive results from the study. A subsequent outcome trial is also in the cards to confirm the clinical benefit on a post-marketing basis in a broader population of NASH patients with cirrhosis.We note that OCA is already approved as Ocaliva in combination with ursodeoxycholic (“UDCA”), for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (“PBC”) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as a monotherapy in adults unable to recuperate with UDCA. The initial uptake of Ocaliva has been encouraging. However, there has been a lot of debates regarding the drug’s safety. Prescription demand softened following the Dear Health Care Provider letter and the FDA safety communication on Ocaliva.Intercept is also evaluating OCA to treat a variety of other non-viral progressive liver diseases such as NASH, primary sclerosing cholangitis and biliary atresia.  Intercept’s stock has lost 47.9% in the last six months compared with the industry’s decline of 5%.  In particular, the company’s shares have plunged significantly due to safety issues regarding the approved drug Ocaliva.The company initiated a phase III study (REGENERATE) on Ocaliva for the treatment of non-cirrhotic NASH in patients with advanced liver fibrosis. Enrollment for the interim analysis cohort in the REGENERATE trial was completed. CONTROL study is being conducted to evaluate the effect of Ocaliva in combination with statin therapy on lipid metabolism in patients with NASH.  Results from AESOP revealed that OCA met the primary endpoint of statistically significant reduction in alkaline phosphatase while results from CONTROL showed that the company achieved its objective in demonstrating that the lowest available dose of atorvastatin rapidly reverses OCA associated LDL changes to below baseline levels in NASH patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis.Given the challenges faced by the drug in recent times, the label expansion of OCA will boost the growth prospects.Per estimates, NASH is expected to surpass hepatitis C as the leading reason for liver transplants in the United States and Europe. NASH market has huge potential and a tentative approval will boost Ocaliva’s prospects.  However, bigwigs like Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) and Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) have FXR agonists in phase II or earlier stages of clinical or preclinical development that can be used to treat PBC, NASH and the other liver diseases.Zacks Rank & Key PickIntercept currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Exelixis (EXEL  -  Free Report) which currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Exelixis’ earnings per share estimates increased from 72 cents to 77 cents for 2018 over the last 60 days.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

In another news, Alexion announced plans to acquire Wilson Therapeutics for $855 million. Thus, the space remained one of the key areas of investors focus.Recap of Important Stories:Alkermes Jumps on FDA Decision:  Following the FDA’s decision to review the NDA for ALKS 5461 for the treatment of major depressive disorder (“MDD”), shares of Alkermes (ALKS  -  Free Report) moved up. The FDA had initially issued a Refusal to File letter on Mar 30 for the candidate stating that the NDA did not have enough evidence for the oral medication to work. The FDA suggested that additional studies might be required to demonstrate the drug’s overall effectiveness for the proposed indication. ALKS 5461, a once-daily oral medication has been developed for the adjunctive treatment of MDD in patients who have not responded well to standard antidepressant therapies. The FDA's acceptance of the ALKS 5461 NDA and rescission of the Refusal to File letter followed productive interactions with the Agency in which Alkermes clarified certain aspects of the NDA submission.

The candidate failed to meet the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (“PFS”) benefit over Roche’s chemotherapy, Xeloda, in the treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancers that overexpress gpNMB. An assessment of the data from the mid-stage study showed that glembatumumab vedotin achieved a PFS of 2.9 months versus 2.8 months for Xeloda.The candidate was also not able to demonstrate significant advantage in key secondary endpoints, including overall response rate, duration of response and overall survival. Following the failure, Celldex has decided to discontinue studies evaluating glembatumumab vedotin across all indications. The company is currently restructuring its pipeline to focus on five candidates in ongoing clinical studies, which includes varlilumab. It may also reduce its workforce.

Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibitor selonsertib was combined with either the Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitor GS-0976 or the selective, non-steroidal Farnesoid X receptor agonist GS-9674 as therapies.  Patients diagnosed with NASH and liver fibrosis stages F2 to F3 based on biopsy, or by magnetic resonance elastography and MRI proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) enrolled in the s tudy. They were treated with either selonsertib 18 mg plus GS-0976 20 mg (n=20), selonsertib 18 mg plus GS-9674 30 mg (n=20), or each monotherapy (n=10 per group) once daily for 12 weeks.Patients treatment the most notable change that were observed was the decrease in liver fat content (measured by MRI-PDFF), which occurred in regimens containing GS-0976. The results also showed improvements in liver biochemistry and/or markers of fibrosis across both combination arms of the study compared to baseline.  Moreover, patients treated with selonsertib plus GS-0976, kinetic labeling showed reduction in the fractional synthesis rate of lumican, a marker of fibrogenesis.Hence, the favorable results suggest that combination therapy with selonsertib and either GS-0976 or GS-9674 can be evaluated further in patients with NASH and F3 and F4 fibrosis.  (Read more:Gilead Presents Encouraging Data on NASH Therapies)PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return  Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 1.82% over the last five trading sessions.

Moreover, the company is also evaluating cabotegravir monotherapy for the prevention of HIV infection in sexually active women.HIV treatments generally are three-drug based regimens. The latest entrant in the market is Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) once-daily single tablet regimen, Biktarvy (bictegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide), approved earlier this month. However, Glaxo is trying to reduce the number of medicines in a HIC treatment regimen without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimenShares of GlaxoSmithKline have underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has lost 9.6% against the industry’s 10.1% rally during the period.The phase III TANGO study will investigate a two-drug regimen for the treatment of HIV. The phase III program is designed to evaluate non-inferior antiviral activity of the combination regimen at 48 weeks compared to continuation of a TAF-based regimen. The study will also evaluate long-term antiviral activity, tolerability and safety of the combination therapy for up to 96 weeks.Glaxo is also evaluating the combination regimen in GEMINI studies in patients with HIV-1 who have received no prior treatment. Data from the GEMINI and TANGO studies are anticipated in 2018.We note that Glaxo’s newest HIV medicine – Juluca is a single tablet containing dolutegravir and J&J’s rilpivirine. Juluca is the first two-drug regimen approved by the FDA.Meanwhile, with several companies interested in developing drugs to treat this life-threatening disease, competition has intensified manifold in the space.GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price | GlaxoSmithKline PLC QuoteZacks RankGlaxoSmithKline carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3432,GILD,"2017 turned out to be a pretty good year for pharma and biotech stocks where FDA decisions are concerned. The regulatory body approved 46 novel drugs last year, easily surpassing 2016’s total tally of 22.Landmark decisions last year include the approval of a couple of gene-based therapies for cancer – Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah and Gilead Sciences’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta. These therapies have the potential to change the way we look at cancer treatments.Other key approvals included Lilly’s Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Many of these drugs have blockbuster potential.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of January.Label Expansion for Synergy’s Trulance? Biopharma company, Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. (SGYP  -  Free Report), will get to know about the approval status of Trulance for use in adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) this month. The regulatory body is expected to deliver a decision regarding Trulance’s label expansion into this indication on Jan 24, 2018. Trulance, the company’s first and only commercial product, was approved last year in January for the treatment of adults with chronic idiopathic constipation (“CIC”). According to information provided by the company, about 33 million adults suffer from CIC while 12 million adults suffer from IBS-C in the United States alone. Synergy’s shares have declined 63.4% over the last one year.Advisory Panel & January PDUFA Date for Aradigm’s Linhaliq: Emerging specialty pharmaceutical company, Aradigm Corporation’s (ARDM  -  Free Report) regulatory application for Linhaliq will be reviewed by an FDA advisory panel (the Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee) on Jan 11, 2018, a few days ahead of the PDUFA (Prescription Drug User Fee Act) goal date of Jan 26, 2018. Aradigm is looking to get Linhaliq approved for the treatment of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (“NCFBE”) patients with chronic lung infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. According to information provided by Aradigm, there is unmet medical need for NCFBE with more than 150,000 people in the United States and over 200,000 people in Europe being affected by the severe, chronic and rare disease. The company expects that sales for the NCFBE indication could cross $500 million by 2021. Aradigm’s shares are up 318.7% over the last one year.FDA to Decide on Pediatric Label Expansion for Sucampo’s Amitiza: Biopharma company, Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. , is awaiting a decision from the FDA for the label expansion of its key marketed drug, Amitiza. The company is looking to get Amitiza approved for use in children aged 6 to 17 years with pediatric functional constipation. With the FDA granting Priority Review designation, a response is expected on Jan 28, 2018. Timely approval would make Amitiza the first branded product available for certain pediatric patients that suffer from pediatric functional constipation. We remind investors that Sucampo recently agreed to be acquired by Mallinckrodt in a deal valued at approximately $1.2 billion. The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018 (Read more: Mallinckrodt to Buy Sucampo for $1.2B to Diversify Portfolio).Sucampo’s shares are up 32.5% over the last one year.Sucampo is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

3433,GILD,"As 2018 fast approaches, we can’t help but look back on the past 12 months, a year that was a whirlwind politically, socially, culturally, and economically.While the U.S. dealt with everything from natural disasters and gun violence to protests about racial inequality and the sexual harassment reckoning, the stock market reached extraordinary highs.The market hit 62 daily all-time highs in 2017, notes CNBC, and the S&P 500 has returned almost 20% so far. And, the top performing sector, technology, which is up around 38% year-to-date, surpassed the worst-performing sectors (energy and telecom) by over 43 percentage points.Even with this overall positive economic sentiment, which has gotten a big boost from the new tax bill, merger and acquisition activity in 2017 has been relatively quiet; deals were down 35% year-to-date through mid-November.The deals that were announced this year, though, were major, and revolved around some of the biggest consumer and technology names. Here are 15 of the best mergers and acquisitions of 2017.1. Amazon Buys Whole FoodsEarlier this summer, e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced that it would be buying high-end organic grocery chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion; the deal officially closed at the end of August. While the acquisition has been off to a rocky start, it gives Amazon hundreds of physical stores and provides the company a strong entryway into the competitive grocery and food industry.2. Intel Acquires MobileyeIntel INTC said in August that it had completed its tender offer for the outstanding shares of Mobileye, a company that develops sensors and cameras for Advanced Driver Assisted Systems (ADAS); the Israel-based company is also known for its computer vision and machine learning technology. The $15.3 billion deal gives Intel a huge advantage in the growing self-driving car industry, a market they estimate will grow to $70 billion annually by 2030.3. United Technologies Buys Rockwell CollinsIn a major industry deal, United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) agreed to buy Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) for roughly $23 billion. This is one of the biggest moves in aviation history, and gives rise to an aerospace giant that will focus on the manufacturing of aircraft parts like touchscreen cockpit displays and jet engines, among many other things. United plans to combine its aerospace business with Rockwell Collins, creating a new unit named Collins Aerospace Systems.4. Disney To Buy Some of 21st Century Fox’s AssetsJust a few weeks ago, Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) and 21st Century Fox FOXA announced a historic $52.4 billion deal that would see Mickey Mouse’s parent scoop up a good chunk of the media conglomerate’s assets, including the film studio 20th Century Fox, the company’s TV production arm 20th Century Fox Television, Fox-owned cable networks (including FX and National Geographic), and FOXA’s stakes in international networks like Star TV and Sky; Disney will also gain majority control of streaming service Hulu. The deal, however, will likely face intense regulatory scrutiny.5. JAB Holdings Acquires PaneraFor $7.5 billion, European investment firm JAB reached a deal to buy bakery-café chain Panera Bread earlier this year, creating a formidable food-focused portfolio that includes Keurig Green Mountain, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Peet’s Coffee & Tea, and Caribou Coffee Company. Additionally, Panera is a restaurant that has managed to post steady comparable sales growth and rising revenue at a time when many chains are hurting.6. Michael Kors Acquires Jimmy Choo“Affordable” luxury retailer Michael Kors KORS agreed to buy footwear brand Jimmy Choo, a popular name in the fashion world known for its towering stilettos, for about $1.2 billion in July. The purchase had been a long-rumored one, and Kors plans on using its own massive global infrastructure to expand Jimmy Choo’s footprint. This likely won’t be Kors’ last acquisition either, as the company is now focused on forming a new, “luxury group.”7. Coach Buys Kate SpadeCoach, now Tapestry Inc. TPR, shook up the fashion industry back in May when the company announced that it would be purchasing its smaller rival, Kate Spade, for $2.4 billion. The deal is both an effort to reach younger consumers—it recently signed a deal with millennial and Instagram icon Selena Gomez—and to rebrand itself as a broader “lifestyle assortment company.”8. CVS Buys AetnaAfter weeks of rumors and speculation, drugstore chain CVS CVS announced that it would acquire insurance provider Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) for $69 billion. The two companies said this blockbuster deal would rein in health care costs and transform CVS’s 9,700 pharmacy storefronts into community medical hubs for primary care and basic procedures. It’s expected to close in the second half of 2018, and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.9. Gilead Acquires Kite PharmaIn October, Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) shelled out $11.9 billion for Kite Pharma, marking its biggest acquisition ever. The deal gives the biopharmaceutical company access to a promising cancer therapy, and hopefully makes it less reliant on antiviral treatments like its Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. In particular, the cancer therapy is a CAR-T drug, which many in the industry believe will transform the cancer treatment market.10. Cisco Acquires BroadSoftIn a move that will grow its software footprint, Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) paid nearly $2 billion for BroadSoft , a company that sells cloud-based call control software, a product that is often re-labeled and sold by traditional telephone companies to their customers. This acquisition is what IT vendors dub “the future of work,” as it uses technology meant to make it easier for workgroups to communicate with each other.11. Apple Buys ShazamRecently, iPhone maker Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) confirmed that it has acquired Shazam for $400 million, a company that lets users identify songs, movies, TV shows, and commercials from short audio clips. The tech giant will be able to use Shazam to boost Apple Music. It also hopes to integrate Shazam more deeply into iOS, and utilize the app’s augmented reality technology to improve its ARKit efforts.12. Arby’s Roark Buys Buffalo Wild WingsJust last month, Arby’s owner Roark Capital Group announced that it would be acquiring chicken wing chain Buffalo Wild Wings BWLD for $2.4 billion. Arby’s has successfully executed a turnaround strategy by specifically emphasizing its unique fast-food menu selection; the firm hopes to apply this similar formula to Buffalo Wild Wings. Arby’s will also assume the debt of BWLD.13. Meredith Corp. Buys Time Inc.The Meredith Corporation MDP closed a $2.8 billion deal in November to buy Time TIME that would create a publishing giant. The Des Moines–based Meredith publishes the magazines Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle, and Shape, among others, while Time owns Time, People, Sports Illustrated, Fortune, Entertainment Weekly, and many other print and digital media properties, and has been in business since 1922.14. Discovery Acquires Scripps Networks InteractiveIn November, Discovery’s (DISCA  -  Free Report) $14.6 billion acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive  received overwhelming shareholder support. The merger would unite two cable programming giants; Discovery owns the Discovery Channel, Investigation Discovery, OWN and TLC, while Scripp’s portfolio includes the Food Network, HGTV and Travel Channel.15. Google Buys Part of HTC Smartphone TeamThis fall, Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google division confirmed that it plans to acquire part of HTC’s mobile division team for $1.1 billion as it grows its smartphone hardware business. Google has become very serious about its hardware development with the debut of its Pixel line of smartphones, and scooping up a chunk of HTC’s team means that the tech giant can better directly challenge Android partners like Samsung, LG, and Huawei.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3434,GILD,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced encouraging data from a proof-of-concept study of experimental combination therapies for patients with advanced fibrosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (""NASH""). The data were presented at The International Liver Congress 2018 in Paris.Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibitor selonsertib was combined with either the Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (""ACC"") inhibitor GS-0976 or the selective, non-steroidal Farnesoid X receptor (""FXR"") agonist GS-9674 as therapies.Patients diagnosed with NASH and liver fibrosis stages F2 to F3 based on biopsy, or by magnetic resonance elastography (""MRE"") and MRI proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) enrolled in the study. They were treated with either selonsertib 18 mg plus GS-0976 20 mg (n=20), selonsertib 18 mg plus GS-9674 30 mg (n=20), or each monotherapy (n=10 per group) once daily for 12 weeks.Post treatment the most notable change that were observed was the decrease in liver fat content (measured by MRI-PDFF), which occurred in regimens containing GS-0976. The results also showed improvements in liver biochemistry and/or markers of fibrosis across both combination arms of the study compared to baseline.  Moreover, patients treated with selonsertib plus GS-0976, kinetic labeling showed reduction in the fractional synthesis rate of lumican, a marker of fibrogenesis.Hence, the favorable results suggest that combination therapy with selonsertib and either GS-0976 or GS-9674 can be evaluated further in patients with NASH and F3 and F4 fibrosis.Gilead also announced completion of enrolment in the phase III trials, STELLAR selonsertib.  Gilead’s NASH pipeline include selonsertib, GS-9674 and GS-0976, alone and in combinationConcurrently, Gilead presented data from a pre-clinical study of another combination treatment approach for NASH, evaluating GS-9674 and GS-0976 together and as single-agents in rodent models of NASH and liver fibrosis. The data indicate that combining agents had greater anti-fibrotic and anti-steatotic effects and led to improvements in liver biochemistry and fibrosis markers, compared with either agent alone.As a result, Gilead has initiated a larger phase IIb study in combination treatment with selonsertib, and/or GS-0976, and/or GS-9674 in patients with advanced fibrosis due to NASH.Given the persistent decline in the HCV franchise, Gilead is looking to foray into markets like NASH and CAR-T as they hold great potential. Per estimates, NASH is expected to surpass hepatitis C as the leading reason for liver transplants in the United States and Europe.  Gilead’s stock has lost 4.6% in the last six months as against the industry's decline of 15.5%.Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT  -  Free Report) is also evaluating its lead candidate, obeticholic acid, in a phase III study in subjects with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) has a mid-stage candidate in the NASH space. BMS-986036, an investigational pegylated analogue of human fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a key regulator of metabolism, in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH (F1-F3) achieved its primary endpoint of significant reduction in liver fat versus placebo.Swiss major Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) is conducting a phase IIb involving the combination of a Novartis FXR agonist and cenicriviroc with for the treatment of NASH.Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

3435,GILD,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 7.2% n that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is GILD due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Gilead Q1 Earnings & Sales Miss Estimates on Weak HCVGilead reported dismal results for the first quarter of 2018 wherein both earnings and revenues missed expectations due to a wider-than-expected decline in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise.The company’s first-quarter earnings of $1.48 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.66. Earnings were also below the year-ago quarter figure of $2.23 per share.Moreover, total revenues of $5.1 billion also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.42 billion. Further, revenues declined 21.8% year over year.Harvoni & Sovaldi Plunge FurtherProduct sales came in at $5.0 billion, down 21.6% year over year due to accelerated decline in HCV sales.Antiviral product sales, which include Gilead's HIV and liver disease portfolio, came in at $4.4 billion in the quarter, down 24.1% from the year-ago quarter.Research & development (R&D) expenses declined 8.4% to $814 million. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 9.5% to $884 million.HCV product sales, which include Harvoni, Sovaldi, Epclusa and Vosevi, were $1.0 billion, down from $2.6 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was mainly due to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets and lower sales of Epclusa in the United States as a result of increased competition.Sales of Harvoni plunged 74.7% year over year to $348 million in the quarter.  Epclusa garnered sales of $536 million in the quarter, down from the year-ago period figure of $892 million.Meanwhile, HIV and HBV product sales came in at $3.3 billion, up 1.9% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by continuous strong uptake of tenofoviral afenamide (TAF)-based products such as Genvoya, which generated sales of $1,082 million, up from $769 million in the year-ago quarter, Descovy, which recorded sales of $361 million, up from $251 million, and Odefsey, which registered sales of $342 million, up from $227 million. Entry of generics and greater U.S. inventory drawdown than in the prior-year quarter somewhat impacted sales. However, HIV treatments like Stribild and Complera/Eviplera sales declined 43.7% and 24.9% respectively. Viread sales were down at $97 million, down 62.7%.Atripla sales tanked 30.5% to $314 million, while Truvada sales fell 8.7% to $652 million.Other products like Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig recorded sales of $204 million (down 3.3%), $195 million (up 27.4%), $107 million (up 16.3%) and $33 million, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin was 86.3% compared to 88.3% in the year-ago period.2018 Guidance ReiteratedGilead continues to expect net product sales in the range of $20-$21 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are projected in the range of $3.4-$3.6 billion and $3.4-$3.6 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 85-87%.AcquisitionsThe company acquired Kite Pharma in 2017. The FDA approval for Yescarta, a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy should Gilead’s prospects. The company also acquired Cell Design Labs to expand further in the CAR-T space.Yescarta sales came in at $40 million in the quarter.Dividend and Share RepurchaseGilead declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock for second-quarter 2018. The dividend is payable on Jun 28 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Jun 15. During the quarter, the company paid cash dividends of $253 million and repurchased shares for $1.0 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

3436,GILD,"Shares of Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ICPT  -  Free Report) have declined 42.3% in 2017 as against the industry’s 5.2% rally.  Intercept’s lead drug, Ocaliva was approved in the United States, in combination with ursodeoxycholic (UDCA) for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults who are unable to endure UDCA in 2016. The drug was also granted conditional approval by the European Commission.The initial uptake of the drug was encouraging. In third-quarter 2017 Ocaliva recorded $40.9 million of sales, up from $30.4 million recorded in the second quarter.However, prescription demand softened following the Dear Health Care Provider letter and the FDA safety communication on Ocaliva. The FDA reported 19 deaths due to Ocaliva and stated that the drug may also affect the liver. However, Intercept conducted an analysis and concluded that these patients were prescribed once daily doses of Ocaliva, which is seven times higher than the recommended weekly dose. The analysis was conducted in consultation with the FDA. Consequently, Intercept issued the Dear Healthcare Provider letter. Thereafter, the FDA issued their own safety communication to reinforce recommended label dosing. Intercept is also working with the FDA on further updates to Ocaliva’s label for safety purposes.Thus, such news are likely to dent the sales potential.Meanwhile, Ocaliva is being evaluated for other indications including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The company has earlier stated plans to initiate a phase III trial on Ocaliva in NASH patients with cirrhosis in the second half of 2017. We expect the trial to start in 2018.The FDA has approved a redesign of the phase III trial, REGENERATE on Ocaliva for the safety and efficacy in treating NASH patients with liver fibrosis. The company now needs to achieve only one co primary endpoint- either fibrosis improvement or NASH resolution as compared with the earlier target of achieving both. The sample size of the trial has also been reduced to approximately 750 patients or about 250 patients per arm. The company completed enrolment for the interim analysis cohort in the REGENERATE trial (data readout in the first half of 2019). NASH market has huge potential and a tentative approval will boost Ocaliva’s prospects.  However, bigwigs like Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) have FXR agonists in phase II or earlier stages of clinical development that can be used to treat PBC, NASH and the other liver diseases.  Gilead is conducting multiple phase III trials in NASH patients of various disease severity with selonsertib, an inhibitor of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1. The company is also exploring additional studies in NASH for GS-0976, a small molecule allosteric inhibitor that acts at the protein-protein homodimer interface of acetyl-CoA carboxylases acquired from Nimbus Therapeutics, LLC, and an FXR agonist known as GS-9674. Gilead is also studying a number of compounds in other liver diseases including PBC and PSC.Allergan Plc (AGN  -  Free Report) also has an ongoing phase III trial of cenicriviroc, an immunomodulator that blocks C-C chemokine receptor type 2 and type 5, for the treatment of NASH. Thus this can pose a stiff competition to Intercept.It is unlikely that the stock will turnaround in 2018. A tentative approval in NASH might boost investore sentiment though.Zacks RankIntercept currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3437,GILD,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) is the latest company to join the ongoing acquisitions spree in the biotech sector. The company recently announced that it will acquire Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutics.Details of The TransactionAlexion has offered SEK 232 in cash for each outstanding share of Wilson Therapeutics which translates into a total transaction value of $855 million. Alexion has already obtained shareholder support agreements from the four largest shareholders accounting for 57.4% of Wilson Therapeutics’ outstanding shares and two additional shareholders accounting for 8.7% for a total of 66.1% of the company’s outstanding shares. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter.Rationale Behind the TransactionThe acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, WTX101 to Alexion’s pipeline. The candidate is currently in phase III for the treatment of Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder. The candidate is a first-in-class oral copper-binding agent with a unique mechanism of action and ability to access and bind copper from serum and promote its removal from the liver. The candidate has also obtained Fast Track designation in the United States and enjoys Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of Wilson disease in the United States and EU.   Our TakeAlexion is looking to diversify its portfolio and reduce its dependence on its blockbuster drug Soliris. The deal will strengthen Alexion’s rare disease pipeline with a late-stage candidate.However, investors weren’t much impressed with the news as the acquisition adds a candidate to the pipeline and not an approved drug. Thus, the stock lost 2.35% following the announcement. Moreover, the market opportunity for such a rare disease will be limited and might not boost the top-line as expected.  Alexion’s shares have lost 21.7% in the last six months, compared with the industry’s decline of 16.2%.Of late, quite a few biotech companies have been looking to strengthen their portfolio/pipeline. While 2017 was pretty ho-hum on this front with just a few key deals, 2018 is expected to see a surge in M&A primarily due to lower U.S. tax rates.  Taking a clue from Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) acquisition of Kite Pharma, Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) recently acquired Juno Therapeutics to gain traction in the promising CAR-T space.  Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) acquired Bioverativ Inc. which focuses on therapies for hemophilia and other rare blood disorders.Zacks Rank Alexion currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3438,GILD,"Last year turned out to be pretty good for pharma and biotech stocks as far as FDA decisions are concerned. The regulatory body approved 46 novel drugs, easily surpassing 2016’s total tally of 22.Landmark decisions last year include the approval of a couple of gene-based therapies for cancer – Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah and Gilead Sciences’ (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta. These therapies have the potential to change the way we look at cancer treatments.With just a quarter gone by this year, the FDA has already granted approval to six new treatments. Key approvals include J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) next-generation oral androgen receptor (“AR”) inhibitor Erleada (apalutamide) for pre-metastatic prostate cancer (CRPC), Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated’s (VRTX  -  Free Report) third medicine to treat the underlying cause of CF, Symdeko, which is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor, Gilead’s once-daily single tablet HIV regimen Biktarvy and Novartis’s Lutathera for certain gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming, plus requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Let’s take a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of April.Note that this month, the FDA has already approved Pacira Pharmaceuticals’s Exparel for a new indication as a nerve block for regional analgesia and Clovis Oncology’s PARP inhibitor Rubraca as maintenance therapy for recurrent ovarian cancer.Second Indication for Novartis’ Kymriah: On Apr 30, the FDA is expected to give its decision on Novartis’ supplemental biologics license application (BLA) looking for approval of Kymriah for its second indication. With the latest filing, Novartis is looking to get Kymriah approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBLC) — most common form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma — who have failed two or more prior therapies. Kymriah was approved for the treatment of a deadly cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia last August. According to the company’s annual report, 10-15% of DLBLC patients do not respond to initial therapy or relapse within three months of treatment, indicating the significant market potential for Kymriah in the DLBLC indication.FDA Decision on Mallinckrodt’s Label Expansion of Amitiza in Children: Mallinckrodt plc’s (MNK  -  Free Report) supplemental new drug application (sNDA) looking to get its constipation drug Amitiza approved for paediatric functional constipation between six and 17 years, is under review. The FDA is expected to give its decision on Apr 28. Amtiza was added to Mallinckrodt’s portfolio with the February acquisition of Sucampo Pharmaceuticals.Amitiza is already approved for chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults, irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) among adult women and opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. According to the company’s press release, Amitiza, if approved for paediatric functional constipation, would be the first and only prescription medication specifically approved for such patients, who have limited treatment options to address their disease.Will an FDA Panel Back GW Pharmaceuticals’ Epidiolex and Incyte/Lilly’s Olumiant? An FDA panel is expected to give its opinion on GW Pharmaceuticals’ lead cannabinoid pipeline candidate, Epidiolex, next week. GW Pharmaceuticals is looking to get Epidiolex approved as an adjunctive treatment for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (“LGS”) and Dravet syndrome. Both are highly treatment-resistant forms of childhood-onset epilepsy.With the FDA granting priority review to Epidiolex’s NDA, a response from the FDA is expected by Jun 27, 2018. Epidiolex represents blockbuster potential especially if it is approved across all possible indications.An FDA panel is also expected to give its opinion this month on Incyte/Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Olumiant (baricitinib) for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. In April 2017, the companies had received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA for baricitinib. The FDA required additional clinical data. TheNDA for Olumiant was re-submitted in January. Olumiant has already been launched in select European countries and in Japan, and fetched sales of $46 million in 2017.Although the FDA takes the recommendations of its panels/advisory committe into account while reviewing applications, it is not bound to follow the same.FDA Decisions for Rigel’s Tavalisse and Ultragenyx’s Burosumab on April 17: The FDA is expected to give its decision on Rigel Pharmaceuticals NDA for Tavalisse (fostamatinib) for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) on Apr 17. Rigel is preparing for the launch of this oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor in the second quarter, if approved. Existing therapies to treat chronic ITP include steroids, blood platelet production boosters (TPOs) and splenectomy. However, still the disease remains inadequately treated in many patients. This means that if approved, Tavalisse should enjoy significant market potential.Another FDA decision expected on Apr 17 is on Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical’s BLA for burosumab to treat pediatric and adult patients with X-Linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH). Burosumab was approved for treating XLH by the trade name of Crysvita in the EU in February.FDA to Decide on Prometic’s Ryplazim: This FDA decision, expected on Apr 14, will be on Canadian biotech Prometic Life Sciences’ biologics license application (BLA) for Ryplazim for the treatment of congenital plasminogen deficiency. Ryplazim enjoyed Orphan Drug and Fast Track Designations by the FDA for the said indication.Bristol Myers’ Opdivo+Yervoy Combo to Get FDA Approval? Bristol Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) has filed an sBLA looking get its blockbuster drug Opdivo approved in combination with its another cancer drug Yervoy in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). The FDA decision is expected in Apr 16.In clinical studies, the combination has demonstrated superior overall survival (OS) compared with the current standard of care sunitinib in intermediate- and poor-risk patients. This bodes well for the drug given the potential in the targeted market.The PD-1 inhibitor is presently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications. Label expansion should boost Opdivo’s sales further. Opdivo generated sales of almost $5 billion in 2017.Bristol-Myers is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

3439,GILD,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that it has formed an alliance with private biotech, Allogene Therapeutics, to expedite the development of its allogeneic CAR-T therapy.San Francisco-based Allogene is co-founded and led by former executives of Kite Pharma, which was acquired by Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) for $12 billion last year. Pfizer will own a 25% stake in Allogene and also get a representation on the latter’s board.Per the deal, Allogene will assume from Pfizer the rights to 16 preclinical CAR-T assets, which Pfizer in-licensed from French companies, Cellectis and Servier. In addition, Allogene will also gain rights to a phase I candidate, UCART19, which Pfizer developed in partnership with Servier. UCART19 is an allogeneic CAR-T therapy that has the potential to be developed for the treatment of CD19-expressing hematological malignancies. It is presently in a phase I study for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) while phase II studies are expected to be initiated next year by Allogene and Servier.Allogeneic CAR-T therapies, a potentially revolutionary cancer treatment approach, are developed from cells of healthy donors and stored for “off-the-shelf” use in patients. This approach eliminates the need to create personalized therapy, thereby reducing the time patients must wait for treatment.Focus on the CAR-T area has increased with last year’s FDA approval of therapies such as Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah and Gilead’s Yescarta. These treatments have huge commercial potential and could well change the treatment paradigm.CAR-T falls under the ambit of cellular immunotherapy, which involves using a patient’s own immune cells to attack and get rid of harmful disease cells in the body. The CAR-T approach involves the collection of a patient’s T cells, their genetic modification outside the body, the incorporation of specific receptors targeting cancer cells and finally, the re-infusion of the modified T cells back into the patient.It goes without saying that many drug/biotech companies are looking to boost their pipeline with such drugs.Meanwhile, per a CNBC report, Pfizer is in talks with consumer giant Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) regarding the sale of its Consumer Healthcare segmentLast October, Pfizer had said that it was exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. A decision regarding the same is expected to be made this year and it may ultimately opt to retain the business.However, Pfizer is having trouble finding a buyer for the same. Last month, London-based pharma/consumer giant Glaxo, which was considered a frontrunner to bid for Pfizer’s unit, withdrew from the race to buy Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare segment. (Read more: Glaxo Drops Bid for Pfizer Unit, Shingrix Gains EU/Japan Nod).British company, Reckitt Benckiser Group also pulled out of the discussion with Pfizer to buy the same unit.Following the recent developments, Pfizer’s shares were up 1.8% on Tuesday.

3440,GILD,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) reported core earnings of 72 cents per American depositary share in the fourth quarter of 2017, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents. The bottom line was up 11% at constant exchange rate (CER) compared with the year-ago figure.Glaxo’s shares have lost 9.4% in a year’s time against the industry’s 14.1% increase. Quarterly revenues rose 4% at CER to $10.3 billion (£7.6 billion), driven by strong segmental performances in Consumer Healthcare, Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines. The top line also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.9 billion.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at CER.Quarterly HighlightsSales were up 4% in the United States and 7% in the International markets. On the flip side, sales in Europe were flat year over year.Sales of New Pharmaceutical and Vaccine products surged 51%, driven by HIV drugs, Tivicay and Triumeq; respiratory drugs, the Ellipta products and Nucala; and the meningitis preventive vaccines, Bexsero and Menveo.Glaxo reports financial figures under three segments: Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare.The Pharmaceuticals division registered 3% revenue growth, driven by HIV drugs, Tivicay and Triumeq and respiratory disease drugs, Relvar/Breo and Nucala. This upside was but partly offset by the impact of recent divestments and a sales decrease of older respiratory products including Seretide/Advair and Established Pharmaceuticals.HIV sales increased 17% on the back of 19% and 28% growth in the United States and International sales, respectively. Europe sales were also up 7% year over year. The encouraging numbers were driven by continued market share growth for both Triumeq (sales up 27%) and Tivicay (sales up 41%). However, sales of another HIV drug Epzicom/Kivexa tumbled 61% due to an increased generic competition, particularly affecting the European market.Notably, the company’s latest product from the HIV portfolio is Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine), the first two-drug regimen, once-daily, single pill for HIV. It was approved in the United States in November 2017. The drug generated initial sales of £5 million during the quarter. However, this week, Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) has announced an FDA approval of its triple combination, once-daily single tablet regimen, Biktarvy (bictegravir /emtricitabine /tenofovir alafenamide), for HIV-1 infection treatment. This approval might pose competitive threats to Juluca in the coming quarters.Respiratory sales were up 2% at CER. In the EU and the International markets, sales increased 4% and 6%, respectively. However, in the United States, the metric was flat year over year. The sales improvement was mainly driven by the new respiratory products sales growth, partially offset by the sales decline of older products like Seretide/Advair, Flovent and Ventolin.Notably, the recently launched respiratory product, Trelegy Ellipta (only once-daily single inhaler triple therapy for COPD), has generated initial sales of $2 million in the United States and the EU during the reported quarter.The Ellipta products recorded a 53% surge in sales, driven by market share gains with the global roll-out continuing. However, this upside was offset by lower sales of Seretide/Advair (down 14%). Flixotide/Flovent and Ventolin sales decreased 12% and 9%, respectively.Immuno-inflammation drugs, including Benlysta, rose 15% in the quarter.The new grouping of Established Pharmaceuticals comprises the previous Established Products, Cardiovascular, metabolic and urology (CVMU) and other Pharma products. Established Pharmaceuticals sales declined 5% in the quarter under review.Sales in the Consumer Healthcare segment climbed 4%, despite a slowdown in market conditions. The power brands, particularly in Pain relief and Oral health categories, saw a sturdy performance in the quarter.Sales from the Vaccines segment were impressive, having increased 9% year over year. Geographically, the United States, Europe and the international markets increased 16%, 2% and 9%, respectively. While meningitis vaccines — Bexsero — decreased 5% in the United States, the same increased 15% in the Europe market. While Menveo in the United States posted higher sales, the same was offset by a weak performance of the Established Vaccines due to increasing competitive pressures on Infanrix and Pediarix in the United States and Europe.It is important to note that in October 2017, the FDA granted an approval to Glaxo’s shingles vaccine, Shingrix. Later in the same month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted in favor of three recommendations for the use of Shingrix. The vaccine is preferred over Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zostavax. Owing to this favorable recommendation, Shingrix generated initial sales of £22 million in the United States during the period under discussion.2017 ResultsFull-year sales gained 3% year over year to $39.3 billion (£30.2 billion). However, the metric marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39.5 billion.The 2017 earnings of $2.9 per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The full-year bottom line reflects 4% growth compared with the year-ago figure. Moreover, reported earnings matched the previously announced guidance for 2017.2018 OutlookThe company stated that EPS growth for 2018 is uncertain due to the timing of the entry of Advair generics in the market. Hence, it issued two sets of guidance for 2018.The company expects 4-7% EPS growth at CER in 2018, if no Advair generics are launched further this year. However, in the probable event of introducing Advair generics in the U.S. market by mid-2018, Glaxo anticipates adjusted EPS to be flat to down 3% year over year at CER.Three companies Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report), Hikma Pharmaceuticals and Novartis which are trying to bring a generic version of Advair in the market received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA. While, Mylan and Hikma received CRL last year, Novartis received the same this week delaying the entry of generics in the U.S. market.Long-term GuidanceThe company projects its EPS to witness a CAGR in the mid-to-high-single-digit range through 2020.While the Vaccine segment is estimated to register a mid-to-high-single-digit growth through 2020 despite competition for pediatric and flu vaccines, the Consumer Healthcare segment is expected to deliver low-to-mid-single-digit top-line CAGR through 2020.GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | GlaxoSmithKline PLC Quote Zacks RankGlaxo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3441,GILD,"Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ICPT  -  Free Report) reported mixed results for first-quarter 2018. The company reported a loss of $3.22 per share in the first quarter, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $3.41 per share and the year-ago loss of $3.61 per share. Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Quote Quarterly revenues were $35.9 million, up significantly from $21.1 million in the year-ago quarter but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.8 million.Quarter in DetailOcaliva recorded $35.2 million of sales, down from $37.3 million recorded in fourth-quarter 2017. Net sales in the United States came in at $28.5 million while the ex-U.S. Ocaliva net sales came in at $6.7 million.Ocaliva was approved in the United States, in combination with ursodeoxycholic (“UDCA”) for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (“PBC”) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults who are unable to endure UDCA in 2016. The drug was also granted conditional approval by the European Commission. In February 2018, the Ocaliva label was updated in the United States to include a boxed warning and a dosing table that reinforced the existing dosing schedule in PBC patients with Child-Pugh Class B or C or decompensated cirrhosis.Research and development expenses increased 11.1% year over year to $48.7 million primarily driven by increases in clinical development programs for Obeticholic acid (“OCA”) and infrastructure to support such programs.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $62.5 million from $61.1 million in the year-ago quarter.2018 OutlookOcaliva net sales are expected between $170 million and $185 million in 2018. Intercept continues to expect operating expenses in the range of $390-$410 million in 2018.Pipeline UpdateOCA is being evaluated for other indications including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (“PSC”).The FDA earlier approved a redesign of the phase III trial, REGENERATE on OCA for the safety and efficacy in treating NASH patients with liver fibrosis. The company now needs to achieve only one co primary endpoint, either fibrosis improvement or NASH resolution as compared with the earlier target of achieving both. Enrolment of the interim analysis cohort was completed in the trial and results are expected in the first half of 2019.Earlier, Intercept initiated a phase III trial, REVERSE, on OCA. The randomized phase III study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of OCA, in subjects with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH in approximately 540 patients with a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of cirrhosis. The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage of subjects with histological improvement in fibrosis by at least one stage using the NASH Clinical Research Network (“CRN”) scoring system after 12 months of treatment. Patients enrolled in the trial are being randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment arms — once-daily dosing of OCA 10 mg, once-daily OCA 10 mg with titration to 25 mg at three months, or placebo. The patients who successfully complete the double-blind phase of REVERSE will be enrolled in an open-label extension phase for up to 12 additional months. The trial is currently enrolling.Intercept expects to submit marketing authorization for OCA as a treatment option for NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis, in the United States and international markets based on the positive results from the study. A subsequent outcome trial is also in the cards to confirm the clinical benefit on a post-marketing basis in a broader population of NASH patients with cirrhosis.Our TakeIntercept’s first-quarter results were mixed as loss was narrower than expectations while sales missed expectations.  While the updated label should help the stock turn around, it might be a while before the sales start to recover.Intercept’s stock has tumbled 39.6% over a year compared with the industry’s decline of 11.3%.  The company’s stock was hit due to the safety issues regarding Ocaliva.   Given the challenges faced by the drug in recent times, the label expansion of OCA will boost the growth prospects.Per estimates, NASH is expected to surpass hepatitis C as the leading reason for liver transplants in the United States and Europe. NASH market has huge potential and a tentative approval will boost Ocaliva’s prospects.  However, bigwigs like Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) and Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) have FXR agonists in phase II or earlier stages of clinical or preclinical development that can be used to treat PBC, NASH and the other liver diseases.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderIntercept currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Exelixis (EXEL  -  Free Report) which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Exelixis’ earnings per share estimates increased from 59 cents to 86 cents for 2018 over the last seven days after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter results.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3442,GILD,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) reported encouraging first-quarter 2018 results wherein both earnings and sales topped expectations.The company reported adjusted earnings of $2.05 per share which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.00, up from $1.67 in the year-ago quarter.Celgene Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Celgene Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Celgene Corporation QuoteTotal revenues grew 19.4% to $3.54 billion in the quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.50 billion. Revenues were boosted by consistent performance of the company’s key growth driver, Revlimid.Revlimid — Key CatalystNet product sales increased 20% year over year to $3.5 billion. Net sales of Revlimid came in at $2.2 billion, reflecting 19% year-over-year growth. The drug performed well both in the United States (up 21%) and international markets (up 15%). Growth in the quarter was driven by increased volume as a result of increases in duration of treatment and market share.Net sales of another cancer drug, Abraxane increased 11% to $262 million as sales benefited from buying patterns.  Pomalyst/Imnovid came in at $453 million, up 24%. Sales were driven by increased volume due to increase in market share and duration.Otezla sales were $353 million in the quarter, up 46%. Sales in the United States were primarily volume-driven due to increasing demand and improved access pull-through in contracted health plans while sales in international markets were driven primarily by increasing adoption in key ex-U.S. markets.All other product sales (including Istodax, Thalomid, Vidaza and an authorized generic version of Vidaza in the United States) totaled $229 million in the quarter, up from $226 million from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted research and development expenses increased 16.6% to $694 million due to higher spending related to drug discovery and clinical trial activity while adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 24.5% to $671 million.Pipeline UpdateCelgene acquired acquire Juno Therapeutics, Inc. for approximately $9 billion in March 2018. In February 2018, the company also acquired Impact Biomedicines and added a late stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to its pipeline.Celgene announced a global collaboration with Prothena (PRTA  -  Free Report) in March 2018 to develop new therapies for a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases primarily focused on three proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including tau, TDP-43 and an undisclosed target.Celgene's partner bluebird bio (BLUE  -  Free Report) opted to co-develop and co-promote bb2121, an experimental anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy for the treatment of patients with RRMM in the United States in March 2018. Both companies had originally entered into a broad, global strategic research collaboration in 2013 to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies in oncology, which included bb2121. The agreement was amended in 2015.However, Celgene suffered a setback when it received a Refusal To File letter from the FDA regarding the New Drug Application (NDA) for ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). Celegne now plans to resubmit the NDA in the first quarter of 2019 following a Type A meeting with the FDA in early April. The company also plans to submit a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) for ozanimod in RMS in the first quarter of 2019.2018 Outlook UpdatedCelgene now anticipates earnings per share of $8.45 in 2018 compared to the earlier estimate of $8.70-$8.90. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is $8.44 per share.  Net revenues are now estimated around $14.8 billion, at the high end of the previously projected range of $14.4-$14.8 billion, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $14.84 billion. The numbers include the impact of dilution from the Juno acquisition.Revlimid sales are now projected at $9.5 billion, up from $9.4 billion estimated earlier. Abraxane sales are estimated to be around $1 billion. Pomalyst’s revenues are now projected at around $2.0 billion (previous projection: $1.9 billion). Otezla sales continued to be projected at $1.5 billion.Our TakeCelgene’s first-quarter results were encouraging as the company beat on both sales and earnings. Revlimid sales were impressive yet again along with Pomalyst and Otezla.The results come as a breather for investors who bore the brunt of the decline in share price due to series of setbacks over the last few months. Celgene’s stock has lost 16% in the last six months compared with the industry’s decline of 12.6%. Nevertheless, shares of the company are up in the pre-market trading due to an earnings beat.Celgene suffered a series of setbacks over the last few months. The company suffered a setback when a late stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Rituxan failed. The threat of generic competition is also looming large on Revlimid which loses patent protection in 2022 forcing Celgene to look for acquisitions. The stock was hit earlier after a phase III trial, REVOLVE, (CD-002) on pipeline candidate GED-0301 in Crohn’s disease and the extension trial, SUSTAIN (CD-004) was discontinued. The company also suffered a setback with its RMS candidate, ozanimod.Celgene was on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions given a lacklustre 2017 and the Juno acquisition was on the same track. We note that the slowdown in mature products compelled prominent biotechs to acquire smaller ones with promising pipelines. Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) acquired Kite Pharma and subsequently obtained FDA approval of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), the latter’s chimeric CAR-T therapy candidate.Zacks RankCelgene is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

3443,GILD,"The performance of the drug industry in first-quarter 2018 has been an encouraging one with quite a few companies’ beatings both earnings as well as revenue estimates.The overall investor sentiment toward pharma and biotech stocks has improved of late as investors are focusing more on fundamentals than on issues like drug pricing. While drug pricing will continue to pose as a major deterrent, thanks to the government increased emphasis on making drugs affordable, new drug approvals and label expansion of existing drugs should help companies maintain the momentum in 2018. The year 2017 saw a number of drugs like Rhopressa, Tymlos, Ozempic, Vyzulta, Siliq, Trulance, Hemlibra, among others getting approval.  Lutathera, Ilumya, Symdeko, Biktarvy, Erleada have already been approved in 2018 and investors are expected to keep their focus on the same.Mergers and acquisitions remain another key area of investor focus. While 2017 was pretty ho-hum on this front with just a few key deals, 2018 is expected to see a surge in M&A primarily due to lower U.S. tax rates.  Taking a clue from Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) acquisition of Kite Pharma, Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) recently acquired Juno Therapeutics to gain traction in the promising CAR-T space.  Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) acquired Bioverativ Inc. which focuses on therapies for hemophilia and other rare blood disorders. The company has also obtained anti-trust clearances in connection with its previously announced acquisition of Ablynx.  While strong pipelines, innovative treatments, impressive results, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending should support growth in this sector, caution is to be exercised when picking stocks for investing.Here are a few sell-rated stocks which should be strictly avoided for now:Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (VRX  -  Free Report):  Canada-based specialty pharma company, Valeant, has been in troubled waters for quite some time now. Valeant’s guidance for 2018 was disappointing. After a tumultuous period, Valeant started a rebuilding process with its CEO, Joseph C. Papa.  The company has reduced total debt by approximately $6.7 billion since the end of first-quarter 2016. However, the dermatology business remains challenging and is expected to decline in 2018 as compared to 2017.  Quite a few of its drugs are facing generic competition. Hence, it might be a while before the company turn arounds as management had projected. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).  Valeant’s shares have declined 25.6% in the last three months, compared with industry’s fall of 2.8%.  Endo International plc (ENDP  -  Free Report): Ireland-based Endo is a global specialty pharmaceutical company focused on generic and branded pharmaceuticals. Endo’s guidance for 2018 was way below expectations. The generics business is under tremendous pressure due to the loss of marketing exclusivity for the first-to-file products ezetimibe tablets and quetiapine ER tablets in the first half of 2017. The branded pharmaceuticals business was impacted by continued generic competition for established products, product divestitures and ceasing shipments of Opana ER and this is expected to continue further. Endo withdrew opioid pain medication Opana ER (oxymorphone hydrochloride extended release) from the market following FDA’s request in June 2017.  The company divested its non-core assets such as Belbuca and restructured its pain franchise to focus particularly on specialty branded business. However, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company is expected to face challenging business conditions in 2018. Endo’s shares have lost 25.8% in the last three months worse than the industry’s decline of 2.8%.  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AERI  -  Free Report): Irvine, CA-based Aerie Pharmaceuticals focuses on the development and commercialization of eye disease therapies, including glaucoma and other eye-diseases. Aerie received a significant boost with the recent approval of lead drug Rhopressa for the lowering of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  However, Rhopressa faces stiff competition from established branded and generic pharmaceutical companies, such as Novartis’ Simbrinza and Travtan, and Allergan’s Lumigan, as well as other smaller biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Valeant’s Vyzulta was recently approved for open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Rhopressa will face a tough time in gaining market share due to competition from these products. Hence, we advise investors to steer clear of this Zacks Rank #4 stock for the time being. Aerie’s shares have fallen 13.8% in the last three months, worse than the industry’s decline of 2.8%.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3444,GILD,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Gilead Sciences has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9.5, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.3x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Gilead Sciences’ current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 34.7. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Gilead Sciences has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.7, which is tad higher than the current level. So it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near term.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Gilead Sciences has a P/S ratio of about 4.1. This is a bit higher than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4x right now. However, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, GILD is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Gilead Sciences currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40%  of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Gilead Sciences a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Gilead Sciences might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of F. This gives GILD a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>).Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been downbeat. The current year has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to nine down, while the next year estimate has seen three up and four down in the same time period.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current year consensus estimate has decreased by 6.6% in the past two months, while the next year estimate has decreased 2.8%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and Consensus  Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and Consensus | Gilead Sciences, Inc. QuoteThe stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineApple is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 24% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

3445,GILD,"The cancer/oncology space has always been keenly watched by investors interested in the pharma/biotech sector. This is because the disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality across the world preceded only by heart disease.Major players in this field include Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report), Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report). Cancer drugs are the most important revenue drivers for these bigwigs as well as their smaller counterparts like Clovis Oncology, Tesaro, and Puma Biotechnology among othersEvolution of the Cancer SpaceA lot of progress has been made in this area in the last few years. Companies are aiming to bring out newer and better treatments like immunotherapies, gene therapy, targeted therapy and other novel therapies.In fact, focus in this area has increased with the FDA approval of CAR-T therapies - Novartis’ Kymriah and Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta - last year. The path-breaking immunocellular therapy is a one-time treatment that uses a patient's own T-cells to fight cancer. The acquisitions of Kite by Gilead and Juno by Celgene have led to renewed interest in this area.Interest in PARP inhibitors has also increased considerably as they could well be the next major class of therapeutics in oncology.According to IMSQuintiles, 68 new cancer drugs were approved for 22 indications from 2011 to 2016. Worldwide costs for cancer therapeutics and supportive care drugs shot up from $91 billion in 2012 to $113 billion in 2016 with the United States accounting for 46% of the costs. More than 600 molecules are in late-stage development, with the majority being targeted therapy, which attack a specific feature, or target, in cancer cells.New Cancer DrugsNew oncology brands including Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo, Merck’s Keytruda, Pfizer’s Ibrance and AbbVie/J&J’s Imbruvica are fast catching up  and giving tough competition to category stalwarts such as Avastin, Herceptin, and Rituxan. New cancer drugs approved last year include Pfizer/Merck KGaA’s Bavencio for bladder cancer, Eli Lilly’s Verzenio, Novartis’ Kisqali, Puma Biotechnology’s Nerlynx for breast cancer and Tesaro’s Zejula for ovarian cancer.The most common indications for new drugs are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, melanoma, and breast cancer.Is the Patient Population Benefiting?It goes without saying that these new drugs bring in millions of bucks for the companies as these are sold for a huge amount of money. However, are these doing enough to cure patients or help them live longer or better? Are these relieving them of pain or fatigue, considering the fact that these come at a premium?While the FDA has approved a number of oncology drugs in recent years and also lowered the bar for clinical study goals of cancer candidates, the disease still remains the top cause of death in many populations. Here’s probably why.A few of these drugs have been successful in allowing patients with limited life expectancies to live for years. However, the efficacy of several others is being questioned as they have led to only marginal benefits with not much improvement in survival or quality of life.Many drugs are being approved based on progression free survival - the amount of time the patients live without their tumors growing larger - without evidence of benefit on survival or quality of life. This is specially the case for drugs that aim to treat terminal cancers with few treatment options. However, overall survival (OS) data, once available, sometimes shows that the drug does not help people live longer.  Also, when drugs do offer survival benefits, the gains are often marginal. The risks and long-term side effects of some drugs have also been underestimated.Overall cancer survival has barely changed over the past decade, which raises concerns about the push to get more drugs approved instead of getting effective drugs approved.Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return  Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

3446,GILD,"Acquisitions once again remained in focus this week with Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) rumored to be in talks with Juno  regarding a possible deal.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesJuno Soars on Acquisition Rumors: Juno’s shares skyrocketed on reports that Celgene is interested in acquiring the immuno-oncology focused company. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the companies are in talks regarding a possible acquisition deal. If the Juno acquisition rumors turn out to be true, this will be the second acquisition announcement to be made by Celgene this year. Just last week, the company announced its intention to acquire Impact Biomedicines, which is developing fedratinib for myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera.Celgene is under a lot of pressure to strengthen its pipeline and revenue stream - the company had a tough 2017 with issues like pipeline setbacks as well as the weak performance of Otezla weighing on the stock.However, it remains to be seen how much Celgene will be willing to shell out for Juno. Juno’s market cap as of Jan 16, 2018 was $5.2 billion. Juno’s shares have been on an upward trend following the $11.9 billion Gilead-Kite acquisition announcement last year in August. With Juno being focused on the development of innovative cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, the company has long been considered a potential acquisition target. Over the last one year, Juno’s shares are up 139% compared to the 3.3% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Juno’s cell-based cancer immunotherapies are based on chimeric antigen receptor and high-affinity T cell receptor technologies. The company has several cell-based candidates in its pipeline targeting a variety of B-cell malignancies as well as multiple solid tumors and multiple myeloma. Although Juno suffered a major setback with the development of its erstwhile lead pipeline candidate due to safety issues (including patient deaths), the company is now focusing on liso-cel, a next-generation CAR-T cell product that targets CD19. Juno expects to file for FDA approval of liso-cel for relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) in the second half of 2018. With the immuno-oncology space remaining quite lucrative, Celgene may have to pay a hefty premium to finalize the deal. Juno and Celgene already have a collaboration deal in place.Concert Down on Patent Challenge Update: Concert Pharmaceuticals (CNCE  -  Free Report) suffered a major blow with its Post Grant Review (“PGR”) petition challenging the validity of U.S. Patent No. 9,662,335 being rejected by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Concert had filed the petition last year in July challenging the validity of the patent that has been assigned to Incyte Pharmaceuticals (INCY  -  Free Report). The concerned patent covers deuterated ruxolitinib analogs while Concert’s CTP-543 is a deuterium-modified version of ruxolitinib. Incyte markets ruxolitinib in the United States under the name Jakafi and has patents covering ruxolitinib that may be unexpired if and when Concert seeks marketing approval for CTP-543.Despite the setback, Concert said that it can always challenge the validity of the patent later in federal court. Moreover, the company said that the decision does not affect its plans to develop CTP-543 for alopecia areata. However, the company is now reassessing its plans for developing CTP-543 for additional indications.CTP-543 is a novel JAK inhibitor currently in phase II development for alopecia areata. The FDA recently granted fast track status to the candidate for this indication (Read more: Concert Pharmaceuticals Plunges on Patent Petition Setback).Vertex’s Orkambi Label Expanded in EU: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report) gained EU approval for the use of Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) in children with cystic fibrosis (“CF”) in the 6-11 years age group with two copies of the F508del mutation. About 3,400 children in Europe belong to this category. Approval was in-line with expectations considering the company had got a positive opinion from the European Union Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) for this indication in November 2017 (Read more: Vertex's Cystic Fibrosis Drug Ok'd for Pediatric Use in EU). Vertex is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Humira Biosimilar BLA Accepted by FDA: The FDA has accepted for review a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) submitted by Sandoz for its biosimilar version of AbbVie’s blockbuster drug, Humira (adalimumab). Humira is approved for a wide range of indications. At a recent healthcare conference, AbbVie said that global Humira sales crossed $18 billion in 2017 and should approach $21 billion in 2020. The company, which expects the drug to lose exclusivity in international markets in the fourth quarter of 2018, believes that sales erosion will be manageable.  We note that Sandoz is not the first to file for a biosimilar version of Humira. In fact, companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Boehringer Ingelheim have already gained approval for their Humira biosimilars. Amgen, which entered into a global settlement and license agreement with AbbVie, expects to launch its Humira biosimilar in Europe in October 2018 and in the United States in January 2023. Meanwhile, AbbVie and Boehringer are engaged in patent litigation in the United States.Eiger Plunges on Pipeline Setback: Eiger suffered a major setback with its investigational treatment, ubenimex, for pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”) failing to meet the primary endpoint in a mid-stage study. Based on this disappointing update, the company has decided to discontinue the development of ubenimex for PAH though it will continue to evaluate ubenimex for lymphedema. Ubenimex is in a mid-stage study for this indication with data expected in the second half of the year. The company’s shares were down 49.4% on the news.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index was up slightly over the last four trading sessions.

3447,GILD,"Shares of Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) have declined 9.5% in 2017 as against the industry’s gain of 5.2%.  Celgene suffered a series of setbacks over the last few months. The company suffered a setback last week when a late stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan failed.The study evaluated Revlimid plus Rituxan (R2) followed by R2 maintenance compared with the standard of care featuring Rituxan plus chemotherapy (R-CHOP, R-bendamustine or R-VN CVP) followed by Rituxan maintenance for previously untreated follicular lymphoma.However, the R2 treatment arm could not achieve superiority in the co-primary endpoints of complete response or unconfirmed complete response CR/CRu) at 120 weeks and in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) observed during the pre-planned analysis. None of the arms proved superior for either of the co-primary endpoints. Meanwhile, an additional analysis of the trial is underway.Celgene’s key growth engine is Revlimid. In 2016, the drug’s worldwide sales increased 20% to $7.0 billion and contributed almost 62.1% of the total revenues. Revlimid, an oral immunomodulatory drug, is currently approved for several indications including MM, myelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma.The failure of the study is disappointing. The drug’s label expansion would have boosted its sales potential. The company had expected lymphoma to increase Revlimid’s growth prospects by 2020 and beyond.The company's portfolio also includes Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane, Otezla, Istodax, Vidaza and Thalomid/Thalidomide. However, Abraxane sales are under pressure due to a highly competitive U.S. market for lung and breast cancer therapy. In this scenario, dependence on Revlimid has its inherent risks.In addition, in October 2017, the company announced a phase III trial, REVOLVE, (CD-002) on pipeline candidate GED-0301 in Crohn’s disease and the extension trial, SUSTAIN (CD-004) were discontinued following a recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee, which assessed overall benefit/risk during a recent interim futility analysis.Meanwhile, the deep yet persistently slow growth of the psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis markets, especially during the entire third quarter, has led to a weak performance of Otezla. Consequently, the company also reduced its annual guidance. The challenging market conditions were driven by an increasingly restrictive PBM formulary control.These factors will remain a hangover on the company’s shares in 2018 as well.On a positive note, in August 2017, the company obtained an FDA approval for Idhifa for treatment of relapsed and/or refractory acute myeloid leukemia with isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutation. The drug was developed in partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc (AGIO  -  Free Report). We expect Celgene to look out for strategic acquisitions on the same note as bigwigs like Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) to aid the top line.Zacks RankCelgene currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3448,GILD,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) received a major boost when the FDA approved the company’s once-daily single tablet regimen (“STR”), Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25mg, BIC/FTC/TAF) for HIV-1 infection.The approval, which comes ahead of the PDUFA date of Feb 12, 2018, provides a major boost to Gilead’s HIV franchise.Though the company topped both earnings and revenue estimates in the fourth quarter, the magnitude of the decline in HCV sales was wider-than-expected. The HCV franchise has been under pressure for a while due to lower patient starts and increased competition form AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report).The company’s guidance for 2018 also lacks lustre and we expect sales of the same to decline further.  Amid such a scenario, the approval of this latest triple HIV therapy is likely to provide an impetus to the stock as Gilead is now banking on its HIV franchise and newer avenues like the CAR-T therapy post the Kite acquisition and promising NASH candidates for growth. Following the news of the approval, shares of the company moved up 3.8%. Gilead’s stock has gained 14.4% in the last six months as against the industry's decline of 3.6%.Biktarvy, Gilead’s latest triple therapy, is approved as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults who have no antiretroviral treatment history or to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen for at least three months with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of Biktarvy.Meanwhile, the HIV franchise continues to gain traction on the back of rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens in the United States and EU. The TAF-based regimens now represent 62% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya along with Odefsey and Descovy in 2016.Biktarvy combines the novel, unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor (“INSTI”) bictegravir, with the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of the Descovy, (FTC/TAF) dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (“NRTI”) backbone, and is the smallest INSTI-based triple-therapy STR available.The approval of Biktarvy was supported by encouraging data from four ongoing studies: Studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults, and Studies 1844 and 1878 in virologically suppressed adults. Biktarvy met its primary objective of non-inferiority at 48 weeks across all four studies.However, Biktarvy has a Boxed Warning in its product label regarding the risk of post treatment acute exacerbation of hepatitis B.The approval of this new HIV therapy will pose stiff competition to GlaxoSmith’s (GSK  -  Free Report) existing therapies, Tivicay and Triumeq.On the other hand, per a report from Reuters, ViiV Healthcare, a joint venture majority-owned by GlaxoSmith with Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Shionogi Ltd has filed a lawsuit against Gilead alleging patent infringement on ViiV's dolutegravir, a component of the venture's triple-drug HIV treatment Triumeq.Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

3449,GILD,"Even in times of global uncertainty and market volatility, an increasing number of investors flock the equity markets to invest their hard-earned money. There are a number of investment styles to suit the predilection of hundreds of investors looking for the best value stocks.Among them, price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is an easy-to-use tool for identifying low-priced stocks which have high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.What is Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:US Foods Holding Corp.

3452,GILD,"Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 results wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations. However, management issued a bleak view for 2018.  Consequently, the stock declined in after-market hours trading and is expected to open in the red given the expectation of a further decline in hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise in 2018.  Nevertheless, Gilead’s stock has gained 10.9% in the last six months as against the industry's  decline of 4.6%.The company’s fourth-quarter earnings of $1.78 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.70.

Quote Harvoni & Sovaldi Plunges FurtherProduct sales came in at $5.8 billion, down 19.1% year over year. The decline was due to lower HCV sales, partially offset by higher sales across HIV and other therapeutic areas.Antiviral product sales, which include Gilead's HIV and liver disease portfolio, came in at $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 21.2%.HCV product sales, which include Harvoni, Sovaldi, Epclusa and Vosevi, were $1.5 billion, down from $3.2 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was mainly attributed to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets.Sales of Harvoni declined 60.7% year over year to $644 million in the quarter. Further, Sovaldi sales recorded a steep year-over-year decline of 78.4% to $117 million.Epclusa garnered sales of $565 million in the quarter, down from the year-ago figure of $1.0 billion.Meanwhile, HIV and HBV product sales came in at $3.7 billion, up 8.8% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by continuous strong uptake of tenofoviral afenamide (TAF)-based products such as Genvoya, which generated sales of $1,060 million, up from $563 million in the year-ago quarter, Descovy, which recorded sales of $365 million, up from $149 million, and Odefsey, which registered sales of $325 million, up from $155 million.

The dividend is payable on Mar 29 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Mar 16. During 2017, the company paid cash dividends of $2.7 billion and repurchased shares for $954 million.Our TakeThough the company topped both earnings and revenue estimates in the fourth quarter, the magnitude of the decline in HCV sales was larger-than-expected. The HCV franchise is under tremendous pressure due to lower patient starts and increasing competition. We expect sales to decline further going forward.  We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa, face competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR, Bristol-Myers’(BMY  -  Free Report) and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier. Both pricing and market share are expected to stabilize by mid-2018 while patient starts are expected to decline further.Meanwhile, the HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens in the United States and EU. The TAF-based regimens now represent 62% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and the launches of Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting also put up a strong performance as the company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with an estimated 153,000 patients using Truvada by the end of 2017. The approval of Yescarta also bodes well for Gilead. We expect the decline in HCV franchise to offset the positive momentum of HIV franchise. Gilead is also intending to foray into the NASH market with pipeline candidates- selonsertib and filgotinib.Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

3453,GILD,"The Q4 earnings season for the pharma/biotech sector was scattered with a few small biotech companies yet to report. The releases so far provide us with a clear picture of the sector’s performance.Overall, the sector performed reasonably well. Among the biotech/pharma bigwigs, Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report), Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) beat earnings and revenue estimates. Meanwhile, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced mixed results with earnings beating estimates and sales lagging the same. However, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) had a rather weak quarter as it missed expectations for earnings and sales and also issued a lower-than-expected sales guidance for 2018.Drug/biotech stocks remained on a growth trajectory in 2017. Ramp up in new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion, favorable clinical study results, frequent FDA approvals, strong performance by key products, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep driving the sector. A faster drug approval process, the proposed removal of outdated regulations that push up costs and a slowdown in innovation should also prove beneficial.The year started off on expectations of a pick-up in M&A activity. The new tax law, which cuts corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and encourages companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%, is expected to spur merger activity this year.Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report), earlier this year, announced deals to buy Belgian biotech company, Ablynx, and haemophilia-focused biotech firm — Bioverativ.Banking on the positive trend and impressive Q4 performance, it might be the perfect time to cash in on the bountiful prospects in this growing market. Here we have picked three biotech stocks which saw positive estimate revisions post Q4 earnings release and also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Earnings estimate revisions have the greatest impact on stock prices. Stocks with rising estimates have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 index year after year. Hence, investors can safely bet on stocks that have been seeing an upward movement in earnings estimates. All the three companies have also seen a steady rally in the share price post Q4 results.Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report)The San Diego, CA-based biotechnology company, Ligand, carries a Zacks Rank #2. The stock witnessed positive estimate revision over the last 30 days. The company released fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 21. It has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings rise 9.8% for 2018 and 21.1% for 2019. The company surpassed earnings and revenue estimates in fourth-quarter 2017 mainly on higher royalty revenues. Additionally, shares of the company have rallied 16.8% post its Q4 earnings release.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report)The Tarrytown, NY-based biopharmaceutical company, Regeneron, witnessed positive estimate revision over the last 60 days. The company released fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 8. The Zacks Rank #1 stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings rise 9.7% and 6.4% for 2018 and 2019, respectively. Regeneron’s fourth-quarter results were impressive as both earnings and sales beat estimates on strong sales of the company’s key marketed drug, Eylea. Shares of the company have rallied 7.1% after it released Q4 earnings release.Horizon Pharma plc (HZNP  -  Free Report)Based in Dublin, Ireland, Horizon Pharma carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings move 10% up in the last 30 days for 2018 and 14.9% for 2019. The company released fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 26. Shares of the company have gained 5% post Q4 earnings announcement. Horizon Pharma also beat earnings and sales estimates in fourth-quarter 2017 backed by strong performance by its Orphan unit. The company’s sales guidance for 2018 is encouraging as well.OutlookWhile 2017 was strong, this year is expected to be a vital one for the biotech sector as these companies continue to invest in pipeline, build global business and drive new product growth.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

3454,GILD,"With just a few days left for the year to end, it can be said that 2017 turned out to be a pretty good year for the biotech sector. The sector had been struggling due to several issues including the drug pricing controversy, mixed results, slower-than-expected new product launches, increasing competition and pipeline setbacks.However, with investors being more comfortable about the drug pricing controversy this year, the focus is now more on the fundamentals of the sector. New product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, and continued strong performance from key products are some of the factors that helped the sector rebound in 2017. The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index is up an impressive 22% year to date.The year also turned out to be pretty good where FDA approvals are concerned. Till date, the regulatory agency has given its nod to 46 novel drugs, well above the 22 drugs approved last year. Immuno-oncology was a key focus area in 2017, whether it was to do with scientific conferences, clinical trial collaborations, acquisitions or FDA approvals.The approval of Novartis’s Kymriah, a gene cell therapy, and Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta, a CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor T cells) cell treatment, ensured that the highly lucrative immuno-oncology market remained in the limelight.The $11.9 billion acquisition of immuno-oncology focused Kite by Gilead also increased interest in this category with investors expecting more acquisition announcements in this area.Of course, it was not all good news for the sector. Companies like Celgene and Biogen were hit by pipeline setbacks while Gilead continues to struggle due to the dwindling sales of its hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) franchise.Nevertheless, there were quite a few companies that fared extremely well in 2017 with their shares outperforming the sector as well as the overall market on the back of factors like deals, pipeline progress and FDA approvals. Here is a look at five such companies.XOMA Corporation (XOMA  -  Free Report): XOMA is focused on the discovery, development and licensing of therapeutic antibodies. The company has several licensing agreements with other biotech and pharma companies which provide XOMA with funds in the form of upfront and milestone payments and potential royalty payments. XOMA’s shares have been on an upward trajectory from August following the signing of licensing agreements with Novartis for gevokizumab and intellectual property covering the use of IL-1 beta targeting antibodies in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. This deal resulted in XOMA receiving upfront payments worth $31 million including an equity investment worth $5 million. The agreement terms also resulted in a 50% reduction in XOMA's outstanding debt through the repayment of its €12 million obligation to Les Laboratoires Servier and the extension of the company’s maturity date for its debt to Novartis by a couple of years. XOMA also stands to earn significant milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales of gevokizumab.Year to date, XOMA’s shares are up 771.8%, significantly outperforming the 3.5% rally of the industry it belongs to. XOMA is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock – you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Dynavax Technologies Corporation (DVAX  -  Free Report): Commercial-stage biopharma company, Dynavax, is focused on the discovery and development of novel vaccines and immuno-oncology therapeutics. The company’s shares shot up in July following a favorable recommendation (12-1) from the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (“VRBPAC”) for Heplisav-B, a vaccine for immunization against hepatitis B infection in adults. Heplisav-B, which had previously received two complete response letters (one in November 2016 and the other in February 2013), from the FDA, gained FDA approval this year in November. The regulatory action makes Heplisav-B the first new hepatitis B vaccine in the United States in more than 25 years and the only two-dose hepatitis B vaccine for adults. Heplisav-B is the first FDA-approved product for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, which expects to launch the vaccine in the first quarter of 2018. Dynavax’s shares are up a whopping 386.1% year to date.Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (SGMO  -  Free Report): Clinical-stage biotech company, Sangamo, is focused on translating ground-breaking science into genomic therapies using its platform technologies in genome editing, gene therapy, gene regulation and cell therapy. The company got a shot in the arm earlier this year when it entered into an agreement with Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) for the development and commercialization of gene therapy programs for hemophilia A. The agreement saw Sangamo getting an upfront payment of $70 million with the potential to earn significant milestone payments as well as tiered double-digit royalties on net sales. This deal bodes well for the long-term prospects of the company. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s shares are up 468.9% year to date.Early next year, Sangamo expects preliminary proof-of-concept data on SB-525 (hemophilia A), SB-FIX (hemophilia B), SB-318 (MPS I) and SB-319 (MPS II). Other value drivers could be the signing of partnership deals for the company’s central nervous system/tau and oncology assets.Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALNY  -  Free Report): RNAi therapeutics company, Alnylam, is focused on rare genetic, cardio-metabolic, and hepatic infectious diseases. The Zacks Rank #3 company has a strong discovery platform and a deep pipeline including four pipeline candidates that are in late-stage development. Alnylam has agreements with companies like Sanofi and Vir Biotechnology. Alnylam’s shares are up 243.4% year to date on the back of pipeline progress during the year.bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report): bluebird is a clinical-stage company working on developing lentiviral-based gene therapies for serious genetic diseases and T cell-based immunotherapies for cancer. The company’s pipeline includes Lenti-D, currently in a phase II/III study, for the treatment of cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, and LentiGlobin, currently in five studies for the treatment of transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia and severe sickle cell disease. The company’s lead oncology programs, bb2121 and bb21217, are anti-BCMA CAR T programs which are being developed in collaboration with Celgene.bluebird’s shares have been gaining following the presentation of data at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) earlier this year in June. Shares shot up further in August when Gilead announced its intention to acquire immuno-oncology focused Kite Pharma. The Gilead-Kite deal has raised hopes for additional acquisition deals in the immuno-oncology therapeutic area with bluebird considered to be an attractive acquisition target. bluebird is also a Zacks Rank #3 stock and its shares are up 191.6% year to date.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3455,GILD,"The year 2017 has been quite a impressive one for the biotech sector as evident from the 19.4% gain registered so far by the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (^. This is surely welcome news for investors since the industry suffered a decline of 19.2% last year.While drug pricing issue, competition and a slowdown in growth of key drugs dented the sector’s 2016 performance, new drug approvals and encouraging outlook by the companies boosted investor sentiment in 2017.Immuno-oncology continued to remain in spotlight in 2017. The FDA’s approval of CAR-T (chimeric antigen T-cell receptor) therapies like Kymriah and Gilead Sciences’ (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta for leukemia and lymphoma shifted investors’ attention toward small biotechs companies developing these therapies. Investors also kept tab of key candidates’ data.The slowdown in mature products forced bigwigs like Gilead to undertake acquisitions to bolster pipelines. Gilead acquired erstwhile Kite Pharma to add Yescarta to its kitty. The company also inked an agreement to acquire Cell Design Labs. Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) too might be on the look-out for acquisitions to bolster its portfolio.Approval of new drugs like Dupixient, Kevzara, Idhifa, Tremfya among others along with label expansion of existing drugs like Cabometyx boosted the respective companies’ portfolios. We note that 2017 saw a larger number of drug approvals from the FDA than 2016.Although the threat of biosimilars loom large on the sector, we expect a further boost in performance from the sector in 2018.  Notably, the Medical - Biomed/Genetics sub-industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 114, which places it at the top 45% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.While the smaller biotechs have performed impressively in 2017, the bigwigs weren’t far behind and we expect the momentum to continue in 2018 as well. Here we list a few biotech companies which should outperform the market in 2018:ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ACAD  -  Free Report)’s lead drug Nuplazid is approved for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease psychosis. The drug was approved in 2016 by the FDA. Notably, it is the only drug approved in the United States for this condition. The drug generated sales of $81.3 million in the first nine months of 2017 and the company is looking to expand the drug’s label further. 2017 was a roller-coaster ride for Acadia. Shares of the company have moved up 5.6% year-to-date compared with the industry’s  gain of 4.8%. We believe this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company should perform well in 2018 boosted by Nulpazid.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. (Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018?

3456,GILD,"Key highlights of the week include FDA’s acceptance of Regeneron/Sanofi's Dupixent sBLA for asthma, Biogen/AbbVie’s decision to withdraw multiple sclerosis drug, Zinbryta, due to risk of liver failure and Celgene’s completion of Juno acquisition.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesRegeneron/Sanofi's Dupixent sBLA for Asthma Accepted by FDA: Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has accepted for review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) of Dupixent (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults and adolescents (12 years of age or older) with moderate-to-severe asthma. The FDA has set a target action date of Oct 20, 2018 per the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. The sBLA was supported by results from the three pivotal trials from the LIBERTY ASTHMA clinical development program. Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of clinical development programs for diseases driven by Type 2 inflammation, including pediatric atopic dermatitis (phase III), nasal polyps (phase III) and eosinophilic esophagitis (phase III).(Read more: FDA Accepts Regeneron/Sanofi's Dupixent sBLA for Asthma)Regeneron is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.

Both companies decided to withdraw the drug on grounds of the complex and evolving benefit/risk profile of Zinbryta, given the limited number of patients being treated.  The drug is currently available in Europe and United States, Switzerland, Canada and Australia. While AbbVie distributes Zinbryta in the United States, Biogen distributes the drug in ex-U.S. markets.  The European regulatory authorities provisionally restricted the use of Zinbryta in adult patients with highly active relapsing disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one DMT or with rapidly evolving severe relapsing MS who are unsuitable for treatment with other DMTs following the report of a case of fatal fulminant liver failure, as well as four cases of serious liver injury.Gilead Reports New Data on Biktarvy: Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) announced encouraging results at 48 weeks from a phase III study (Study 1961) among 470 virologically suppressed adult women with HIV infection at the International Workshop on HIV and Women and at the 2018 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (“CROI”) in Boston (Poster 2539). Biktarvy was found to be statistically non-inferior to regimens containing a bPI or boosted elvitegravir and demonstrated no treatment-emergent resistance at 48 weeks in the ongoing study. Biktarvy, Gilead’s latest triple therapy, was approved by the FDA in February 2018 as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults who have no antiretroviral treatment history.(Read more: Gilead Announces Positive Data on New HIV Therapy Biktarvy)Celgene Completes Juno Acquisition: Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announced that it has completed the previously-announced acquisition of Juno Therapeutics, Inc for $9 billion Juno focuses on the development of CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T and TCR (T cell receptor) therapeutics with a promising pipeline evaluating multiple targets and cancer indications. The acquisition will add JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel) to Celgene’s lymphoma pipeline. JCAR017 is a best-in-class CD19-directed CAR-T currently in a pivotal program for relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The candidate is expected to obtain regulatory approval in the United States in 2019 with potential global peak sales of approximately $3 billion. PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 4.52% over the last five trading sessions.

3457,GILD,"The year 2017 has been better than expected for the biotech sector. The NASDAQ Biotechnology index was up 18.7% in 2017. While drug pricing issue, competition and a slowdown in growth of key drugs are expected to remain a hangover in 2018 as well, approval of new drugs and strategic acquisitions by several big wigs in 2017 are likely to boost investors’ sentiments. Thus 2018 needless to say, holds promise for generating stellar returns.The slowdown in mature products compelled bigwigs like Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) to undertake acquisitions to bolster pipelines. Gilead acquired erstwhile Kite Pharma and added Yescarta to its kitty. The company also inked an agreement to acquire Cell Design Labs. Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(CELG  -  Free Report) inked a deal to acquire Impact Biomedicines for an upfront amount of $1.1 billion. The acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to Celgene’s pipeline.  The candidate is being developed for the treatment of myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. Celgene was on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions given a lacklustre 2017, having suffered a few pipeline setbacks and weakness in Otezla sales.

The company recently won the FDA approval for the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) of Xvega to expand the drug’s label for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #3.Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) is another biotech which looks poised for growth in 2018.

The drug has performed impressively since approval in 2016. Exelixis currently carries a Zacks Rank #1.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (ALXN  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well and the FDA approval of the drug for generalized myasthenia gravis will further boost sales. Among new products, while Strensiq is gaining momentum, the company redefined its strategy for Kanuma.  Alexion carries a Zacks Rank #3.Investors should also keep an eye on key upcoming PDUFA dates. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) is looking to expand label for its newly approved drug Dupixent. The drug is already approved for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The company is also evaluating the drug for treating asthma in adults (LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study).  sBLA for the same is expected to be filed shortly.

3458,GILD,"Quite a few pharmaceutical industry mergers – including some large deals - may be in the cards in 2018 now that the tax reforms are in place. The tax bill was signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump in December last yearThe tax rate for corporates will now go down from 35% to 21%, which can boost profits of large drug/biotech companies. Meanwhile, the change in tax code will also allow companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%. Also the tax cuts are expected to prevent inversions, which were rampant in the drug industry.These changes should definitely leave more cash in the hands of drug/biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been few in 2017 compared to 2016.Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) nearly $12 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech Actelion were the only two noteworthy deals of 2017.This week, senior executives from some of the largest pharmaceutical/biotech companies discussed the impact of tax reform on mergers and acquisition and their plans to use the excess cash at the JP Morgan HealthCare conference.What the CEOs Said?Brent Saunders, chief executive officer (CEO) of Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) said that the first half of the year is likely to see smaller deals such as the one by Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) while the bigger high profile mergers of large pharmaceuticals/biotech companies would probably happen in the latter half of the year or next year.Last week, Celgene announced that it has offered to buy a small cancer drug developer, Impact Biomedicines. (Read More: Celgene to Acquire Impact Biomedicines to Boost Pipeline).Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) CEO Dave Ricks and J&J’s Chief Financial Officer, Dominic Caruso said that with the tax cuts, American companies can compete better with their foreign counterparts, which operate in better tax environments. Caruso said the new tax law provides “more flexibility and ease of analysis in terms of getting a transaction done”.Along the same lines, Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) CEO, Meg Tirrell, said that having access to overseas cash will give it more financial flexibility to “think about different ways to go about the M&A transactions”. Tirrell, however, confidently said that even before the new tax law was implemented, the company had “enough power in their balance sheet” to make the bolt-on acquisitions it wanted to do.Michel Vounatsos, Biogen's (BIIB  -  Free Report) CEO, smartly argued that though the tax overhaul may spur some M&A activity, the rationale behind any M&A activity should not be the cash available. He went on to say that they are looking at “all sets of potential targets”.Gilead CEO, John Milligan, said that the tax reform is good for the company as it “allows to plan for the long term” since the FDA approval process is quite lengthy. Meanwhile, it maintained its goal of investing in M&A to replenish the pipeline. He also said that the excess cash will allow it to clean up its balance sheet by repaying debt.Conclusion Overall, it is quite clear that the drug industry is optimistic that the tax reform will fuel greater M&A activity in 2018.As it is, major drug/biotech players struggling with organic growth need an infusion of new growth drivers in their pipeline/product portfolios — either from internal development or from buyouts. Strategic M&A and licensing deals are therefore inevitable for innovation starved drug/biotech companies looking for growth in a highly competitive and global marketplace.Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash may prefer to buy innovative small/mid cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines. What matters for companies looking to buy a drug/biotech stock is the current sales performance of the latter’s drugs/products, prospects of sales growth, and the quality of the pipeline.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3459,GILD,"More earnings reports hit the tape this afternoon, following a day that showed some significant push-back on the big market sell-off of the last three regular sessions. Will these companies reporting after the close -- The Walt Disney Co. (DIS  -  Free Report), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report), Snap Inc. (SNAP  -  Free Report) and Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) -- catch a break in after-hours trading?Disney topped expectations on its top and bottom lines Tuesday, posting $1.89 per share on $15.35 billion in revenues, ahead of the $1.62 per share and $15.24 billion expected. Quarterly sales were up 4% overall, buoyed by a 13% increase in Parks & Resorts. This was augmented somewhat by lower figures in Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products/Interactive Media. Shares are trading up 2.8% in the late session. For more on DIS's earnings, click here.Chipotle, on the other hand, put up mixed Q4 results, beating easily on the bottom line -- $1.55 per share vs. $1.33 expected -- while narrowly missing on the top -- $1.1 billion vs. the $1.12 billion we had been expecting. But comparable store sales (comps) from the year-ago quarter were a disappointing +0.9%, and comps guidance for the coming year is for ""low single digits."" Nevertheless, we see shares trading up 1.2% in after-hours.

3462,GILD,"This week, the focus is on the 36th annual J.P. Morgan healthcare conference where several biotech and pharma companies provided a preliminary look at their results for 2017 and have also provided pipeline updates as well as their outlooks for 2018. Meanwhile, Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) was in the news with the company announcing its intention to acquire Impact Biomedicines.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesCelgene to Buy Impact: Celgene has started the year with an acquisition announcement – the company will be acquiring Impact Biomedicines, which is developing fedratinib for myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. The deal terms include an upfront payment of approximately $1.1 billion and contingent payments of up to $1.25 billion based on the achievement of regulatory approval milestones for myelofibrosis. Celgene could make additional payments based on approvals for label expansion and the achievement of sales-based milestones. Plans are on to submit a new drug application to the FDA in mid-2018. Celgene is looking to boost its pipeline with this acquisition. The company had a rough 2017 with shares declining 12.1% over the last one year. Issues like pipeline setbacks as well as the weak performance of Otezla have been weighing on the stock (Read more: Celgene to Acquire Impact Biomedicines to Boost Pipeline).Key Takeaways from J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference: Several biotech companies were present at the 36th annual J.P. Morgan healthcare conference. Most of these companies provided a preliminary look at fourth quarter results and their outlook for 2018. Among key updates, Acorda (ACOR  -  Free Report) could start facing generic competition for its flagship drug, Ampyra, any time after Jul 30, 2018. The company is currently seeking FDA approval for Inbrija for which a response could be out in February (Read more: Acorda's Shares Down on Disappointing Ampyra View for 2018). Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report), which holds a strong position in the cystic fibrosis (“CF”) market, is looking to strengthen its position further with the potential approval of tezacaftor/ivacaftor in the United States – a decision from the FDA is expected on Feb 28, 2018. Vertex could also be one of the companies that will pursue acquisition deals this year.

The candidate failed to meet the primary efficacy endpoints in studies that were conducted in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (“DLB”) and patients with dementia and gait impairment. Based on this, Axovant has decided to discontinue the development of intepirdine.This is not the first time that Axovant has faced a setback in its development efforts for intepirdine. Last year in September, the company had said that intepirdine failed to meet its co-primary efficacy endpoints in a late-stage study being conducted in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (""AD"") patients who were receiving background donepezil therapy. At that time too, the company’s shares had plunged significantly (73.9%). Axovant’s shares are down 81.7% over the last one year compared to the 3.3% decline recorded by the industry it belongs to.Regeneron & Sanofi Boost R&D Investment in Dupixent and Cemiplimab: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi have decided to boost their investment in the development of cemiplimab (a PD-1 antibody) in oncology and Dupixent (an IL-4/IL-13 pathway-blocking antibody) in type 2 allergic diseases. Based on this decision, investment in cemiplimab will shoot up to at least $1.64 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion from the initial agreement, with both companies contributing equally. Cemiplimab is being studied as monotherapy as well as in combination with other therapies in a wide range of cancers including advanced skin cancers, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer and lymphomas. Regulatory applications for cemiplimab in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma are scheduled to be submitted in the European Union and the United States in the first quarter of 2018.  Meanwhile, Dupixent, currently approved for eczema, has the potential to be evaluated for additional indications including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peanut allergy and grass allergy and in patients who have multiple allergic conditions. This is in addition to ongoing development in pediatric atopic dermatitis, pediatric asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis and nasal polyposis. Regeneron and Sanofi are currently seeking FDA approval for Dupixent in uncontrolled, persistent asthma in patients at least 12 years old.Another candidate that should benefit from the additional investment is REGN3500, an IL-33 antibody, with potential indications including atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.AbbVie Eczema Drug Gets BTD: AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) investigational, once-daily oral JAK1-selective inhibitor, upadacitinib, has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”) by the FDA for use in adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy.Breakthrough Therapy Designation helps fasten the development and review of drugs which are being evaluated for the treatment of serious conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may be substantially better than existing treatments on clinically significant endpoint(s). Upadacitinib is scheduled to move into a late-stage program for atopic dermatitis in the first half of the year (Read more: AbbVie's Upadacitinib Gains Breakthrough Therapy Designation).PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declined 0.3% over the last four trading sessions.

3463,GILD,"2017 turned out to be a notable year for the pharma and biotech industry with the FDA giving its nod to 46 novel drugs as well as several biological license applications (“BLA”) including for path-breaking cancer treatments like Kymriah and Yescarta. This number compares favorably not only to 2016 when just 22 novel drugs were approved, but to earlier years as well. A look at the chart below shows that the highest number of approvals recorded since 1993 was in 1996 when 53 novel drugs were approved.According to the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”), a higher number of new applications were submitted in 2017 compared to five year averages. As of Nov 30, 2017, all regulatory applications that were approved in 2017 met their PDUFA goal dates with quite a few approvals coming ahead of the FDA action date. About 88% of these drugs were approved in the first review cycle with 70% being approved under priority review status. As of Nov 30, 2017, the approval action rate was 82%.Many of the drugs approved in 2017 had also gained Breakthrough Therapy designation – while 17 breakthrough therapies were approved last year (as of Nov 30, 2017), since inception, 192 Breakthrough Therapy designations have been granted by the CDER out of a total of 529 requests (as of Nov 30, 2017). A major part of the Breakthrough Therapy requests are for cancer drugs followed by hematology and antiviral.Landmark decisions last year include the approval of a couple of gene-based therapies for cancer – Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah and Gilead Sciences’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta. These therapies have the potential to change the way we look at cancer treatments.Other key approvals included Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report)/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Many of these drugs have blockbuster potential.What’s in Store for 2018?The FDA intends to continue working on the recruitment and hiring of new drugs program staff. The agency will also work on the continued implementation of new PDUFA VI and BsUFA II agreements, other aspects of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (“FDARA”) and the 21st Century Cures Act. The 21st Century Cures Act is expected to encourage more innovation in the sector and, maybe, a surge in new drug approvals.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Some of the key drugs currently under FDA review with decisions expected in the coming months include Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) investigational migraine drug, Aimovig (target action date of May 17, 2018), Dova Pharmaceuticals’s avatrombopag, and GW Pharmaceuticals’s (GWPH  -  Free Report) Epidiolex (cannabidiol or CBD), an investigational treatment for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (“LGS”) and Dravet syndrome. Epidiolex is currently under priority review for these two rare and difficult to treat conditions of childhood-onset epilepsy with a response from the FDA expected on Jun 27, 2018. Dova’s avatrombopag is also under priority review for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic liver disease (“CLD”) who are scheduled to undergo a procedure – a response from the regulatory body is expected on May 21, 2018.Amgen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

3465,GILD,"2017 has been a banner year for the U.S. stock market and the trend is likely to continue next year. The tax reform will act as a major driving factor for stocks coupled with strong corporate earnings and accelerating economic growth in many parts of the world.As Christmas tree symbolizes good tidings, let’s build a similar tree for stock-loving investors that could rake in big gains in 2018.Starting with the base – the most valuable portion of the tree – the technology sector seems  to be a perfect fit here as it is placed in the top 6% among the 16 broad Zacks sectors. Within the Industry classification, Semiconductor – General is expected to outperform. Being a cyclical sector, it tends to move higher with market rallies. New areas such as autonomous cars, cloud computing, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence continued to fuel exceptional growth.Intel INTC having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) seems an excellent pick. The stock saw solid earnings estimate revision of 19 cents for the next year over the past 90 days and falls in the Industry having a Zacks Rank in the top 1%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The stocks that can form the leaves of the tree are Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) from the basic materials sector and Acco Brand Corporation ACCO from industrial products sector. Both the sectors are expected to benefit from Trump’s pro-growth policies, especially big spending in infrastructure and thus carry a sector Rank in the top 13%.Westlake Chemical has a Zacks Rank #1 and is part of an industry with a Rank in the top 10%. It has seen solid earnings estimate revision of $1.32 for the next year over the past 90 days with an expected growth rate of 21.67%. On the other hand, Acco Brand saw positive earnings estimate of 4 cents for the next year over the past 90 days, with an expected earnings estimate of 6.98%. It has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and Industry Rank in the top 1%.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)For the top layer, we have selected the energy sector, which is expected to be the largest contributor to 2018 S&P 500 earnings with 33.3% growth. HollyFrontier Corporation HFC seems an intriguing pick in this sector having a Rank in the top 25%. The stock saw solid earnings estimate revision of 79 cents for the next year over the past 90 days with an expected earnings growth rate of 20.87%. It has a Zacks Rank #1 with an Industry Rank in the top 20%.At the very top is the star stock of 2017 with a Zacks Rank #1. XOMA Corporation XOMA has soared nearly 692% this year so far with room for more upside next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has moved up from a loss of $1.31 to a loss of 42 cents. Rising earnings estimates indicate analysts’ optimistic view on earnings, indicating higher chances of outperformance. Additionally, the stock boasts a solid Industry Rank in the top 45%.Now that we are done with the tree’s structure, it’s time to decorate it with bells, candies, lights and chocolates. For these, we can concentrate on areas expected to benefit most from the tax reform.Bells and candies could be the companies that are poised to benefit from tax policies to bring offshore cash home at reduced tax. The top five U.S. hoarders are from the tech sector - Apple AAPL, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) - that hold 88% of their money overseas, according to Moody’s. Drug makers like Amgen Inc. AMGN, Gilead Sciences GILD, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Merck & Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) also stash huge cash offshore and are likely to gain from tax repatriation policy. All these stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Banking stocks could be the fairy lights on the tree that will light up on the dual tailwinds of rising rates and tax cuts. According to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, tax cuts will add 16% to median bank earnings in 2018 and 18% in 2019 while AB Bernstein sees earnings per share jumping 12-20% at large banks and 15-25% at mid-caps banks in 2018. While there are several choices, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and Industry Rank in the top 34%. The company is expected to generate double-digit earnings growth next year.Small cap stocks that pay the highest effective tax rate could be the sweet treats, as these will be the biggest beneficiaries of the corporate tax cut. According to Thompson Reuters data, companies in the Russell 2000 pay a median effective tax rate of 31.9%, while larger multinationals in the S&P 500 pay 28% and 30 mega-cap stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average pay 23.8%. Additionally, these tend to outperform in a rising rate environment. Given this, a spread of top-ranked stocks with 2018 double-digit earnings growth potential include Upland Software, Inc. (UPLD  -  Free Report), Farmers & Merchants Bancorp Inc. (FMAO  -  Free Report), Geopark Ltd GPRK and PetMed Express Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report). All these stocks doubled this year.And voila, the tree is up!

3466,GILD,"Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report), is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Feb 6, after the market closes.Gilead, a leader in the hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) space, has a mixed track record, with the company beating estimates in three of the last four and missing in one. Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 8.6%. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 9.1%. Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Gilead Sciences, Inc. Quote Gilead’s stock has rallied 12.8% over a year compared with the industry's gain of 6.0%.  Factors at PlayConcurrent with the third-quarter earnings call, Gilead updated its annual guidance. Gilead expects net product sales in the range of $24.5-$25.5 billion, up from $24.0-$25.5 billion provided earlier. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $16 billion and $16.5 billion (earlier projection: $15.5 billion and $16 billion).Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (“TAF”) based products — Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the fourth quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch. This should drive the non-HCV product sales.  The TAF-based regimens now represent 56% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is also expected to boost sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Genvoya is $1058 million. However, Gilead lost exclusivity for Viread in some countries outside the United States which might impact sales.HCV product sales are projected between $8.5 billion and $9.0 billion (earlier projection: $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion).  The HCV franchise continues to be under competitive and pricing pressure leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales. Harvoni and Sovaldi has been facing competition from AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others. While patient starts have exceeded expectations in 2017, competition has started to erode Gilead's market share and net pricing. The company saw some impact of this in the third quarter but most of it was due to be experienced in the fourth quarter.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of lead HCV drug Sovaldi and Harvoni are $141 million and $614 million, respectively. The HCV portfolio received a major boost when Epclusa gained approval in 2016. The FDA also approved Vosevi tablets as a single-tablet regimen (“STR”) for the re-treatment of chronic HCV infection in adults.Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are now projected in the range of $3.3-$3.4 billion and $3.3-$3.4 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 86-87%. Earnings per share are now projected around $1.02-$1.17 (earlier projection: 86-93 cents).Meanwhile, the Kite acquisition was a step in the right direction with the FDA approval of its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. However, management stated that Yescarta launch will be a controlled launch to ensure patient safety as CAR-T therapy is complicated and can sometimes be associated with severe side effects.We expect the management to throw more light on the same during the fourth-quarter’s call. Investors are also likely to keep an eye on other pipeline updates.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Gilead will beat on earnings this quarter.

3467,GILD,"2017 turned out to be a notable year for the pharma and biotech industry with the FDA giving its nod to 46 novel drugs as well as several biological license applications (“BLA”) including for path-breaking cancer treatments like Kymriah and Yescarta. This number compares favorably not only to 2016 when just 22 novel drugs were approved, but to earlier years as well.Other key approvals last year include Lilly’s Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s (BMRN  -  Free Report) Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Many of these drugs have blockbuster potential.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of February.FDA Decision for AMAG’s Makena and Feraheme: AMAG Pharmaceuticals (AMAG  -  Free Report) is seeking FDA approval for a subcutaneous auto-injector version of Makena - the drug-device combination product, if approved on the PDUFA date of February 14, would offer the convenience of using a ready-to-administer subcutaneous auto-injector while providing patients with an alternative option to an intramuscular injection. Makena is currently available as an intramuscular injection for reducing the risk of preterm birth in women who are pregnant with one baby and who spontaneously delivered one preterm baby in the past.  The approval of this product would help AMAG extend the patent life of Makena which is scheduled to lose orphan drug exclusivity on February 3. While AMAG is ready to launch an authorized generic along with a partner in February itself, the company does not expect a generic competitor to enter the market until later in 2018. If the drug-device combination product is approved, the company will apply for Orange Book listing of the patents for the device.Meanwhile, the FDA is expected to issue a decision regarding the label expansion of Feraheme on February 2. AMAG is looking to expand the label beyond the current chronic kidney disease (“CKD”) indication to include all eligible adult patients with iron deficiency anemia (“IDA”).Priority Review for Gilead’s HIV Treatment: Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) is also awaiting a decision from the FDA this month for its new drug application (“NDA”) for an investigational, fixed-dose combination of bictegravir (50 mg) (“BIC”), an integrase strand transfer inhibitor, and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (200/25 mg) (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. The NDA is under priority review with a decision expected on February 12. With the company’s hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) franchise seeing declining sales, Gilead is focusing on its HIV franchise for growth. The company’s HIV portfolio includes drugs like Genvoya, Truvada, Atripla, Descovy, Odefsey, Complera and Stribild which contributed approximately $9.5 billion to total sales in the first nine months of 2017. Gilead’s TAF-based products like Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey remain key growth drivers.Will Vertex Boost its CF Portfolio with an FDA Approval This Month? Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report) is a key player in the cystic fibrosis (“CF”) market with two products, Orkambi and Kalydeco, in its CF portfolio. The company is looking to strengthen its position in this area further with the potential approval of a tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination treatment that is under priority review with a decision from the FDA expected on February 28. The combination treatment is under review for use in CF patients (12 years and older) who have two copies of the F508del mutation or one F508del mutation and one residual function mutation that is responsive to the treatment.The approval of this combination would be a major boost for Vertex’s CF portfolio which is expected to deliver revenues in the range of $2.1 - $2.15 billion in 2017. Currently, about 31,000 patients are eligible for treatment under the company’s CF portfolio with the number expected to grow to 44,000 in 2018 on the back of EU reimbursement for Orkambi, label expansion for the drug and the potential approval of the tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination.Vertex’s shares are up 94% over the last one year, outperforming the 10% rally of the industry it belongs to. Vertex is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (VRX  -  Free Report) also expects to hear from the FDA about the approval status of Plenvu, a bowel cleanser used in preparation for colonoscopies (FDA action date: February 13). Moreover, companies like KemPharm and Apricus expect a response from the FDA this month for their resubmitted NDAs. While KemPharm has a PDUFA date of February 23 for Apadaz (an immediate-release, abuse-deterrent hydrocodone/acetaminophen combination product candidate), Apricus will get to know the approval status of its resubmitted Vitaros (topically delivered treatment for erectile dysfunction) NDA on February 17.Meanwhile, the FDA’s Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee will be meeting on February 14 to discuss Pacira Pharmaceuticals’s (PCRX  -  Free Report) supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for Exparel (bupivacaine liposomal injectable suspension), to produce local analgesia and as a nerve block to produce regional analgesia.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

3468,GILD,"ImmunoGen, Inc. (IMGN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 4 before the market opens. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 42.86%.ImmunoGen’s earnings performance has been a mixed bag in the recent past. The company surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters, missing the same in the other two. Overall, ImmunoGen pulled off an average negative surprise of 0.50%.Shares of ImmunoGen have significantly outperformed the industry  so far this year. The stock has skyrocketed 71.1% against the industry’s decrease of 2.1%. Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayIn absence of an approved product in ImmunoGen’s portfolio, investors’ focus should remain on the company’s progress with its lead pipeline candidate, mirvetuximab soravtansine, and other programs.ImmunoGen has significantly advanced with respect to mirvetuximab soravtansine. Recently, the company successfully completed the interim analysis of a phase III study (FORWARD I), evaluating the candidate as a single-agent therapy for treating patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, whose tumors express high or medium levels of FR alpha. The company has also finished full enrollment of the trial two months ahead of schedule and expects top-line results from the program during the first half of 2019.Also, combination regimens with mirvetuximab soravtansine to address ovarian cancer are in phase Ib/II FORWARD II study. The trial consists of cohorts assessing mirvetuximab soravtansine in combination with Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Avastin and Merck’s Keytruda. Initial findings from the study demonstrated that the candidate has potential to complement all available therapies for the indication. Updated outcomes from the program are expected in the first half of 2018.Apart from mirvetuximab soravtansine, ImmunoGen is working to develop a couple of early-stage candidates including IMGN779 and IMGN632. Last December, the company presented positive results from the ongoing phase I study, evaluating IMGN779 on patients with relapsed or refractory adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at the annual meeting of American Society of Hematology. Moreover, this January, the company moved IMGN632 into phase I study to treat hematological malignancies including AML.Per fourth-quarter 2017 earnings call, the company issued its cash guidance for 2018, anticipating cash and cash equivalents in the range of $115-$120 million by the end of December 2018. ImmunoGen had then stated that it hoards enough funds to run its operations through the fourth quarter of 2019.What the Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that ImmunoGen is likely to beat estimates this reporting cycle. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: ImmunoGen has an Earnings ESP of -3.07%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate of a loss of 28 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 27 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: ImmunoGen has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.ImmunoGen, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise ImmunoGen, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | ImmunoGen, Inc. Quote Stocks to ConsiderTwo health care stocks with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around are as follows:Gilead Sciences, Inc.

3469,GILD,"This week, focus was on data presented at the annual conference of the American Society of Hematology (""ASH"") from December 9-12 with some companies emerging winners while others lost ground on disappointing data.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesASH Roundup: Several companies were at ASH with data on approved and pipeline drugs. While some companies soared on data, others were hit by disappointing results.One of the companies that scored a win was bluebird (BLUE  -  Free Report), which along with partner Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report), announced updated results from an ongoing phase I study of bb2121 anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy in patients with late stage relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The companies said that the overall response rate (“ORR”) was 94% in patients in active dose cohorts while a complete response (“CR”) rate of 56% observed in patients in active dose cohorts. Bluebird’s shares shot up 15.2% while Celgene gained 1.8% (Read more: Bluebird's Shares Jump on Strong Data for CAR-T Therapy). bluebird is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Kite, a Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) company, was also there at ASH with updated results from the ongoing phase I/II ZUMA-3 study of KTE-C19, a CAR T cell therapy, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”). High rates of response were observed – 71% of ALL patients on KTE-C19 achieved complete tumor remission. Long-term data was also presented on Yescarta from the pivotal ZUMA-1 study in patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. 42% of patients continued to respond to therapy including 40% in complete remission, at a median follow-up of 15.4 months. Yescarta was approved in the United States recently and is currently under review in the EU with potential approval expected in the first half of 2018 (Read more: Gilead Posts Updated Data on CAR-T Therapy Yescarta).Juno Therapeutics , another major name in the CAR T category, provided additional data from the TRANSCEND study on JCAR017 in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although data looked good, shares declined reflecting investor expectation for better results. The company expects to finish submitting a regulatory application in the United States in the second half of 2018, with approval expected as early as the end of 2018 (Read more: Juno Reports Additional Data on CAR-T Therapy, Shares Drop).Another company that was hit by ASH data is Spark Therapeutics (ONCE  -  Free Report) which saw it shares plunging 34.9% on preliminary data on its investigational hemophilia A treatment, SPK-8011 (Read more: Spark Therapeutics Stock Plunges on Hemophilia Therapy Data).Gilead to Buy Cell Design Labs, Strengthen Cellular Therapy Efforts: Gilead announced its next acquisition deal which comes a few months after the company acquired Kite Pharma for approximately $11.9 billion. This time round, Gilead is acquiring Cell Design Labs, Inc., with the deal expected to add new technology platforms to Gilead’s portfolio. Gilead will shell out up to $567 million including an upfront payment of approximately $175 million. Additional payments of up to $322 million will be made on the occurrence of certain events, including the achievement of development and approval milestones. With this acquisition, Gilead is looking to enhance its R&D efforts in cellular therapy (Read more: Gilead Sciences to Acquire Cell Design Labs for $567 Million)).Vertex Selects First Gene Edited Treatment under CRISPR Collaboration: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report) announced the selection of CTX001 as the first gene edited treatment that will be co-developed and co-commercialized under its agreement with CRISPR Therapeutics. The companies will split all R&D costs and profits worldwide. The plan is to commence a phase I/II study in Europe for β-thalassemia in 2018 while an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application will be submitted in the United States to support the commencement of a phase I/II study in sickle cell disease.Meanwhile, on the cystic fibrosis (“CF”) front, Vertex said that Kalydeco met the primary endpoint in an open-label phase III study in children (1 to 2 years of age) with CF. Vertex expects to file for approval in the United States and the EU for this patient population in the first quarter of 2018 (Read more: Vertex Kalydeco Study Successful in Children Aged 1-2 Years). Vertex’s shares are up 91.3% year to date, compared to the 3% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Repros to be acquired by Allergan: Repros Therapeutics saw its shares gaining 41.5% on news that it will be acquired by Allergan for a cash payment of 67 cents per share. The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. With this acquisition, Allergan is looking to boost its women’s health pipeline. However, Repros’s Proellex ran into trouble with the program being placed on partial clinical hold, and the FDA asking for a large pre-approval safety data base to support future development. PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 2.4% over the last five trading sessions. Among major biotech stocks, Celgene gained 6.3% while Amgen declined 1.4%.

3470,GILD,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announced that it will acquire Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  for $87 per share in cash, or a total of approximately $9 billion, net of cash and marketable securities acquired. The former already owns approximately 9.7% of outstanding shares of Juno.Details of the AgreementThe transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. Celgene expects to fund the transaction through a combination of existing cash and new debt.  The acquisition is expected to dilute the company’s bottom line in 2018 by approximately 50 cents and is expected to be incrementally additive to net product sales in 2020.Strategic Value of the AcquisitionThe acquisition is expected to position Celgene as a prominent company in the cellular immunotherapy space. Juno focuses on the development of CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T and TCR (T cell receptor) therapeutics with a promising pipeline evaluating multiple targets and cancer indications. The acquisition will add JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel) to Celgene’s lymphoma pipeline. JCAR017 is a best-in-class CD19-directed CAR-T currently in a pivotal program for relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).  The candidate is expected to obtain regulatory approval in the United States in 2019 with potential global peak sales of approximately $3 billion. Other candidate include JCARH125 for multiple myelomaCelgene already has a collaboration and investment agreement with Juno for the development and commercialization of immunotherapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases. We remind investors that Celgene and Juno entered into a strategic collaboration in June 2015 whereby the companies will leverage T cell therapeutic strategies to develop treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases with an initial focus on CAR-T and TCR technologies. Celgene exercised its option to develop and commercialize the Juno CD19 program outside North America and China in April 2016.Our TakeCelgene is on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions given a lacklustre 2017. We note that the slowdown in mature products compelled prominent biotechs to acquire smaller ones with promising pipelines. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) acquired Kite Pharma and subsequently obtained FDA approval of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), the latter’s chimeric CAR-T therapy candidate. Celgene’s stock has tumbled 8.6% over a year as against the industry’s gain of 10.3%. Celgene suffered a series of setbacks over the last few months. The company suffered a setback when a late stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Rituxan failed. The threat of generic competition is also looming large on Revlimid which loses patent protection in 2022 forcing Celgene to look for acquisitions.In January 2018, Celgene announced to acquire Impact Biomedicines for an upfront amount of $1.1 billion. The acquisition will add a late stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to Celgene’s pipeline.  The candidate is being developed for the treatment of myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. Fedratinib demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the primary and secondary endpoints of splenic response and total symptom score, respectively in a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III pivotal trial (JAKARTA-1) for treatment-naïve MF.The CAR-T therapy space was in the spotlight in 2017 as the FDA approved the first CAR-T therapy, Kymriah for the treatment of patients upto 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in second or later relapse stage.Given the immense potential of the therapy, Celgene too wants to go the Gilead way.  Meanwhile, Celgene also has a partnership with bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report) for CAR-T therapy candidates.However, the acquisition of Juno might be a risky proposition for Celgene.  Juno has faced setbacks with its pipeline candidate, JCAR015. In July 2016, Juno suffered a huge setback with the FDA placing a clinical hold on the company’s phase II study (ROCKET) on JCAR015 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL). The hold was placed after two patients died within a week due to severe neurotoxicity following the addition of fludarabine to the pre-conditioning regimen. While the hold was lifted a week later and the study resumed under a revised protocol, the company voluntarily placed the study on hold again in November 2016 after two patients suffered cerebral edema. Subsequently, in March 2017, Juno announced that it has discontinued the development of the candidate. Moreover, the price of $87 per share represents a huge premium from Juno’s share price of $45.60 when the rumors of the acquisition had surfaced.The biotech sector is likely to see a lot happening in the M&A front in 2018 given a dull 2017.Zacks RankCelgene currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3471,GILD,"Gilead Sciences’ (GILD  -  Free Report) subsidiary Kite announced that it has entered into a collaboration with Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) to evaluate a combination of its newly approved CAR-T therapy Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) and Pfizer's utomilumab, a 4-1BB agonist, for refractory large B-cell lymphoma.A phase I/II study is expected to begin in 2018 and will be sponsored by Kite. The results of the study will be used to find options for further development of this combination, or similar combinations between Kite’s engineered T-cell products and utomilumab.Gilead’s stock has increased 13.4% in the year so far, compared with the industry’s 3.8% gain. Yescarta was approved in October 2017 as the second (CAR) T cell therapy to get FDA approval. The first CAR-T therapy — Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah received approval by the FDA in August 2017. Yescarta is the first CAR-T therapy indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy.Pfizer is developing utomilumab, also known as PF-05082566, in both hematologic cancers and solid tumors as a single agent and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies.We remind investors that Kite was acquired by Gilead in October 2017. Kite was a pioneer in cell therapy, having developed engineered cell therapies that express either a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or an engineered T-cell receptor (TCR), depending on the type of cancer. The acquisition diversified Gilead’s portfolio and positioned the company in a dominant position in cellular therapy space.The CAR-T therapy space has remained in investor focus in 2017, courtesy of immense potential. CAR-T cell therapy is expected to be revolutionary in cancer treatment. Another company that also develops CAR-T therapy is Juno Therapeutics, Inc. , whose most advanced pipeline candidates include JCAR017 and JCAR014. Juno was also in the news recently after reports surfaced that it will be acquired by Celgene Corporation.Another clinical-stage company committed to developing CAR-T therapy is bluebird bio, Inc., whose lead oncology programs, bb2121 and bb21217, are anti-BCMA CAR T programs which are being developed in collaboration with Celgene.Gilead Sciences, Inc.

3472,GILD,"The biotech sector has been attracting a lot of investor attention lately. This sector is expected to continue benefiting from increased M&A activities, new drug approvals, better R&D and innovations.Although the sector took a beating last year owing to drug-price controls and Trump’s plans of tackling the ever-surging drug prices getting highlighted in his latest budget, growing demand for drugs, especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending should benefit the industry.U.S. Economy BackdropU.S. markets recently suffered a sell-off owing to fears of rising rates. The S&P 500 entered correction territory, as it declined more than 10% from the record high set in January. Strong wage growth and jobs data introduced fears of inflation making a comeback and led investors to bet on aggressive rate hikes.Consumer prices increased 2.1% year over year in January, unchanged from the previous month but above economists’ forecasts of 1.9%. Moreover, President Donald Trump’s tax reform and spending deal might create further pressure on prices. Hence, the Fed is expected to hike interest rates multiple times this year to tame inflation.Jerome Powell’s testimony was seen indicative of the possibility of Fed raising rates more than three times in 2018. “In gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the FOMC will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing PCE [personal consumption expenditures] price inflation to 2% on a sustained basis,” per a Financial Times article, citing a statement by Powell.As such, when the markets are suffering from the anticipated rate hikes, the non-cyclical nature of biotech stocks might seem appealing to investors. Moreover, encouraging industry trends and positive earnings are poised to benefit the ETFs exposed to the said sector (read: Biotech Crushing the Market: Best ETFs & Stocks YTD).Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sector.SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to the biotech space and tracks the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index. It has AUM of $4.9 billion and charges a fee of 35 basis points a year. It has 108 holdings and bears less concentration risk as less than 19% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.The fund’s top three holdings are Bioverativ Inc. , Array BioPharma Inc. (ARRY  -  Free Report) and Juno Therapeutics Inc. , with 2.8%, 2.2% and 2.0% allocation, respectively (as of Feb 26, 2018).  The fund has returned 31.2% in a year and 5.6% year to date. XBI has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy), with a High risk outlook.iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to biotech space and tracks the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index. It has AUM of $9.4 billion and charges a fee of 47 basis points a year. It has 196 holdings and bears concentration risk as more than 52% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.The fund’s top three holdings Are Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD  -  Free Report), Amgen Inc (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Celgene Corp (CELG  -  Free Report), with 8.3%, 8.1% and 7.2% allocation, respectively (as of Feb 26, 2018). The fund has returned 11.1% in a year and 0.7% year to date. IBB has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold), with a High risk outlook.Bottom LineIBB is more popular than XBI, as is evident from its higher AUM. However, XBI may be more appealing to investors owing to its cheaper expense ratio and a better Zacks rank.At the same time, XBI has significantly outperformed IBB when it comes to performance. XBI has returned almost 5.0% more than IBB so far this year, whereas in a year, it outperformed IBB by more than 20.0%. However, investors should note that XBI is focused on providing exposure to small-cap stocks in the space, while IBB is more inclined toward the large-cap players.  Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

On the other hand, Kite will be responsible for all development, manufacturing and commercialization of products under the collaboration. Sangamo shares skyrocketed to a high of $25.40 on the news of the collaboration as investors had lots to cheer for given Gilead’s expertise in the biotech field.CHMP Positive on Amgen’s Xgeva Label Expansion: The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the European Medicines Agency has given a positive opinion to expand the current indication for Amgen’s Xgeva to include skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma. Given the positive results of the phase III study, ‘482, the candidate should get approval for the aforementioned indication.The study results showed Xgeva successfully met the primary endpoint, demonstrating non-inferiority to zoledronic acid in delaying the time to first on-study skeletal-related event in patients with multiple myeloma. The FDA already approved the company’s Supplemental Biologics License Application for XGEVA to expand the currently approved indication for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors to include patients with multiple myeloma in January 2018.Vertex Initiates Phase III Triple Combination Study for CF: Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report), a leader in cystic fibrosis (“CF”) market, announced the initiation of a phase III study, VX-659, tezacaftor and Kalydeco as an investigational triple combination regimen for patients suffering from CF who have one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation. The study is being conducted to support the submission of a NDA in the United States using data from the four-week primary efficacy endpoint together with safety data through 12 weeks of treatment.Earlier in the month, the FDA approved Symdeko for the treatment of the underlying cause of CF in patients aged 12 or older who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene or who have at least one mutation that is responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return  Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 0.79% over the last five trading sessions.

3474,GILD,"Biotech bigwig Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) develops drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (“HIV”), liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) infection and chronic hepatitis B virus (“HBV”) infection, cardiovascular, hematology/oncology and inflammation/respiratory diseases.Apart from blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni and the recently launched Epclusa, primary products at Gilead include Stribild, Viread, Atripla, Complera/Eviplera and Emtriva among others, along with the tenofovir alafenamide (“TAF”)-based products Genvoya, Odefsey and Descovy and newly approved HBV drug, Vemlidy.Gilead had a solid presence in the HCV market. However, the HCV franchise continues to grapple with competitive and pricing pressure leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales. Harvoni and Sovaldi have been facing competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR and Merck‘s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier. Nevertheless, the HCV portfolio received a major boost when Epclusa gained approval in 2016. The FDA also approved Vosevi tablets as a single-tablet regimen (“STR”) for the re-treatment of chronic HCV infection in adults in 2017. Sovaldi recently obtained approval in China. The approval of these new drugs will somewhat offset the decline of legacy drugs.  Gilead’s stock has gained 13.8% in the last six months compared with the industry's gain of 0.5%.The company suffered a decline in HCV sales in the third quarter and same is expected in the fourth quarter as well. HCV product sales were $2.2 billion, down from $3.3 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was mainly attributed to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets, partially offset by higher sales of Epclusa (launched in 2016) and sales of Vosevi (approved in the United States and Europe in July 2017.While patient starts have exceeded expectations in 2017, competition has started to erode Gilead's HCV market share and net pricing. The company saw some impact of this in the third quarter but most of it was due to be experienced in the fourth quarter.  Hence, we expect the older HCV products to continue to witness declining sales.The company expects HCV product sales between $8.5 billion and $9.0 billion in 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of lead HCV drug Sovaldi and Harvoni are $141 million and $614 million, respectively for the fourth quarter.Hence, the weakness in the HCV franchise will adversely impact Gilead’s performance in the fourth quarter. Although Gilead has a mixed track record, with the company beating estimates in three of the last four and missing in one, an earnings beat looks highly unlikely in the fourth quarter given the competitive pressure.

The announcement comes just a few weeks after Novo Nordisk had announced its interest in acquiring Ablynx in a deal valued at approximately €2.6 billion. Ablynx had rejected Novo Nordisk’s offer with the company’s Board saying that the proposal fundamentally undervalued Ablynx and its growth prospects.A look at Ablynx’s pipeline shows that the company could well be in a position to launch its first product, caplacizumab (anti-vWF; acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - aTTP), this year. Caplacizumab is currently under review in the EU while a regulatory application will be filed in the United States in the first half of 2018. The estimated annual market opportunity for aTTP, a life-threatening blood clotting disease, is expected to be about €1.2 billion. The company also has a broad range of partnerships with the potential to generate more than €10.6 billion in milestones plus royalties. Other pipeline candidates also address significant market opportunities. The company has more than 45 programs in its pipeline and eight Nanobodies in clinical development. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2018 (Read more: Sanofi on a Buyout Spree This Month, to Buy Ablynx for $4.8B).Bellicum Down on FDA Clinical Hold: Bellicum Pharmaceuticals’s shares are down almost 30% following the company’s announcement that the FDA has placed a clinical hold on U.S. studies being conducted on BPX-501. The hold was placed after three cases of encephalopathy were deemed as possibly connected to BPX-501. The company said that the cases were complex with certain factors like prior failed transplants, prior history of immunodeficiency, concurrent infection, and administration of rimiducid in combination with other medications.Bellicum is now waiting to receive a formal notice from the FDA as to the steps needed to be taken for the resumption of the studies. The clinical hold will not impact an ongoing registration study in Europe.Seattle Genetics to Boost Pipeline with Cascadian Acquisition: Seattle Genetics announced that it will be acquiring Cascadian Therapeutics for $10 per share in cash, or about $614 million. With this acquisition, slated to close in the first quarter of 2018, Seattle will be adding tucatinib to its pipeline. Tucatinib is an investigational oral, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (“TKI”) that is highly selective for HER2, a growth factor receptor that is overexpressed in several cancers, including breast, colorectal, ovarian and gastric. The candidate is currently in a pivotal phase II program for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer and complements Seattle’s existing pipeline.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index declined 1.5% over the last five trading sessions.

3476,GILD,"Shares of the company bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report), went up almost 17.9% after the company along with its partner Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announced  five  months of  follow-up  data from the ongoing phase I study (n=21) of its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy candidate- bb2121. The open-label phase I CRB-401 study is evaluating the preliminary safety and efficacy of bb2121 in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. The study also aims to identify a dose to use in phase II studies.So far this year, bluebird’s shares have skyrocketed 227%, compared with the industry’s gain of 3%. As of the cutoff date of Oct 2, 2017, 21 patients had been enrolled patients and dosed in the dose-escalation phase of the study in four dose cohorts. The patients in the study were heavily pre-treated and had failed on a median of seven prior lines.Of the 18 patients in the active dose cohorts of the study, 94% achieved an objective response (OR). 56% patients achieved a complete response compared with the CR rate of 27% as shown in the data released at ASCO in June this year. The increase in CR rate from the previous update led to the increase in share price.The study also showed that nine out of ten (90%) of patients evaluable for minimal residual disease (MRD) status were found to be MRD-negative. The study did not reach the median progression free survival (PFS) with median follow up of 40 weeks in active dose cohorts. These encouraging data and the deepening response showed by bb2121 in the study bode well for the candidate and if approved can prove to be a groundbreaking CAR-T therapy in multiple myeloma. However bluebird’s competitor Juno Therapeutics, Inc.   released additional data from the TRANSCEND  phase I study on its CAR-T candidate JCAR017 (in patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The TRANSCEND trial demonstrated that in a high risk patient population, 74% of patients achieved an overall response rate while and 68% achieved CR rate at 3 months.We also note that another company Gilead Sciences Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) CAR-T therapy, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), was approved by the FDA in October for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. Yescarta is the first CAR-T therapy approved by the FDA for this indication.We also note that Novartis breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) received FDA approval for the treatment of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse.bluebird bio, Inc.

3477,GILD,"Shares of Bluebird Bio (BLUE  -  Free Report) were up nearly 20% in early morning trading Monday as investors responded to the company’s announcement that its CAR-T candidate, bb2121, produced encouraging results in patients with a deadly blood cancer.In a presentation at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting this weekend, representatives from Bluebird and bb2121 co-developer Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) revealed that 94% of patients with advanced forms of multiple myeloma exhibited positive responses to the therapy in a recent study. The two companies also reported that at least seven study participants were complete responders.In addition to the therapy’s unprecedented efficacy, bb2121 displayed remarkable safety data. The latest study was relatively small, but Bluebird and Celgene plan to move the therapy into a larger, pivotal-stage trial soon.If the two companies can get bb2121 on the fast-track to approval, the pair would become the third group to bring a CAR-T treatment to market. CAR-T is a newly emerging method of treating cancer that includes making genetic changes to a patient’s immune T-cells and reinjecting them into the body to attack cancer cells.Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah therapy, which treats lymphoblastic leukemia, became the first approved CAR-T therapy in the world in late-August, while Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) large B-cell lymphoma regimen, Yescarta, was approved in October.Gilead acquired Yescarta when it purchased Kite Pharmaceuticals earlier this year, and now Bluebird’s CAR-T progress has many investors hopeful that it will be the latest takeover target in this space.According to a note from Goldman Sachs analysts published in response to Bluebird’s recent results, the firm has emerged as an attractive acquisition candidate because of “its innovative and leading lentiviral-based gene therapy and CAR-T cell platforms backed by positive proof of concept data, which targets large blood disorders beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease and multiple myeloma.”Goldman raised its price target for the stock to $309 from $186. This new call would represent an 80.5% gain from Friday’s close, or an additional 39.5% surge from Monday’s opening price.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

3478,GILD,"Novartis AG‘s (NVS  -  Free Report) supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Kymriah suspension for intravenous infusion, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are ineligible for or relapse after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) has been accepted by the FDA for Priority Review.Moreover, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) also granted accelerated assessment to the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Kymriah for the treatment of children and young adults with r/r B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and for adult patients with r/r DLBCL who are ineligible for ASCT.We remind investors that Kymriah was the first CAR-T therapy to obtain FDA approval in August 2017 for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor ALL that is refractory or in second or later relapse.A novel immunocellular therapy and one-time treatment, Kymriah uses patient's T cells to fight cancer. CAR-T is manufactured for individual patients using their own cells thereby making it different from typical small molecule or biologic therapies. During the treatment, T cells are drawn from a patient's blood. These cells are then reprogrammed in the manufacturing facility to create genetically coded cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor to recognize and fight cancer cells and other B cells expressing a specific antigen. The drug was developed in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania. The approval is a major boost for Novartis given the potential in the CAR-T therapy space.  The approval opens up new frontiers in the treatment of cancer by advancing immunocellular therapy for children and young adults with r/r B-cell ALL which comprises approximately 25% of cancer diagnoses among children under 15 years old and is the most common childhood cancer in the United States. Kymriah has been launched in the United States.The respective designations from the FDA and EMA will expedite the standard review time. Assuming approval from the FDA and EMA, Kymriah will be the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy available for two distinct indications in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and B-cell ALL. The applications were based on data from the sponsored global clinical trial program of Kymriah in children and young adults with r/r B-cell ALL and adult patients with r/r DLBCL demonstrating the efficacy and safety of Kymriah across studies. The results from the pivotal phase II trial, JULIET, served as the basis of the sBLA and MAA for Kymriah in adult patients with r/r DLCBL. Results from the pivotal phase II ELIANA study were submitted as part of the MAA for Kymriah in children and young adults with r/r B-cell ALL.Novartis plans additional regulatory submissions for Kymriah in pediatric and young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL and adult patients with r/r DLBCL beyond the United States and EU in 2018.  Novartis’ stock has rallied 27.2% in the past one year compared with the industry’s 25.7% gain.The CAR-T therapy space was in the spotlight in 2017 with the approval of Kymriah. Subsequently, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) acquired Kite Pharma and obtained FDA approval of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), the latter’s chimeric CAR-T therapy candidate.Meanwhile, rumours surfaced that Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is in advanced talks to acquire Juno Therapeutics .  Juno’s pipeline includes CD19 and CD22 directed CAR T-cell product candidates.Given the immense potential of the therapy, we expect the spotlight in this space in 2018.Zacks RankNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3479,GILD,"Per reports, biotech bigwig Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is looking to acquire smaller biotech Juno Therapeutics .Rationale of the DealCelgene is on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions given a lacklustre 2017.  Celgene suffered a series of setbacks over the last few months. The company suffered a setback when a late stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Rituxan failed.Earlier in Jan 2018, Celgene announced it will acquire Impact Biomedicines for an upfront amount of $1.1 billion. The acquisition will add a late stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to Celgene’s pipeline.  The candidate is being developed for the treatment of myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. Fedratinib demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the primary and secondary endpoints of splenic response and total symptom score, respectively in a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III pivotal trial (JAKARTA-1) for treatment-naïve MF.We note that the slowdown in mature products compelled prominent biotechs to acquire smaller ones with promising pipelines. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) acquired Kite Pharma and subsequently obtained FDA approval of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), the latter’s chimeric CAR-T therapy candidate.Why is Celgene Mulling Over the Acquisition?Celgene already has a collaboration and investment agreement with Juno for the development and commercialization of immunotherapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases. The agreement became effective in July 2015. Per the terms of the agreement, Celgene has the option to be the commercialization partner for Juno’s oncology and cell therapy auto-immune product candidates, including Juno’s CD19 and CD22 directed CAR T-cell product candidates.Per the deal, Juno will have the option to enter into co-development and co-commercialization arrangements on certain Celgene-originated development candidates that target T-cells.In April 2016, Celgene exercised option to develop and commercialize Juno’s CD19 program outside North America and China. The company also entered into a pre-negotiated license agreement with Juno with respect to such program by making a $50.0-million license payment.  Celgene’s stock has loss 22.3% of its value in the last six months compared with the industry’s decline of 2.4% while Juno’s stock surged significantly following the news.CAR-T Therapy Holds PromiseThe CAR-T therapy space was in the spotlight in 2017 as the FDA approved the first CAR-T therapy, Kymriah for the treatment of patients upto 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in second or later relapse stage.Given the immense potential of the therapy, Celgene too wants to go the Gilead way. Meanwhile, Celgene also has a partnership with bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report) for CAR-T therapy candidates.  Last month, the company also announced results from the ongoing CRB-401 phase I clinical study on investigational anti-B-cell maturation antigen CAR-T cell therapy, bb2121. The data showed ORR of 94% in patients in active dose cohorts (doses above 50 x 106 CAR + T-cells) and CR rate of 56% observed in patients in active dose cohorts.Zacks RankCelgene currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3480,GILD,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) reported encouraging fourth-quarter 2017 results wherein both earnings and sales topped expectations.The company reported adjusted earnings of $2.00 per share which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.95, up from $1.61 in the year-ago quarter.Total revenues grew 16.7% to $3.48 billion in the quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.47 billion. Revenues were boosted by consistent performance of the company’s key growth driver, Revlimid.Celgene Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Celgene Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Celgene Corporation QuoteRevlimid – A Key CatalystNet product sales increased 17% year over year to $3.48 billion. Net sales of Revlimid came in at $2.2 billion, reflecting 21% year-over-year growth. The drug performed well in the United States (up 24%). Growth in the quarter was driven by increased volume as a result of increases in duration of treatment and market share.Net sales of another cancer drug, Abraxane decreased 6% to $251 million as sales declined the United States. Sales of oncology drug, Pomalyst/Imnovid, came in at $442 million, up 17%. Sales were driven by increased volume due to increases in market share and duration.Otezla reported sales of $371 million in the quarter, up 22%.All other product sales (including Istodax, Thalomid, Vidaza and an authorized generic version of Vidaza in the United States) totaled $227 million in the quarter, up from $220 million from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted research and development expenses increased 13.8% to $766 million due to increased spending related to drug discovery and clinical trial activity while adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 28.9% to $687 million.Earlier in the week, Celgene announced that it will acquire Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  for $87 per share in cash, or a total of approximately $9 billion, net of cash and marketable securities acquired. The former already owns approximately 9.7% of outstanding shares of Juno.  Celgene also announced that it will acquire Impact Biomedicines for an upfront amount of $1.1 billion. The acquisition will add a late stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to Celgene’s pipeline. In December 2017, Celgene and partner bluebird bio (BLUE  -  Free Report) presented updated data from the phase I trial evaluating bb2121 in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The candidate was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA and PRIority MEdicines eligibility by the European Medicines Agency. The companies also initiated the KarMMa trial evaluating bb2121 in RRMM was initiated.2017 ResultsSales came in $13.0 billion, up from $11.3 billion in 2016 and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.98 billion.  Earnings per share came in at $7.44 in 2017, up from $5.94 in 2016 and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.37.2018 OutlookCelgene anticipates earnings in the range of $8.70-$8.90. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is $8.78 per share.  Net revenues are projected to be in the range of $14.4-$14.8 billion, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $14.90 billion.Revlimid sales are projected around $9.4 billion. Abraxane sales are estimated to be around $1 billion. Pomalyst’s revenues are projected around $1.9 billion. Otezla sales are now projected at $1.5 billion.Our TakeCelgene’s fourth-quarter results were encouraging as the company beat on both sales and earnings. While Revlimid sales were impressive yet again, Abraxane sales declined in the United States. Sales of Otezla have picked up too after a slowdown in the third quarter.Celgene’s stock has declined 21.4% in the last six months as against the industry’s loss of 0.5%. Shares of the company are up in the pre-market trading due to earnings beat. Celgene suffered a series of setbacks over the last few months. The company suffered a setback when a late stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Rituxan failed. The threat of generic competition is also looming large on Revlimid which loses patent protection in 2022 forcing Celgene to look for acquisitions. The stock was hit earlier after a phase III trial, REVOLVE, (CD-002) on pipeline candidate GED-0301 in Crohn’s disease and the extension trial, SUSTAIN (CD-004) was discontinued.Celgene was on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions given a lacklustre 2017 and the announcement of Juno’s acquisition was on the same track.We note that the slowdown in mature products compelled prominent biotechs to acquire smaller ones with promising pipelines.

3481,GILD,"Buyout speculations related to Bluebird Bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report) are doing the rounds again. The rumors surfaced after biotech giant Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announced a $9 billion deal to buy Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  to add the latter’s CAR-T cancer therapy to its pipeline.In fact, Bluebird’s shares were up 10.6% on Jan 22 after Celgene announced the deal to buy Juno.We remind investors that last year, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) acquired another CAR-T therapy designer, Kite Pharma for $11.8 billion. Back then, Juno and Bluebird Bio were rumored to be hot takeover targets.CAR-T therapy is the most recent and advanced form of treating cancer. It strengthens the body’s immune system to get rid of the tumors. There are only two approved CAR-T therapies to date – Novartis’ Kymriah in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Gilead’s Yescarta for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”) – leaving sufficient scope for other companies to bring in prospective therapies.Terms of the Celgene/Juno Pharma DealPer the agreement, Celgene will pay $87.00 per share in cash. The total transaction value is approximately $9 billion. The price represents a 28% premium over the closing share price of Juno as of Jan 19, 2018.The transaction was approved by shareholders of both companies and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018.While shares of Juno have shot up 27%, that of Celgene have gone up 0.3% after the announcement. In fact, in the past six months, Juno’s stock has returned 186.2% against a 5% decline registered by the industry.Why Juno Therapeutics?Juno’s CAR-T therapy, JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel) for treating relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”), the most common form of NHL, will boost Celgene’s lymphoma pipeline. A regulatory approval is being anticipated for JCAR017 in 2019 and potential peak sales are expected to be approximately $3 billion.Data from the phase I study, TRANSCEND, announced last month, demonstrated that at dose level 2, 74% of the patients with the aforementioned indication showed an overall response rate (ORR) and 68% complete response (“CR”) rate at three months in core group.The acquisition will also add another CAR-T candidate, JCARH125, to Celgene’s pipeline, which is being developed for multiple myeloma.Bluebird Bio in FocusCAR-T therapy represents immense potential at this juncture, thereby attracting the attention of big pharmas. Thus, following the acquisition of Kite Pharma and Juno, investors are anticipating a buyout offer for Bluebird, which has already started rallying on rumors.Bluebird is developing its anti B-cell maturation antigen CAR T-cell therapy, bb2121, in a dose-ranging phase I study. Five months of follow-up data announced in December 2017 demonstrated that among the 18 patients treated with bb2121 in active dose arm, 94% achieved an objective response (OR) while 56% patients achieved a complete response. The encouraging data and the deepening response showed by bb2121 in the study bode well for the candidate. Shares of the company are up 95.5% in the past six months.The candidate is being developed in collaboration with Celgene. However, with acquisition of Juno, Celgene is less likely to bid for Bluebird. But there are several other big pharma companies with a large cash pile who may be interested in Bluebird.The Celgene/Juno deal has also led to a rally in stocks of other CAR-T therapy focused companies, including Fate Therapeutics, ZIOPHARM Oncology and Bellicum Pharmaceuticals.Bluebird carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

3482,GILD,"The CAR-T therapy space has remained in investor focus in 2017, courtesy of immense potential. The latest annual conference of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) witnessed pharma big wigs, including Novartis and Gilead reporting data on their CAR-T therapy candidates.The FDA has already approved Swiss giant Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) for the treatment of patients upto 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse stage. Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) acquired Kite Pharma and subsequently obtained FDA approval of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), the latter’s chimeric CAR-T therapy candidate. To further strengthen its position in this space, Gilead Sciences and newly acquired cell therapy subsidiary — Kite Pharma — recently signed an agreement to acquire Cell Design Labs, Inc. for $567 million.Gilead will also acquire 12.2% Cell Design Labs’ shares which are owned by Kite Pharma. Cell Design, is a leading cell-based therapy developer through synNotch and Throttle technology platforms. These technological platforms will enhance Gilead’s cellular therapy research efforts. The company’s lead pre-clinical candidate is instrumental in treating multiple myeloma.Meanwhile, Kite Pharma announced results from the ongoing phase I/II ZUMA-3 study of KTE-C19, a CD19 CAR-T cell therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory ALL. 71% of ALL patients who received a single infusion of KTE-C19 achieved complete tumor remission (complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete hematological recovery). Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  and partner Celgene Corp. (CELG) announced additional data from the TRANSCEND study on pipeline candidate JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel) in patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Data from the trial showed at dose level 2, 74% of patients with the aforementioned indication showed an overall response rate (ORR) and 68% CR rate at three months in core group.Additionally, 50% of patients showed CR at six months. While the data was encouraging, investors expected far better ORR rates leading to a significant decline in Juno’s shares. A biologics license application filing is expected to be completed in the second half of 2018 and a tentative approval is expected by 2018-end. Juno currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report) and partner Celgene also announced results from the ongoing CRB-401 phase I clinical study on investigational anti-B-cell maturation antigen CAR-T cell therapy, bb2121. The data showed ORR of 94% in patients in active dose cohorts (doses above 50 x 106 CAR + T-cells) and CR rate of 56% observed in patients in active dose cohorts. bluebird currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Meanwhile, Novartis submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application to the FDA for Kymriah suspension for intravenous infusion for the treatment of adult patients with r/r diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Moreover, in November, the company submitted an application to the European Medicines Agency for Kymriah for the treatment of adult patients with r/r DLBCL who are ineligible for ASCT, and for children and young adults with r/r B-cell ALL.Kymriah was given Breakthrough Therapy designation for r/r DLBCL which, if approved, will be the second indication for Kymriah.  The company recently announced results from the pivotal JULIET study which showed sustained complete responses at six months with Kymriah suspension for intravenous infusion, in adult patients with a difficult-to-treat cancer- r/r DLBCL. In the study at six months, 30% of patients treated with Kymriah were in complete response. The relapse-free probability at six months after first response was 74%.Given the immense potential of the therapy, investors are likely to keep an eye on this space in the days ahead as well.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

3485,GILD,"At the beginning of 2017, expectations were pretty high that the pharma and biotech sector would finally see lots of mergers and acquisitions (M&As). However, that did not happen. While a few high-value deals were announced, the focus was mostly on small bolt-on acquisitions and licensing deals and agreements.According to Mergermarket’s Global Pharma, Medical & Biotech trend report for Q317, M&A in the global pharma, medical and biotechnology sector was in the range of $207.6 billion spanning 1,040 deals so far this year, declining 9.9% from the year-ago period. The dip was mostly attributable to the pharma and medical sectors.Key deals announced this year include the Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report)-Kite and the Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report)-Actelion acquisitions, which boosted the value of M&A transactions in the biotech sector. Biotech stocks continue to command hefty premiums where M&A is concerned.The key question now facing the sector is - will M&A activity remain sluggish in 2018 or will there be a surge in M&A deals?  With tax reform in the works, M&A activity is expected to increase in the upcoming quarters. Tax reform and cash repatriation are expected to lead to a boost in this area with biotech remaining a highly sought-after sector. Companies with innovative technologies and pipelines remain in demand with disease areas like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), immuno-oncology, gastrointestinal and central nervous system diseases seeing quite a bit of activity. Treatments for orphan diseases and gene editing technology are also in demand.There are several large drugmakers that are on the lookout for deals – while some of these companies are looking to replace sales of blockbuster products that are facing loss of patent exclusivity, others are looking to build their pipelines both through acquisitions as well as licensing agreements.Expectations are high that big players like Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report), Pfizer, Merck and Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) will announce M&A deals in 2018. Companies like J&J and Gilead are also expected to be on the lookout for additional acquisition targets. A major deterrent, however, could be high valuations and bidding wars which could keep some of the key players on the sidelines.   In this backdrop, here is a look at three biotech stocks that could find themselves on the radar of companies on the lookout for acquisition targets in 2018.Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report): Wilmington, DE-based Incyte is a company that is often considered an attractive acquisition target thanks to its flagship product, Jakafi, and a promising pipeline. Jakafi – a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor – looks well-positioned for growth. Jakafi revenues are expected in the range of $1,125-$1,135 million in 2017. Incyte is also working on expanding Jakafi’s label into additional indications including steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (“GVHD” – data expected in the first half of 2018) and essential thrombocythemia (“ET”), a rare blood cancer that can lead to life-threatening complications.The company has several catalysts lined up for 2018 including the potential approval of baricitinib (resubmission of the new drug application for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis expected by January 2018) as well as the advancement of its immuno-oncology pipeline.The company’s immuno-oncology pipeline includes IDO1 inhibitors (epacadostat), PI3K-delta inhibitors (INCB50465), and JAK inhibitors (itacitinib, INCB52793) among others. Epacadostat, which is in late-stage development for melanoma with data due in the first half of 2018, has immense commercial potential. Epacadostat is being evaluated for several other types of cancer as well.Juno Therapeutics, Inc. : Biopharmaceutical company, Juno’s shares have been on an upward trend following the Gilead-Kite acquisition announcement earlier this year. With Juno being focused on the development of innovative cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, the company is considered a potential acquisition target. Juno’s cell-based cancer immunotherapies are based on chimeric antigen receptor and high-affinity T cell receptor technologies. The company has several cell-based candidates in its pipeline targeting a variety of B-cell malignancies as well as multiple solid tumors and multiple myeloma.Although the company suffered a major setback with the development of its erstwhile lead pipeline candidate due to safety issues (including patient deaths), Juno is now focusing on JCAR017, a next-generation CAR-T cell product that targets CD19. JCAR017 is currently in a registrational study for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (""NHL""). The company expects to file for approval in the second half of 2018.  Juno’s shares are up 211.1% year to date, compared to the 2.7% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report): bluebird is another clinical-stage company working on developing gene therapies for serious genetic diseases and T cell-based immunotherapies for cancer. The company’s pipeline includes Lenti-D, currently in a phase II/III study, for the treatment of cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, and LentiGlobin, currently in five studies for the treatment of transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia and severe sickle cell disease. The company’s lead oncology programs, bb2121 and bb21217, are anti-BCMA CAR T programs which are being developed in collaboration with Celgene.While Incyte, Juno and bluebird are all Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

While Merck provided data on Keytruda, Novartis was in the news for gaining priority review status for the label expansion of its CAR-T therapy, Kymriah.    Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesMerck’s Keytruda Shines in 1st Line Lung Cancer Study: Merck scored a win this week with its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda (in combination with Alimta (pemetrexed) and cisplatin or carboplatin) meeting the primary endpoints of overall survival (“OS”) and progression-free survival (“PFS”) in a late-stage study for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). The interim analysis conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee showed that the Keytruda combination resulted in significantly longer OS and PFS compared to Alimta plus platinum chemotherapy alone (Read more: Merck Strong on Confirmatory Phase III Lung Cancer Study).Priority Review for Label Expansion of Novartis’s Kymriah: Novartis, the first company to gain FDA approval for a CAR-T therapy, Kymriah, said that the agency has granted priority review to the company’s regulatory application seeking to expand the label of the product. Novartis is looking to get Kymriah approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) who are ineligible for or relapse after autologous stem cell transplant (“ASCT”).Kymriah also got accelerated assessment status from the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for the treatment of children and young adults with r/r B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”) and for adult patients with r/r DLBCL who are ineligible for ASCT (Read more: Novartis sBLA for CAR-T Therapy Kymriah Accepted by FDA).Unfavorable IPR Decision for J&J: J&J suffered a setback this week with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (“PTO”) issuing a final written decision in an inter partes review (“IPR”) related to the sole unexpired patent listed as covering the company’s prostate cancer therapy, Zytiga (abiraterone acetate), in the FDA’s Orange Book. Generic drug company Argentum Pharmaceuticals had challenged all claims of the patent, which is due to expire on Aug 24, 2027.J&J issued a statement regarding the PTO’s decision and said that it is evaluating its options for a rehearing and/or an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Zytiga brought in sales of about $1.8 billion during the first nine months of 2017.Novartis’s Sandoz in Global Partnership with Biocon for Biosimilars: Sandoz, a Novartis division, is entering into a global partnership with Biocon for the development, manufacture and commercialization of multiple biosimilars in immunology and oncology.The companies will share responsibility for end-to-end development, manufacturing and global regulatory approvals for a number of products, and will have a cost and profit share arrangement while commercialization responsibilities will be divided.This partnership will allow both companies to address the next wave of biosimilar opportunities globally. Sandoz and Biocon both have had some success in the biosimilar space. Sandoz’s portfolio includes five biosimilars marketed in various countries across the world. The company is currently seeking FDA approval for its biosimilar version of AbbVie’s blockbuster immunology drug, Humira. The regulatory application for the biosimilar was recently accepted for review by the FDA.Pfizer-Gilead in Clinical Trial Collaboration: Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) has entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Kite, a Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) company, under which the safety and efficacy of Kite’s CAR-T cell therapy, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), will be evaluated in combination with Pfizer’s utomilumab, a fully humanized 4-1BB agonist monoclonal antibody, in patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma.

3487,GILD,"Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  along with partner Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announced additional data from a phase I study (TRANSCEND) on its lead pipeline candidate, JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel), for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”). Results were presented at the 59th annual meeting of American Society of Hematology.Notably, JCAR017 is a next-generation chimeric antigen receptor and high-affinity T cell (CAR-T) receptor product that targets CD19.The company presented separate data from the TRANSCEND study for the full group of patients enrolled as well as the core group i.e. a high-risk patient population.Finds from the multi-center TRANSCEND trial demonstrated that at dose level 2, 74% of patients with the aforementioned indication showed an overall response rate (ORR) and 68% complete response (“CR”) rate at three months in core group. Additionally, 50% of patients showed CR at six months.These figures are better than the previous data of 66% ORR and 50% CR reported in June. Moreover, the safety profile of JCAR017 remains impressive with only 1% of patients experiencing severe cytokine release syndrome and 15% experiencing severe neurotoxicity.It is interesting to note that Juno’s shares dropped almost 15% following the news release probably as investors expected better response rates.

3488,GILD,"Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced long-term follow-up data from a phase II study, evaluating its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), for treatment of patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. Detailed results from this study were presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in Atlanta.Notably, the drug was added to Gilead’s portfolio following the acquisition of Kite Pharma in early October. Subsequently, it received an FDA approval later in the same month for treating refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL) and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). The drug is also under review in the EU with a tentative approval expected in the first half of 2018.Shares of Gilead have outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has gained 3.6% against the broader industry’s 2.6% increase.The updated data from the ZUMA-1 study showed that the drug with a single infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 42%, including 40% of patients achieving complete remission at a median follow-up of 15.4 months. The study was conducted on a total of 108 patients. Notably, the previously reported data from the study showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 72%, including 95% of patients achieving complete remission at a median follow-up of 7.9 months.We remind investors that Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) has also received an FDA approval for its CAR-T therapy, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel), in August for treatment of patients aged up to 25 years with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later stage relapse.Additionally, Juno Therapeutics  is developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies based on its CAR-T technologies in partnership with Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) for curing adults with r/r aggressive NHL, including r/r DLBCL. Hence Gilead is expected to face a fierce competition from these products in the long run.Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price | Gilead Sciences, Inc.

3489,GILD,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced updated results from the pivotal JULIET study. It showed sustained complete responses at six months with Kymriah suspension for intravenous infusion, in adult patients with a difficult-to-treat cancer- relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel), formerly CTL019, is the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy approved.  The drug has been developed in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania. This novel immunocellular therapy and one-time treatment uses patient's T cells to fight cancer.CAR T therapies are developed for individual patients using their own cells, thereby making it different from typical small molecule or biologic therapies.So far this year, Novartis’ shares have gained 15.2%, compared with the industry’s growth of 15.6%.JULIET is the first multi-center global registration study for Kymriah in adult patients with r/r DLBCL and the second global CAR-T cell therapy trial. In the study at six months, 30% of patients treated with Kymriah showed complete response. The relapse-free probability at six months after first response was 74%. Median overall survival was not achieved and the median time from infusion to data cutoff was 5.6 months. When the patients with DLBCL enrolled for this study, they had to go through multiple rounds of chemotherapy and many had unsuccessful stem cell transplants, leaving them with few options and a poor prognosis. The study showed that Kymriah was able to considerably increase their chance of achieving and maintaining a sustained response without stem cell transplant, thus highlighting its benefit.Additionally, the study revealed that cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 58% of the  total patients under treatment while 23% experienced grade 3/4 CRS (15% grade 3; 8% grade 4) using the Penn Grading Scale. Also, it showed that 21% of patients experienced any grade neurologic events and 12% of patients had grade 3/4 neurologic adverse events, who were provided supportive care.In the study, 26 patients (26%) were infused in the outpatient setting of which 20 patients (77%) remained outpatient for three or more days after infusion.43 patients discontinued before infusiondue to rapid progression of their disease or deterioration in their clinical status.According to the study, only nine out of 147 (6.1%) enrolled patients could not be infused due to inability to manufacture an adequate dose of CAR-T cells.Novartis submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the FDA in October for Kymriah suspension for intravenous infusion. The applicationwas filed for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).Again in November, the company submitted an application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Kymriah for the treatment of adult patients with r/r DLBCL who are ineligible for ASCT and for children as well as young adults with r/r B-cell ALL.Of late, Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) also received FDA approval for Yescarta — a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. Yescarta is the first CAR-T therapy approved by the FDA for this indication.Another company, bluebird bio, Inc.’s (BLUE  -  Free Report) anti-BCMA CAR T therapy, bb21217, is being evaluated for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. bb21217 as well as bb2121 are being developed in collaboration with Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report).Novartis AG Price Novartis AG Price | Novartis AG QuoteZacks Rank Novartis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Meanwhile, Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) CAR T therapy gained earlier-than-expected FDA approval. Alexion (ALXN  -  Free Report) also got a regulatory boost with the FDA expanding the label of the company’s flagship product, Soliris.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesBiogen Beats on All Fronts: Although Biogen’s third quarter results were better than expected with the company surpassing both earnings and revenue expectations, shares were down 3.9% on concerns regarding the company’s multiple sclerosis franchise sales as well as U.S. sales of its recently launched spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”) treatment, Spinraza. Spinraza U.S. sales were $198 million in the third quarter, more or less flat from second quarter sales of $195 million though the company reported a 75% increase in the number of patients on therapy in the United States compared to the end of the second quarter. However, second quarter sales included inventory buildup of $30 million (Read more: Biogen Tops Q3 Earnings & Sales, Spinraza Sales Up).Biogen has gained 11.3% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 8.2% rally.Gilead CAR T Therapy Yescarta Approved: Gilead’s Yescarta, which became a part of the company’s portfolio following the $11.9 billion Kite Pharma acquisition, gained FDA approval for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. This makes Yescarta the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy to gain approval for use in this patient population.Yescarta is the second gene therapy to gain approval in the United States, the first being Novartis’s Kymriah. Both treatments come with a Boxed Warning regarding the risks of cytokine release syndrome (“CRS”) and neurologic toxicities.Yescarta’s approval is a major boost for Gilead which is currently facing declining sales from its hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) franchise. According to information provided by the company, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”) - about 7,500 patients with refractory DLBCL are eligible for CAR T therapy every year. Yescarta represents a new treatment option for these patients who have run out of treatment options and face a poor prognosis. Yescarta will be launched with a list price of $373,000 in the United States and is currently under review in the EU where a response is expected in the first half of 2018 (Read more: Gilead CAR-T Therapy Yescarta Clinches FDA Approval).Gilead also announced phase II results on its investigational treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (""NASH""). The company said that the higher dose (20 mg) of GS-0976, an oral ACC inhibitor, achieved significant reductions in buildup of fat in the liver and a noninvasive marker of fibrosis (TIMP-1) compared to placebo. However, statistical significance was not achieved for other parameters like liver stiffness (by FibroScan and MRE), serum ALT and PIII-NP, a serum marker of fibrogenesis.

3495,GILD,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, Alexion’s track record is excellent as it has consistently beaten expectations in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.12% over the trailing four quarters.Moreover, a Alexion’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has been up 13.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 9.1%.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Alexion is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – which have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Zacks ESP: Alexion has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.34 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.33. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Alexion’s Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Impact Q3 ResultsAlexion’s blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well. Alexion continues to identify and treat a consistently high number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) with Soliris, across its 50-country operating platform.In order to further increase the commercial potential of the drug, Alexion is also working on expanding Soliris’ label into additional indications. Label expansion into additional indications would give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.In August 2017, the European Commission expanded the indication for Soliris to include the treatment of refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adults who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive. In October, the FDA approved Soliris for the same. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Soliris indicates the drug sales to increase 4.9% from the year-ago quarter to $765 million.Meanwhile, Strensiq continues to perform well with revenues benefiting from a growing number of patients (both children as well as adults with pediatric onset disease) owing to hypophosphatasia (HPP) disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives. Going forward,  the company expects Strensiq to be a strong additional growth driver. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Strensiq indicates the drug sales to increase about 41% from the year-ago quarter to $86 million.Furthermore, the company announced some restructuring initiatives. In this context, Alexion plans to focus on rare diseases businesses in core areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders to enhance productivity.Notably, the company is expected to reduce spending and headcount associated with the previously announced de-prioritized pipeline programs as well as optimizing additional R&D expenses. Alexion also deprioritized ALXN1101 (cPMP replacement therapy) and ALXN6000 (samalizumab) as well as partnerships with Moderna Therapeutics, Blueprint Medicines and Arbutus Biopharma.Consequently, the company will reduce its global workforce by approximately 20% and expects that the increased financial flexibility will allow it to reinvest approximately $100 million annually into R&D.While, Alexion anticipates pre-tax savings of approximately $250 million by 2019, the total pre-tax restructuring and related expenses associated with the plan will be in the range of $340- $440 million. The company targets non-GAAP operating margin of 50% by the same year. Approximately 50% of the restructuring and related expenses will result in cash outlays while the same of approximately $240 million to $300 million are expected to be recorded in 2017.In the meantime, the company’s efforts to develop its pipeline are impressive, particularly in case of ALXN1210. Currently, it is evaluating ALXN1210 (a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody that inhibits terminal complement) in phase III studies for both PNH and aHUS.In fact, the company initiated a phase III PNH switch study of ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks compared to patients currently treated with Soliris. Therefore, we expect investors to focus on updates from ALXN1210 as the successful development and commercialization of the drug will boost growth prospects.However, Soliris’ quarter-to-quarter revenue growth will be impacted by the enrollment ramp-up of trials on ALXN1210 (by $70 million–$110 million), particularly in the second half of 2017.   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Immuno-oncology remains a key focus area with Gilead acquiring Kite last year for $11.9 billion and Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) currently rumored to be interested in acquiring Juno .New product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, continued strong performance from key products, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the momentum in 2018.That said, headwinds remain in the form of drug pricing scrutiny, pricing pressure, increasing competition, the growing presence of biosimilars, generic competition, a slowdown in the growth of legacy products, concerns regarding Amazon’s interest in entering the healthcare arena and major pipeline setbacks.How to Pick WinnersAnyone interested in biotech and pharma stocks will know that it could be challenging to pick winners in this “high risk - high returns” industry which is constantly growing and changing. Companies which hit the bull’s eye become overnight success stories with shares doubling or even tripling on positive news. However, negative outcomes have an equally strong effect on the shares and failure may very well spell doom for these companies.In such a scenario, let’s take a look at stocks preferred by analysts who have a deep knowledge and understanding of the industry and its companies. We have zeroed in on three stocks with the help of our Zacks Stock Screener - these stocks have been given a Strong Buy or Buy rating by 80% or more brokers and sport a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report): Vertex is a key player in the cystic fibrosis (“CF”) market with two products, Orkambi and Kalydeco, in its CF portfolio. About 31,000 patients are eligible for treatment under the company’s current CF portfolio with the number expected to grow to 44,000 in 2018 on the back of EU reimbursement for Orkambi, label expansion for the drug and the potential approval of the tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination, expected in the United States by February 28, 2018 and the EU in the second half of the year.Vertex expects CF revenues in the range of $2.1 - $2.15 billion in 2017.

3498,GILD,"Quite a few pharmaceutical industry mergers may be in the cards in 2018 if the proposed tax reforms are finally approved. The U.S. Senate passed an amended tax reform bill last week, thereby successfully passing the second stage. The bill will now be presented to a conference committee where representatives from the House and Senate will come together to draft the final bill.The tax reforms propose to cut the tax rate for corporates from 35% to 20%, which can boost profits of large drug/biotech companies. Meanwhile, the change in tax code will also allow companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%.These changes should definitely leave more cash in the hands of drug/biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been few in 2017 compared to 2016. Contrary to expectations of increased pharma and biotech mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in 2017, the focus was mostly on small bolt-on acquisitions and licensing deals and agreements.Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) nearly $12 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech Actelion were the only two noteworthy deals of this year.With rising investor expectation that Trump's action on drug prices may not be as onerous as previously feared, there is a lot of chatter about a possible increase in M&As.Meanwhile, the major drug/biotech players struggling with organic growth need an infusion of new growth drivers in their pipeline/product portfolios — either from internal development or from buying assets. Strategic M&A and licensing deals are therefore inevitable for innovation starved drug/biotech companies looking for growth in a highly competitive and global marketplace.Drug/biotech companies have regularly tried to merge or acquire competitors in mega-merger deals to achieve critical mass both in R&D and sales and marketing. Meanwhile, smaller biotech research firms investigating new therapies or interesting pipeline candidates have also attracted the attention of larger counterparts in the last few years.With focus on drug pricing taking a backseat and possibility of repatriation of funds, hopes are high that M&A activity will pick up. Companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), and J&J are expected to take the lead supported by their robust cash flow and balance sheet.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3499,GILD,"Every year, World Aids Day is celebrated on Dec 1 to raise public awareness about Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome, popularly known as AIDS. The day is observed to make people aware about proper cure and prevention of the disease. In this regard, this year, the theme for the day this year is ""Right to Health."" This day also commemorates those who have died from an AIDS-related illness.World AIDS Day is one of the eight official global public health campaigns marked by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to WHO, globally, about 36.7 million people were suffering from HIV/AIDS at the end of 2016. Of the total, 2.1 million were children less than 15 years old.AIDS is a pandemic disease caused due to the infection of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The virus weakens the immune system by destroying cells that fight diseases and infections, eventually leading to AIDS. Medicines for the treatment of HIV are called antiretroviral therapy (ART) that slow or put a check on the progression of the virus.Currently, companies are investigating new medicines to treat, prevent and ultimately cure HIV. Scientists also are exploring new treatment paradigms like two drug regimens, making therapies/drugs drugs with improved long-term safety profiles and new mechanisms of actions.Despite improved medical understanding of HIV and significant efforts made by leading government and medical bodies to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS, this disease still has limited treatment options. In 2016, 1 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses, totaling to 35.0 million since the start of the epidemic.Based on these statistics, it is not surprising that several healthcare companies are investing a significant amount of their R&D expenditures on developing treatments and devices for HIV and AIDS.Stocks to Watch For On World AIDS Day, here are some of the key pharma companies in the HIV market that investors can rely on.GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) has a long-standing commitment to HIV and AIDS. The company had developed the widely used antibiotic amoxycillin around 40 years ago, which was the first medicine approved to treat HIV. The sales of older HIV products — Epzicom and Selzentry — have been declining. However, the newer HIV drugs —Triumeq and Tivicay — are witnessing a consistent increase in sales and gaining market share.Meanwhile, a significant portion of its R&D expenditures are being used toward developing HIV medicines to treat/prevent HIV.Last week, Glaxo and partner Johnson & Johnson announced the FDA approval for Juluca — a combination of Glaxo’s Edurant/dolutegravir and J&J’s Tivicay/rilpivirine into a single tablet — for the treatment of HIV. Most medicines for HIV treatment are made up of three or more antiretroviral drugs. Juluca is the first two-drug regimen to be approved that reduces the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen.This week ViiV Healthcare, an HIV company majorly owned by Glaxo and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), announced the start of a large late-stage African study that will evaluate long-acting cabotegravirinjection for the prevention of HIV in sexually active women. If approved, cabotegravir injections will be administered every two months as opposed to presently available oral anti-retroviral medication, which needs to be taken every day.Already, ViiV Healthcare has started conducting a HPTN 083 study on cabotegravirin HIV-uninfected men and transgender women who have sex with men, under co-funding with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Meanwhile, cabotegraviris also being evaluated in three late stage studies as atwo drug regimen withEdurant, with the third study initiation announced earlier this week.Furthermore, Glaxo is developing two drug regimen ofdolutegravir + lamivudine.Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) is a dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive portfolio. In fact, Gilead’s HIV franchise is a major contributor to sales with approved drugs like Genvoya, Truvada, Atripla, Stribild, Descovy, Odefsey and Complera.The company was the first to introduce a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV — Atripla. Gilead’s other STRs for HIV include Complera/Eviplera and Stribild. Its TAF-based product, Genvoya, happens to be a bestseller surpassing both Truvada and Atripla since fourth-quarter 2016.Currently, Gilead’s bictegravir single table regimen (STR) for HIV treatment is under priority review in the United States. The FDA is expected to announce its decision in February 2018.The STR is a fixed-dose combination of bictegravir, an INSTI, and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone. This combination is also under review in the EU.Another company working towards developing HIV drugs is Johnson and Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report). The company along with partner Glaxo recently received FDA approval for first two-drug regimen- Juluca, as discussed above. Further, the company along with The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and National Institutes of Health is conducting an efficacy study for an investigational mosaic HIV-1 preventive vaccine.The study will evaluate whether the vaccine is safe and is able to reduce the incidence of HIV infection among women in sub-Saharan Africa.  HIV has a significant unmet need and women and girls account for about 60% of people living with HIV in eastern and southern Africa.OthersSome other popular marketed HIV drugs are AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report), Kaletra and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Isentress.Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) also recently received a tentative FDA approval for its combination tablet comprising efavirenz, lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.Meanwhile, Merck is developing an investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, doravirine both as a single-entity tablet and in combination (fixed dose tablet) with other antiretroviral agents — lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). The company plans to file regulatory applications for the same before the end of 2017.ConclusionAIDS/HIV is a life threatening disease which has limited medical cure. However, there are numerous companies that are developing drugs for the treatment and care for people suffering from HIV and for them who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV, thereby making the space competitive.While Johnson & Johnson sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both Glaxo and Gilead carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs Pending A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

3500,GILD,"Tax reform has been grabbing headlines since the election campaign last year. However, the plan has been modified quite a few times. With a Congressional vote expected this week to move the tax reform bill forward, let’s revisit some aspects of the bill and their impact on the biotech/pharma industry.Corporate Tax CutThe bill in its current form proposes to cut the tax rate for corporates from 35% to 20%. Although it is higher than the originally proposed 15%, a 15-point cut will also help companies to save a considerable amount in tax payment in the United States.The bill also proposes a full exemption on future dividend/income from a company’s foreign subsidiaries.Currently, if foreign income is repatriated, it is taxed at 35% with a full credit of the local levies. However, the change will allow foreign subsidiaries to send the cash back to the parent company after just paying local taxes.This will leave some extra cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share buybacks among others. The lower tax rate and inflow of foreign income may lead to a rise in mergers & acquisitions (M&A), which have been relatively low so far in 2017. Pharma sector acquisitions so far this year include Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) buyout of Actellion and Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) takeover of Kite Pharma.Minimum Tax on Foreign EarningsWhile the bill cuts tax rates and removes tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, it proposes to implement “minimum tax” on foreign incomes. Under the current tax plan, the companies can defer tax payment by parking its foreign profits in the host country. However, if minimum tax is imposed, there will be no deferral route to skip taxes. The companies will have to pay taxes (difference of minimum tax & local taxes) every year, which will increase the tax bill of U.S. based companies.This proposed tax may improve the competitiveness of foreign pharma companies like Swiss giants AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) and Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) against their U.S.-based counterparts.However, the rate of this tax has yet to be decided.Cash Repatriation WindowThe current tax plan allows multinational companies to keep their foreign cash in the host country and thereby defer tax liability in the United States. However, the proposed minimum tax will stop the deferral system. The companies that have hoarded cash in low-tax countries will be allowed to repatriate at a much lower rate.This move will also increase domestic cash for the companies. The biotech companies may utilize the extra cash to fund their clinical studies or make a strategic acquisition to strengthen their portfolio.DeductionsThe tax reform proposes to expense capital expenditure excluding costs for structures like plants and warehouses in the current year rather than deferring it over 5-15 years as allowed currently. The large pharma companies areexpected to have a huge pile of cash available with them upon a potential tax reform.Any acquisition or setting up of a manufacturing facility will help the companies to lower the tax bill in the near term. However, the reform will partially limit the deduction of interest on debt in tax calculation. The deduction limit is yet to be set.Moreover, presently the companies can claim a tax credit for half of the research cost related to development of drugs for rare diseases. This credit may get eliminated if the reform passes. This will hurt the small biotech companies, which could have recouped some of their development costs.Although the Senate budget committee has voted the bill for a full vote of the house, many are still sceptical about the tax reform. Many still believe that this will add to the country’s fiscal deficit. Some also argue that lower federal revenues, a result of lower taxes will strain healthcare funds.Moreover, healthcare costs are expected to increase in the future as the United States will see an increase in the number of aged people, which will further dent healthcare funds. Congress is still divided on the impact of the tax reform over the long term.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

3501,GILD,"Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) reported third quarter 2017 results wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations.  However, the stock is expected to open in the red given the decline in hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise.  Nevertheless, Gilead’s stock has gained 15.2% year to date as against the industry's  decline of 0.2%.The company’s third-quarter earnings (including the impact of stock-based compensation expenses) of $2.27 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09. However, earnings were below the year-ago quarter figure of $2.75.Moreover, total revenues of $6.5 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.3 billion. However, revenues declined 13.2% year over year.HIV Impresses Yet Again, Harvoni & Sovaldi PlungesProduct sales came in at $6.4 billion, down 13.5% year over year. The decline was due to lower hepatitis C virus (HCV) sales, partially offset by higher sales across HIV and other therapeutic areas.Antiviral product sales, which include Gilead's HIV and liver disease portfolio, came in at $5.8 billion in the reported quarter, down 14.7%.HCV product sales, which include Harvoni, Sovaldi, Epclusa and Vosevi, were $2.2 billion, down from $3.3 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was mainly attributed to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets, partially offset by sales of Epclusa (launched in 2016) and sales of Vosevi (approved in the United States and Europe in July 2017).Sales of Harvoni declined 47.7% year over year to $973 million in the reported quarter. Further, Sovaldi sales recorded a steep year-over-year decline of 73.4% to $219 million.Epclusa garnered sales of $882 million in the reported quarter, up from the year-ago figure of $640 million. We note that Epclusa was launched in the U.S. and Europe in June and Jul 2016, respectively.Meanwhile, HIV and HBV product sales came in at $3.6 billion, up 16.1% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by continuous strong uptake of tenofoviral afenamide (TAF)-based products such as Genvoya, which generated sales of $988 million, up from $461 million in the year-ago quarter, Descovy, which recorded sales of $316 million, up from $88 million, and Odefsey, which registered sales of $296 million, up from $105 million. HIV treatments like Stribild and Complera/Eviplera sales declined 63.1% and 42.3% respectively. Viread sales were down at $274 million, down 9.6%.Atripla sales tanked 32.4% to $439 million, while Truvada sales fell 5.5% to $811 million.Other products like Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig recorded sales of $213 million (down 0.9%), $164 million (down 3.5%), $92 million (up 1.1%) and $40 million (up 2.5%), respectively.Research & development (R&D) expenses declined 24% to $745 million. On the other hand, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 3.3% to $806 million. Adjusted product gross margin was 87.2% compared to 87.6% in the year-ago period.2017 Guidance UpdatedGilead now expects net product sales in the range of $24.5-$25.5 billion, up from $24.0-$25.5 billion provided earlier. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $16 billion and $16.5 billion (earlier projection: $15.5 billion and $16 billion). HCV product sales are projected between $8.5 billion and $9.0 billion (earlier projection: $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion). Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are now projected in the range of $3.3-$3.4 billion and $3.3-$3.4 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 86-87%. Earnings per share are now projected around $1.02-$1.17 (earlier projection: 86-93 cents).Kite AcquisitionThe company recently acquired Kite Pharma. Last week, the company received FDA approval for Yescarta, a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy.Dividend and Share RepurchaseConcurrently, Gilead declared a cash dividend of 52 cents per share of common stock for fourth-quarter 2017. The dividend is payable on Dec 28 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Dec 15. During the quarter, the company paid cash dividends of $682 million and repurchased shares for $153 million.Our TakeThough the company topped both earnings and revenue estimates in the third quarter, it witnessed a  decline in HCV sales. The HCV franchise is under tremendous pressure due to lower patient starts and increasing competition. We expect sales to decline further going forward.  We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa, face competition from AbbVie, Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza among others. Competition as well as pricing pressure has intensified further with the launch of Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier. Only 39,000 patients began treatment on a Gilead regimen during the quarter, down 9% from the prior quarter.Meanwhile, the HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens in the United States and EU. The TAF-based regimens now represent 56% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and the launches of Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting should further boost sales as the company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with an estimated 145,000 patients using Truvada by the end of the third quarter. The approval of Yescarta also bodes well for Gilead.However, Gilead has lost exclusivity for Viread and Truva which will further impact performance. We expect the decline in HCV franchise to offset the positive momentum of HIV franchise.Zacks Rank Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3503,GILD,"The third-quarter earnings season is off to a strong start.  The results of the companies that have reported numbers show that earnings and revenue growth pace is accelerating from the first two quarters. In particular, revenue growth has shown significant momentum as evident from the proportion of positive revenue surprises. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index for the third quarter are expected to be up 3% on 4.9% higher revenues.As of Oct 20, 2017, 87 S&P 500 companies which account for 24.7% of index’s total market capitalization have reported results. Results reveal that earnings for these companies are up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter on a 7.3% increase in revenues. Among these, 71.3% beat earnings estimates while 70.1% beat revenue estimates.Medical Sector PerformanceThe Medical sector has performed relatively well till date and this quarter is not going to be any different as per estimates. Of the 5.4% companies that have reported so far, 66.7% beat on revenues while all the companies surpassed earnings expectations. Going forward, the sector is expected to record year-over-year growth of 4.8% in revenues and 1.9% in earnings in Q3.The bellwether of the sector, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results and raised its outlook. Swiss giant Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) too beat on both earnings and sales on the back of new drugs like Cosentyx and Entresto. Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) also reported better-than-expected results in the third quarter.Here we have four major biotech giants that are set to report third-quarter results on Oct 26. Let's see how things are shaping up for these:Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) is expected to beat expectations when it reports after the market closes. Per the Zacks model a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Gilead’s track record is pretty mixed, with the company beating estimates in two of the last four and missing in two. Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 17.4%. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4%. Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.57%. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) based products — Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch. This should drive the non-HCV product sales.  The TAF-based regimens now represent 51% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Specifically, Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%. The Zacks Consensus estimate for Genvoya stands at $919 million. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is also expected to boost sales.  (Read more: Is Gilead Poised for a Beat This Earnings Season?)Gilead Sciences, Inc.

The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.We expect the company to beat estimates once again on the back of strong performance of key drug Revlimid.  The drug performed well in the first half and combated the challenges of uneven buying patterns and coverage gap. Continued momentum in core indication, label expansion and global launches should help the product to keep contributing to the top line.

3506,GILD,"A leader in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) space, Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report), is expected to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter results on Oct 26, after the market closes.Gilead’s track record is pretty mixed, with the company beating estimates in two of the last four and missing in one two. Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 17.4%. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4%.  Gilead’s stock has gained 15.9% year to date against the industry's 11.7%. A strong performance in the third quarter will boost share price performance further.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Gilead is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.23%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $2.09 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged a penny lower at $2.08. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Gilead Sciences, Inc. Quote Factors at PlayConcurrent with the second-quarter earnings call, Gilead updated its annual guidance. Based on a better-than-expected performance in the first half of 2017 specifically in the United States, the company raised its guidance for 2017.  Gilead now expects net product sales in the range of $24.0-$25.5 billion, up from $22.5-$24.5 billion provided earlier. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $15.5 and $16.0 billion (earlier projection: $15 million and $15.5 billion). HCV product sales are projected between $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion (earlier projection: $7.5 billion and $9.0 billion). Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are now projected in the range of $3.2-$3.4 billion and $3.2-$3.4 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 86-88%. Earnings per share are now projected around 86-93 cents (earlier projection: 84-91 cents).Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) based products — Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch. This should drive the non-HCV product sales.  The TAF-based regimens now represent 51% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and Odefsey and Descovy in 2016.  Specifically, Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%. The Zacks Consensus estimate for Genvoya stands at $923 million. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is also expected to boost sales.  However, Gilead will lose exclusivity for Viread in 2017 in some countries outside the United States which might impact sales.Meanwhile, the HCV franchise continues to be under competitive and pricing pressure leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales. Harvoni and Sovaldi has been facing competition from AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others. Higher discounts and payer mix continue to impact sales adversely. Despite this, the company increased its guidance for HCV franchise.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for lead HCV drug Sovaldi and Harvoni currently stand at $24.6 million and $1.0 million for the third quarter. The HCV portfolio received a major boost when Epclusa gained approval in 2016. The FDA also approved Vosevi tablets as a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the re-treatment of chronic HCV infection in adults.On the other hand, we expect the company to increase its guidance further for the incremental contribution from the recent Kite Pharma acquisition. The FDA recently approved its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma.  We expect the management to throw more light on the same during the third-quarter’s call. Investors are also likely to keep an eye on other pipeline updates.Other Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.24% and a Zacks Rank #2.

3507,GILD,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and partner GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) recently announced FDA approval for Juluca — a combination of Glaxo’s Tivicay/rilpivirine and J&J’s Edurant/dolutegravir into a single tablet — for the treatment of HIV.Most medicines for HIV treatment are made up of three or more antiretroviral drugs. Juluca is the first two-drug regimen that reduces the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen. The approval of Juluca has shifted investor focus to the HIV disease space. Let’s see how companies are trying to tap into this huge market.A Note on HIVHIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It weakens the immune system by destroying cells that fight diseases and infections and can eventually lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Medicines for the treatment of HIV are called antiretroviral therapy (ART) that slow or put a check on the progression of the virus.Globally, about 36.7 million people were living with HIV/AIDS at the end of 2016. Of the total, 2.1 million were children (less than 15 years old).Despite improved medical understanding of HIV and its prevention and treatment as well as significant efforts made by leading government and medical bodies, HIV and AIDS still has no cure. Notably, 1 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses in 2016, reaching the total number since the start of the epidemic to 35.0 million.Companies Developing HIV DrugsMarketed Therapies for HIVSeveral pharmaceutical companies are marketing drugs/therapies to treat HIV. Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) is a dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive portfolio. The company was the first to introduce a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV — Atripla. Gilead’s other STRs for HIV include Complera/Eviplera and Stribild. Its TAF-based product Genvoya is a bestseller, surpassing both Truvada and Atripla since fourth-quarter 2016.Another company, GlaxoSmithKline has a long-standing commitment to HIV and infectious diseases. The company had developed the widely used antibiotic amoxycillin around 40 years ago, and developed the first medicines approved to treat HIV (AZT). The company’s other marketed HIV drugs include Triumeq and Tivicay.Other popular marketed HIV drugs are AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Kaletra and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Isentress.Another pharmaceutical company Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) has received a tentative approval from the FDA for its combination tablet, comprising efavirenz, lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, to treat HIV.What’s in the Pipeline?Companies are working on developing new drugs to treat, prevent and possibly cure HIV. Scientists are exploring new treatment paradigms like two-drug regimens, making therapies/drugs with improved safety profiles and new mechanisms of actions.Gilead’s STR bictegravir for HIV treatment is under priority review in the United States. The FDA is expected to announce its decision next February. The STR is a fixed-dose combination of bictegravir, an INSTI, and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone.Merck is developing an investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor MK-1439, doravirine for HIV -1 infection and plans tofile regulatory applications for fixed-dose combination of the same,both as a single-entity tablet and a fixed-dose combination tabletconsisting of  fixed-dose combination of doravirine (DOR), lamivudine (3TC), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) n late 2017.Glaxo is also developing two drug regimens are dolutegravir + lamivudineand cabotegravir + rilpivirine.As an increasing number of companies are developing drugs to treat this life threatening disease, competition has intensified manifold in the space. Meanwhile, it is to be seen how Juluca fares in the market.(We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake. The original article, issued Tuesday, Nov 24, 2017, should no longer be relied upon.)

3508,GILD,"World AIDS Day takes place every year on December 1 with people across the world coming together to fight against HIV, to support those living with HIV and to commemorate those who have died from an AIDS-related disease.Everybody CountsThe slogan for this World AIDS Day is “Everybody Counts”. The goal is to ensure access to affordable and high quality care and services for people with HIV, a strong health care system, as well as the integration of HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis services.According to information provided by the World Health Organization (“WHO”), more than 35 million people have lost their lives due to HIV so far while one million people died last year from HIV-related causes. At the end of 2016, approximately 36.7 million people were living with HIV. Number of newly-infected HIV patients was 1.8 million in 2016.Currently Available TreatmentsWhile there is no cure for HIV at present, the virus can be controlled through the use of effective antiretroviral (“ARV”) drugs. According to WHO, 54% of adults and 43% of children with HIV are currently on lifelong ARV - 19.5 million people living with HIV were receiving antiretroviral therapy (“ART”) in 2016. Combination ART (combining 3 or more ATV drugs) has been found to be effective in suppressing viral replication within a person's body thereby allowing the immune system to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off infections.The HIV drug landscape has evolved over the years with drugs with varying mechanisms of action being approved over the years. These include multi-class combination products (Atripla, Complera, Stribild), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs – Combivir, Epivir, Truvada, Viread), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs – Edurant, Sustiva), protease inhibitors (PIs – Prezista, Reyataz, Norvir), HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI - Isentress, Tivicay) as well as fusion inhibitors and entry inhibitors (CCR5 co-receptor antagonist).According to WHO, new HIV infections fell by 39% between 2000 and 2016 while HIV-related deaths declined by one-third with ART saving 13.1 million lives. However, with only 70% of HIV-infected people being aware of their status, there remains significant need to spread awareness about the disease and the availability of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), which detect the presence or absence of HIV antibodies.  According to GlobalData, the HIV market across the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, Japan, Brazil, and China, is expected to grow from $16.3 billion in 2015 to $22.5 billion by 2025.There is significant need for new alternative ARV treatment options that come with better tolerability, higher efficacy, and lower rates of treatment discontinuation. Here is a look at a few key players in the HIV market.4 Drug Stocks in FocusJohnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report): J&J is a key player in the HIV market with the company introducing several transformational medicines in this therapeutic area over the last 25 years. The company and its partner GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) recently gained FDA approval for  Juluca, the first, complete, single-pill, two-drug regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in certain adults living with the disease who are virologically suppressed.The once-daily, antiretroviral is a combination of Tivicay (INSTI) and Edurant (NNRTI) which maintains the safety and efficacy of a traditional three-drug regimen without an NRTI. Simpler treatment regimens will make compliance easier for HIV patients who need to stay on a consistent treatment regimen in order to keep their viral counts low.The company is currently seeking FDA approval with partner Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) for a darunavir-based single tablet regimen (“STR”). The once-daily regimen comprises darunavir 800mg/cobicistat 150mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 10mg (D/C/F/TAF).J&J is also working on an HIV vaccine. The company along with The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and National Institutes of Health is conducting an efficacy study for an investigational mosaic HIV-1 preventive vaccine. There is significant unmet need for a vaccine for HIV – although a lot of progress has been made in treating and managing the disease, almost two million people become infected every year. Developing a vaccine for HIV has proved to be challenging due to the unique properties of the virus including its ability to mutate rapidly. Moreover, genetic diversity with multiple strains and subtypes prevalent in different parts of the world are additional hurdles.J&J is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The stock has gained 20.9% year to date, compared to the 16.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Gilead Sciences, Inc.: HIV is one of the primary areas of focus at Gilead. The company’s HIV portfolio includes drugs like Genvoya, Truvada, Atripla, Descovy, Odefsey, Complera and Stribild which contributed approximately $9.5 billion to total sales in the first nine months of 2017. Gilead’s TAF-based products like Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey remain key growth drivers. Gilead is currently seeking FDA approval for an investigational, fixed-dose combination of BIC/FTC/TAF with the FDA expected to respond on Feb 12, 2018. Meanwhile, the company expects to complete a 6mg cohort phase I study on GS-9620 (TLR-7 agonist, HIV cure) by year end. A late-stage study evaluating Descovy for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is scheduled to complete in the third quarter of 2018.With the company’s hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) franchise seeing declining sales, Gilead is focusing on its HIV franchise for growth. The company’s non-HCV products are expected to generate sales of $16 - $16.5 billion in 2017. However, competition in this market is intense. Moreover, the company is facing competition from generic products as well.Gilead is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The stock has gained 4.4% year to date, compared to the 2.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.GlaxoSmithKline: Glaxo is a majority stakeholder in ViiV Healthcare, a global specialist HIV company, which was set up in partnership with Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) in 2009 and now has Shionogi as a shareholder as well. Key products in the HIV portfolio include Triumeq and Tivicay. Glaxo is working on bringing new growth drivers into the HIV business with Juluca being a recent addition. Glaxo is exploring new treatment paradigms (two drug regimens), new modalities (long-acting injectables) and new mechanisms of actions (including maturation inhibitors and broadly neutralising antibodies). The company is working on a dolutegravir – lamivudine combination which will also be for naive patients and a long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine combination.ViiV has commenced a late-stage study on long-acting cabotegravir for the prevention of HIV infection in sexually active women. The study will compare cabotegravir injections given every two months to daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.Glaxo, a Zacks Rank #3 stock, has declined 8.9% year to date, compared to the 16.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Merck (MRK  -  Free Report): Merck has a presence in the HIV market in the form of Isentress/Isentress HD, HIV integrase inhibitors for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents. The company’s HIV franchise brought in sales of $896 million in the first nine months of 2017, down 15% from the year-ago period mainly due to lower demand in the United States due to competitive pressures.Merck’s HIV pipeline has a couple of late-stage candidates - MK-1439 (doravirine, NNRTI) and MK-1439A (doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate – DOR/3TC/TDF). The company expects to file for regulatory approval of doravirine both as a single-entity tablet and as a fixed-dose combination tablet (DOR/3TC/TDF) by year end.Merck, a Zacks Rank #3 stock, has declined 6.1% year to date, compared to the 16.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

3509,GILD,"United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR  -  Free Report) reported that the FDA has granted six months pediatric exclusivity to its pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) drug, Adcirca (tadalafil). This will delay generic competition for the drug for an additional six months.The pediatric exclusivity has pushed back patent expiry of the oral PDE-5 inhibitor to May 2018. The patent was otherwise set to expire this month. This means a generic version of the drug cannot be approved until then.Shares of United Therapeutics were up 2.6% on Monday, in response to the positive development. However, a look at United Therapeutics’ share price movement shows that the stock has underperformed the industry this year so far. United Therapeutics stock has declined 12% during this period, while the industry rose 2%.We remind investors that United Therapeutics bought exclusive rights to commercialize Adcirca for the treatment of PAH in the United States from Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) in November 2008. Tadalafil is also sold by Lilly as Cialis for erectile dysfunction.The additional exclusivity for Adcirca was based on some study data submitted by Lilly to the FDA.Separately, United Therapeutics will be required to pay higher royalties on sales of Adcirca, effective from next month, per a previously announced amendment to the licensing agreement. The royalty rate on Adcirca sales is up from 5% to 10%. United Therapeutics also has to make milestone payments of $325,000 for each $1,000,000 in net product sales.Adcirca generated sales of $300.4 million in the nine months of 2017, up 15.8% year over year.Meanwhile, the company has three more PAH products in its portfolio – Remodulin, Tyvaso and Orenitram. With these products, United Therapeutics has a varied range of therapies targeting the PAH market.Lately, growth of Orenitram, Tyvaso and Remodulin has slowed down due to competition, mainly from Actelion’s new drug, Uptravi (selexipag). Actelion is now part of Johnson & Jonson (JNJ  -  Free Report). Also some patients are staying longer on front-line oral AMBITION combination therapy (Adcirca + Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Letairis) and delaying the transition to inhaled/injectable therapies like Tyvaso/Remodulin, thereby hurting their demand.Meanwhile, Remodulin, which accounts for more than 35% of United Therapeutics’ total sales, could start facing generic competition after June 2018.United Therapeutics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3510,GILD,"Key highlights in the biotech sector over the past week include earnings results from companies like Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) and the lifting of the clinical hold imposed by the FDA on a couple of studies being conducted on Cellectis’s (CLLS  -  Free Report) UCART123.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesSolid Q3 Results from Regeneron: Regeneron’s third quarter results were strong with the company surpassing both earnings and revenue expectations. Flagship product, Eylea, continues to perform well. On the third quarter call, Regeneron said that the diabetic macular edema (“DME”) indication represents significant growth opportunity considering only 10% of patients with DME in the United States are currently treated with an anti-VEGF agent. Regeneron is looking to expand Eylea’s label into diabetic retinopathy and expects to file for regulatory approval in the second half of 2018 if results from a late-stage study are positive. A supplementary biologics license application (“BLA”) for every 12-week dosing of Eylea for wet age-related macular degeneration (“AMD”) is set to be filed by year end.The Dupixent launch for atopic dermatitis is ongoing while Regeneron and its partner Sanofi expect to file for approval for the asthma indication by year end. Meanwhile, data from the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study on PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent, should be out in the first quarter of 2018. A regulatory application for PD-1 inhibitor, cemiplimab, is also slated for the first quarter of 2018 (Read more: Regeneron Beats on Q3 Earnings & Sales, Shares Up).Regeneron has gained 13.1% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 3% rally.Dicerna-Boehringer Ingelheim to Work Together for NASH Treatment: Dicerna Pharmaceuticals (DRNA  -  Free Report), which is focused on the development of investigational RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics, has signed up with Boehringer Ingelheim for the discovery and development of novel RNAi therapeutics based on Dicerna’s proprietary technology platform, GalXC, for the treatment of chronic liver diseases. The initial focus will be on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), a chronic liver disease with no treatment options currently approved though several companies are conducting research in this area.The agreement could see Dicerna receive more than $200 million from Boehringer, including an upfront payment, development and commercial milestone payments, and R&D reimbursement for a GalXC candidate addressing an undisclosed NASH target. Dicerna could also receive staggered royalties (up to double-digits) on worldwide net sales. Dicerna’s shares jumped 28.2% following the announcement of the deal.Keryx Down Despite Auryxia Label Expansion: Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (KERX  -  Free Report), which is focused on developing medicines for renal disease, gained FDA approval for the label expansion of Auryxia. Auryxia can now be used for the treatment of patients with iron deficiency anemia and non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (“CKD”). However, while approval for this indication, which significantly expands the patient population for Auryxia, is a positive, the company’s shares were down on disappointing third quarter results (Read more: Keryx Q3 Loss Wider Than Expected, Stock Declines).FDA Lifts Clinical Hold on Cellectis Studies: The FDA lifted the clinical hold, previously announced on Sep 4, 2017, on a couple of early-stage studies being conducted on Cellectis’s UCART123 for acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (“BPDCN”). The hold was placed after the company had reported a death in the BPDCN study.Cellectis has agreed to several changes in the study protocols for the hold to be lifted. These include lowering the cohort dose level as well as the cyclophosphamide dose of the lympho-depleting regimen, including specific criteria on the day of UCART123 infusion, ensuring that the next three patients who will be treated in each protocol are under the age of 65 and ensuring that enrollment will be staggered across the UCART123 protocols AML123 and ABC123 with at least 28 days elapsing between the enrollments of two patients across the two studies.Although the lifting of the clinical hold comes with several restrictions, it is a relief for the company, which is focused on developing immunotherapies based on gene-edited allogeneic CAR T-cells (UCART).Cellectis is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 0.2% over the last five trading sessions. Among major biotech stocks, Regeneron was up 4.6% reflecting strong third quarter results while Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) was down 2.3%. Over the last six months, Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) was up 28.1% while Celgene lost 14.1% (See the last biotech stock roundup here: Celgene, Amgen, Gilead Hit by Q3 Results, Vertex Beats on All Fronts).What's Next in the Biotech World?Several small- and mid-cap companies will be reporting results in the next few days. Moreover, companies like Dynavax Technologies Corporation (DVAX  -  Free Report) and Heron Therapeutics, Inc. should get a response from the FDA for regulatory applications filed by them. It could be third time lucky for Dynavax which is awaiting approval for its hepatitis B vaccine, Heplisav-B, with the FDA expected to respond today. Heron is awaiting a decision from the FDA for Cinvanti, which is under review for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (“CINV”). The FDA is expected to give its decision on November 12.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3511,GILD,"2017 has been a pretty good year for pharma and biotech stocks where FDA decisions are concerned. The regulatory body has approved 40 novel drugs so far in 2017, easily surpassing last year’s total tally of 22.There were quite a few landmark approvals this year including the approval of a couple of gene-based therapies for cancer – Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah for the treatment of certain pediatric and young adult patients with a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”) and Gilead Sciences’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta, a cell-based gene therapy for the treatment of adult patients with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma who have not responded to or who have relapsed after at least two other kinds of treatment. These therapies have the potential to change the way we look at cancer treatments.Other key approvals this year include Lilly’s Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Quite a few of these drugs have blockbuster potential.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of December.Cardiovascular Outcomes Data to be Part of Amgen’s PCSK9 Inhibitor Label? Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) is looking to add cardiovascular outcomes data to the label of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha. With the FDA granting priority review to the company’s regulatory application, a response should be out on December 2.With cardiovascular disease being the leading cause of death around the world, the addition of this data to Repatha’s label could boost the product’s sales. Sales of PCSK9 inhibitors, which were once considered to be worth multi-billion dollars, are yet to ramp up significantly. Repatha sales in the first nine months of 2017 were $221 million.Amgen continues to work with payers to improve patient access to Repatha. If the FDA allows the addition of the cardiovascular outcomes data to the label, the company will be in a position to promote Repatha's ability to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes.Amgen’s shares are up 17.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 1.4% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to. While Amgen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will the FDA Approve Mylan’s Herceptin Biosimilar? Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) and partner Biocon should also get a response from the FDA for their biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster cancer drug, Herceptin (trastuzumab) this month. The FDA, which had previously extended the target action date for the biosimilar in order to review some clarificatory information provided by the companies, is expected to give a response on December 3.   We remind investors that earlier this year in July, the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ODAC”) had voted in favor of approving the biosimilar. Although the FDA is not required to do so, it usually follows the recommendations of its advisory panels.Mylan’s shares are down 3.4% year to date, compared to the 30.2% decline recorded by the industry it belongs to.Will the FDA Follow its Advisory Panel’s Recommendation for NVO’s Diabetes Drug? Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report), a key player in the diabetes market, will get to know the approval status of its latest diabetes product offering, semaglutide, this month. Once-weekly semaglutide is under FDA review for the improvement of glycemic control in adults with type II diabetes. With an FDA advisory panel voting in favor (16-0) of approval, chances of gaining approval look high.Novo Nordisk’s shares are up 43.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the 16.2% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Christmas Cheer for Aclaris? Aclaris Therapeutics (ACRS  -  Free Report), which is focused on addressing significant unmet needs in medical and aesthetic dermatology, is seeking FDA approval for its lead pipeline candidate, A-101 40%, a topical treatment for seborrheic keratosis (“SK”). According to information provided by the company, 83.8 million people in the United States are affected by SK, a common non-malignant skin tumor, with current treatments (cryosurgery, curettage, electrodessication and excision) being painful or invasive. Timely approval would make A-101 40% the first FDA-approved medication for the treatment of SK. The FDA action date is December 24.Aclaris’s shares are down 14.4% year to date, compared to the 3.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Valeant Eye Drop for Ocular Redness under Review: Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.'s (VRX  -  Free Report) New Drug Application (“NDA”) for Luminesse (brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.025%) is under FDA review with a PDUFA action date of December 27. The topical vasoconstrictor formulation has been developed to relieve redness of the eye due to minor eye irritations. If approved, the eye drop will be the first over-the-counter (“OTC”) product to be developed with brimonidine tartrate for the treatment of ocular redness.  Valeant’s shares are up 13.3% year to date, compared to the 3.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

3512,GILD,"Interest in the CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor T cells) space continues to build up with the FDA giving its nod to the second CAR-T therapy last week. Gilead Sciences’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta, a cell-based gene therapy, gained approval for the treatment of adult patients with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma who have not responded to or who have relapsed after at least two other kinds of treatment. This makes Yescarta the second gene therapy to gain FDA approval, the first being Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah. Kymriah was approved in late August 2017 for certain pediatric and young adult patients with a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”).How Does CAR-T Cell Therapy Work?CAR-T falls under the ambit of cellular immunotherapy which involves using a patient’s own immune cells to attack and get rid of harmful disease cells in the body.The CAR-T approach involves the collection of a patient’s T cells, their genetic modification outside the body, the incorporation of specific receptors which target cancer cells and finally, the re-infusion of the modified T cells back into the patient.There is a lot of enthusiasm for CAR-T as studies have shown that it can help achieve durable complete responses in some leukemias and lymphomas, including in patients who have suffered multiple relapses. However, CAR-T comes with its own set of challenges including a high level of R&D investment as well as safety issues like serious immune toxicity (“CRS”) or neurotoxicity. In fact, both Kymriah and Yescarta have boxed warnings in their labels for CRS and neurologic toxicities. These treatments will also not come cheap. While Novartis has set a price of $475,000 for Kymriah, the list price for Gilead’s Yescarta is $373,000.The FDA’s StanceWith the FDA granting back-to-back approvals to two CAR-T treatments, it looks like the regulatory environment might well be encouraging for gene cell therapy candidates.  In fact, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said that the approval of Yescarta shows the continued momentum in this promising new area of medicine. The agency intends to release a comprehensive policy on how it plans to support the development of cell-based regenerative medicine.CAR-T Stocks in FocusGiven the increased focus on this corner of the immuno-oncology market and the huge commercial potential for approved treatments in this market, here is a look at 3 companies that are working on CAR-T cell treatments.Juno Therapeutics, Inc. : Biopharmaceutical company, Juno, is focused on the development of innovative cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Juno’s cell-based cancer immunotherapies are based on chimeric antigen receptor and high-affinity T cell receptor technologies. The company has several cell-based candidates in its pipeline targeting a variety of B-cell malignancies as well as multiple solid tumors and multiple myeloma.Although the company suffered a major setback with the development of its erstwhile lead pipeline candidate due to safety issues (including patient deaths), Juno is now focusing on JCAR017, a next-generation CAR-T cell product that targets CD19. JCAR017 is currently in a registrational study for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (""NHL""). The company also has a strong partner in Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report).Juno stock has gained 131.9% year to date, substantially outperforming the 10.2% rally of the industry it belongs to.bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report): bluebird is another clinical-stage company working on developing gene therapies for serious genetic diseases and T cell-based immunotherapies for cancer. The company’s anti-BCMA CAR T therapy, bb21217, is being evaluated for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. bb21217 as well as bb2121 are being developed in collaboration with Celgene.bluebird stock has gained 131% year to date, substantially outperforming the 10.2% rally of the industry it belongs to.ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc. (ZIOP  -  Free Report): Biotech company ZIOPHARM uses innovative gene expression, control and cell technologies to provide safe, effective and scalable cell- and viral-based therapies for cancer and graft-versus-host-disease. ZIOPHARM’s immune-oncology platform includes CAR-T as well as other adoptive cell-based approaches.While announcing second quarter results, the company had said that within its CAR+ T programs, it is continuing with a phase I second generation study of CD19 specific CAR+ T for lymphoid malignancies and expects to move third generation CD19 with mbIL15 towards an early-stage study evaluating point-of-care. Plans are also on to commence a phase I study with CD33-specific CAR+ T for relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) this year. ZIOPHARM’s shares are up 0.9% so far in 2017.Juno, bluebird and ZIOPHARM are all Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In addition to the above three, companies like Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (BLCM  -  Free Report) and Cellectis also have a presence in this area. However, Cellectis, a French  biopharmaceutical company focused on developing immunotherapies based on gene-edited allogeneic CAR T-cells (UCART), has run into a roadblock with the FDA placing a clinical hold on a couple of early-stage studies being conducted on UCART123. The hold came into place after the company reported a death in one of the studies.Going forward, we expect investor focus to remain in this corner of the immuno-oncology market. In addition to tracking the performance of Kymriah and Yescarta, we believe more deals will be announced in the cell therapy space.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

3513,GILD,"BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after the market closes. BioMarin delivered a positive earnings surprise of 168.18% in the last quarter.BioMarin’s earnings track record has been strong, with the company beating estimates in each of the past four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 99.93%.BioMarin’s shares are up 5.9% so far this year. This compares unfavorably with 10.2% increase registered by the industry during this period.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayKey orphan disease drugs, Vimizim and Kuvan, which have been driving BioMarin’s top line for some time now, are likely to maintain the trend this quarter too. Robust patient growth and penetration are likely to propel sales of the drugs. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vimizim and Kuvan for the third quarter is $103 million and $102 million, respectively.However, Naglazyme and Vimzin revenues may vary on a quarterly basis due to inconsistent ordering patterns from some countries. Last week, at its R&D day, the company said that a slowdown in Federal purchasing orders in Brazil will hurt Naglazyme and Vimizim product revenues in the third quarter. Moreover, the company said that if the slowdown continues in the fourth quarter, it will only be able to meet the lower end of the total product revenue guidance ($1.25 billion and $1.3 billion, not including a $35 million milestone payment from Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. [(SRPT  -  Free Report)]) for 2017. On the other hand, if orders in Brazil are as expected, it will meet the mid-point of the guidance. Nevertheless, the drugs continue to witness steady patient growth and we expect the trend to continue this quarter.We expect management to discuss how the pipeline is progressing at the conference call. Brineura was approved in both the U.S. and EU this year for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease – a form of Batten disease. Though Brineura generated sales of only $0.3 million in the second quarter, we expect higher sales this quarter.At the Q3 investor call, we also expect management to comment on Brineura’s early launch progress and also on the launch preparation for pegvaliase. Pegvaliase, developed for treating phenylketonuria (PKU), is under review in the United States with the FDA expected to give its decision in the first half of next year.Importantly, at the Q2 call, the company had said that due to the ramp up of BMN 270 and vosoritide programs, R&D spending is expected to be higher in the third and the fourth quarters. This will result in lower adjusted net income in these quarters compared to the first and second.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that BioMarin is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -9.65% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 14 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 13 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: BioMarin’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderBioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.

3514,GILD,"GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) along with partner Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that its HIV-focused company, ViiV Healthcare, has initiated a phase III program to evaluate combination of long-acting, injectable cabotegravir and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) rilpivirine for treating adults with virally suppressed HIV-1 infection.Shares of GlaxoSmithKline have underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has lost 7.7%, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s 15.3% rally during the period.The ATLAS-2M trials comprise the third phase III study undertaken by ViiV Healthcare to investigate a two-drug regimen for the treatment of HIV. The phase III program is designed to evaluate non-inferior antiviral activity of the combination regimen at 48 weeks when administered every 8 weeks versus every 4 weeks. The study will also evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of the combination therapy. Preliminary data from the study is anticipated in 2019.Notably, ViiV Healthcare was formed in November 2009 by GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer. The partners were later joined by Shionogi in October 2012.We remind investors that another phase III ATLAS study is already evaluating the monthly dosing of the combination regimen in virally suppressed patients, while the FLAIR study is evaluating the combination in the first-line setting. Outcomes from the study are expected in 2018.Notably, last week, GlaxoSmithKline and partner J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) announced the FDA approval for Juluca, a two-drug complete regimen of Tivicay/rilpivirine and Edurant/dolutegravir as a single tablet for treating HIV-1 infection. Most medicines for HIV treatment are made up of three or more antiretroviral drugs. Juluca is the first two-drug regimen that reduces the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen.Meanwhile, several companies are working on developing drugscombination regimens to treat HIV. Gilead's (GILD  -  Free Report) bictegravir single table regimen (STR) is under priority review in the United States. The FDA is expected to announce its decision in February next year.To the uninitiated, Mylan has received a tentative approval to treat HIV from the FDA for its combination tablet comprising efavirenz, lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.With companies increasingly developing drugs to treat this life-threatening disease, competition has intensified manifold in the space.GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price | GlaxoSmithKline PLC QuoteZacks RankGlaxoSmithKline carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3515,GILD,"It has been more than a month since the last earnings report for Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 7.9% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Gilead’s HCV Sales Weak, Earnings BeatGilead reported third quarter 2017 results wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations.The company’s third-quarter earnings (including the impact of stock-based compensation expenses) of $2.27 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09. However, earnings were below the year-ago quarter figure of $2.75.Moreover, total revenues of $6.5 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.3 billion. However, revenues declined 13.2% year over year.HIV Impresses Yet Again, Harvoni & Sovaldi PlungesProduct sales came in at $6.4 billion, down 13.5% year over year. The decline was due to lower hepatitis C virus (HCV) sales, partially offset by higher sales across HIV and other therapeutic areas.Antiviral product sales, which include Gilead's HIV and liver disease portfolio, came in at $5.8 billion in the reported quarter, down 14.7%.HCV product sales, which include Harvoni, Sovaldi, Epclusa and Vosevi, were $2.2 billion, down from $3.3 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was mainly attributed to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets, partially offset by sales of Epclusa (launched in 2016) and sales of Vosevi (approved in the United States and Europe in July 2017).Sales of Harvoni declined 47.7% year over year to $973 million in the reported quarter. Further, Sovaldi sales recorded a steep year-over-year decline of 73.4% to $219 million.Epclusa garnered sales of $882 million in the reported quarter, up from the year-ago figure of $640 million. We note that Epclusa was launched in the U.S. and Europe in June and Jul 2016, respectively.Meanwhile, HIV and HBV product sales came in at $3.6 billion, up 16.1% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by continuous strong uptake of tenofoviral afenamide (TAF)-based products such as Genvoya, which generated sales of $988 million, up from $461 million in the year-ago quarter, Descovy, which recorded sales of $316 million, up from $88 million, and Odefsey, which registered sales of $296 million, up from $105 million. HIV treatments like Stribild and Complera/Eviplera sales declined 63.1% and 42.3% respectively. Viread sales were down at $274 million, down 9.6%.Atripla sales tanked 32.4% to $439 million, while Truvada sales fell 5.5% to $811 million.Other products like Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig recorded sales of $213 million (down 0.9%), $164 million (down 3.5%), $92 million (up 1.1%) and $40 million (up 2.5%), respectively.Research & development (R&D) expenses declined 24% to $745 million. On the other hand, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 3.3% to $806 million. Adjusted product gross margin was 87.2% compared to 87.6% in the year-ago period.2017 Guidance UpdatedGilead now expects net product sales in the range of $24.5-$25.5 billion, up from $24.0-$25.5 billion provided earlier. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $16 billion and $16.5 billion (earlier projection: $15.5 billion and $16 billion). HCV product sales are projected between $8.5 billion and $9.0 billion (earlier projection: $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion). Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are now projected in the range of $3.3-$3.4 billion and $3.3-$3.4 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 86-87%. Earnings per share are now projected around $1.02-$1.17 (earlier projection: 86-93 cents).Kite AcquisitionThe company recently acquired Kite Pharma. Last week, the company received FDA approval for Yescarta, a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy.Dividend and Share RepurchaseConcurrently, Gilead declared a cash dividend of 52 cents per share of common stock for fourth-quarter 2017.

3516,GILD,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) extended its strategic partnership with TARGET PharmaSolutions, Inc. The partnership has been extended for TARGET-NASH for a multi-year deal.We note that both companies announced two new collaborations in Nov 2016 for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The TARGET model is designed to provide pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners access to a robust disease state registry that is also linked to a biorepository and patient reported outcomes and provides unique data and insights compared to typical patient registries.TARGET-NASH, a longitudinal observational study is evaluating patients suffering from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Having enroled 2,364 patients at 55 sites, the study is collecting retrospective and prospective data from enroled patients and is developing a biorepository which its stakeholders can access for translational studies (including those of genomics and biomarkers).   Bristol-Myers’ stock has rallied 25.3% in the last six months compared with the industry’s rally of 14.3% gain.Bristol-Myers already has a mid-stage candidate in the NASH space. BMS-986036, an investigational pegylated analogue of human fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a key regulator of metabolism, in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH (F1-F3) achieved its primary endpoint of significant reduction in liver fat versus placebo in April. The company was entitled the rights to research, develop and commercialize BMS-986036 from Ambrx, Inc.A chronic liver disease, NASH is caused by excessive fat accumulation in the liver which in turn is known as steatosis. NASH is known to affect up to 15 million people in the United Stated and can lead to inflammation, hepatocellular injury, progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis.

3517,GILD,"Big-time investors of late have been investing a substantial portion of their R&D sources for the treatment of Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). The market for NASH is poised to witness rapid growth unlike other lucrative but saturated markets like cancer.A chronic liver disease, NASH is caused by excessive fat accumulation in the liver which in turn is known as steatosis. NASH is known to affect up to 15 million people in the United Stated and could lead inflammation, hepatocellular injury, progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis. It is expected to be the leading cause for liver transplantation by 2020. Notably, it is currently the leading cause of liver transplants for people under 50 in the United States.NASH patients are also known to be affected by obesity and type II diabetes. The disease is prevalent in European countries along with developing countries. The market for this disease is projected around $20-$35 billion. With no treatments currently approved for this disease, the market opportunity is significant.Let us take a look at the companies whose candidates are being evaluated at present for the treatment of NASH.Intercept Pharmaceuticials, Inc. (ICPT  -  Free Report) is presently evaluating lead drug Ocaliva. The drug is already approved in the United States for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) with an inadequate response to or intolerant to the standard of care, UDCA. The company currently has an ongoing phase III trial, REGENERATE, in non-cirrhotic NASH patients with liver fibrosis and top-line data from interim analysis is expected in the first half of 2019.The company also completed a phase II trial, CONTROL, to evaluate the lipid metabolic effects of Ocaliva and cholesterol management effects of concomitant statin administration in NASH patients. The company also plans to initiate a phase III trial in NASH patients with cirrhosis in the second half of 2017. Given the success of the phase II trial, we expect Intercept to be one of the first companies to obtain an approval for NASH.Biotech bigwig Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) also has quite a few programs for patients diagnosed with NASH along with advanced fibrosis. These include selonsertib (ASK-1 inhibitor; phase III), GS-9674 (FXR agonist; phase II) and GS-0976 (ACC inhibitor; phase II). The company plans to initiate combination studies with three agents in 2017.Given the increasing competition in once lucrative hepatitis C market, Gilead is looking to diversify its portfolio and foray into emerging fields of CAR T therapy and NASH. The company earlier acquired Phenex’s farnesoid X receptor program comprising small molecule FXR agonists for the treatment of liver diseases including NASH.Another major player in the biotech space, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) has a mid-stage candidate in the NASH space. BMS-986036, an investigational pegylated analogue of human fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a key regulator of metabolism, in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH (F1-F3) achieved its primary endpoint of significant reduction in liver fat versus placebo in April. The company was entitled the rights to research, develop and commercialize BMS-986036 from Ambrx, Inc.Swiss major Novartis Inc. (NVS  -  Free Report) entered into a clinical trial agreement with Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) to conduct a phase IIb study in April, involving the combination of a Novartis FXR agonist and Allergan's cenicriviroc for the treatment of NASH. The company has a collaboration and license agreement with Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CNAT  -  Free Report) for the global development and commercialization of emricasan for patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis caused by NASH.Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return  Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnBottom Line Given the potential in the market, there are many other big pharma and biotech companies having pipeline candidates for the treatment of NASH. We expect a lot of activity in the space going forward. A potential approval of any drug for NASH will attract more players.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3518,GILD,"Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ICPT  -  Free Report) reported encouraging results for third-quarter 2017. The company posted a loss of $2.89 per share in the third quarter, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.55 and the year-ago loss of $3.59.Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteQuarterly revenues were $41.3 million, up significantly from $5.1 million in the year-ago quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.9 million.Intercept’s stock has declined 43.7% year to date against the industry’s loss of 1.4%.  In particular, shares have plunged significantly over the last few days due to safety issues regarding the approved drug Ocaliva. Quarter in DetailRevenues from international markets were $4.7 million. In third-quarter 2017 Ocaliva recorded $40.9 million of sales, up from$30.4 million recorded in second-quarter 2017. Ocaliva was approved in the United States, in combination with ursodeoxycholic (UDCA) for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults who are unable to endure UDCA in 2016. The drug was also granted conditional approval by the European Commission.Sales from the United States markets came in at $36.2 million, up from $27.9 million recorded in the second quarter as prescriptions continue to grow.Research and development expenses increased 29.8% year over year to $45.9 million primarily driven by increases in clinical development programs for OCA and infrastructure to support such programs.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $61.4 million, up from $52.8 million in the year-ago quarter driven by personnel-related costs to support commercial and international initiatives and an increase in indirect expenses.2017 Outlook ReiteratedIntercept expects operating expenses to be in the middle of the earlier projected range of $380-$420 million in 2017. The company believes that continued commercialization of Ocaliva in PBC in the United States and other markets.  In order to streamline operating expenses, Intercept has decided to deprioritize its INT-767 development program.Pipeline UpdateOcaliva is being evaluated for other indications including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).The FDA has earlier approved a redesign of the phase III trial, REGENERATE on Ocaliva for the safety and efficacy in treating NASH patients with liver fibrosis. The company now needs to achieve only one co primary endpoint- either fibrosis improvement or NASH resolution as compared with the earlier target of achieving both. The sample size of the trial has also been reduced to approximately 750 patients or about 250 patients per arm. The company completed enrolment for the interim analysis cohort in the REGENERATE trial (data readout in the first half of 2019).The company also plans to initiate a phase III trial on Ocaliva in NASH patients with cirrhosis in the second half of 2017. Intercept announced trial results from two phase II trials — CONTROL (Combination OCA aNdsTatins for monitoRing Of Lipids) and AESOP for PSC. CONTROL study is being conducted to evaluate the effect of Ocaliva in combination with statin therapy on lipid metabolism in patients with NASH.  Results from AESOP revealed that OCA met the primary endpoint of statistically significant reduction in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) while results from CONTROL showed that the company achieved its objective in demonstrating that the lowest available dose of atorvastatin rapidly reverses OCA associated LDL changes to below baseline levels in NASH patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis.Our TakeIntercept’s third-quarter results were encouraging as the company reported a narrower-than-expected loss and beat on revenues.  However, prescription demand softened following the Dear Health Care Provider letter and the FDA safety communication on Ocaliva.Recently, some deaths have been reported in PBC patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B or C cirrhosis). The FDA reported 19 deaths due to Ocaliva and stated that the drug may also affect the liver. However, Intercept conducted an analysis and concluded that these patients were prescribed once daily doses of Ocaliva, which is seven times higher than the recommended weekly dose. The analysis was conducted in consultation with the FDA. The company concluded that deaths occurred due to overdosing. Consequently, Intercept issued the Dear Healthcare Provider letter. Thereafter, the FDA issued their own safety communication to reinforce recommended label dosing. Intercept is also working with the FDA on further updates to Ocaliva’s label for safety purposes.Nevertheless, such side-effects will limit the sales potential going forward. On the other hand, NASH market has huge potential and a tentative approval will boost Ocaliva’s prospects.  However, bigwigs like Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) have FXR agonists in phase II or earlier stages of clinical or preclinical development that can be used to treat PBC, NASH and the other liver diseases.Zacks Rank & Key PickIntercept currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Exelixis, Inc.

3519,GILD,"The immuno-oncology space has been in the limelight in 2017. The CAR-T therapy space in particular, has been grabbing investors, courtesy of two key approvals.The FDA’s approval of Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) suspension for the treatment of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse in patients up to 25 years of age was a significant boost for this space. Kymriah, formerly CTL019, is the first chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy approved.A novel immunocellular therapy and one-time treatment, Kymriah uses patient's T cells to fight cancer. Novartis also submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application to the FDA for Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) suspension for intravenous infusion for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Kymriah was given Breakthrough Therapy designation for r/r DLBCL which, if approved, will be the second indication for Kymriah.While the long-term impact of the treatment is yet to be evaluated, the approval opens up new frontiers for cancer treatment. To start with, CAR-T uses patient’s cells to identify and destroy cancer cells, thereby making it different from other small molecule or biologic therapies. During the treatment, T cells are drawn from a patient's blood. These cells are then reprogramed in the manufacturing facility to create genetically coded cells. This leads to the creation of a chimeric antigen receptor which recognizes and fights cancer cells and other B cells expressing a specific antigen.Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) acquired Kite Pharma to foray into this space. The FDA’s approval of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), the latter’s CAR-T therapy candidate provided a significant boost. The FDA approved the therapy as a treatment for refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma.  The therapy is also under review in Europe and an approval is expected in 2018.  Gilead also acquired therapy candidates in clinical trials in both hematologic cancers and solid tumors, including KITE-585, a CAR-T therapy candidate that targets B-cell maturation antigen expressed in multiple myeloma.Given the vast potential of the therapy, biotech companies are leaving no stone unturned to develop their pipeline candidates. Nevertheless, stiff competition continues to remain a major concern.Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  is developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies based on CAR and high-affinity TCR technologies to genetically engineer T cells to recognize and kill cancer cells.  The company is currently conducting a phase I trial with JCAR017 in adult r/r aggressive NHL, including r/r DLBCL. The company plans to initiate a phase I/II trial with JCAR017 in r/r chronic lymphocyctic leukemia (CLL) in the fourth quarter of 2017.The company expects the FDA to approve r/rDLBCL in 2018 and r/r CLL in 2019.  Shares of the company have surged a whopping 220% year to date. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report) in collaboration with Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) is evaluating bb2121, a CAR-T cell product candidate for the treatment of multiple myeloma in a phase I study.  bb2121 targets b-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) in previously treated patients with multiple myeloma. It was granted a Breakthrough Therapy status by the FDA. Both companies are also developing a second anti-BCMA CAR-T program, bb21217. Shares of the company have increased 171.0% year to date. The company presently carries a Zacks Rank #3. ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc. (ZIOP  -  Free Report) is developing CAR-T cell therapies for advanced lymphoid malignancies.

3520,GILD,"The FDA, which approved 22 novel drugs last year, has given its approval to 35 drugs so far in 2017 including a key approval in October – Gilead Sciences’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta, a cell-based gene therapy for the treatment of adult patients with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma who have not responded to or who have relapsed after at least two other kinds of treatment. This makes Yescarta the second gene therapy to gain FDA approval, the first being Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah. Kymriah was approved in late August 2017 for certain pediatric and young adult patients with a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”).Other key approvals this year include Lilly’s Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Quite a few of these drugs have blockbuster potential.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of November.Keryx’s Auryxia under Review for Label Expansion: Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (KERX  -  Free Report), which is focused on developing medicines for renal disease, is seeking FDA approval for the label expansion of Auryxia. The company is looking to get Auryxia approved for the treatment of patients with iron deficiency anemia and non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (“CKD”). A decision should be out on November 6. Approval for this indication would expand the patient population for Auryxia which brought in sales of $24.6 million in the first half of 2017.Keryx’s shares are up 2.9% year to date, compared to the industry’s 2.7% rally.Label Expansion for Bristol-Myers’s Sprycel? Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) is looking to expand the label of its blockbuster drug, Sprycel, so that it can be used for the treatment of children with Ph+ chronic phase (“CP”) chronic myeloid leukemia (“CML”). The company is also seeking approval for a powder for oral suspension (“PFOS”) formulation of Sprycel. A response from the FDA for the regulatory application, which is under priority review, is expected on November 9. Label expansion should boost Sprycel sales further - the drug brought in sales of $1.5 billion in the first nine months of 2017.Bristol-Myers’s shares are up 6.4% year to date, compared to the industry’s 15.1% rally.Bristol-Myers is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Will it be Third Time Lucky for Dynavax’s Heplisav-B? Dynavax Technologies Corporation (DVAX  -  Free Report) is awaiting a response from the FDA for its hepatitis B vaccine, Heplisav-B, this month. Earlier this year, the vaccine had got a favorable recommendation (12-1) from the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). With the positive vote, expectations were high that the company would finally gain approval for the vaccine which had previously received two complete response letters (one in November 2016 and the other in February 2013). However, the FDA action date of August 10 was pushed out by three months with the agency asking for more detailed information about the company's proposed post-marketing study for the vaccine.With the additional information being considered a major amendment to the Biologics License Application (“BLA”), the FDA is expected to give its response regarding the approval status of the vaccine by November 10. Approval would allow Dynavax to go ahead with its plans to launch the vaccine early next year.Dynavax’s shares are up 431.7% year to date, compared to the industry’s 2.7% rally.Heron’s Cinvanti under Review for CINV: Commercial-stage biotech company, Heron Therapeutics, Inc. (HRTX  -  Free Report) is awaiting a decision from the FDA for Cinvanti, which is under review for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (“CINV”). Approval would strengthen Heron’s CINV franchise by adding a second, complementary therapeutic agent. The FDA is expected to give its decision on November 12.Heron’s shares are up 18.7% year to date while the industry recorded a decline of 0.9%.Will Ultragenyx Gain FDA Approval for its First Product? Clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (RARE  -  Free Report) has an FDA action date coming up this month for vestronidase alpha or rhGUS which is under review for mucopolysaccharidosis 7 (MPS 7) also known as Sly syndrome. About 200 patients across the world are afflicted by this disease, which is one of the rarest forms of MPS. Currently, there are no approved treatments for MPS 7. Approval for rhGUS on November 16 would transform Ultragenyx into a commercial-stage company.Ultragenyx’s shares are down 31.8% year to date, compared to the industry’s 2.7% rally.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

3521,GILD,"Pharma and biotech stocks started 2017 on a strong note with this part of the market remaining in favor as the year progresses. So far this year, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index and the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index are up 25.6% and 14.6%, respectively.With investors being more comfortable with the drug pricing scenario, focus has shifted to the fundamentals of the sector. Although the drug pricing issue will remain a headwind, expectations are that steps taken by the Trump administration to drive down drug prices will not be as draconian as previously expected.  Deregulation and increased competition seem to be some of the ways that will be used to control drug prices. The FDA is working to lower healthcare costs by speeding up the development of next-generation treatments, especially for rare diseases or targeted cancer therapies and is also working on clearing up a backlog of orphan drug applications.The FDA has approved far more drugs this year than it did in the whole of 2016. Key approvals this year include Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah (the first gene therapy in the United States), Lilly’s Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Quite a few of these drugs have blockbuster potential.Meanwhile, some other factors that should continue having a positive impact on pharma and biotech stocks are new product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, strong results, a higher number of FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products.According to the Zacks Earnings Trends report, the medical sector, which has been among the better performing sectors over the last several quarters, is expected to record earnings growth of 1% on revenue growth of 4.7% in the third quarter.Given this scenario and with medical sector earnings round the corner, it would make sense to look at some pharma and biotech stocks that are expected to report a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Investing in such stocks could prove beneficial for investors as an earnings beat usually leads to significant share price appreciation.5 Drug Stocks to Keep an Eye on This Earnings SeasonWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed-in on five pharma and biotech stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) and have a positive Earnings ESP. Earnings ESP is a very valuable tool for investors looking for stocks that are most likely to beat earnings estimates. Moreover, adding a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 has produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. While you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here, you can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report): Pfizer is focused on the development and commercialization of a wide range of medicines and vaccines as well consumer health care products. The company has surpassed earnings expectations in each of the first two quarters of 2017. Key revenue drivers include Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz. Pfizer, which expects 2017 revenues to be affected by about $2.5 billion due to loss of exclusivities (LOEs), is working on bringing new products to market to make up for lost sales. The company has 15 potential blockbusters lined up for the next 5 years with about half of these potentially by 2020. Focus also remains on growing new products like Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz. Meanwhile, the impact of LOEs should continue declining in the coming years (about $2 billion in 2018 as well as 2019, $1 billion - $2 billion in 2020; $1 billion in 2021, and $0.5 billion or less from 2022 to 2025).Pfizer, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, carries a VGM Score of B. The VGM Score is a useful tool that allows investors to gain an insight into a stock’s strengths and weaknesses.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offer the best upside potential.This company, which will be reporting third quarter results on October 31, has an earnings ESP of +0.84%.Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report): Lilly, which has a strong presence in the pharmaceuticals as well as animal health segments, is slated to report third quarter 2017 results on October 24.

3522,GILD,"Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) markets blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, while other well-known names in this market are AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak, Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Olysio.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 3.2 million people in the United States are living with chronic hepatitis C infection while many remain unaware of being infected. There are about 17,000 new hepatitis C cases each year in the United States, many of which go unreported.Considering these numbers, it is not a surprise that quite a few pharma and biotech companies are working on bringing new, improved, shorter-duration HCV treatments to the market. The market is thus getting crowded and seeing increased pricing pressure.  A lot has happened in the HCV space of late.  In September 2017, Gilead Sciences’ Sovaldi received approval in China, as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen. It is the first Gilead HCV drug to be approved in China.  Meanwhile, Gilead’s single-tablet regimen (STR) of Sovaldi, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir, Vosevi received approval in the United States, EU and Canada in July/August. Vosevi became the first once-daily STR available as a salvage therapy for patients infected with HCV genotype 1–6 who have failed prior treatment with DAA regimens including NS5A inhibitors.Gilead’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has rallied 16.6% compared with the industry’s gain of 14.5% in the same time frame. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Meanwhile, AbbVie’s 8-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret/Maviret, gained approval in the United States, EU and Canada in the past couple of months. Mavyret, AbbVie’s next-generation HCV program, is a combination of glecaprevir, a potent protease inhibitor and pibrentasvir, a NS5A inhibitor. Maviret has the potential to rejuvenate growth in the HCV franchise. According to AbbVie, Mavyret may be used in up to 95% of HCV patients, depending on the stage of liver disease and prior treatment history.Abbvie’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has rallied 44% compared with the industry’s gain of 17.9% in the same time frame. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3.However, last week, pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that it is discontinuing further development of two of its next-generation hepatitis C (HCV) programs — MK-3682B (grazoprevir/ruzasvir/ uprifosbuvir) and MK-3682C (ruzasvir/uprifosbuvir). The company made this decision based on review of available phase II efficacy data and a heavily crowded HCV market.Merck’s shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has gained 9.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 17.9% in the same time frame. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3.Besides Merck, another giant Johnson & Johnson also discontinued the development of its investigational HCV treatment regimen JNJ-4178, a combination of three direct acting antivirals: AL-335, odalasvir and simeprevir. The company took this decision considering that there are several highly effective therapies available for this indication.Johnson & Johnson’s shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has gained 15.6% compared with the industry’s gain of 17.9% in the same time frame. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3.It is believed that the discontinuation of Merck and J&J’s combination HCV regimens should act in favor of Gilead and AbbVie. Gilead and AbbVie should benefit from the lack of additional competition entering the market, at least in the near term. However, the companies will continue to face challenges in the form of declining patient volume and intense pricing pressure. The lack of additional entrants in the market should also slow down the rate of decline in sales.Where Do Zacks' Investment Ideas Come From?You are welcome to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buy"" stocks free of charge.

3523,GILD,"Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), for treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL) and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). The drug was added to Gilead’s portfolio following the recent acquisition of Kite Pharma, earlier this month.Notably, Yescarta is the first CAR-T therapy approved by the FDA for the aforementioned indication. The candidate is also under review in the EU with a tentative approval expected in the first half of 2018.Shares of Gilead have outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has rallied 13.4% against the broader industry’s 12% decrease. The approval was supported by positive data from ZUMA-1 phase II study. Finds from the study showed that a single infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 72%, including 51% of patients with no detectable traces of cancer remaining. Also, 95% of patients achieved complete remission at a median follow-up of 7.9 months, who had not earlier reached the estimated median duration of response.Significantly, this CART therapy will be manufactured at Kite Pharma’s state-of-the-art commercial manufacturing facility in El Segundo, California. In the ZUMA-1 pivotal trial, Kite Pharma achieved a manufacturing success rate of 99% with a median manufacturing turnaround time of 17 days.We remind investors that Novartis A.G. (NVS  -  Free Report) has also received an FDA approval for its CAR-T therapy, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel), in August for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later stage relapse.Additionally, Juno Therapeutics  is developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies based on its CAR-T technologies in partnership with Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) for healing adults with r/r aggressive NHL, including r/r DLBCL. Hence, Gilead is expected to face an intense competition from these products in the long run.Per the company’s press release, approximately 7,500 patients in the United States, who have ran out of option to fight the disease, are detected with refractory DLBCL each year. Among them, only 7% achieves a complete remission when treated with the current standard of care.Hence, given the huge market opportunity open for Yescarta, the company can widely address the vast unmet need of patients suffering from the disease despite approved therapies in the market with such new treatment options brought to the table.Gilead Sciences, Inc.

The FDA approved the therapy for treating relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (r/rLBCL) in adults who have received two or more lines of systemic therapy.The various forms of r/rLBCL for which Yescarta is approved include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma. This is the second gene therapy to be approved in the United States after Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah, which received approval in August for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.CAR-T therapy is the most advanced form of treating cancer. This is done by modifying the patient’s T-cell, part of the body’s immune system, to fight cancerous cells. The therapy is manufactured specifically for each single patient.Gilead Sciences, Inc.

3526,GILD,"On Nov 14, major biotech players plummeted more than 5% on average. This pushed the sector to its lowest level in the recent past. Following this decline, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) and SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) tanked 11.5% in intraday trade, the sharpest fall since October.However, this decline is momentary as investors have only rotated out of biotech to tech stocks as that seemed prudent. Also, this was more of a correction than a decline and investors should buy this dip.Further, biotech stocks have rallied throughout 2017, emerging as one of the top performers this year. In fact, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) has rallied 17.1% year to date. Moreover, biotech majors have demonstrated strength despite challenges like rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs.Moreover, the drug pricing issue has ebbed and there are high hopes from Trump’s one-time tax repatriation which is slated to improve things further for the sector. Republicans have been trying hard to get the reforms implemented and there is a high possibility that we might find the new tax code by the next year. So there is no reason to shy away from biotech mutual funds.Drug Pricing Issue Has EbbedHealthcare was hit hard before the election on the price-gouging issue which was first raised by Hillary Clinton in September 2015. She had tweeted about ""price gouging"" and framed a proposal to combat skyrocketing drug prices.In March, President Donald Trump took this a little further and tweeted about increasing competition and how he wants to lower drug prices himself, sending fresh shockwaves across the industry. He had tweeted that his team was working on a ‘new system’ which would involve competition in the Drug Industry. Since this tweet, Trump has never commented publicly about drug pricing.Also, Trump's pledges to reduce FDA regulations, remove taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical-device manufacturers, and successful clinical trials for new drugs may prove to be a boon for the space. Meanwhile, some other factors that should continue having a positive impact on pharma and biotech stocks are new product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, strong results, a higher number of FDA approvals, and continued strong performance from legacy products. (Read More)Biotech Stocks Rally on Hopes of Tax CutOn Nov 16, the House of Representatives finally passed the tax cut legislation, now named the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Members of the GOP remained positive about the how the Bill would actually improve the overall economy. House Speaker, Paul Ryan even commented that the legislation would result in more jobs, increased wages and above all, higher take-home pay. The Bill reduces the corporate tax rate to 20% from the current 35%. (Read More)The proposed tax reforms, if approved, will leave more cash in the hands of biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been relatively fewer this year than the last. It goes without saying that significant uncertainty regarding the timely passing of the U.S. tax reform has cast a pall over the future of the biotech sector. (Read More)A lot of large biotech companies, have, in the recent past engaged in tax inversion in a bid to increase their revenue. Tax inversion refers to an indirect evasion of taxes which involves shifting the headquarters outside of the borders of the United States. An unwelcome development for such companies which utilized tax inversion practices is that they would now have to pay higher taxes.Per the new rules regarding tax evasion, such companies would now have to pay 20% excise tax for any payment within the company. However, the cut in taxes is likely to lure them back into the domestic territory, tackling this problem at the very root itself.More Investments in Pipeline for 2018Major biotech companies have gained primarily because of prospects of tax reforms, which would leave them with more cash for research and development, and mergers and acquisitions. Secondly, there has been a major boost in the number of FDA approvals in 2017, which has led to the development of newer products.This year has been largely successful for the sector, making it costlier for companies to engage in such deals. This is evident from the fact that there have been no major mergers this year save for Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) acquisition of Kite Pharma, Inc.on Aug 28 for $11.9 billion in cash. However, things are likely to change next year after the tax reforms are implemented.3 Major Biotech PicksHere, we have highlighted five technology mutual funds boasting a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Moreover, these funds have encouraging one-year and YTD returns. Additionally, the minimum initial investment is within $15000 and net assets are above $50 million.With the drug pricing issue long gone, the biotech stocks are poised for growth. Moreover, members of the GOP are breaking a sweat to push through the reforms makes it somewhat evident that tax reforms might be implemented. Also, Trump’s one-time tax repatriation would make it cheaper for the large biotech companies to bring the profits held overseas back home. Such developments would also lead to more investments in R&D as well as a larger number of mergers and acquisition deals going through. Under such circumstances we suggest you consider investing in biotech mutual funds.We expect these funds to outperform their peers in the future. Remember, the goal of the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is to guide investors to identify potential winners and losers.

It holds about 30 healthcare and medical stocks for the long term.Tracey has been getting questions from listeners wondering if there is any value in healthcare stocks right now. Are any of them cheap?Biotechs on FireThe biotechs are hot again. The S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) has soared 47% this year while the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology ETF (IBB) has gained 27%.But can some value still be found in the biotechs? And what about all the other healthcare industries?Zacks’ Medical Sector has over 800 companies, including drug companies, hospitals, managed care insurers, medical device companies, dental companies and others. They’re not all created equal.Tracey and Kevin ran a screen to quickly find basic value stocks within the sector. They looked only in the Medical sector and chose a current year forward P/E less than 20 and a next year forward P/E of under 15.They didn’t screen for Zacks Rank.It returned 61 stocks.Tracey and Kevin discuss about a dozen of them on this week’s podcast including these 5 big names.5 Cheap Healthcare Stocks1.      Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) has been cheap for years. It trades with a forward P/E of just 9.1. But earnings are on the decline. The company made $11.57 last year and expects to just make $8.74 this year. It recently bought KITE but will that be enough to give earnings a boost? Or is it a value trap?2.      Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) is another big biotech that is cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of just 15.6. Two analysts just raised their price targets to over $400 on the stock. Unlike Gilead, it’s expected to see earnings growth this year and next year.3.      Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) is the cheapest in the group. It trades with a forward P/E of 3.4 but investors have to be concerned about those falling earnings estimates. It made $5.14 in 2016 and is expected to make just $3.82 in 2018. Is it a value trap?4.      AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) has the rare combination of an attractive P/E at just 16.4 and rising earnings estimates. Earnings are expected to jump 14% in 2017 and another 19% in 2018. Should ABBV be on your short list?5.      Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) is in the managed care group, which, is one of the most difficult areas to be in right now due to Obamacare uncertainty. But Aetna has been reducing its exposure to the exchanges and it trades with a forward P/E of just 15.9.There are other industries that are also in the cone of uncertainty due to the unknowns surrounding Obamacare, including the hospitals.Tracey and Kevin discuss the hospital group, especially Tenet Healthcare (THC).Additionally, Valeant (VRX) appears to be cheap, but Tracey fears it’s a value trap.And what about medical device companies? They’ve been hot this year but are they just too expensive to make the list?Find out the answer to all of these questions and more on this week’s podcast.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3528,GILD,"The month of October will be highlighted by a deluge of earnings and investors’ quest for clarity on the Fed’s likely policy tightening as well as passage of tax reforms. As per the Earnings Trends issued on Sep 27, 2017, earnings growth of the S&P 500 in Q3 is expected to be 3.2% on 5% higher revenues. Third-quarter revenue growth is projected to be way higher than 2.2% in Q3 of 2016 while earnings growth might come in slightly lower than what we saw (4%) in the year-ago cycle.The economic front looks upbeat as evident by the 13-year high manufacturing activity recorded in September and a jump in new auto sales. The broader market has also seen a decent start in October, though many fear disturbingly low levels of volatility and chances of a crash if Trump fails to push through the tax reform.Against this backdrop, it is important to pin point ETFs that could safeguard investors from any sudden market swing as well as play the current momentum.Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR  -  Free Report)This can be a great momentum play. Biotech ETFs especially those with a focus on cancer therapy are on fire lately on a slew of mergers and acquisitions, FDA’s approval of CAR-T cell therapy and improving research and developments.Shares of Endocyte Inc. (ECYT  -  Free Report) soared more than 150% on Oct 2, after it acquired an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize ABX GmbH’s phase III-ready prostate cancer candidate 177Lu-PSMA-617. There was Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) buyout announcement of the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Kite Pharma . The FDA has in fact given its nod to 34 drugs so far in 2017 including three in September. This is already way higher than 22 approvals seen last year.First Trust Mid Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (FNY  -  Free Report)With both the United States and global economy on the rise, it is time to play mid-cap growth ETFs like FNY. This is because the greenback may gain strength in the coming days on an improving U.S. economy. This will go against large-cap stocks with greater foreign exposure. But through md-cap growth ETFs, investors can mitigate the adverse impact of a rising dollar while tap the surge in the global economy alongside.iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Index Fund IYTAs per the source, Dow Jones Transportation index enjoys a seasonal tailwind in October. Plus, the transportation sector is expected to witness revenue growth of 4.6% in the ongoing reporting cycle, after 10.1% growth in Q2. The transportation sector is best positioned to take advantage of falling crude. This is especially true as energy costs form a major portion of the overall costs of this sector (read: 5 Sector ETFs for Revenue Growth Play).If this was not enough, airline stocks surged on Oct 3 following Cowen & Co. analyst Helane Becker’s reiteration of an outperform rating on Delta Airlines (DAL). The analyst sees Delta’s outlook ‘positive,’ as per an article published on MarketWatch. The surge benefited the transportation ETF. Also, the fund should offer some bargains now as these stocks were battered in previous months on back-to-back hurricanes (read: Top and Flop Sector ETFs of Q3).iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Global ETF (ACWF  -  Free Report) A look at global ETFs is also warranted given the upbeat prospects. This way, investors can mitigate certain risks. And the fund looks to track the global developed and emerging market large- and mid-cap stocks chosen on the basis of value, quality, momentum and low-size scores (read: Global Dividend Payments Upbeat in Q2: ETFs to Benefit).Barron's 400 ETF (BFOR  -  Free Report) This ETF seeks to track the performance of the rules-based and fundamentals-driven Barron’s 400 Index. The benchmark looks to select high performing U.S. stocks based on four fundamental factors — growth, valuation, profitability and cash flow. The fund will suit investors seeking quality exposure (read: Are We Nearing a Bear Market?

3529,GILD,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and partner GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) announced FDA approval for Juluca, a two-drug complete regimen of Tivicay/rilpivirine and Edurant/dolutegravir as a single tablet for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.Tivicay, a novel investigational integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), is marketed by ViiV Healthcare, an HIV company majorly owned by Glaxo and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report). Edurant, on the other hand, is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) marketed by Janssen, J&J’s pharma arm. Juluca has been developed under a partnership between ViiV Healthcare and Janssen.This year so far, J&J’s share price is up 20.1%. This compares favorably with 14.1% increase witnessed by the industry.Coming back to the latest news, Juluca’s approval was based on data from two phase III SWORD studies. Data from these studies published in February this year showed that the combination of dolutegravir/rilpivirine antiretroviral was as effective as a three- or four-drug antiretroviral regimen as a maintenance therapy in HIV patients who have already achieved viral suppression.Juluca, the first two-drug regimen to be approved, reduces the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen.We remind investors that Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) bictegravir single table regimen (STR) for HIV treatment is under priority review in the United States. The FDA is expected to announce its decision in February next year. The STR is a fixed-dose combination of bictegravir, an INSTI, and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone. The combination is under review in the EU as well. Gilead’s HIV franchise is a major contributor to sales with approved drugs like Genvoya, Truvada, Atripla, Stribild, Descovy, Odefsey and Complera.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3530,GILD,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) and partner bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report) announced that their chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy candidate, bb2121 targeting b-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) in previously treated patients with multiple myeloma obtained Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA.The candidate was also granted PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) eligibility by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions while PRIME is a program launched by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need.We remind investors that Celgene entered into a collaboration agreement with bluebird bio in March 2013 to develop CAR-T cell therapies. The collaboration was amended and restated to focus on developing product candidates targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) in June 2015. The lead candidate in this program is bb2121, anti-BCMA CAR-T program is currently being studied in a phase I trial for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Both companies are also developing a second anti-BCMA CAR-T program, bb21217.CAR-T uses patient’s cells to identify and destroy cancer cells, thereby making it different from other small molecule or biologic therapies. During the treatment, T cells are drawn from a patient's blood. These cells are then reprogrammed in the manufacturing facility to create genetically coded cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor to recognize and fight cancer cells and other B cells expressing a specific antigen.The therapy has been in spotlight in 2017. Novartis AG's (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah was the first CAR-T to get FDA approval in September 2017. Last month, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) also received FDA’s approval for Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma.While the long-term impact of the treatment is yet to be evaluated, the approval opens up new frontiers in the treatment of cancer.  Meanwhile, Celgene’s stock has fallen 12% in the last six months as against the industry’s gain of 0.5%.Celgene’s third-quarter results were mixed with the company beating earnings but missing sales estimates. While Revlimid sales were impressive yet again, Otezla sales in the United States were weak which led the management to reduce annual guidance for the drug.Zacks RankCelgene is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

3531,GILD,"The biotech industry turned around this year after the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year.It had a number of things going in its favor. Strong quarterly results, new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year.However, after rising 15.4% in the first nine months of the year (January-September), the Medical-Biotech /Genetics industry has declined 13.4% so far in the fourth quarter (Oct 1 - to date). Both macro and industry specific factors resulted in the sudden downfall.Uncertain Macro PictureA big component of this sell-off is the confusion over the passing of the tax reform. The reform aims to bring down corporate tax to stimulate economic as well as employment growth.The proposed tax reforms, if approved, will leave more cash in the hands of biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been relatively fewer this year compared with the last. It goes without saying that significant uncertainty regarding the timely passing of the U.S. tax reform has cast a shadow over the future of the biotech sector.In October, President Trump once again criticized high drug prices. This came at a time when investors had started to expect that Trump's action on drug prices may not be as onerous as previously feared, sending health-care stocks lower.Tepid Q3 ResultsComing to some industry specific factors, most big biotechs beat estimates for earnings and sales in Q3. However, shares of most of these companies declined post earnings release for various reasons.Although Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) topped both earnings and revenue estimates in the third quarter, it witnessed continued decline in sales of its HCV drugs — Harvoni and Sovaldi — as a result of competitive and pricing pressure.Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) also beat expectations for both earnings and sales in Q3 and raised its earnings guidance for 2017. However sales declined year over year, which resulted in share price decline post the earnings call. Sales of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, were also disappointing.Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) shares plunged following the release of third-quarter results. Although Celgene’s earnings topped estimates, revenues fell short. Moreover, the company lowered its 2017 outlook for Otezla sales as well as its total revenue and earnings outlook for 2020.Although Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) third-quarter results were better than expected, shares were down 3.9% on concerns regarding the company’s multiple sclerosis franchise sales as well as U.S. sales of its recently launched spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”) treatment, Spinraza.Alexion (ALXN  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates but missed on revenues in the third quarter.Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) were the only two outperformers in Q3.ConclusionWe believe that the biotech space should be back on track if there is more certainty regarding the timing of the tax reforms. This is because the fundamentals of the sector remain strong. Meanwhile, with the Q3 earnings season now behind us, stocks should start picking up. Positive data from key clinical studies can drive the sector up as share price of biotechs is correlated to success in key studies. The major biotech players need an infusion of new growth drivers in their pipeline/product portfolios — either from internal development or from buying assets from outside. Strategic deals signed by these biotechs can also push the stocks higher.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

(MRK  -  Free Report), Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report), AbbVie Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) reported their third-quarter results last week.  While Merck, Celgene and AbbVie outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimates for earnings, they lagged the same for revenues. However, Bristol-Myers and Gilead surpassed expectations for both earnings and revenues.Notably, Bristol-Myers and Gilead raised their earnings outlook for 2017 as well. While Merck raised its previously issued adjusted earnings guidance, it upped sales guidance marginally. Abbvie and Celgene also tightened their earnings guidance for 2017.Here we have three biotech/pharma companies that are set to report third-quarter results on Oct 31.Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) Pfizer, which is scheduled to release earnings before the market opens, delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.08% in the last quarter. The company’s earnings performance has been mixed with the bottom line missing in two of the last four quarters while beating the same in the other two, bringing the average surprise to negative 0.39%.For this quarter, Pfizer has an Earnings ESP of -0.11% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 65 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.New products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain) and Eliquis (blood thinner) may contribute to the top line, meaningfully. Meanwhile, sales of blockbuster drug Enbrel will continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition. The lower sales trend in Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise is likely to continue as well. Sales of Viagra are expected to be affected by lower demand.

3533,GILD,"CAR-T stocks were in the news this week with key biotech player, Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) announcing its intention to acquire Kite Pharma , one of the most advanced players in the CAR-T therapy market. Moreover, the FDA approved Novartis’ Kymriah yesterday, making it the first CAR-T therapy to gain approval in the U.S.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesGilead Looks to Boost Oncology Pipeline with Kite Deal: Gilead has finally announced an M&A deal with the company saying that it will acquire Kite Pharma for $180 per share in cash or approximately $11.9 billion. Gilead has been under a lot of pressure to utilize its huge pile of cash for a major acquisition deal given the dwindling sales of its erstwhile top-selling hepatitis C virus (""HCV"") franchise. The Kite acquisition, slated to close in the fourth quarter, will place Gilead among the top players in the emerging field of cell therapy. Kite’s expertise lies in developing engineered cell therapies that express either a chimeric antigen receptor (""CAR"") or an engineered T cell receptor (""TCR""), depending on the type of cancer.Kite already has a CAR-T therapy, axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel), under priority FDA review with a response expected by Nov 29, 2017. EU approval could come next year. Axi-cel is under review for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (""NHL""), which includes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (""DLBCL""), transformed follicular lymphoma (""TFL"") and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (""PMBCL""). Other candidates in Kite’s pipeline include those targeting hematologic cancers as well as solid tumors (Also read: Gilead to Fly High with Kite Pharma Acquisition for $11.9B). Axi-cel has blockbuster potential though Novartis is currently the first company to gain approval in the U.S. for a CAR-T treatment with the FDA approving the company’s Kymriah.Kite’s shares were up 28% following the acquisition news while year to date, the stock has gained 296.9%, substantially outperforming the 9.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.With the Kite-Gilead deal being announced, other companies involved in CAR-T treatment saw their shares shooting up on hopes that more M&A deals will be announced in this segment of the market.

The companies, which had previously said that they expect a delay of at least 18 months in the resubmission of the regulatory application for baricitinib, announced that they will be resubmitting the regulatory application by Jan 2018. New safety and efficacy data will be included in the resubmission. Investors reacted positively to the news sending Incyte’s shares up 10.6%.The Medicines Co.’s Vabomere Gets FDA Nod: The Medicines Company (MDCO  -  Free Report) got a boost with the accelerated approval of Vabomere for the treatment of adult patients with complicated urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis. The drug addresses pathogens designated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (""CDC"") as urgent and serious antimicrobial resistance threats, and pathogens cited by the World Health Organization (""WHO"") as a critical need for new antibiotics. Vabomere will enjoy an additional 5 years of exclusivity given its status as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (""QIDP"") under the Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now (""GAIN"") Act. The Medicines Company intends to launch Vabomere in the fourth quarter.Priority Review for BioMarin Drug: BioMarin Pharmaceutical’s (BMRN  -  Free Report) pegvaliase got priority review in the U.S. for the reduction of blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in adult patients with phenylketonuria (""PKU"") who have uncontrolled blood Phe levels on existing management. This means a response from the agency regarding the approval status of pegvaliase should be out by Feb 28, 2018. However, with the FDA asking the company to submit additional Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (""CMC"") information, BioMarin said that it expects the review period to be extended by an additional three months (Also read: BioMarin's Pegvaliase BLA Granted Priority Review by the FDA).Acorda Down on Inbrija Regulatory Update: Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR  -  Free Report) saw its shares fall 24.3% on news that the FDA has issued a Refusal to File ('RTF"") letter for Inbrija. The agency has raised two questions in the RTF – one regarding the date when the manufacturing site will be ready for inspection and the other regarding the submission of the drug master production record. The FDA has also asked for additional information at resubmission though it has not asked for additional efficacy or safety studies. Acorda intends to meet with the FDA to discuss the RTF.Acorda is looking to get Inbrija approved for the treatment of the symptoms of OFF periods in people with Parkinson’s disease taking a carbidopa/levodopa regimen.

3534,GILD,"The cancer treatment industry is celebrating a massive victory on Wednesday, as Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) received approval for its innovative new lymphoblastic leukemia treatment, making it the first approved CAR-T therapy in the world.After achieving unprecedented results in patients with this deadly form of cancer, Novartis’ new therapy, which will be marketed as “Kymriah,” was officially approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration today.Kymriah is an example of a CAR-T therapy. CAR-T is a newly emerging method of treating cancer that includes making genetic changes to a patient’s immune T-cells and reinjecting them into the body to attack cancer cells.Unlike traditional medicines and treatments, each CAR-T therapy must be individually tailored to a specific patient. For this reason, patients seeking Kymriah will have to travel to one of just 32 locations around the country that can administer the therapy. From there, the harvested cells are sent to a Novartis facility in New Jersey, where they are edited and then sent back.And the logistics aren’t the only thing that’s challenging for patients looking to receive Kymriah. Indeed, Novartis has said that just one course of treatment will cost a staggering $475,000.Nevertheless, the prevailing reaction from the market is that this price tag is actually quite cheap, all things considered. Kymriah left about 83% of trial participants with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia cancer-free after just three months.On top of its effectiveness, Kymriah’s initial cost is also quite a bit lower than analysts were expecting. In fact, Wall Street estimates for the therapy’s opening price reached as high as $750,000 for just one dose.For Novartis, this means that Kymriah won’t be a massive revenue generator. There are only about 3,100 new cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia each year, and most of these can be treated with traditional drugs. Nevertheless, this is a monumental achievement for the company.And while Novartis is the first company in the world to receive regulatory approval for a CAR-T treatment, it is hardly the only brand developing these cures. Earlier this week, we learned that biotech behemoth Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) was planning to acquire CAR-T developer Kite Pharma  for a staggering $11.9 billion (also read: Why Did Kite Pharma Stock Skyrocket Today?).Kite’s lead CAR-T candidate, axicabtagene ciloleucel, is currently under review by the FDA. Axicabtagene ciloleucel is expected to be approved as a treatment for aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with a decision coming on or before November 29.Elsewhere in the biotech space, companies like Juno Therapeutics  and Bluebird Bio (BLUE  -  Free Report) are working to develop CAR-T therapies. Both of these researchers watched their stock prices skyrocket in response to the Kite buyout, as investors speculated that they could also become takeover targets soon.Kymriah’s approval marks the beginning of what could become a monumental moment for biotech investors, but more importantly, it is the first in what will hopefully be a long list of world-changing cancer treatments.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

However, the performance has been a mixed bag for biotech companies, with some beating market expectations, while a few failing to do so (read: U.S. Fiscal Deficit at 3.5% of GDP: ETFs in Focus).We will now discuss the performance of a few biotech giants such as Amgen Inc (AMGN  -  Free Report), Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report), Biogen Inc (BIIB  -  Free Report) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN  -  Free Report) (read: Should You Keep Your Portfolio Healthy with Biotech ETFs?).Earnings in FocusAmgen reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $3.27 per share on Oct 25, 2017, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.09 and increasing 8.3% from $3.02 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the revenue front. Amgen reported revenues of $5.773 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.743 billion but decreased 0.7% from $5.811 billion in the year-ago quarter.The company updated its full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance to the range $10.96-$11.20 from the previous guided range of $10.79-$11.37, owing to hurricane-recovery costs. It also updated its revenue guidance to the range of $22.7-$23 billion from the previous guided range of $22.5-$23 billion. The company’s shares lost around 0.8% during after-hours trading on Oct 25, 2017, after it revised down its guidance.Gilead Sciences reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $2.06 per share on Oct 26, 2017, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 and decreasing more than 25.1% from $2.75 per share in the year-ago quarter.

The company’s shares fell around 3.8% in after-hours trading on Oct 26, 2017, owing to the EPS miss.Biogen Inc reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.31 on Oct 24, 2017, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.70 and increasing 21.6% from $5.19 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company reported revenues of $3.078 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.036 billion and increasing roughly 4.1% from $2.956 billion in the year-ago quarter.The company’s shares declined 3.9% at market close on Oct 24 due to weaker-than-expected sales of its sclerosis franchise.Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.44 on Oct 26, 2017, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33 and increasing roughly 17.1% from $1.23 per share in the year-ago quarter.

3536,GILD,"Companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Endocyte (ECYT  -  Free Report) were in the news with Amgen signing a deal with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) related to the entry of its biosimilar version of Humira and Endocyte signing an in-licensing deal which could prove to be transformational for the company.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesEndocyte Soars on In-Licensing Deal: Endocyte’s shares have shot up a whopping 317% following the company’s announcement that it has got an exclusive worldwide license for PSMA-617 from ABX GmbH.

Amgen, which gained FDA approval for Amjevita, its biosimilar version of Humira, has acknowledged the validity of AbbVie’s extensive intellectual property portfolio for Humira. According to the deal, the non-exclusive license for Humira will commence on Jan 31, 2023 in the United States and on different dates in other markets including Oct 16, 2018 in most countries in the EU. Amgen will also pay royalties.This agreement has removed a major overhang on AbbVie’s shares though the company is still facing a patent challenge from Boehringer Ingelheim, which gained approval for its biosimilar version of Humira, Cyltezo, in August.Humira generated sales of $8.8 billion in the first half of 2017 including $5.9 billion in the United States, which remains a key market for the drug. With Humira continuing to perform well, it will remain a major contributor to the top-line in the coming years. Moreover, the agreement gives AbbVie ample time to focus on developing its pipeline and launching new products that will help make up for the loss of revenues once biosimilar Humira enters the market. Expectations are high that AbbVie and Boehringer Ingelheim will announce a similar settlement agreement and dismiss all patent litigation.  While AbbVie is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, Amgen is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

Ablynx is currently seeking approval for caplacizumab in the EU and expects to submit a regulatory application in the United States in the first half of 2018. Caplacizumab has Fast Track designation in the United States for the treatment of aTTP and timely approval would make it the first therapeutic specifically indicated for the treatment of aTTP, an acute, life-threatening autoimmune blood clotting disorder.CytomX in Immuno-Oncology Deal with Amgen: CytomX Therapeutics (CTMX  -  Free Report) has entered into an immune-oncology focused strategic collaboration with Amgen for the development of a CytomX Probody T-cell engaging bispecific against the epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”).While early development will be led by CytomX, Amgen will lead later development and commercialization. The companies will share global late-stage development costs. The deal will see CytomX getting an upfront payment of $40 million and issuing $20 million of common stock to Amgen. CytomX could also earn up to $455 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones for the EGFR program. Global commercial activities will be led by Amgen with CytomX having the option to opt into a profit share in the United States and receive tiered, double-digit royalties on net product sales outside the United States.The agreement also covers up to three additional, undisclosed targets. If Amgen decides to pursue all these targets, CytomX could get up to an additional $950 million in upfront and milestone payments and high single-digit to mid-double digit royalty payments. CytomX will also receive the rights to an undisclosed preclinical T-cell engaging bispecific program from Amgen for which it will make milestone and royalty payments on any resulting products under this arrangement. We expect investors to react favorably to this deal.Regeneron, Sanofi Eczema Drug Gets EU Nod: Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi gained EU approval for their eczema treatment, Dupixent. This makes Dupixent the first targeted biologic to be approved for use in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (“AD”) who are candidates for systemic therapy. Dupixent, approved in the United States earlier this year, has blockbuster potential and is being investigated for other indications as well including asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis and nasal polyps.Shares of Regeneron have gained 24.1% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 15.4% rally.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index gained almost 3% over the last five trading sessions.

3537,GILD,"Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that Health Canada has granted a Notice of Compliance (NOC) for updated label of hepatitis C virus drug, Epclusa.The drug’s label has been expanded to extend the drug’s use for patients co-infected with HIV-1.The drug was approved in Canada in July 2016 for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, or with decompensated cirrhosis in combination with ribavirin.We expect the drug’s sales to increase with this label expansion as HCV co-infection remains a major cause of morbidity in HIV-infected individuals.Last month, Health Canada granted a NOC for single-tablet regimen, Vosevi (sofosbuvir 400 mg/velpatasvir 100 mg/voxilaprevir 100 mg), for chronic HCV infection.Gilead is known for its presence in the HCV market, courtesy of its blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni. The HCV portfolio received a huge a boost when Epclusa gained approval in both the United States (June 2016) and EU (July 2016) and became the first and only all-oral, pan-genotypic, STR consisting of Sovaldi and velpatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection. The approval of Vosevi is expected to boost Gilead’s strong HCV portfolio further.However, the HCV franchise is under pressure due to competition and pricing issues. We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa, face competition from AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others. Competition as well as pricing pressure intensified further with the launch of Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier. Gilead’s stock has gained 17.5% year to date against the industry’s 17.3%.Gilead recently announced plans to acquire Kite Pharma, Inc.  to foray in the emerging field of cell therapy. Kite is a pioneer in cell therapy having developed engineered cell therapies that express either a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or an engineered T-cell receptor (TCR), depending on the type of cancer. The acquisition will diversify Gilead’s portfolio and poise the company in a dominant position in cellular therapy space. We note that investors were expecting Gilead to announce an acquisition in the near term given the decline in the once lucrative HCV market due to competitive pressure.Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3538,GILD,"The biotech industry witnessed a rebound in 2017 despite facing some odds in the previous year. The industry faced some challenges like rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs in 2016.However, we have seen the trend reversing in 2017 with more FDA approvals, new product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, strong clinical study results and continued strong performance of some legacy products. These positive factors are expected to continue to contribute to the sector’s growth through the rest of this year and maybe the next.The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index has gained 25.6% so far this year. This is in sharp contrast to last year’s performance when the index was down 22%.Some major recent events that contributed to the rally were the announcement by Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) to acquire immunotherapy focused company Kite Pharma , and the second was the FDA approval of the first gene therapy in the United States – Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah.Recently, the FDA also approved the first cancer biosimilar – Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Allergan’s Mvasi, a biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) blockbuster cancer drug, Avastin.Though the momentum in the biotech sector is likely to continue, it’s a good idea to avoid a few stocks in the industry which will not prove to be prudent additions to your portfolio.4 Sell-Rated Stocks to AvoidGetting rid of underperforming stocks at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. It will be tricky to avoid stocks from an industry which is doing well. However, we have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to shortlist the stocks that should be dumped from the vast universe of biotech sector.

3539,GILD,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Gilead Sciences has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8.3, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.3. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Gilead Sciences’ current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 12.6 over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands significantly lower than the highs for the stock, indicating that it could be a solid entry point.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should point out that Gilead Sciences has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 9.4, so it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Gilead Sciences has a P/S ratio of about 3.8. This is a bit higher than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now. This indicates that the stock is a bit overvalued from this aspect.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Gilead Sciences currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Gilead Sciences a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) for Gilead Sciences is just 6.5, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 23.5. Clearly, GILD is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Gilead Sciences might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of A. This gives GILD a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Notably, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging. The current quarter and full year have seen three and five estimates go higher in the past sixty days, respectively. The company did not witness any downward revisions in the said time frame.This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 3.9% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 6.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and Consensus  Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and Consensus | Gilead Sciences, Inc. QuoteHowever, this somewhat bullish trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock, as we have just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance in the near term. Nonetheless, the bullish analyst sentiment indicates that the stock’s prospects in the near term look good.Bottom LineGilead Sciences is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 company enjoys a solid Zacks Industry Rank (among Top 35% of more than 250 industries). However, the industry has underperformed the broader market over the past two years. This is visible from the chart below:So, value investors might want to wait for the broader industry factors to turn favorable, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye OnWith news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

3540,GILD,"Over the past few years, consolidation has become an important trend in nearly every major global industry. There’s no one reason why—although changing consumer trends, globalization, and emerging technologies are our primary culprits—but all around the world, we’ve seen countless household names join forces and shrink the competition pool.2017 has certainly extended this trend. In fact, according to the IMAA, the total global value of M&A deals is expected to once again eclipse the $4.0 trillion mark—on the back of a near-record 40,000 transaction year.Investors will also note that this year’s deals have included some of Wall Street’s most powerful brands and have had industry-rattling consequences. To celebrate this, we’ve compiled our list of the most important M&As of 2017!In no particular order, check them out now:1.       United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report)) Buys Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report)We’ll start with the newest deal on the list, as the details of this acquisition weren’t made official until early last month. Per the merger agreement, United Technologies will acquire Rockwell Collins for $140 per share in cash and stock.Upon completion, Rockwell Collins’ aircraft avionics business will merge with United Technologies’ wide portfolio—which includes aircraft engines, structures, cockpit and cabin controls, ventilation systems, and other devices—to create a brand new aircraft behemoth.Post-acquisition, United Technologies is expected to have global sales of around $67-$68 billion, and the deal is expected to generate $500 million of run-rate pre-tax cost synergies by the fourth year. Because of Rockwell’s status as a supplier to Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), the acquisition is also expected to give United Technologies greater negotiating power in the industry. 2.       Intel (INTC  -  Free Report)) Acquires MobileyeAs the public grows more and more obsessed with the impending rollout of self-driving cars, Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye has certainly emerged as one of the year’s most meaningful buyouts.The semiconductor giant scooped up the Israeli autonomous vehicle tech firm in a deal worth a staggering $15.3 billion, making it the biggest purchase of a company focused solely on the self-driving market to-date.The acquisition underscored the massive amount of cash that’s being spent on autonomous driving right now. Intel’s own automated driving group has now joined forces with Mobileye’s renowned computer vision technology, immediately cementing Intel’s status as a leader on the chip side of the business. 3.       JAB Holdings Purchases Panera BreadIn a move that has had major ramifications for the retail restaurant industry, German conglomerate JAB Holdings purchased fast-casual chain Panera Bread for $315 per share earlier this year. With the deal, JAB added Panera’s bakery cafes to its portfolio of breakfast-oriented brands, which includes Krispy Kreme, Einstein Bros. Bagels, and Keurig Green Mountain.The buyout was another major deal in a series of several purchases involving notable restaurant chains. Also this year, Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report) snapped up Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, and Burger King owner Restaurant Brands International (QSR  -  Free Report) bought out Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen.In its most recent quarter before the buyout was announced, Panera reported that company-owned comparable store sales increased 5.3%. It had been an up-and-down few years for Panera’s stock, but JAB appeared to snag the brand at an opportune time. 4.       Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report)) Scoops Up Kite Pharma Without a doubt, Gilead’s acquisition of Kite Pharma will go down as one of 2017’s most important biotech deals. Industry behemoth Gilead will pay $180.00 per share in cash for Kite, valuing the buyout at nearly $12 billion.How could a relatively small biotech research firm be worth that much money? Well, it comes down to Kite’s pipeline, which includes a CAR-T therapy that is expected to be approved by the FDA in November.CAR-T is a newly emerging method of treating cancer that includes making genetic changes to a patient’s immune T-cells and reinjecting them into the body to attack cancer cells. Many industry analysts believe that CAR-T will revolutionize the cancer treatment market, and Gilead’s deal with Kite was one of the first major investments in CAR-T by a large biotech company. 5.       Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report)) Buys Whole FoodsLast but not least, we have the monumental Amazon-Whole Foods deal. This one was obviously going to make the list, as it is has been perhaps the biggest headline on Wall Street all year and has major consequences for several industries.The deal was valued at $13.7 billion, or $42 per Whole Foods share. This was a somewhat surprising move by Amazon—and not because the company is shy about spending money. No, what shocked investors was the fact that Amazon was willing to spend nearly $14 billion on what many considered to be a gamble with a brick-and-mortar retailer.We’ve already seen Amazon slash prices on several popular products throughout Whole Foods stores, and we expect to see the e-commerce king parlay its new real estate into an advantage for delivering goods. Whether Amazon paid the right price for Whole Foods is up for debate, but this is a future-minded move that will take years to fully develop. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

3541,GILD,"Within the Medical sector, biotech stocks have performed well in the first half of the year, despite challenges like rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs. The sector recovered from the pricing controversy of 2016 and defied uncertainties surrounding President Trump’s proposed healthcare policy.Some of the factors that are responsible for the biotech sector performing well in the current year so far are an increase in FDA approvals, new product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, strong clinical study results and continued strong performance of legacy products.A few other events also contributed to the rally in the sector in the past month. These include pharmaceutical giant, Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) decision to acquire immunotherapy focused company, Kite Pharma .The FDA’s approval of Novartis AG’s NVS gene transfer treatment, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) suspension for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse was another good news for the sector. Kymriah, formerly CTL019, is the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy to be approved.Further, two companies -- Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) -- announced restructuring initiatives including job cuts recently. While the former will reduce its global workforce by about 20%, Lilly will do the same by about 8%. Both the companies plan to invest the cost savings in new drugs/line extensions which in turn bodes well for growth of the sector as well.Industry and Rank PerformanceThe broader Drugs market is up 11.9% year to date, outpacing the 11.8% gain for the S&P 500.Two of the four Zacks industries — Medical-Biomed and Genetics (16% versus 11.8%) and Large-Cap Pharma (16% versus 11.8%) have outperformed the S&P 500 Index.The Zacks Industry Rank for Medical-Biomed and Genetics is #105 (top 40% of the 265 Zacks industries), for Medical-Drugs the rank is #105 (top 40%), for  Large-Cap Pharma it is #79 (top 30%) Our back testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Which Stocks to Pick?To cash in on the favorable trends in the drug/biotech space, this is the right time to add a few stocks that have growth potential.We have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener  to select the right stocks.

Also, it is expected to record 39.9% earnings growth in 2017 and 6.3% in 2018. Sales are expected to grow 9.8% in 2017 and 10.9% in 2018.Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.

3542,GILD,"Biotech giant Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) $11.8 billion deal to buy CAR-T cancer therapy designer, Kite Pharma, Inc.  has made two other leading independent CAR-T developers, Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  and Bluebird Bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report) hot takeover targets.Terms of the Gilead/Kite Pharma DealPer the agreement, Gilead will pay $180.00 per share in cash. The total transaction value is approximately $11.9 billion. The price represents a 28% premium over the closing share price of Kite Pharma as of Aug 25, 2017.The transaction was approved by shareholders of both companies and is expected to close by the fourth quarter of 2017.While shares of Gilead have shot up 28%, that of Gilead have gone up by almost 3% since the announcement. In-fact, so far this year, Kite Pharma’s stock is up 296.8%which compares favorably with a 9.7% increase registered by the industry.Why Kite Pharma?                                 Kite Pharma’s CAR-T therapy axicabtagene ciloleucel for treating aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is under priority review in the U.S. A decision from the FDA is expected on Nov 29. We believe the solid efficacy profile demonstrated by the pivotal ZUMA-1 study of axicabtagene ciloleucel is likely to support the drug’s approval this year. In Europe, a regulatory application was filed in July 2017 with an approval and launch expected next year.According to the company, the initial market opportunity for axicabtagene ciloleucel includes about 7,400 and 7,000 addressable CAR-T patients in the U.S. and Europe, respectively, while 7,800 new cases are diagnosed in Japan every year and 25,000 in key urban/eastern rural coastal areas of China.Meanwhile, other studies with axicabtagene ciloleucel and additional candidates including KITE-585 and KITE-718 are also advancing.The acquisition should diversify Gilead’s portfolio beyond the struggling HCV franchise and position it to take share in the growing cellular therapy space. The HCV franchise is under pressure because of competition and pricing issues.Other CAR-T Therapy Makers in FocusCAR-T is manufactured for each individual patient using their own cells, thereby making it different from typical small molecule or biologic therapies. During the treatment process, T cells are drawn from a patient's blood. These cells are then reprogrammed in the manufacturing facility to create T cells that are genetically coded to express a chimeric antigen receptor to recognize and fight cancer cells and other Bcells expressing a specific antigen.While the deal might look expensive given the premium Gilead paid for Kite, the CAR-T space is expected to be revolutionary in treatments for cancer.  It represents immense potential at this juncture, thereby attracting the attention of big pharmas.It goes without saying that following Kite Pharma’s acquisition by Gilead, other small biotechs developing CAR-T therapies like Juno and Bluebird may be bought by a larger biotech, probably by Gilead or even their biggest partner Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report).Juno is developing JCAR017 in partnership with Celgene for NHL, utilizing the CAR-T cell technology. Data presented in June demonstrated a 50% complete response in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive cd19+ NHL. The company plans to bring JCAR017 to the market for NHL as early as 2018 and for multiple indications by the end of 2019. In fact, shares of Juno are up almost 43% after the Kite/Gilead deal was announced on buyout speculation.

3543,GILD,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2.1% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Gilead Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenue EstimatesGilead reported results for the second quarter wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations.Second-quarter 2017 earnings (including the impact of stock-based compensation expenses) of $2.56 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18. However, earnings were below the year-ago quarter figure of $3.08.Moreover, total revenue in the reported quarter was $7.1 billion and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.4 billion. However, revenues declined 8.2% year over year.HIV Impresses Yet AgainProduct sales came in at $7.0 billion, down 9% year over year. The decline was due to lower hepatitis C virus (HCV) sales, partially offset by higher sales across HIV and other therapeutic areas.Antiviral product sales, which include Gilead's HIV and liver disease portfolios, came in at $6.4 billion in the reported quarter, down 9.8%.HCV product sales, which include Harvoni, Sovaldi and the recently launched Epclusa, were $2.9 billion, down from $4.0 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was mainly attributed to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets, partially offset by sales of Epclusa (launched in 2016) across various locations.Sales of Harvoni declined 46.1% year over year to $1.4 billion in the reported quarter. The decline was mainly due to lower sales in the U.S and Europe. Further, Sovaldi sales recorded a steep year-over-year decline of 76.8% to $315 million.Epclusa garnered sales of $1.2 billion in the reported quarter, lower than the prior-quarter figure of $892 million. We note that Epclusa was launched in the U.S. and Europe in June and Jul 2016, respectively.Meanwhile, HIV and HBV product sales came in at $3.6 billion, up 16.1% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by continuous strong uptake of tenofoviral afenamide (TAF)-based products such as Genvoya, which generated sales of $857 million, up from $302 million in the year-ago quarter, Descovy, which recorded sales of $286 million, up from $61 million, and Odefsey, which registered sales of $258 million, up from $58 million.HIV treatments like Stribild and Complera/Eviplera sales declined. Viread sales were up at $300 million, up 4.5%. Atripla sales tanked 29.4% to $475 million, while Truvada sales fell 13.8% to $812 million.Other products like Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig recorded sales of $230 million (up 13.3%), $200 million (up 30.7%), $92 million (up 8.2%) and $35 million (down 14.6%), respectively.Research & development (R&D) expenses declined 41.8% to $864 million due to purchase of Nimbus Apollo, Inc. and an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) priority review voucher. On the other hand, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were roughly flat at $897 million. Adjusted product gross margin was 87.3%, up from 91.5% in the year-ago period.2017 Guidance UpdatedBased on a better-than-expected performance in the first half of 2017 specifically in the U.S, Gilead raised its guidance for 2017. Gilead now expects net product sales in the range of $24.0–$25.5 billion, up from $22.5–$24.5 billion provided earlier. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $15.5 and $16.0 billion (earlier projection: $15 and $15.5 billion). HCV product sales are projected between $8.5 and $9.5 billion (earlier projection: $7.5 and $9.0 billion). Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are now projected in the range of $3.2–$3.4 billion and $3.2–$3.4 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 86–88%. Earnings per share are now projected around $0.86 – $0.93 (earlier projection: $0.84 – $0.91).Dividend and Share RepurchaseConcurrently, Gilead declared a cash dividend of 52 cents per share of common stock for third-quarter 2017.

3544,GILD,"Investors in Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 15, 2017 $60 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Gilead Sciences shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Gilead Sciences is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry that ranks in the Top 36% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.00 per share to $2.11 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Gilead Sciences right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

3545,GILD,"After a lackluster performance in 2016, the drug/biotech sector has shown promise since the beginning of 2017. With no major announcement related to drug pricing control since Trump’s election as President, investors are breathing a sigh of relief. Drug pricing controversy was one the major issues that hurt the industry last year.The FDA is planning to streamline the review process for generics for speeding up approval. It suggested that instead of any direct measures for price control, the Trump administration is trying to control drug prices through competition. As the uncertainty clears, more and more investors are expected to put their money in biotech companies, pulling their shares up.Meanwhile, the acquisition of Kite Pharma, Inc.  by Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) for almost $11 billion has set the stage for further merger and acquisition (M&A) deals.  Also, the industry should benefit from tax reforms - once it makes its way through Congress. These reforms aim at allowing companies to bring back profits stored overseas at lower rates.However, controversies and rumors surrounding scrapping of Obamacare and passing of Trump’s proposed health care bill persist. A report from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that abolishing Obamacare will increase the number of uninsured people, running into millions, which will affect the demand for expensive medical procedures and devices.The rally is expected to continue on the back of an increase in demand for drugs due to a rise elderly population and prevalence of a wide variety of diseases. Drug/biotech companies are investing in developing innovative treatment with many clinical studies showing impressive results so far.Favorable Industry Rank and Price PerformanceThe broader Drugs market is up 12.4% year to date, having outpaced the 11.5% gain for the S&P 500.Two of the four Zacks industries — Medical-Biomed and Genetics and Large-Cap Pharma have outperformed the S&P 500 Index.The Zacks Industry Rank is #96 (top 38% of the 250 plus Zacks industries) for Medical-Biomed and Genetics, #91 (top 36%) for Medical-Drugs, #56 (top 22%) for Large-Cap Pharma and #245 (bottom 4%) for Generic Drugs.

3547,GILD,"The biotech sector got a shot in the arm last week thanks to two major developments that led to a rally in the sector. The first catalyst was Gilead Sciences’ (GILD  -  Free Report) decision to acquire immunotherapy focused company, Kite Pharma  and the second was the FDA approval of the first gene therapy in the United States – Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah.Gilead has been under a lot of pressure to utilize its huge pile of cash for a major acquisition deal given the dwindling sales of its erstwhile top-selling hepatitis C virus (""HCV"") franchise. The $11.9 billion Kite acquisition, slated to close in the fourth quarter, will place Gilead among the top players in the emerging field of cell therapy. Kite’s expertise lies in developing engineered cell therapies that express either a chimeric antigen receptor (""CAR"") or an engineered T cell receptor (""TCR""), depending on the type of cancer.With the Kite-Gilead deal being announced, other companies involved in CAR-T treatment saw their shares shooting up on hopes that more merger and acquisition (M&A) deals will be announced in this segment of the market. These include companies like Juno Therapeutics  and bluebird bio (BLUE  -  Free Report).Meanwhile, the FDA approval of Novartis’ CAR-T therapy also gave the sector a boost indicating the beginning of a new era in the treatment of cancer. The path-breaking immunocellular therapy is a one-time treatment that uses a patient's own T cells to fight cancer.The NYSE ARCA Biotech Index was up almost 9% last week with most biotech stocks recording solid gains.Will the Rally Continue?  Biotech stocks were once a strong favorite chalking up impressive gains until 2015 when the drug pricing issue started weighing on the sector. But the sector rebounded in 2017 and is on a roll since the beginning of the year with the industry gaining 15.9% year to date, outperforming the broader market which is up 10.7%.A key question now facing investors is will the rally continue and is this the right time to invest in this corner of the market?The biotech sector is currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 40.5, well above the S&P 500 price-to-earnings ratio of 18.3, which makes it rather expensive.However, a look at the sector’s performance over the last five years shows that there is significant room for upside given the five-year high of 111.3%.So, what are the factors that could drive the rally? First and foremost, this is an industry that will continue to witness demand for its products given an aging population and the increasing prevalence of a wide variety of diseases. Strong pipelines, innovative treatments, impressive results, and increased health care spending should support growth. Trump's pro-business stand is also expected to benefit the sector.A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow down innovation should also work in favor of the sector. The FDA has approved far more drugs so far in 2017 than it did in the whole of 2016.With the Gilead-Kite deal, expectations are that M&A activity will pick pace. Finally, although drug pricing remains a headline risk this year as well, investors now seem to be more comfortable with the drug pricing scenario and are willing to look at the fundamentals of the sector. On the flip side, the estimate revision trend for the sector is not very encouraging. The growing presence of biosimilars, a slowdown in growth of legacy products and high profile pipeline setbacks are also challenges for the sector. And, as we mentioned earlier, drug pricing will remain a headline risk.As far as M&As are concerned, activity in this area could be muted given the “wait and watch” stance adopted by most companies regarding the drug pricing situation and tax reforms. Another major deterrent is high valuations with companies remaining wary of bidding wars leading to over-priced deals.However, licensing deals should continue especially in orphan and rare disease areas as well as highly sought after therapeutic areas like immune-oncology.The bottom-line is that although biotech stocks are definitely not cheap at current levels, there is still some room for upside in this “high risk - high returns” industry. 2017 is expected to be a catalyst-rich year for the sector with several major pipeline events lined up. Some buy-ranked biotech stocks include Gilead, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN  -  Free Report). While Gilead is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, Regeneron and Alexion are Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks.

3548,GILD,"Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (VRX  -  Free Report) have declined 7.6% so far in 2017 against 1.6% gain of the industry. Shares fell further 6.9% on Aug 29.Once an acquisition giant, Valeant has been caught up in various controversies since October 2015 due to price hike of specialty drugs, erroneous financial reporting and termination of contracts with Philidor Rx Services.Following a substantial decline in Valeant’s share price in the first quarter of 2016, Bill Ackman and Steve Fraidin joined the board in March 2016 as part of Pershing Square’s effort to stabilize the company. Thereafter, Joseph C. Papa took charge as the new CEO. The new management took various efforts to turnaround the company.Even though it is still early to comment on the rebuilding process but the company’s efforts to sell non-core assets and lower debt is commendable. Valeant sold its equity interests in Dendreon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to China-based Sanpower Group Co. Ltd. Valeant has also decided to sell Obagi. The company reduced debt by $4.8 billion and expects to meet its target of $5 billion debt reduction ahead of schedule. The divestiture of non-core assets should help the company streamline its product portfolio and focus better on core areas of dermatology and lower debt.However, weakness in the dermatology segment persists and is expected to impact the top line.Valeant recently announced that the FDA confirmed to issue a Voluntary Action Indicated (VAI) inspection classification for its Bausch + Lomb manufacturing facility in Tampa, FL as part of a forthcoming Establishment Inspection Record for the facility. With this confirmation, manufacturing uncertainties related to the current and upcoming regulatory submissions will be eliminated for products manufactured at the facility.In August 2017, the company received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA regarding the New Drug Application (NDA) for latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution, 0.024%, an investigative intraocular pressure lowering single-agent eye drop for patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The CRL from the FDA refers to a Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) inspection at Bausch + Lomb's manufacturing facility in Tampa, FL.On a positive note, the company received FDA filing acceptance for the NDA for Plenvu (NER1006), a novel, low volume polyethylene glycol-based bowel preparation for colonoscopies. Earlier, the FDA approved its new psoriasis treatment, Siliq. The company had an agreement with AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) for Siliq but the agreement has been amended.Although the approval of new drugs brings some hope. We believe it is still a long road ahead for Valeant before the investor faith can be restored. Earlier in the year, Bill Ackman, chairman of Perishing Square Holdings, Ltd stated that investing in Valeant  was a big mistake on his part.Zacks Rank & Key PicksValeant currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the health care sector are Aduro Biotech, Inc. (ADRO  -  Free Report) and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) . Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3549,GILD,"Late last week, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced its decision to discontinue the development of a couple of candidates in its hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) program - MK-3682B (grazoprevir/ruzasvir/ uprifosbuvir) and MK-3682C (ruzasvir/uprifosbuvir). The company’s decision was based on a review of available phase II efficacy data and the growing competition in the HCV market. Merck itself has a marketed product in the HCV market in the form of Zepatier (elbasvir and grazoprevir) which brought in sales of $895 million in the first six months of 2017 (including a $40 million favorable adjustment to rebate accruals due to mix of business). While Merck will continue to work on expanding Zepatier’s utilization across the world, uptake will be impacted by the ongoing decline in overall patient volumes in many markets and increased competition.Gilead and AbbVie in HCV SpotlightMerck’s announcement has now put the spotlight firmly on Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), two key players in this market.Gilead is the undisputed leader in the HCV market with its HCV products bringing in sales of $5.4 billion in the first half of 2017. The company revolutionized the treatment paradigm in the HCV market with the introduction of Sovaldi by cutting down the duration of treatment to as few as 12 weeks instead of the prior standard of care of up to 48 weeks. Moreover, the need for peg-interferon injections, which come with several side effects, was reduced or eliminated completely.Gilead launched Harvoni next, the first once-daily single-tablet regimen for the treatment of the most prevalent HCV genotype in the United States. This was followed by the launch of Epclusa, the first all-oral, pan-genotypic, single-tablet regimen for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection. This year, Gilead gained approval for yet another HCV treatment, Vosevi.Although Gilead ruled the HCV market for quite a few years, sales are declining given intense pricing pressure, growing competition, pricing scrutiny and a declining patient population. The approval of newer HCV products has resulted in a rapid increase in the number of patients who were treated and cured followed by a decline in the number of patients seeking care and being able to access HCV treatment. Gilead expects HCV net product sales in the range of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion in 2017 (announced with Q2 results), representing quite a drop from last year’s HCV product sales of $14.8 billion.Meanwhile, AbbVie’s HCV products include Mavyret (glecaprevir/pibrentasivr), Viekira Pak (ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir tablets co-packaged with dasabuvir tablets) and Viekira XR (dasabuvir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir). While Mavyret was approved recently, Viekira sales were $488 million in the first half of 2017. Mavyret, the company’s next generation HCV offering, should be a meaningful contributor to sales from 2018.Other HCV drugs include Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza (daclastavir) and Janssen Therapeutics’s Olysio (simeprevir).We remind investors that Merck is not the only company to have taken the decision to halt the development of HCV candidates. Last month, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) had announced its decision to terminate a collaboration agreement with Achillion Pharmaceuticals (ACHN  -  Free Report) for HCV.J&J’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals said that it would be discontinuing the development of the investigational HCV treatment regimen JNJ-4178, a combination of three direct acting antivirals: AL-335, odalasvir and simeprevir.With both Merck and J&J dropping their investigational HCV treatments, Gilead and AbbVie should benefit from the lack of additional competition entering the market, at least in the near term. While the companies will continue to face challenges like declining patient volume and intense pricing pressure, the lack of additional entrants in the market should slow down the rate of decline in sales.Gilead has been working on expanding the HCV market by encouraging baby boomers to get tested. According to the company, there has been an 80% increase in HCV antibody screening by baby boomers since the start of this initiative. Increased testing has led to an increase in diagnosis with about 190,000 people being newly diagnosed with HCV in 2016, up 32% from 2015. This represents a significant opportunity for the existing players in the HCV market.Both Gilead and AbbVie are Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

3550,GILD,"Shares of Bluebird Bio (BLUE  -  Free Report), a major player in the emerging gene therapy and CAR-T research markets, slumped more than 6% in morning trading Monday after receiving a key analyst downgrade.In a note to clients, Morgan Stanley downgraded the biotech firm from “Equal weight” to “Underweight” and reiterated its price target of $105.00 per share. That call would represent a 23.5% drop from Friday’s close.Morgan Stanley’s Matt Harrison said that he expects shares to underperform, citing headwinds in Bluebird’s sickle cell business. Still, the analyst noted that Bluebird’s BCMA-targeting CAR-T candidate does provide some valuation support.As most biotech investors will know by now, CAR-T therapy is an emerging method for treating cancer that includes making genetic changes to a patient’s immune T-cells and reinjecting them into the body to attack cancer cells.Bluebird currently has several active clinical and pre-clinical programs under its CAR-T umbrella. The company’s lead CAR-T program, bb2121, is a collaboration with biotech giant Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) and has produced encouraging data thus far in its Phase 1 study.It’s been a busy year for the CAR-T industry, as several major milestones have been reached. In August, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) received approval for its innovative new lymphoblastic leukemia treatment, making it the first approved CAR-T therapy in the world.And earlier that same week, biotech behemoth Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that it was acquiring Kite Pharma , another competitor in the CAR-T market. Gilead will pay a staggering $11.9 billion for Kite, which is expected to receive approval for its own CAR-T therapy in November.For more on the current state of the CAR-T market, check out our Friday Finish Line team’s exclusive interview with Brad Loncar, the creator of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy Index:Want more stock market analysis from this author?

3551,GILD,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that it is discontinuing further development of two of its next-generation hepatitis C (HCV) programs — MK-3682B and MK-3682C — as the market is becoming extremely crowded.MK-3682B was an all-oral, triple combination regimen (3682/uprifosbuvir, in combination with grazoprevir and ruzasvir1) developed for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. MK-3682C was a combination of ruzasvir/uprifosbuvir.Merck’s shares have risen 9.2% this year so far compared with a 16.4% increase for the industry.The company will now focus on growing sales of its key HCV drug in the market, Zeptier, which is approved for use with ribavirin to treat chronic HCV genotype 1 or 4 infection. Zepatier, a once-daily, fixed-dose combination tablet containing the NS5A inhibitor elbasvir and the NS3/4A protease inhibitor grazoprevir, is gradually becoming a key top-line driver for Merck along with cancer drug Keytruda.The medicine recorded sales of $517 million in the second quarter of 2017, much higher than $378 million in the first quarter, attributable to strong underlying demand trends in the United States, Europe and Japan as the company continues to launch Zepatier globally. However, we remind investors that at the second quarter conference call, management had warned that Zepatier uptake, going forward, may be impacted by the ongoing decline in overall patient volumes in many markets and increased competition.The HCV market is getting crowded and is thus seeing increased pricing pressure. Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) markets blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, while other well-known names in this market are AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak, Bristol-Myers’ Daklinza and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Olysio.Moreover, other companies are also looking to bring new, improved, shorter-duration HCV treatments to market.AbbVie’s pan-genotypic shorter-duration HCV regimen of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P), Mavyret, received approval in the United States., Canada and the EU in July/August. Meanwhile, Gilead already markets Epclusa, an all-oral, pan-genotypic, single tablet HCV regimen since 2016. Meanwhile, Gilead’s single-tablet regimen (STR) of Sovaldi, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir, Vosevi received approval in the United States, EU and Canada in July/August. Vosevi became the first once-daily STR available as a salvage therapy for patients infected with HCV genotype 1–6 who have failed prior treatment with DAA regimens including NS5A inhibitors.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3552,GILD,"During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump had stressed on tax reforms and promised that bringing down corporate tax would be his top priority as the President of the United States. Keeping his words, Trump proposed changes in tax rates for both individuals and corporates to stimulate economic growth as well as employment growth.Tax ReformsThe plan proposes to lower the current corporate tax rate of 35%, one of the highest in the world, to 15%. This is expected to favorably impact the post-tax earnings of companies. A territorial tax system (tax on only domestic income) has also been proposed for American companies so as to create a level playing field. It also suggests the elimination of special tax breaks for companies. Another major reform proposed is the repatriation of trillions of dollars held as cash reserve overseas by the companies with global operations for one-time tax (reportedly 10%). A similar tax move was made for bringing in overseas cash reserves by the Bush administration in 2004 for one-time tax of 5.25%. A number of companies repatriated an amount exceeding $300 billion.The current tax code allows tax repatriation at 35% rate. However, it gives tax credit for the amount of tax paid in overseas country.Anticipated ImpactThe reforms have been proposed to create new jobs and aid economic growth through expanded investment as more cash will available to companies through tax cuts and repatriation. However, the extent to which these steps will be successful is uncertain. A large portion of the repatriated cash in 2004 was used to fund share buybacks and dividend payments. Though the buybacks fueled a stock rally, there was no actual economic growth.The tax reforms are expected to benefit companies which have operations around the globe. A similar buyback this time is also expected to help the stocks grow.  Large cap pharma companies based in the United Sates with major operations worldwide including J&J, Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Gilead Sciences and others are sitting on huge pile of cash reserves stashed in overseas countries. The repatriation will benefit these large drug/biotech companies more than the tax savings due to rate cutsMoreover, repatriation of cash held overseas will create a surplus in domestic cash reserve, which may fuel merger & acquisition (M&A) in the sector. The industry has seen only two major acquisitions this year, Actelion by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Kite Pharma, Inc.  by Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report), which is expected to close by 2017 end.Let’s discuss the impact of tax reform on the some drug/biotech giants.Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson is a well-known brand all over the world catering to a wide variety of medical needs. The company has paid tax at an effective rate of 16.5%, 19.7% and 20.6% for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Therefore, a revision of tax rate to 15% will not bring a huge positive change in post-tax earnings. As of June end, J&J had $12.9 billion in cash reserve, down almost 70% from 2016 year end. The company has used a major chunk of its cash reserves in 2017. Hence, J&J is expected to be least impacted by these reforms.AmgenThe company has a strong presence in the oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, bone health and nephrology markets. The effective tax rate for Amgen in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were 15.7%, 13% and 7.6%, respectively. Hence, a tax rate cut will have minimal effect. Amgen had nearly $35 billion in overseas cash as of 2016 fiscal end, per a Bloomberg report. The total cash reserve of the company has changed minimally in the first six months of 2017. So, the repatriation reform may initiate a buyback. Moreover, after 10% tax, it will have more than $30 billion in domestic cash reserve, if the total overseas cash is repatriated. This increase in domestic cash can also be used in acquiring new drug technologies like CAR-T therapy.Gilead SciencesGilead recently announced its plan to acquire Kite Pharma for nearly $12 billion, adding the latter’s CAR-T therapy candidate to its pipeline. Gilead is planning to complete the acquisition through a combination of cash and debt. Per a Bloomberg report, Gilead had $29.3 billion of cash reserves in overseas countries at the end of 2016. A repatriation will help the company to pay off the debt quickly. The effective tax rate has been between 16% and 21%, which suggests a minimal impact due to tax rate cut.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

3553,GILD,"The biotech sector is going through the roof right now with SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI  -  Free Report) adding over 9% in a month (as of Sep 11, 2017). Plenty of factors are powering the sector. Among these, breakthrough U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals, success in the immune-oncology field, and mergers and acquisitions are at the forefront.Biotech stock Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report) received a new FDA approval for cystic fibrosis drug, Kalydeco. In early September, FDA approved “Novartis AG' breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) suspension for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in second or later relapse,” as per the source.Investors should note that CAR-T is a fresh immunocellular therapy and many companies are eyeing it. In fact, Gilead Sciences GILD announced the buyout of Kite Pharma KITE for $11.9 billion in late August (read: Biotech ETFs Soar on Gilead-Kite Deal). Kite Pharma is expected to receive approval for its CAR-T therapy axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) shortly. With this acquisition, Gilead will step into the new arena of oncology treatment, known as CAR-T, which targets the body’s own immune system to fight tumors.Two months ago, Clovis Oncology CLVS shares also skyrocketed following the company’s positive cancer drug data. The company then said that clinical trial data on its ovarian cancer drug treatment indicated that it may substantially help more patients than expected (read: 4 Stocks & ETFs to Buy on Clovis' Positive Drug Data).If this was not enough, Teva Pharmaceutical TEVA shares surged over 19% on Sep 11 as it appointed a former Novo Nordisk (NVO) as CEO. The new recruitment followed Teva’s last full-time CEO’s seven-month term and resignation amid a bribery scandal.Compelling Valuation Biotech stocks were the most hurt among the S&P 500 members last year. This has probably made the space cheap and helped it to be back with a bang. Biotech ETF XBI added about 17.7% in the last three months (as of Sep 11, 2017) while SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report) was up 2.9%. The fund XBI has a relative strength index of 66.95. This means that the fund is yet to enter the overbought territory.Also, fears over price gouging are ebbing substantially in the Trump administration. In a nutshell, the space is riding on research and development and may log more returns ahead.ETFs to Tap Below we highlight a few biotech ETFs that can benefit investors with solid gains (see all Health Care ETFs here).Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull 3X (LABU  -  Free Report) Ultrapro Nasdaq Biotechnology Proshares (UBIO  -  Free Report) ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotechnology (BIB  -  Free Report) iShare Nasdaq Biotech ETF (IBB  -  Free Report) Bioshares Biotech Clinical Trial (BBC  -  Free Report) VanEck Vectors Biotech ETF (BBH  -  Free Report) Bioshares Biotech Products (BBP  -  Free Report)    Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR  -  Free Report)    ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF (SBIO  -  Free Report)Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

3554,GILD,"Biotech stocks are back in favor thanks to two recent major developments that led to a rally in the sector. The first catalyst was Gilead Sciences’ (GILD  -  Free Report) announcement that it will be acquiring immunotherapy focused company, Kite Pharma  while the FDA approval of the first gene therapy in the United States, Novartis AG’s Kymriah, boosted the sector further.The Gilead-Kite deal has raised expectations that the sector will finally see more merger and acquisition (M&A) deals in the coming quarters. Moreover, companies involved in CAR-T treatment like Kite saw their shares shooting up on hopes that more M&A deals will be announced in this segment of the market.   Meanwhile, the approval of Novartis’ CAR-T therapy, Kymriah, also gave the sector a boost indicating the beginning of a new era in the treatment of cancer. The path-breaking immunocellular therapy is a one-time treatment that uses a patient's own T cells to fight cancer.Year to date, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index is up an impressive 26.1%, representing a sharp contrast to the Index’s performance during this same time period last year when it recorded a decline of 18.2%.A key reason for last year’s dismal performance was the drug pricing controversy which weighed on the sector a major part of the year. However, investors now seem to be more comfortable with the drug pricing scenario and are willing to look at the fundamentals of the sector.A key question that remains on the minds of investors is whether the rally will continue and what are the factors that will drive the same.Firstly, this is an industry that will continue to witness demand for its products given an aging population and the increasing prevalence of a wide variety of diseases. Strong pipelines, innovative treatments, impressive results, and increased health care spending should support growth. Trump's pro-business stand is also expected to benefit the sector.A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow down innovation should also work in favor of the sector. The FDA has approved far more drugs so far in 2017 than it did in the whole of 2016. The sector will receive an additional boost if more M&A deals are announced though companies are likely to adopt a “wait and watch” stance as they await more clarity regarding the drug pricing situation and tax reforms. Another major deterrent could be high valuations with companies remaining wary of bidding wars leading to over-priced deals.That said, licensing deals should continue especially in orphan and rare disease areas as well as highly sought after therapeutic areas like immune-oncology.Picking the Right StocksPicking biotech stocks can be a bit tricky given the “high risk - high returns” nature of the industry. Moreover, the estimate revision trend for the sector is not very encouraging. The growing presence of biosimilars, a slowdown in growth of legacy products and high profile pipeline setbacks are also challenges for the sector.Keeping these factors in mind, we have zeroed in on five biotech stocks that currently hold a strong Zacks Rank and look well-positioned.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report): Tarrytown, NY-based Regeneron's key areas of focus include eye diseases, heart disease, allergic and inflammatory diseases, pain, cancer, infectious diseases and rare diseases. While eye drug, Eylea, the company’s key growth driver continues to perform well, Regeneron has been working on diversifying its portfolio and gained FDA approval for two drugs this year - Dupixent (moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis) and Kevzara (moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis). Both drugs have blockbuster potential.The company also has a strong pipeline and has an eventful second half of the year coming up with key mid-to-late stage pipeline catalysts lined up. Regeneron just reported positive top-line phase III data on Dupixent for asthma and is now looking to go ahead with a U.S. filing by year end. Dupixent should also gain EU approval for the eczema indication in the third quarter. Regeneron is evaluating Dupixent in the pediatric atopic dermatitis setting. Another important data readout scheduled for the second half of the year is on the company’s PD-1 antibody REGN2810, for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (""CSCC""), the second most common skin cancer after basal cell carcinoma and the second deadliest skin cancer after melanoma. Positive data would allow the company to file for FDA approval in the first quarter of 2018.Meanwhile, Eylea is being evaluated in combination with nesvacumab. Top-line data from two phase II studies - one in wet age-related macular degeneration and another in diabetic macular edema - are expected in the fourth quarter of the year.Regeneron, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, has gained 28.4% year to date, substantially outperforming the 15.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report): New Haven, CT-based Alexion’s flagship product, Soliris (eculizumab), continues to perform well and the company is working on expanding Soliris’ label for additional indications. Alexion has a key catalyst coming up with a decision from the FDA expected by Oct 23, 2017, regarding the approvability of Soliris for refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). EU approval for this indication came last month making it the first and only complement-based therapy approved for an ultra-rare subset of gMG. The gMG indication represents incremental growth opportunity for Soliris.Alexion, which had a rough 2016 with shares falling 35.9%, looks set to recover lost ground with shares gaining 15.4% year to date. The efforts of the company’s new management team to turn things around are impressive. Alexion’s R&D strategy is being redefined with a focus on key expertise areas. The company will continue to grow its rare diseases business which includes Soliris, Strensiq and Kanuma. To increase productivity, Alexion will focus its internal research efforts on its complement expertise and its development efforts on its core therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders. The company has also decided to de-prioritize certain pipeline candidates and is discontinuing its preclinical programs with mRNA therapies as well as other preclinical programs that do not fall within the complement franchise. Alexion is a Zacks Rank #1 stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report): San Diego, CA-based Ligand’s business model is based on developing or acquiring royalty revenue generating assets and coupling them with a lean corporate cost structure. The company is focused on the development and licensing of biopharmaceutical assets. Ligand’s Captisol formulation technology has allowed it to enter into several licensing deals and generate royalties. Ligand’s partners include big names like Amgen and Novartis among others. The company also has licensing deals based on its OmniAb technology. Ligand, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 34.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the 15.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO  -  Free Report): Richmond, CA-based Sangamo is focused on translating ground-breaking science into genomic therapies using its platform technologies in genome editing, gene therapy, gene regulation and cell therapy. Sangamo got a major boost earlier this year following the signing of a collaboration agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of gene therapy programs for hemophilia A.Shares of Sangamo, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, have gained 341% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 15.7% rally.Fate Therapeutics, Inc. (FATE  -  Free Report): San Diego, CA-based Fate is focused on the development of programmed cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders. Fate’s hematopoietic cell therapy pipeline includes NK- and T-cell immuno-oncology programs and immuno-regulatory programs. Shares of Fate, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, have gained 64.1% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 15.7% rally.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3556,GILD,"Not only is September historically the worst month for the equity market, stocks presently look susceptible to a pullback due to Harvey, North Korea tensions and U.S. government shutdown. However, fresh data have indicated that the domestic economy continues to grow at a steady albeit slow pace. Corporate earnings also continue to impress and from a trading perspective, more market participants are expected this month as vacation time comes to an end.Thanks to these encouraging developments, Wall Street is expected to be more disciplined and prepared to withstand the habitually rough trading period. Thus, investing in solid stocks that have given consistent returns this month will be judicious. The Somber September  Investors shouldn’t sell based solely on the calendar, but, this seasonal peculiarity can’t be ignored as we head into a busy month of trading. Since the World War II, the S&P 500 Index has seen losses in September. Also, September has seen the worst monthly drop in equities on average.Stock Trader’s Almanac found out that since 1950, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones averaged a loss of 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite, as incepted in 1971, averaged a loss of 0.5%, as did the Russell 2000 of small-cap stocks since it was started in 1979. Such a dismal performance compelled Jeff deGraaf, head of Renaissance Macro Research, to tell his clients that we are “entering the only month of the year that has statistically significant negative returns.”This year could also spring surprises. With North Korea attacking Japan, hurricane Harvey wreaking havoc and the political climate in the United States losing stability, possibilities of a market correction haunt investors.Market-Jolting Events that Spooked Investors North Korea’s ballistic missile launch over Japanese airspace reignited tensions. This has resumed the logjam between Pyongyang and President Trump that had unnerved markets in August. The South Korea military that was conducting a war game with the United States has been put on alert, while Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the missile test an “unprecedented, grave and serious threat that seriously damages peace and security in the region.”On the domestic front, Harvey, the first major hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in almost 12 years, has put vast areas under water. The rainstorm originated from a tropical depression which rapidly ballooned from a Category 1 hurricane to Category 4. It worsened due to a lethal confluence of meteorological events. While it is too early to gauge the financial impact of the hurricane, some experts are calling for losses in the double-digit billions. The hurricane disrupted oil refineries and led to a decline in shares of insurance companies (read more: 4 Home-Improvement Stocks to Buy Post Harvey Mayhem). As if all of that wasn’t enough, anxiety gripping the Wall Street over the debate to raise the federal government’s debt ceiling has frayed relations between President Trump and the Republican leadership. Such disputes, may, further delay the implementation of the promised pro-business policies. In fact, with the disconnect growing, the chances that the government will shut down is 50/50, says Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS  -  Free Report).Positive Economic Environment & Earnings Buoy MarketsBut, let’s be optimistic. Not everything is as dampening about the markets. The U.S. GDP expanded 3% in the second quarter, the fastest rate of growth in more than two years. An uptick in consumer outlays and business investment helped the economy gain traction. Increased spending on goods and services pushed consumer expenditure up 3.3% in the said quarter. Consumer spending – the biggest driver of the economy – picked up on higher income for consumers and low inflation.The second-quarter earnings season, in the meanwhile, has come to an end for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with results from 491 S&P 500 members or 98.2% of the index’s total membership already out. Total earnings for these companies are up 11.2% from the same period last year on 5.6% higher revenues, with 74.3% beating EPS estimates and 68.4% beating revenue estimates (read more: Plenty of Small-Cap Earnings Still to Come).Investors Will be Back, Market to See Some UpsideWith the Labor Day fast approaching, the summer months and vacations are soon to be over. During such holiday periods, major market participants don’t make big moves. Big decisions are often postponed. But, once the summer months come to an end and the markets get back to normal, the major decisions are taken.This suggests that trade will increase and market leaders will return and take control of the equity market in a commanding manner. Furthermore, typically after Labor Day, the market is slow for a day or two before things pick up pace.5 Top-Performing Stocks for SeptemberSeptember may be a rocky month for the stock market.

3557,GILD,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) suspension for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse.Kymriah, formerly CTL019, is the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy approved. A novel immunocellular therapy and one-time treatment, Kymriah uses patient's T cells to fight cancer.CAR T is manufactured for individual patients using their own cells thereby making it different from typical small molecule or biologic therapies. During the treatment, T cells are drawn from a patient's blood. These cells are then reprogrammed in the manufacturing facility to create genetically coded cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor to recognize and fight cancer cells and other B cells expressing a specific antigen.The drug was developed in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania.In addition, the FDA has approved a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for Kymriah to inform and educate healthcare professionals about the risks that may be associated with Kymriah treatment.Meanwhile, Novartis plans to make additional filings for Kymriah in the United Staes and EU later this year for Kymriah for the treatment of adult patients with r/r diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In April, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Kymriah based on data from the JULIET study.Novartis also teamed up with the United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to improve efficiencies in current regulatory requirements to deliver value-based care and ensure access for this specific patient population.Kymriah will be manufactured for each individual patient using their own cells at the Novartis Morris Plains, New Jersey facility.Our TakeThe approval is a major boost for Novartis given the potential in the CAR T therapy space.  The approval opens up new frontiers in the treatment of cancer by advancing immunocellular therapy for children and young adults with r/r B-cell ALL which comprises approximately 25% of cancer diagnoses among children under 15 years old and is the most common childhood cancer in the United States.An approval was in the cards as the FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) had unanimously recommended the approval of immunocellular therapy in Jul 2017.The approval will also boost Novartis’ already strong oncology portfolio which boasts of Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, and Jadenu. Novartis is also working on the label expansion of Kymriah.Novartis stock has rallied 14.9% in the year so far compared with the industry’s 11.1% gain.Going forward, we expect that the approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing ones will bode well for Novartis even though stiff generic competition for key drugs like Gleevec continues to act as a major deterrent.Earlier in the week, biotech giant Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that it will buy Kite Pharma, Inc.  to foray into the emerging field of cell therapy. Kite’s axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) is being developed for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL) and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). The Biologics License Application (BLA) for the candidate was submitted in March 2017. This CAR T therapy is currently under priority review in the United States and the FDA is expected to give a decision on Nov 29, 2017.Zacks Rank & Key PickNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Aduro Biotech, Inc. (ADRO  -  Free Report) which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3558,GILD,"Welcome back to Mind Over Money. I’m Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of Behavioral Economics.This episode is all about the risk-reward mechanics of decision-making. Sometimes we avoid making decisions, and often we never learn from our bad ones. I was fortunate that I became a high-frequency currency trader some 20 years ago and learned how to make lots of decisions every hour that I could never afford to regret, and only learn from.But that doesn’t mean I don't still fall prey to the bad habits we all have when faced with uncertainty and risk.Did you ever wonder how great investors and traders make decisions that put them consistently ahead of their peers?I do not put myself in the category of greatness, but I know a little about those who belong because I’ve spent considerable time in the past two decades studying great short-term traders and great long-term investors.Now in finance, you always have to be careful when talking about success to make sure you are not just high-lighting the survivors. Since there’s always a winner, we have to make certain we are looking at credible degrees of success, over time, that go beyond mere randomness.When I studied short-term traders in the 1990s in the commodity and currency pits of Chicago, and read about them in Jack Schwager’s Market Wizards book, I came away with six pillars of behavior that seemed to make all the difference over time and across markets. They were...1) Psychology: not just awareness of bias and decision-making, but continuous process improvement.2) Probability: without sound mechanics of situational risk and reward, it’s way too easy for emotions and bias to take over.3) Systems: not just a computer that spits out signals, but systems for everything from your research process to performance evaluation.4) Risk Management: precise rules for capital allocation and preservation are crucial to long-term survival.5) Discipline: speaks for itself, especially if making dozens of decisions per day that require consistent rule-following.6) Consistency: can you run all these processes for years and survive the vagaries of changing markets and seasons?What happens when a trader or investor doesn’t try to master these principles and skills? At worst, they lose all their money quickly. At best, they might get lucky and survive, but not for long.And in the middle is the majority that slowly watches their money bleed away a little every week, sometimes in bigger chunks.When I saw how hard it was to apply these principles in the chaos of markets, I looked to two different sciences to help explain it. Behavioral finance, spear-headed by Nobel prize winner Daniel Kahneman,looked at human decision making under uncertainty and risk with experiments to find out what do most people do in a given situation.I say that these researchers study us from the “outside-in” to explain behavior. And the neuroscientists, of course, study us from the “inside-out” to explain our actions.After I read as much of the important research from both sciences as I could handle, I came up with a stunning conclusion: Your Brain Wasn’t Made to Trade.And it fit with what evolutionary biologists and anthropologists were teaching us about what kinds of brains a few million years of “fits and starts” from natural selection gave us. They definitely weren’t made for staring at prices moving rapidly up and down and changing our wealth outlook by the second.How do I know? Because most of us naturally do exactly the wrong things, especially in short-term trading. We hold on to losing trades and we take profits too soon. This, is the mathematical recipe for making your money go away over time.In trading, the Golden Rule is “Cut thy losses short, and let thy winners run.” But most human traders (and monkeys) do exactly the opposite as fear, greed, illogical biases and ego take over, and we make our money go away from us.We assume we can make rational decisions about our money that are best for the long-term, but that is a big assumption. Most of us are very irrational when it comes to every day money/risk decisions and long-term planning ones.I covered much of this in my March 21, 2017 episode “Irrational Demands: Of Anchors, Pearls, and Procrastination.”Well, back in 2004, I was pretty proud of my original idea that Your Brain Wasn’t Made to Trade. Then I remembered a book I had read in 1990 that probably helped me along this path. New World, New Mind by Robert Ornstein and Paul Ehrlich, the former a neuropsychiatrist and the latter a biologist who was famous for some of his alarming calls about over-population back in the 70s and 80s. Their book proposed that...The evolution of our brains, and our ability to sense cataclysmic change that takes place over long periods of time, is simply not going fast enough. The only thing that can make a difference is accelerated cultural evolution.Here’s how one bright observer, who reviewed the book on Amazon, described it...""One of the more compelling points the authors make is that not only are politicians being elected and rewarded on the basis of short-term decisions that are by many measures intellectually, morally, and financially corrupt, but the so-called knowledge workers--the scientists, engineers, and others who should be ""blowing the whistle,"" are so specialized that there is a real lack of integrative knowledge.""Can you think of some areas – besides the obvious climate change debate – where short-term thinking blinds us to long-term effects and changes?I think of education vs. the entertainment machine where parents are far too likely to let their kids have electronic gadgets, TVs, and phones to babysit them because mom and dad have stuff to do, or both parents work.Another is the nuclear arms race which seemed to be a problem that got put on ice in the 1990s and now with North Korea rattling their sabre this month, we feel that old question again “Could it really happen?”This is one of the biggest examples that Ornstein and Ehrlich highlighted in New World, New Mind. I can’t remember exactly how they framed the problem or their solution – other than new cultural and political institutions that move beyond warfare as a primary solution -- but the first thing that comes to mind for me is that if some of us are more irrational than others, why do we sleep tight thinking we can prevent nuclear war when just about any very lucky idiot could get his hands on a missile?That’s scary stuff. And we can’t say for sure we’ve figured out a good solution just because we’ve gone 60-some years without incident. Our stone-age brains can barely comprehend that kind of cataclysm. So it’s easier not to think about. But Ornstein and Ehrlich thought we should try anyway.If you think I have a solution, I don't. But I am an eternal optimist and so in the rest of this episode of the Mind Over Money podcast, I share a book by another dynamic duo who 25 years later care about our fate – and science – just as much as Ehrlich and Ornstein.I also break down this week’s big trading in “immuno-oncology” stocks such as Kite Pharmaceuticals , which was bought by Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) for $12 billion and caused a feverish rally in related peers like Juno Therapeutics  and bluebird bio (BLUE  -  Free Report). I tell you how I’m playing these stocks and whether or not Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) might be the next bidder for a little biotech wonder.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the Healthcare Innovators portfolio.

3559,GILD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) showered gains on the biotech ETF world on August 28 by announcing the buyout news of Kite Pharma  for $11.9 billion. GILD shares gained over 1.2% while KITE shares surged about 28% on the day, responding to the super deal.Kite Pharma is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, focused on the development and commercialization of cancer immunotherapy products. The company is developing a pipeline of eACT-based product candidates for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies.The deal marks Gilead Sciences’ biggest deal for a new cancer treatment that will help the company to look away from its receding sales of medicines for hepatitis C infections and focus on some budding zones. Gilead said it will be a $180 per share all-cash deal.With this, Gilead will step into the new arena of oncology treatment – known as CAR-T – which targets the body’s own immune system to fight tumors. As per the source, Kite “doesn’t have a treatment on the market yet, is awaiting U.S. approval for a drug for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer.”Since Gilead is yet to see prodigious success itself in cancer research, it had to go for an inorganic expansion to establish its presence in this apparently most-wanted area. Needless to say, this megadeal acted as a cornerstone for the entire biotech space (read: Stocks to Fight Cancer: Why Immunotherapy Is a Gamechanger).Inside the Participant Stocks  Gilead has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with VGM (Value-Growth-Momentum) score of C. On the other hand, Kite Pharma has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with a VGM score of F, at the time of writing.In this situation, targeting a basket or ETF approach would be more intriguing than single stock pick plays. First, through ETF ways, investors get to play the overall evolvement of the biotech space and certain downbeat VGM scores of GILD and KITE would not come in the way of investors’ optimism.After all, immune-oncology is expected to rule the next-era biotech trading. Like yesterday, biotech stocks saw some great trading about two months ago, when Clovis Oncology (CLVS  -  Free Report) shares gained about 46.5% following the company’s positive cancer drug data (read: 4 Stocks & ETFs to Buy on Clovis' Positive Drug Data).ETF Impact Kite Pharma has weights in the range of 4.5% to 6% in funds like ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF (SBIO  -  Free Report), ARK Genomic Revolution Multi-Sector ETF (ARKG  -  Free Report), Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Dynamic Biotechnology and Genome (PBE  -  Free Report). The funds gained about 3.8%, 5.3%, 6.2% and 2.5%, respectively, on August 28, 2017. Biotech ETFs like ARKG, Bioshares Biotech Clinical Trial (BBC  -  Free Report) (up 4.0%) also hit a 52-week high (see all healthcare ETFs here).Investors should note that Gilead Sciences has a considerable focus (in the range of 8% to 10%) on VanEck Vectors Biotech ETF (BBH  -  Free Report) and iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB  -  Free Report), which obviously got a spike from the said acquisition news. BBH and IBB were up 1% and 1.9%, respectively, on August 28.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

3560,GILD,"Of late, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are investing in immuno-oncology research therapies as it remains a key area of focus, thanks to its vast growth potential. Last week, the immuno-oncology space grabbed investors’ attention with the FDA approving Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) suspension for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse.Kymriah, formerly CTL019, is the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy approved. A novel immunocellular therapy and one-time treatment, Kymriah uses patient's T cells to fight cancer.While the long-term impact of the treatment is yet to be evaluated, the approval opens up new frontiers in the treatment of cancer. To start with, CAR-T uses patient’s cells to identify and destroy cancer cells, thereby making it different from other small molecule or biologic therapies. During the treatment, T cells are drawn from a patient's blood. These cells are then reprogrammed in the manufacturing facility to create genetically coded cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor to recognize and fight cancer cells and other B cells expressing a specific antigen.With the approval of Kymriah, investors have started to shift their focus on a number of companies which have been developing their pipeline candidates to remain afloat in the highly competitive environment.4 Stocks That Warrant a LookKite Pharma Inc.  is expected to receive approval for its CAR-T therapy axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) shortly. The Biologics License Application for the candidate was submitted in March 2017. The application was gr priority review in the United States and the FDA is expected to give a decision on Nov 29, 2017. The candidate is also under review in the EU with a tentative approval expected in 2018. The candidate is being developed for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma.Given the likely approval and potential in the space, Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) has inked a deal to acquire Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion.

3561,GILD,"Biotech giant Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that it will buy Kite Pharma, Inc.  to foray into the emerging field of cell therapy.Terms of the Agreement As per the agreement, Gilead will pay $180.00 per share in cash at a transaction valued at approximately $11.9 billion. The price represents a 28% premium over the closing share price of Kite as of Aug 25, 2017.The transaction was approved by shareholders of both companies and is expected to close by the fourth quarter of 2017. The acquisition is expected to be neutral to the bottom line by the third year and accretive thereafter.Strategic BenefitWe note that Kite is a pioneer in cell therapy having developed engineered cell therapies that express either a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or an engineered T cell receptor (TCR), depending on the type of cancer. The most advanced therapy candidate in Kite’s pipeline is axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) which is being developed for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL) and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). The Biologics License Application (BLA) for the candidate was submitted in Mar 2017.This CAR T therapy is currently under priority review in the United States and the FDA is expected to give a decision on Nov 29, 2017. The candidate is also under review in the EU with a tentative approval expected in 2018. While Kite is prepared for a commercial launch in the United States as manufacturing preparation are complete, the company is currently building infrastructure in Europe. We remind investors that another pipeline candidate in clinical trials in both hematologic cancers and solid tumors is KITE-585, a CAR T therapy candidate that targets BCMA expressed in multiple myeloma.Our TakeThe acquisition will diversify Gilead’s portfolio and position the company in a dominant position in cellular therapy space.We note that investors were expecting Gilead to announce an acquisition in the near term given the decline in the once lucrative hepatitis C (HCV) market due to competitive pressure. Gilead is known for its presence in the HCV market because of its blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni. However, the HCV franchise is under pressure because of competition and pricing issues.We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa face competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR, among others. Moreover, Gilead was sitting on $21.1 billion of cash and short-term marketable securities. Hence, an acquisition announcement was lurking.CAR T is manufactured for each individual patient using their own cells thereby making it different from typical small molecule or biologic therapies. During the treatment process, T cells are drawn from a patient's blood. These cells are then reprogrammed in the manufacturing facility to create T cells that are genetically coded to express a chimeric antigen receptor to recognize and fight cancer cells and other Bcells expressing a specific antigen.While the deal might look expensive given the premium Gilead paid for Kite, the CAR T space is expected to be revolutionary in treatments for cancer.  The CAR T space represents immense potential at this juncture and a potential approval of axi-cell will be a significant boost for Gilead’s prospects which has dampened of late.Gilead’s stock has declined 4.3% in the year so far, against the industry’s 9.3%.Apart from Kite, Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) is another company that is focussed on CAR T treatments.  In July, the FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) unanimously recommended the approval of immunocellular therapy candidate CTL019 (tisagenlecleucel) and a decision is expected shortly (September-October).CTL019 could become the first CAR T cell therapy if approved. CTL019, an investigational CAR-T therapy, is being evaluated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory (r/r) pediatric and young adult patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A potential approval will also open new frontiers in the treatment of cancer by advancing immunocellular therapy for children and young adults with r/r B-cell ALL.On the other hand, shares of Kite were up 28% on the news as the company will immensely benefit from Gilead’s dominant position in the biotech space upon an anticipated approval for its lead candidate. In fact, this year so far, Kite Pharma’s stock is up 297.1%, which compares favorably with a 9.3% increase registered by the industry.Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3562,GILD,"Shares of Juno Therapeutics  continued to soar on Tuesday. The stock has now gained nearly 40% since the announcement that fellow CAR-T cancer therapy designer Kite Pharma  is being acquired by biotech behemoth Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report). Along with Kite and Bluebird Bio (BLUE  -  Free Report), Juno is a leader in the development of CAR-T cancer treatments—a therapy that includes making genetic changes to a patient’s immune T-cells and reinjecting them into the body to attack cancer cells. Kite is significantly further in the approval process than Juno and Bluebird, and its lead candidate, axicabtagene ciloleucel, is currently under review by the FDA. Axicabtagene ciloleucel is expected to be approved as a treatment for aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with a decision coming on or before November 29. On Monday, Gilead announced that it was acquiring Kite for $11.9 billion in an all-cash deal. The buyout valued Kite at $180 per share, a 29% premium to the company’s closing price on Friday (also read: Why Did Kite Pharma Stock Skyrocket Today?).  “The acquisition of Kite establishes Gilead as a leader in cellular therapy and provides a foundation from which to drive continued innovation for people with advanced cancers,” Gilead President and CEO John F. Milligan said in a statement. Of course, the acquisition immediately inspired speculation that Juno and Bluebird would also become takeover targets. With a market cap of just $3.8 billion, Juno would be the cheapest of the three CAR-T leaders; however, the company recently took a step back in the approval process. In March, Juno announced that it was discontinuing development of its lead CAR-T candidate, which had already reached Phase 2 development.  Bluebird’s CAR-T program, bb2121, is still in Phase 1, but the drug has pretty encouraging data so far. Bluebird’s market cap currently sits at about $4.9 billion. Interestingly, both Juno and Bluebird have partnerships with Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report), another global biopharma giant. However, Bluebird’s partnership only extends to its bb2121 project, so it could a more diversified buyout candidate—especially considering that the company has another gene therapy program targeting beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Nevertheless, Juno might emerge as the lowest-priced CAR-T pure play right now. Want to know more about Kite?

Although the kit supply issue was resolved in the first quarter, the company underestimated the complexity of the conversion from the XTS to Cellex devices, resulting in lower-than-anticipated net sales. Moreover, these transitional issues are expected to persist in the upcoming quarters.As expected, weakness in the Specialty Generics segment continues. The segment recorded sales of $216 million, down 18% but better than management’s expectation due to the active pharmaceutical ingredients products and controlled substances and other products categories.Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses in the reported quarter increased 3.2% to $232.1 million. Meanwhile, research and development expenses declined 7.5% to $69.2 million.During the second quarter, the company repurchased 2.4 million ordinary shares for $100.7 million under its share repurchase programs, bringing the total repurchased in the first half to 8 million.2017 GuidanceThe company reiterated its earnings guidance of $7.40 to $8.00 for 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is $7.53. Mallinckrodt PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Mallinckrodt PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Mallinckrodt PLC QuoteOur TakeMallinckrodt’s second-quarter results were mixed as the company beat on earnings but missed on sales as weaknesses in the generics segment persist. While Acthar sales continue to be strong on the back of increased formulary positions and access for appropriate patients in both the commercial and public environments, sales of Therakos is expected to decline.The company is currently streamlining its business. The company aims to focus better on its specialty pharmaceutical business after having sold its Nuclear Imaging business. The company also sold its Intrathecal Therapy business. On the other hand, the acquisition of hemostasis drugs – Recothrom Thrombin topical (recombinant), PreveLeak and Raplixa (fibrin sealant) – from The Medicines Co.

3564,GILD,"Life science company, Bayer AG (BAYRY  -  Free Report), reported a mixed second quarter with earnings surpassing expectations but sales falling short. While the Pharmaceuticals, Animal Health and Covestro segments recorded a year-over-year increase in sales, the Crop Science and Consumer Health divisions recorded a decline.The Crop Science business was hit by high channel inventories in Brazil, the world’s second-largest agriculture market, while a difficult environment in the U.S. market weighed on the performance of the Consumer Health segment. Given the performance of these two segments, the company now expects 2017 sales of more than €49 billion instead of sales of about €51 billion.Core earnings per share from continuing operations are now expected to grow by a low- to mid-single-digit percentage (old guidance: mid- to high-single-digit percentage).The Life Science businesses are expected to generate sales of €35 billion - €36 billion (previously: approximately €37 billion). The company lowered its outlook for the Consumer Health and Crop Science segments. The second half of the year is expected to be weak for the Consumer Health business with sales expected in the range of €6 billion (previously: more than €6 billion).The Crop Science business is now expected to generate sales of less than €10 billion (previously: sales of more than €10 billion).Given the lowered outlook, Bayer has been witnessing downward revisions in earnings estimates for both 2017 and 2018 over the last 30 days. While 2017 estimates are down 2.6%, 2018 estimates have declined 1.6%.While Bayer, a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock, sorts through the headwinds being faced by the Crop Science and Consumer Health segments, we advise investors to focus on drug stocks with a strong Zacks Rank  -- #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).Our PicksAlexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report): New Haven, CT-based Alexion reported a strong second quarter with both earnings and revenues topping expectations. The company also raised its revenue and earnings outlook for the year. Flagship product, Soliris (eculizumab) continued to perform well. Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label and has a key catalyst coming up with a decision from the FDA expected by Oct 23, 2017, regarding the approvability of Soliris for refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). A decision in the EU, where a positive CHMP opinion was received, is also expected in the third quarter.Alexion, which had a tough 2016 with shares falling 35.9%, looks set to recover lost ground with shares increasing 13.1% so far in 2017, outperforming the 9.7% rally of the industry it belongs to. The new management team laid out its strategic roadmap and said that its R&D efforts will be focused on its expertise area of complement biology and core therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology, and metabolic disorders. Alexion will be working on growing its rare disease business. A Zacks Rank #1 stock, Alexion is witnessing upward revisions in earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 over the last 30 days. Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 26.1%.Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report): French pharma giant Sanofi raised its 2017 earnings outlook (at constant exchange rates – CER) following the release of second quarter results. Sanofi has a strong presence in several markets including diabetes, cardiovascular, rare disorders, vaccines and consumer healthcare. The company, which had recorded a decline in share price last year, has gained 18.6% year to date, outperforming the 10.4% rally of the industry it belongs to. Earnings estimates for 2017 are up 2.2% over the last 7 days. Although the company’s diabetes segment will remain under pressure, Sanofi could well be poised for a turnaround on the back of new product approvals and sales ramp up of recently launched products.Sanofi is a Zacks Rank #2 stock. The company also has a VGM style score of “B”. The VGM style score is a useful tool that allows investors to gain an insight into a stock’s strengths and weaknesses.While “V” stands for Value, “G” stands for Growth and “M” for Momentum -- the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics.

3565,GILD,"The second quarter earnings season is drawing to a close with 94.8% of S&P 500 stocks having reported results as of Aug 18, 2017. Thirteen of the 16 Zacks sectors recorded earnings growth with total earnings increasing 10.6% from the year-ago period on revenue growth of 5.6%. While 74.9% beat earnings estimates, 68.4% topped revenue expectations.  The Medical sector is one of the sectors to consistently record earnings growth over the last few quarters. The sector, which recorded earnings growth of 5.7% on revenue growth of 5.8% in Q1, has recorded earnings growth of 6.7% on the back of revenue growth of 4.3% so far in Q2. A look at the beat ratio shows earnings beat of 82.7% and revenue beat of 67.3%.Biotech stocks specifically fared pretty well with most of the key players topping earnings and revenue expectations. Quite a few companies raised their outlook for the year as well. Biotech stocks have had a strong run so far in 2017 with the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index soaring 15% year-to-date (YTD). This is in sharp contrast to last year’s performance when the Index was down 19.1%. There were several reasons for the sector’s dismal performance last year foremost being the drug pricing controversy. Although drug pricing remains a headline risk this year as well, investors now seem to be more comfortable with the drug pricing scenario and are willing to look at the fundamentals of the sector.The FDA has also approved more drugs so far this year than it did in the whole of 2016. Last year, 22 drugs were approved while 28 have gained approval so far in 2017. Some of the drugs approved this year represent blockbuster potential.The second half of 2017 is expected to be catalyst rich for quite a few companies with data expected across a wide range of therapeutics areas. As far as mergers and acquisitions are concerned, we do not expect much activity in this area given the “wait and watch” stance adopted by most companies regarding the drug pricing situation and tax reforms. Another deterrent could be high valuations with companies remaining wary of bidding wars leading to over-priced deals.However, licensing deals should continue especially in orphan and rare disease areas as well as highly sought after therapeutic areas like immune-oncology.Our ChoicesHere is a look at four biotech stocks that delivered positive earnings surprises in the second quarter and are witnessing upward revisions in earnings estimates for 2017. All these companies are either Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report): New Haven, CT-based Alexion delivered a “beat and raise” quarter with flagship product, Soliris (eculizumab) continuing to perform well. Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label and has a key catalyst coming up with a decision from the FDA expected by Oct 23, 2017, regarding the approvability of Soliris for refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). Alexion got a boost this week with Soliris gaining EU approval for this indication making it the first and only complement-based therapy approved for an ultra-rare subset of gMG. The gMG indication represents incremental growth opportunity for Soliris.Alexion, which had a rough 2016 with shares falling 35.9%, looks set to recover lost ground with shares increasing 9.1% so far in 2017, outperforming the 4.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. The efforts of the company’s new management team to turn things around are impressive. Alexion is redefining its R&D strategy with a focus on its key expertise areas. The company will continue to grow its rare diseases business which includes growing Soliris, Strensiq and Kanuma. To increase productivity, Alexion will focus its internal research efforts on its complement expertise and its development efforts on its core therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders. The company has also decided to de-prioritize certain pipeline candidates and is discontinuing its preclinical programs with mRNA therapies as well as other preclinical programs that do not fall within the complement franchise. Alexion, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 5.3% upward over the last 30 days.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report): Tarrytown, NY-based Regeneron's key areas of focus include eye diseases, heart disease, allergic and inflammatory diseases, pain, cancer, infectious diseases and rare diseases. While eye drug, Eylea, the company’s key growth driver continues to perform well, Regeneron has been working on diversifying its portfolio and gained FDA approval for two drugs this year - Dupixent (moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis) and Kevzara (moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis). Both drugs have blockbuster potential.The company also has a strong pipeline and has an eventful second half of the year coming up with key mid-to-late stage pipeline catalysts lined up. Top-line phase III data on Dupixent for asthma are due later this quarter – positive data would allow the company to go ahead with a U.S. filing in the fourth quarter. Dupixent should also gain EU approval for the eczema indication in the third quarter. Regeneron is evaluating Dupixent in the pediatric atopic dermatitis setting. Another important data readout scheduled for the second half of the year is on the company’s PD-1 antibody REGN2810, for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), the second most common skin cancer after basal cell carcinoma and the second deadliest skin cancer after melanoma. Positive data would allow the company to file for FDA approval in the first quarter of 2018.Meanwhile, Eylea is being evaluated in combination with nesvacumab. Top-line data from two phase II studies - one in wet age-related macular degeneration and another in diabetic macular edema - are expected in the fourth quarter of the year.Regeneron has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 15.2% upward over the last 30 days. Regeneron, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 27.9% year to date, substantially outperforming the 4.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report): Foster City, CA-based Gilead is well known for its presence in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV markets. Gilead topped estimates in the second quarter with its HCV business doing better than expected in the U.S. The company said that HCV patient starts in the first six months were better than originally expected. Moreover, the launch of an educational campaign in Oct 2016 to encourage testing of baby boomers has led to an 80% increase in HCV antibody screening by baby boomers, which in turn has led to an increase in diagnosis. The company’s HIV franchise also continues to do well and the company is progressing with its pipeline that includes treatments under evaluation for cancer, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and inflammatory diseases. Gilead raised its outlook for the year. Gilead has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised almost 7% upward over the last 30 days. Gilead is a Zacks Rank #2 stock.Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report): San Diego, CA-based Ligand’s business model is based on developing or acquiring royalty revenue generating assets and coupling them with a lean corporate cost structure. The company is focused on the development and licensing of biopharmaceutical assets. Ligand’s Captisol formulation technology has allowed it to enter into several licensing deals and generate royalties. The company’s partners include big names like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) among others. Ligand also has licensing deals based on its OmniAb technology.Ligand has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised almost 10.4% upward over the last 30 days. Ligand, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 24.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the 4.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

3566,GILD,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission (EC) approved a label expansion of lead drug Soliris.The European Commission expanded the indication for Soliris to include the treatment of refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adults who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive.We note that Soliris is approved for two severe and ultra-rare disorders resulting from chronic uncontrolled activation of the complement component of the immune system – paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).In order to increase the commercial potential of the drug further, Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label into additional indications. Alexion has aslo filed regulatory application to the FDA for expanding the use of Soliris for the treatment of refractory gMG in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive. The FDA accepted the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of Oct 23.A potential label expansion in the U.S. will boost sales further.  Soliris will be launched for this new indication initially in Germany while Alexion is evaluating launches in additional EU countries.Alexion’s stock price has increased 9.1%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 5.3%.Additionally, a phase III study (PREVENT) on Soliris in patients with relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is ongoing with enrolment being expected to be completed in 2017 and data expected in 2018. Label expansion into additional indications will give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.We note that Soliris has received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for the treatment of patients with MG in the U.S. and EU, and for the treatment of patients with refractory gMG in Japan.We expect growth at Alexion to continue being driven by Soliris. Other new products – Strensiq and Kanuma – are doing well and are expected to boost revenues. However, Soliris quarter-to-quarter revenue growth ($70 million - $100 million) will be impacted by the enrolment ramp-up of trials.The company is expecting Soliris revenues to be lower in the second half of the year due to an accelerating impact from the ALXN1210 trials. In addition, pricing will impact sales by 1%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAlexion currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the healthcare sector include Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

3567,GILD,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) recently announced that its subsidiaries, Mylan Inc. and Mylan Specialty L.P., have signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and two other relators. The agreement finalizes the Medicaid drug rebate settlement worth $465 million, announced in Oct 2017.  The settlement resolves claims which relates to the classification of EpiPen Auto-Injector and EpiPen Jr Auto-Injector for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.DOJ wanted to ascertain whether EpiPen products were properly classified with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a non-innovator drug under the applicable definition in the Medicaid Rebate statute. The drugs were subjected to the formula which is used to calculate rebates to Medicaid for such drugs.We note that Mylan has been under immense pressure since Aug 2016 when the company came under the spotlight for price increase of EpiPen since its acquisition of the drug in 2007, drawing immense criticism from lawmakers, consumers and the common people alike. Further, Mylan made it to the headlines for wrongly classifying EpiPen as a generic product in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The misclassification implied that Mylan has been vastly underpaying rebates to Medicaid for the drug for a long time than it would have if the drug was classified as a branded one.EpiPen Auto-Injector was classified as a non-innovator drug with CMS before Mylan acquired the product in 2007 based on longstanding written guidance from the federal government.Nevertheless, the settlement provides for resolution of all potential Medicaid rebate liability claims by the federal government, as well as potential claims by certain hospitals and other covered entities that participate in the 340B Drug Pricing Program. Moreover, Mylan will reclassify EpiPen Auto-Injector for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and pay the rebate applicable to innovator products, effective Apr 1.Mylan’s stock has fallen 16.7% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 14.9%.Mylan’s second-quarter results were dismal as the company missed on both earnings and sales estimates due to challenges in North America. The cut in annual guidance was also disappointing. Ongoing challenges in the U.S. and uncertain regulatory environment in the region has led the company to defer all major launches in the U.S. from the 2017 guidance to 2018 including generic version of GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK  -  Free Report) asthma drug Advair Diskusand generic Copaxone.Meanwhile, Mylan's Biologics License Application for proposed biosimilar version of Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Herceptin is currently under review by FDA.

3568,GILD,"Key biotech stocks, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) reported second quarter results yesterday -- both companies surpassed earnings and sales estimates. There were several other key updates as well from companies like Incyte (INCY  -  Free Report) and The Medicines Co. (MDCO  -  Free Report).  Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAmgen, Biogen Q2 Earnings: Biogen’s results were strong with the company’s most recent offering, Spinraza (spinal muscular atrophy - SMA), doing better than expected. Meanwhile, the company’s multiple sclerosis (MS) franchise continued to grow. MS is Biogen’s key area of expertise. Biogen expects the early 2020s to be an inflection point for the company with its key pipeline candidates expected to launch during that period (Read more: Biogen Tops Q2 Earnings & Sales, Spinraza Sales Up).  Amgen also topped estimates and updated its guidance. Recently launched products including Prolia (the second and fourth quarters are typically the strongest for this product), Repatha and Kyprolis recorded strong volume-driven growth. Amgen is working on improving Repatha patient access across the world. Meanwhile, mature products like Enbrel, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen declined with Neupogen being impacted by short-acting biosimilar competition that will continue affecting sales.While Amgen stock has gained 23.7% year to date (YTD), outperforming the 11.5% rally of the industry it belongs to, Biogen has lagged with shares declining 0.2% YTD.Incyte/Lilly RA Drug Faces At Least 18-Month Delay in Resubmission: Incyte and partner Lilly announced that there will be a delay of at least 18 months in the resubmission of the regulatory application for their investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, baricitinib. This means the resubmission will not take place this year. Incyte and Lilly will discuss the path forward with the FDA and evaluate options for resubmission including the possibility of conducting an additional study as required by the FDA.The FDA had issued a complete response letter (CRL) for baricitinib earlier this year in April. At that time, the agency had told the companies that it is unable to approve baricitinib, a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of moderate-to-severe RA, in its current form. The FDA had asked for additional clinical data to determine the most appropriate doses as well as to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms.We note that baricitinib was approved in the EU under the trade name Olumiant in Feb 2017. The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recently agreed that the label should be updated to include a precaution for patients who have risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Incyte’s shares were down 3.4% on the baricitinib update.Nektar Up on Lilly Deal: Nektar (NKTR  -  Free Report) entered into a deal with big pharma company Lilly which will see Nektar receiving $150 million upfront as well as up to $250 million in the form of milestone payments. The deal covers the co-development of an early stage asset, NKTR-358, in Nektar’s pipeline. NKTR-358, which has the potential to treat a number of autoimmune and other chronic inflammatory conditions, works by targeting the IL-2 receptor complex in the body. By activating regulatory T cells, NKTR-358 has the potential to bring the immune system back into balance.Other deal terms include sharing of phase II development costs (Lilly: 75%; Nektar: 25%), an option for Nektar to participate in late-stage development on an indication-by-indication basis and double-digit royalties for Nektar. The deal is a major win for Nektar considering the early-stage nature of the candidate and the hefty upfront fee. Lilly will make a strong partner for the company. Nektar’s shares were up following the deal announcement.  Ironwood Down on Heartburn Drug Data: Ironwood’s (IRWD  -  Free Report) shares were down even though the company reported positive data on IW-3718 from a mid-stage study conducted in patients with uncontrolled gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The study met its primary endpoint but failed to impress investors with the efficacy results falling short of expectations. Ironwood intends to conduct end of phase II meetings with the FDA and move the candidate into phase III studies in the second half of 2018. According to the company, IW-3718 represents immense commercial potential with annual peak sales opportunity of more than $2 billion (Read more: Ironwood Reports Positive Data on Reflux Candidate).CHMP Positive on Regeneron/Sanofi Eczema Drug: Regeneron and Sanofi are a step closer to gaining EU approval for their eczema treatment, Dupixent, with the CHMP adopting a positive opinion for the drug. The companies are seeking approval for use in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) who are candidates for systemic therapy. A final decision regarding approval should be out in the coming months. Dupixent gained FDA approval earlier this year in March. Dupixent has blockbuster potential and is being investigated for other indications as well.Detailed Data on Gilead HIV Regimen: Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) announced detailed 48-week results from a couple of late-stage studies on a fixed-dose combination of bictegravir (a novel investigational INSTI) and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF, a dual-NRTI backbone) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-naïve adults. The bictegravir-containing regimen was found to be non-inferior to dolutegravir-containing regimens. Gilead holds a strong position in the HIV market and is working on strengthening its franchise. There is significant demand for a simple, convenient dosing regimen that can sustain virologic suppression with a safety profile that is appropriate for most HIV patients.MDCO’s TANGO-2 Stopped Early on Superior Benefit-Risk: The Medicines Co. got some good news with an independent data safety and monitoring board stopping a late-stage study on its investigational antibiotic, Vabomere (previously referred to as Carbavance) based on an interim analysis. Interim results from the TANGO-2 study showed that Vabomere improved clinical cure rates across all infection types and reduced rate of renal adverse events compared to best available therapy.Vabomere is currently under priority FDA review with a response expected in the third quarter. A marketing application was filed in the EU as well.

3570,GILD,"Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ICPT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 31.In the last reported quarter, the company beat expectations by 15.4%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Intercept’s share price movement in the year so far reveals that the stock outperformed the industry. The company’s shares have rallied 18.3% during this period compared with the industry’s 12.8% gain.Surprise HistoryIntercept’s track record has been decent so far, with the company surpassing expectations in three of the last four quarters. The company has posted an average positive earnings surprise of 0.06% over this period.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Intercept is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is at +9.39%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of $3.28 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of $3.62. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Intercept currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayIntercept received a major boost with the FDA’s approval (in May 2016) of its lead drug, Ocaliva, in combination with ursodeoxycholic (UDCA), for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to bear with UDCA. In Dec 2016, the European Commission also granted conditional approval to Ocaliva for the same indication.Ocaliva generated sales of $20.6 million in the last quarter.The initial uptake of Ocaliva has been encouraging and sales of the drug is expected topick up further in 2017.Meanwhile, Ocaliva is being evaluated for other indications including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).Intercept expects operating expenses in the range of $380–$420 million in 2017 to support the continued commercialization of Ocaliva in PBC in the United States and other markets, sustained clinical development for OCA in PBC and NASH and the continued advancement of INT-767 and other pipeline programs.The company initiated a phase III study (REGENERATE) on Ocaliva for the treatment of non-cirrhotic NASH in patients with advanced liver fibrosis. The FDA approved a redesign of the REGENERATE trial for the safety and efficacy in treating NASH patients with liver fibrosis. The company now needs to achieve only one co-primary endpoint – either fibrosis improvement or NASH resolution as compared to the earlier target of achieving both. The sample size of the trial has also been reduced to approximately 750 patients or about 250 patients per arm. The company plans to complete enrolment for the interim analysis cohort in the REGENERATE trial soon (data readout in 2019).Intercept also initiated a phase II study, CONTROL (Combination OCA aNdsTatins for monitoRing Of Lipids), on OCA. Enrolment in the study was completed in third-quarter 2016, with top-line data expected shortly. The company also plans to initiate a phase III trial on Ocaliva in NASH patients with cirrhosis in the second half of 2017. The company also expects top-line results from the phase II trial, AESOP, in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We expect investors to remain focused on sales ramp-up of Ocaliva and pipeline updates on the call.Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

3571,GILD,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 financial results on Aug 3.Radius Health’s shares have outperformed the industry in the year so far. The stock has gained 13.7% during this time period against a 6.8% industry’s gain.Radius Health has a disappointing track record so far. The company has missed estimates in three of the four trailing quarters with a negative average surprise of 3.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayRadius Health focuses on the development of therapeutics for the treatment of osteoporosis, oncology and endocrine diseases.The company’s new drug,Tymlos, was approved in the U.S. on Apr 28. The drug is instrumental in treating postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture defined as history of osteoporotic fracture and multiple risk factors for fracture. The drug is also used for patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. The drug is under review in the EU. The drug is priced at an annualized wholesaler acquisition cost of $19,500 or $1,625 per pen.Hence, we expect investors to focus on the impending launch during the upcoming earnings call.Although the osteoporosis market in the U.S. has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women in the U.S. experience osteoporotic fractures each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Forteo and Prolia.Meanwhile, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues and requested additional data analyses related to the safety and efficacy of abaloparatide-SC in the process of their ongoing regulatory review. The company expects the CHMP to issue an opinion regarding the MAA for abaloparatide-SC prior to the end of 2017.The company is planning to file a supplemental New Drug Application for Tymlos based on the ACTIVExtend study. In May 2017, results from the ACTIVExtend trial showed statistically significant fracture risk reduction through the 3.5 years of sequential therapy: Tymlos followed by an antiresorptive.In Jun 2017, the company announced encouraging results from an ongoing phase I study on pipeline candidate elacestrant (RAD1901) in patients suffering from estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. The candidate,an oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), is being evaluated for potential use as an oral non-steroidal treatment for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer at high doses. During the first-quarter earnings call, the company stated that it plans to discuss the next steps for this program with the FDA. We expect the company to throw more light on the same.Radius Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Radius Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Radius Health, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Radius Health is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Radius Health is currently pegged at 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of $1.35. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Radius Health has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

3572,GILD,"Shares of Mallinckrodt plc (MNK  -  Free Report) were down 12.3% after a U.S. District Court invalidated 11 patents covering its second-largest product Inomax per a Reuters report. Moreover, Mallinckrodt’s stock price has declined 28.7% year to date, compared with the industry’s fall of 19.5%.The drug represented 20% of the company’s total revenues in 2016. We note that Mallinckrodt acquired privately held critical care company Ikaria, which added Inomax (a vasodilator used in conjunction with ventilatory support and other appropriate agents) to its portfolio.We remind investors that in February 2015, Mallinckrodt along with its subsidiaries filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Praxair, Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) following receipt of a January 2015 notice from the latter. The notice was regarding Praxair’s submission of an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV patent certification with the FDA for a generic version of Inomax.Subsequently, in July 2016, Mallinckrodt filed a second suit against Praxair following receipt of a Paragraph IV notice concerning three additional patents recently added to the FDA Orange Book regarding its ANDA for a generic version of Inomax.  Thereafter, a third suit was filed in September 2016.Mallinckrodt plans to appeal against the decision and stated that Inomax has patent protection till 2018.Our TakeThe news comes as a major disappointment for Mallinckrodt as Inomax is its second-largest product after Achtar. The loss of patent protection for Inomax will adversely impact revenues.Mallinckrodt is currently streamlining its business. The company aims to focus better on its specialty pharmaceutical business after having sold its Nuclear Imaging business. However, generic segment continues to face weakness as various product categories are witnessing stiff competition, which is hurting both volumes and prices. The company expects double-digit declines in revenues from this segment. In addition, continued expected weakness in this segment will adversely impact gross profit margins also.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMallinckrodt currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the health care sector are Aduro Biotech, Inc. (ADRO  -  Free Report) and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report). Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3573,GILD,"The markets hate the unknown and unpredictable, and the simmering tension in the Korean peninsula is a bit of both. Investors and politicians across the world seem to be apprehensive about the global reaction to North Korea's sixth and also its biggest nuclear weapons test this Sunday.With the potential for conflict over North Korea’s act in the forefront of everyone’s minds, stock markets are on tenterhooks as well. In fact, according to some South Korean officials, North Korea appears to be setting up the test for another intercontinental ballistic missile.Back home, geopolitics and severe hurricanes rocked Wall Street’s calm, as markets remained skittish in the aftermath of North Korea’s nuclear test and a second potent hurricane — Irma — expected in the United States in as many weeks.Amid such a fickle environment that could rapidly escalate, it was no surprise that investors sought asset security as gold prices flared up and the U.S. Treasuries strengthened.However, we feel that in such a scenario, investors should look beyond gold and government securities. We have created a multi-faceted screen for you that will give investors stability and profit growth potential farther than the next quarter.Making Sense of ProfitsIt is common knowledge that Wall Street is obsessed with the bottom line. But are higher profits necessarily better? Are these really a true indicator of the staying power of a company’s earnings?While dollar profits trump all other measures hands down for sheer shock value, these do not relate profits to the size of the company, its sales, resources or shareholder capital. The only profitability measure that reasonably works across industries is the ratio of return generated on the dollars invested in a business.The most popular among these ratios is Return on Equity (“ROE”), favored by both Wall Street analysts and investors alike. However, since the ROE measure receives the most attention from the investor community, executives focus heavily on this metric as well. Companies can exploit financial strategies (like increasing debt leverage and stock buybacks funded through built-up cash) to artificially maintain a healthy ROE for a while and conceal weakening operational profitability.So, let’s shift our focus to a different bottom-line metric which garners far less attention from executives and investors alike — Return on Invested Capital (“ROI”).The Lesser-Known ROI MetricEssentially, ROI shows how optimally management has been directing the capital under its control into profitable investments. It paints a clear picture of how efficiently a company is employing its capital and whether its competitive positioning is allowing it to produce good returns from that capital.Also, we will focus on large caps, which are big, established companies in the stock market, and have a comparatively softer risk profile. By virtue of their dominant market position, global footprint and relatively consistent cash-flow stream, these companies tend to be more reliable investments — which is called for in the current geopolitical environment. Also, ROI is particularly relevant for assessing companies that have a large amount of capital.Our ScreenNonetheless, it might be quite difficult for investors to single out such companies, as we need companies which have generated strong ROIs over a sufficiently long period of time, in order to determine a robust trend.So, we have created a three-faceted screen to shortlist such companies for you. Only those companies which have generated ROIs in excess of 15% on average over the last five years can get past our screen. Their current ROI (over the trailing 12 months) also needs to be at least 15%.In addition, to ensure that we hone in on stable companies, which have an established history of generating profits, our screen allows only those companies which have a market capitalization north of $10 billion.Needless to say, these companies must have a solid Zacks Rank too. A favorable Zacks Rank shows positive analyst interest and brighter prospects for the company.These stocks have proven their mettle consistently during challenging times and look set to outperform peers effortlessly through efficient usage of assets. Just five companies got through our screen, and here they are:The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report)Boeing is one of the world's major aerospace firms, and designs, develops, manufactures, sells, services, and supports commercial jetliners, satellites, military aircraft, human space flight, missile defense, and launch systems, and services globally.The aerospace giant generated an impressive average ROI of 33.2% over the last five years and boasts a current ROI of 64%.Over the past month, analysts have become increasingly bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company has seen a sharp spike in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017, which is now pegged at $9.97, up from $9.42 witnessed a couple of months back. This move denotes decidedly bullish analyst sentiment for the stock.Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report)Texas Instrumentsis a global semi-conductor company, and one of the world's leading designers and suppliers of digital signal processors and analog integrated circuits.In the past five years, this Zacks Rank #2 stock generated an impressive ROI of 18.9% on an average and has a current ROI of 28.4%.Analysts envision a healthy future for the company, as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings trended up sharply over the past 60 days, from $3.92 to $4.13 per share, thanks to 13 upward estimate revisions.Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report)Based in Foster City, CA, Gilead Sciences focuses on the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs for several indications.This Zacks Rank #2 stock generated an average ROI of 37.1% in five years’ time and its current ROI is pegged at 28.5%.Analysts have great expectations from the company this year and have been revising its 2017 earnings estimates upward for the past couple of months. Gilead’s 2017 estimate inched up from $8.16 to $8.76 over the past 60 days.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report)IDEXX Laboratories is a global leader in providing diagnostic, detection, and information products to the animal health industry, as well as quality assurance products and services to the food and water industries.In five years’ time, the company recorded an average ROI of 34.6% and boasts a current ROI of 45.8%.Moreover, analysts have become increasingly bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 stock over the past two months, with five upward estimate revisions for its 2017 earnings. This has led to a sharp spike in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017, which is now pegged at $3.17, up from $3.05 witnessed 60 days ago.Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report)Moody'sprovides credit ratings, and credit, capital markets, and economic related research, data, and analytical tools worldwide.This Zacks Rank #2 stock generated an average ROI of 36.3% over the last five years, with a current ROI of 34.9%.Over the past couple of months, analysts have become increasingly bullish on the company, with two upward estimate revisions for 2017 earnings.

3574,GILD,"As we exited a lukewarm August and stepped into the final month of Q3, the investing cohort must have shifted its focus to the likely market movement in September. This is especially true given the month’s cursed seasonality in the equity market.September is historically the worst month of the year for stocks. According to moneychimp.com, a consensus carried out from 1950 to 2016 has revealed that September ended up offering positive returns in 29 years and negative returns in 38 years, with an average return of negative 0.67%, which is worse than any month.Undesirable financial events like the start of the Great Depression in 1929 or the fall of Lehman Brothers in 2008 all crept up in the month of September. Even this September bears the risk of considerable negative changes to the market in case geopolitical tensions between North Korea and the U.S. heighten, and political uncertainty in the United States related to tax reforms and government shutdown escalates.All these make it more important to pin point ETFs that could safeguard investors from any steep and sudden market swing as well as lead them to some gains.PowerShares QQQ QQQ"">QQQSeptember may be ill reputed in terms of stock returns, but this time the month opened up with a deluge of upbeat data points. First, at the end of August, the Commerce Department released Q2 economic growth data of 3% compared with its earlier estimate of 2.6%. This was the best GDP growth since first-quarter 2015 (read: Top ETF Stories of August).And at the start of September, data showed that U.S. manufacturing expanded in August at the quickest clip since 2011. This calls for growth investing. We are thus bullish on Nasdaq-100 ETF QQQ. Nasdaq Composite has already registered the largest weekly gain of the year on signs of economic strength and a bounce in biotech shares.SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI  -  Free Report)Biotech ETFs, especially those with a focus on cancer therapy, staged a great show in August in particular on Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) buyout announcement of clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Kite Pharma .  Plus, a CAR-T treatment — a type of gene therapy for cancer —has been approved for use in the United States lately. All these developments in the biotech sphere should bode well for the related ETFs (read: Biotech ETFs Soar on Gilead-Kite Deal).VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report)The usage of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple are on a tear. Following its immense price rise, Burger King has also jumped into this area with the launch of its own virtual coin called ""WhopperCoin"" in Russia (read: Bitcoin ETFs: More Issuers Join the Race).Since mining of cryptocurrencies needs the usage of semiconductors, this part of the technology sector should perform well in September. In any case, semiconductor is the value-centric traditional tech area that is likely to have an upper hand in an edgy investing environment. Moreover, the semiconductor space is consolidating rapidly with a number of deals announced lately.iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Global ETF (ACWF  -  Free Report)Since U.S. equities have a record of underperformance in the month, investors can have a look at the global ETF. This way, investors can mitigate certain risks. Notably, the global economy is on an upward trajectory. And the fund looks to track the global developed and emerging market large- and mid-cap stocks chosen on the basis of value, quality, momentum, and low-size scores (read: Global Dividend Payments Upbeat in Q2: ETFs to Benefit).WisdomTree Europe Small-Cap Dividend ETF (DFE  -  Free Report) The Euro zone economic growth has looked up this year. The region grew 0.6% sequentially in Q2 following 0.5% expansion in the previous period. Despite this positive sentiment, a rising euro might be a deterrent. So, we have chosen a small-cap Europe ETF — DFE — which is less susceptible to a rising euro.Small-caps better reflect the uptick in the domestic economy. And with the benchmark U.S. Treasury yield loitering under 2.2%, it would be intriguing to go for a higher-yielding pick. The fund yields about 2.66% annually.iShares S&P Moderate Allocation Fund (AOM  -  Free Report)Finally, we would like to pick a full-fledged defensive ETF like AOM. The fund takes a fund-of-funds approach and is a combination of bonds and global stocks. Equities make up about 45% of the fund followed by 26% government or Treasury bonds. The U.S. accounts for about 62% of the portfolio while Japan (5.7%) and the U.K. (4%) take the next two spots.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

It earns revenues only through fees received under collaboration and license agreements.Currently, the company is evaluating AGEN1884 in a phase I study and INCAGN01876 in a phase I/II study, for the treatment of solid tumors.

3577,GILD,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced a new analysis from the phase III cardiovascular outcomes study (FOURIER) on its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha.This analysis of a large cohort of patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease showed that there was a strong progressive relationship between lower achieved levels of LDL-C or “bad” cholesterol and a lower risk of cardiovascular events rates. This analysis suggests that the use of intensive LDL-C therapies such as Repatha in high-risk cardiovascular patients can safely reduce the risk of another cardiovascular event like heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death.This year so far, Amgen’s shares are up 17.5%, better than the 7.2% increase registered by the industry.The results were presented at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress held in Spain and also published in The Lancet.We remind investors that data presented from FOURIER in March this year had revealed that treatment with Repatha led to a significant reduction in myocardial infarctions and strokes.Uptake of the drug, which gained FDA approval in Aug 2015, has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions. The FOURIER data holds the key to the commercial success of Repatha as it will broaden the use of the drug. Though data from the study looks good, it is not very clear if payers will be willing to improve access to Repatha based on this data.Encouragingly, at the second quarter conference call, management said that Repatha holds 58% share of the PCSK9 segment in the U.S. and Europe, with share trends improving sequentially in both the markets in the quarter. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the new-to-brand share for Repatha was 70% in the second quarter. Management said that the presentation of the outcomes study data had a positive impact on Repatha share trends.Amgen filed regulatory applications in both the U.S. and EU to include FOURIER data on Repatha’s label in Jun 2017. Last month, Amgen announced that the FDA has granted priority review foritsregulatory application seeking approval to include FOURIER data on its label. A decision from the agency is expected on Dec 2, 2017.Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) also faced similar issues with their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent.Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3579,GILD,"We issued an updated report on Mallinckrodt plc (MNK  -  Free Report) on Aug 14.Mallinckrodt develops, manufactures, markets and distributes branded and generic specialty pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products and therapies as well as nuclear medicine products.The company has been undertaking strategic acquisitions and divestitures to evolve as a high-performing specialty pharmaceutical company.Acthar Gel, which became part of the company’s portfolio following the Questcor acquisition, continues to drive revenues. It is currently approved for 19 indications but marketed for only 9 with a 3% patient penetration rate. Hence, Mallinckrodt is working on boosting Acthar sales in the approved indications including rheumatology and pulmonology as well as underserved patient populations.In a bid to expand into the hospital growth platform, Mallinckrodt acquired privately held critical care company Ikaria, which added Inomax (a vasodilator used in conjunction with ventilatory support and other appropriate agents) to its portfolio. Currently, Inomax is Mallinckrodt’s second-largest product. The company estimates that it is a roughly $400 million business on a global basis.The Cadence acquisition added Ofirmev to the company’s specialty pharmaceuticals portfolio, thus expanding its pain management franchise. With Ofirmev in its portfolio, Mallinckrodt can target the adjacent acute-care hospital market. Penetration rates on available surgical procedures are relatively low and hospitals systems continue to develop recovery standards after surgery protocols, which might benefit products like Ofirmev and enable patients to recover quickly after surgery. Growth of the drug is expected to be driven by expanded patient reach.The company aims to focus better on its specialty pharmaceutical business after having sold its Nuclear Imaging business. The company also sold its Intrathecal Therapy business. On the other hand, the acquisition of hemostasis drugs – Recothrom Thrombin topical (recombinant), PreveLeak and Raplixa (fibrin sealant) – from The Medicines Co. (MDCO  -  Free Report) has strengthened its growing hospital portfolio.However, Therakos sales are down. Although the kit supply issue was resolved in the first quarter, the company underestimated the complexity of the conversion from the XTS to Cellex devices, resulting in lower-than-anticipated net sales.Moreover, these transitional issues are expected to persist in the upcoming quarters.The Specialty segment continues to face weakness as various product categories are witnessing stiff competition, which is hurting both their volumes and prices. The company expects double-digit declines in revenues from this segment. In addition, continued expected weakness in this segment will adversely impact gross profit margins also.Investors interested in the healthcare sector can consider some top-ranked stocks like Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) and Aduro Biotech, Inc.  (ADRO  -  Free Report).Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

3580,GILD,"The U.S. equity market remained skittish over the last few days as the nation faced one of the worst tropical storms in 50 years — Hurricane Harvey. In addition to catastrophic flooding, the Category 4 storm ravaged properties and caused widespread damage to various industries. As sublime tensions within and outside the country continue to raise an element of caution, investors are on the lookout for ‘cash cow’ stocks that will offer high returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is increasing its profits without investing new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screen:Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report): Broadcom is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices and analog III-V based products.

3582,GILD,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced positive primary data from the phase III study, CANTOS, on pipeline candidate canakinumab (ACZ885).The study evaluated quarterly injections of canakinumab in patients with a prior heart attack and inflammatory atherosclerosis as measured by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Results from the study showed that canakinumab reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by 15%.The study met the primary endpoint in cardiovascular risk reduction with the 150mg dose of canakinumab — the 300mg dose showed similar benefits but the 50mg dose was less efficacious. The results were presented at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress and published in The New England Journal of Medicine.The company plans to submit data from the CANTOS study alongside initiating phase III studies in lung cancer.We remind investors that canakinumab was first approved in 2009 for cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes as Ilaris. In 2016, the FDA approved the label expansion of the drug to treat three rare and distinct types of periodic fever syndromes — tumor necrosis factor-receptor associated periodic syndrome, hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome / mevalonate kinase deficiency and familial Mediterranean fever.Meanwhile, a review of blinded, pre-planned oncology safety analyses revealed a 77% reduction in lung cancer and 67% reduction in lung cancer cases in patients treated with 300mg of canakinumab.The successful development and commercialization of canakinumab is expected to boost Novartis’ cardiovascular portfolio significantly. The company currently has Entresto in its portfolio which has been given a Class I recommendation in the United States and EU for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).Novartis stock has rallied 14.1% in the year so far compared with the industry’s 10.8% gain.Going forward, we expect that the approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing ones will bode well for Novartis even though stiff generic competition for key drugs like Gleevec continues to act as a major deterrent.The European Commission recently approved Novartis’ breast cancer drug Kisqali (ribociclib) which is expected to boost its oncology portfolio even though competition is stiff with the likes of Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report).Zacks Rank and Key PicksNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the healthcare sector include Gilead Sciences, Inc.

3583,GILD,"Despite the hurdles in Trump’s plans to repeal and replace Obamacare, healthcare is the second best performing sector this year lagging technology. The optimism comes especially from encouraging industry trends and hopes of a favorable policy environment.The Trump administration plans to focus on easing regulatory hurdles rather than lowering drug prices, and expedite new drug approvals. Additionally, the shift in investors’ sentiment to defensive sectors like healthcare, which generally outperform during periods of low-to-moderate growth and rising geopolitical uncertainty, has led to a rally in healthcare stocks (read: Top Ranked Healthcare ETFs for Long Term Investors).As such, popular funds – Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV  -  Free Report), Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT  -  Free Report), iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF (IYH  -  Free Report) and Fidelity MSCI Health Care Index ETF (FHLC  -  Free Report) – have gained at least 18% so far this year.

3584,GILD,"We expect Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports its second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, after the market closes.Year to date, Vertex’s shares have soared 116.3% while the industry has recorded an increase of 11.2%.Vertex’s track record has been impressive so far. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in three and missed expectations in one of the last four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise for the last four quarters is 406.25%. In the last reported quarter, Vertex posted a positive surprise of 225%.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlaySales of Vertex’s both cystic fibrosis (CF) drugs — Kalydeco & Orkambi — rose in the first quarter. We expect this positive trend to continue in the second as well.In May 2017, Kalydeco gained an FDA approval for use in patients 2 and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Over 900 people in the U.S. have one of these mutations. Following the approval, Vertex upped its Kalydeco 2017 revenue guidance to $740-$770 million. We expect this expanded indication to boost Kalydeco sales in the second quarter.Orkambi’s sales growth will be dependent on reimbursement discussions in Europe in 2017. Last week, Vertex announced that it has struck a re-imbursement agreement in Italy for Orkambi, thereby making the medicine more accessible in the country. Though the reimbursement agreement will not be beneficial in the second quarter, it should contribute to sales in the second half of the year. In the first quarter, the company had also mentioned that if it gains reimbursement in France this year, it would contribute significantly to revenue growth this year.Vertex is also evaluating some next-generation CFTR correctors (VX-152, VX-440, VX-659 and VX-445) as part of a triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor.Data from VX-152 and VX-440 phase II and VX-659 phase I triple combination studies presented earlier this week, have showed that all three combinations led to a pronounced improvement in lung function. Phase II study on VX-659 is expected to be initiated in early Aug. Phase II studies on the fourth next-generation corrector, VX-445 (triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor), are already going on. Data from VX-445 and VX-659 phase II studies are expected in early 2018. Thereafter, upon discussion with regulatory agencies, Vertex will initiate its pivotal studies on one or more of these triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018.If the triple-combo regimes are successful, Vertex can address a significantly larger CF patient population.Investor focus at the call will be on these triple combination CF regimens, crucial for long-term growth of Vertex.However, operating expenses are likely to shoot up as Vertex expands its pipeline.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Vertex is likely to beat estimates this quarterbecause it has the right combination of two key ingredients.

3585,GILD,"Shares of cancer treatment drug maker Kite Pharma  soared on Monday morning after Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) officially announced it would purchase the company for a substantial premium.Gilead is set to pay roughly $11.9 billion in an all-cash deal to acquire Kite and its innovative cancer drug, which aims to make the patient's own immune cells fight-off cancerous tumors.Gilead’s $180 a share purchase marks a 29% premium from Kite’s Friday close. Kite and Gilead’s board of directors both unanimously approved the deal, which will reportedly close in the fourth quarter.Shares of Kite reached a new all-time high on Monday, and the company’s shares have already traded hands more than eight times its average volume. Gilead saw its stock price climb 2.48%.Gilead made it clear in its official announcement that the Kite purchase is designed to diversify its drug offerings. However, the Kite acquisition won’t become neutral in terms of earnings until the third year of the deal, according to Gilead.“The acquisition of Kite establishes Gilead as a leader in cellular therapy and provides a foundation from which to drive continued innovation for people with advanced cancers,” Gilead President and CEO John F. Milligan said in a statement.“The field of cell therapy has advanced very quickly, to the point where the science and technology have opened a clear path toward a potential cure for patients. We are greatly impressed with the Kite team and what they have accomplished, and share their belief that cell therapy will be the cornerstone of treating cancer.”Kite’s biggest, most advanced offering is a CAR T therapy called axicabtagene ciloleucel, or axi-cel. The company expects axi-cel to be approved as a treatment to fight aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The Axi-cel treatment is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the FDA’s target action date is November 29, with European approval set for next year. Gilead grew into a $100 billion biotech company by selling treatments for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C. Kite’s cancer therapy drug could eventually go beyond the treatment of lymphoma to other forms of blood cancers.According to some analysts, Kite’s axi-cel sales could reach $1.7 billion by 2022, which would rank the drug within the top 10 in the industry in terms of sales potential.Gilead stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and scored an “A” for Value in our Style Score system. Shares of Kite skyrocketed from $45.95 a share in early January to $179.69 per share on Monday. Kite is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want to know more about Kite?

3586,GILD,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted priority review for the company’s New Drug Application (NDA) for an investigational, fixed-dose combination of bictegravir (50mg) (BIC), a novel investigational integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (200/25mg) (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.The NDA was filed on Jun 12, 2017. The FDA has set a target action date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) of Feb 12, 2018.A marketing application for BIC/FTC/TAF is also under review in the European Union, and was validated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in July.A potential approval is expected toboost Gilead’s HIV portfoliofurther.Gilead is a dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive portfolio for the same.The newly launched TAF-based products Genvoya, Odefsey and Descovy are performing well with strong adoption in both the U.S. and EU. Genvoya has already become the most-prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch in Nov 2015. The TAF-based regimens now represent 51% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product, surpassing both Truvada and Atripla since fourth-quarter 2016. Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%.Gilead expects use of Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to continue boosting sales of HIV franchise going forward, particularly in the U.S. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting should also boost sales as the company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with an estimated 136,000 patients using Truvada by the end of the second quarter.Meanwhile, Gilead’s stock has gained only 1.1% in the year so far, against the industry’s gain of 6.1%.The uptake in HIV franchise should help the company combat the persistent decline in HCV franchise due to competitive pressure. The HCV business saw some improvement in the second quarter. The HCV franchise was boosted by the FDA approval of Vosevi. HCV patient starts in the first half were better than expectations but should see a gradual decline in the second half due to increased competition.Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa has being facing competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza.

3587,GILD,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that its blockbuster hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection drug, Sovaldi has now been approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) also. The drug was approved for the treatment of adults and adolescents (aged 12-18 years) infected with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen. We note that Sovaldi is the first Gilead HCV drug approved in China.We note that HCV is the fourth-most commonly reported infectious disease in China, with approximately 10 million patients. Hence, the approval in the country holds promise for growth.We note that Sovaldi was approved in the United States in 2013 and in Europe in 2014.  The drug is currently approved in 79 countries.In addition, Gilead is evaluating its HCV single-tablet regimens Harvoni and Epclusa at clinical trials sites across China.Gilead is known for its presence in the HCV market, thanks to its blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni. The HCV portfolio received a huge a boost with the approval of Epclusa in both the United States (June 2016) and the EU (July 2016) and became the first and only all-oral, pan-genotypic, STR consisting of Sovaldi and velpatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection. The FDA approval of Vosevi (Sovaldi, velpatasvir 100 mg/voxilaprevir 100 mg) tablets also boosted the company’s portfolio. The drug is a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the re-treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection in adults with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, previously treated with an NS5A inhibitor-containing regimen, or with genotype 1a or 3 previously treated with a Sovaldi-containing regimen without an NS5A inhibitor.However, the HCV franchise is under pressure due to competition and pricing issues. We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa, face competition from AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others. Competition as well as pricing pressure intensified further with the launch of Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier.Gilead recently announced plans to acquire Kite Pharma, Inc.  to foray in the emerging field of cell therapy. Kite is a pioneer in cell therapy having developed engineered cell therapies that express either a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or an engineered T-cell receptor (TCR), depending on the type of cancer. The acquisition will diversify Gilead’s portfolio and poise the company in a dominant position in cellular therapy space. We note that investors were expecting Gilead to announce an acquisition in the near term given the decline in the once lucrative HCV market due to competitive pressure.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3588,GILD,"Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (KERX  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27.Last quarter, the company missed expectations by 16.7%. In fact, Keryx’s performance over the last four quarters has been disappointing. The company reported a wider-than-expected loss in all the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 39.32%.Keryx’s share price has increased 20.6% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 11.2% rally.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors Influencing This QuarterApart from license fees, Keryx’s top line comprise revenues generated by its only marketed product Auryxia (ferric citrate). Auryxia is approved as tablets to control serum phosphorus levels in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis.Notably, with Auryxia being the only approved product in Keryx’s portfolio, the company is entirely dependent on it for growth. Launched in the U.S. in late Dec 2014, Auryxia is still in its early stages of commercialization. However, Keryx is working on its commercial efforts for Auryxia. In fact, the company is currently working on gaining formulary status for the drug. In Mar 2017, the nation’s largest Medicare Part D plan sponsor added Auryxia to its Medicare Part D plan formularies. With these formulary additions, 95% of the patients taking a phosphate binder across Medicare Part D and commercial plans now have unrestricted access to the drug.Additionally, it is working on contracting the remaining insurance providers to expand patient access to Auryxia. This should enable more contact with the prescribers, both current physicians and those who have not prescribed Auryxia, yet. Meanwhile, Keryx expanded its field-based team to 95 sales representatives, which led to an increase in the number of dialysis patients on Auryxia.Moreover, Keryx is working on expanding ferric citrate's (the compound name for Auryxia in additional indications) label to include the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in patients with stage III–V non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease indication (NDD CKD).In Mar 2017, the FDA accepted the company’s supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Auryxia for review (PDUFA date: Nov 6, 2017). If approved for this indication, Auryxia might be the first FDA-approved oral medicine to treat IDA in this patient population. We believe a potential approval will significantly boost sales of Auryxia, going forward.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Keryx this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Keryx’s has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 17 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Keryx’s has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult for the quarter.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement. Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.

3589,GILD,"Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ICPT  -  Free Report) provided a statement on the recent safety and dosing issues for lead drug Ocaliva.Ocaliva was approved in the United States in May 2016 (and subsequently in the European Union and Canada) for the treatment of patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) with an inadequate response to or intolerant to the standard of care, UDCA.The dose recommended for earlier stage PBC patients with no or mild hepatic impairment was 5 mg once daily, which was increased after three months to 10 mg once daily based on tolerability and treatment response. On the other hand, in late stage patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B or C cirrhosis), recommended dosing starts at 5 mg once weekly, with the possibility to gradually increase to a maximum of 10 mg twice weekly.However, there have been a few safety issues. Deaths have been reported in PBC patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B or C cirrhosis).Last week, shares of Intercept plunged after the FDA warned regarding the safety issues related with incorrect dosing.  The FDA reported 19 deaths due to Ocaliva and stated that the drug may also affect the liver.However, Intercept conducted an analysis and concluded that that these patients were prescribed once daily doses of Ocaliva, which is seven times higher than the recommended weekly dose. The analysis was conducted in consultation with the FDA. The company concluded that deaths occurred due to the overdosing of the drug.Consequently, Intercept issued the Dear Healthcare Provider (DHCP) letter. Thereafter, the FDA issued their own safety communication to reinforce recommended label dosing. Intercept is also working with the FDA on further updates to Ocaliva’s label for safety purposes.Nevertheless, the news gave a major blow to investors as Ocaliva is the company’s only approved drug and such side-effects will limit the sales potential.Intercept is evaluating Ocaliva for other indications primary sclerosing cholangitis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. We note that Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) too have FXR agonists in phase II or earlier stages of clinical or preclinical development that can be used to treat PBC, NASH and the other liver diseases.Investors interested in the broader healthcare sector can consider Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

It is currently under priority review in the United States with a decision from the FDA expected in November 2017.The CAR-T therapy is a newly-found and highly advanced method to treat cancer by modifying the body’s immune system so that it can recognize and destroy cancer cells. The approval of Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah for treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”) in August made it the first approved CAR-T therapy. Considering the fact that the price of the pioneer drug is $475,000 over the course of treatment, an approval for Kite Pharma’s candidate will be a huge revenue generator for the company. There are 70,000 NHL patients diagnosed each year in the United States per the American Cancer Society. GIVE about EUA public offering by the company in the first week of March at $75 a share boosted the share price.In a major move, Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) offered to acquire Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion in August to establish itself as a leader in cellular therapy. Gilead offered $180 per share, a premium of 29% over Kite’s close on Aug 25.Meanwhile, other studies with axicabtagene ciloleucel in mantle cell lymphoma and ALL are also advancing.  The data from these studies are expected in this year and early next year.In the first quarter, Kite Pharma initiated ZUMA-5 study in patients with follicular NHL and ZUMA-9 to provide patients with access to axicabtagene ciloleucel during the regulatory review period.

3592,GILD,"Stock market closed higher on Wednesday following a couple of bullish economic reports, even as the S&P 500 notched up a four-day winning streak. Markets digested the ongoing geopolitical tussle between North Korea and U.S. and also the fallout of Hurricane Harvey. Moreover, President Trump’s speech in Springfield regarding tax reforms boosted investor sentiment. Nasdaq outshone the other benchmarks due to a rally in tech and biotech shares. The Dow also finished in the green following gains from Caterpillar and Microsoft.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,892.43, gaining 0.1%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.5% to close at 2,457.59. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,368.31, increasing 1%. A total of only around 5.12 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 5.84 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1.66-to-1 ratio.  On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by a 1.69-to-1 ratio.Strong Economic Data Overshadows Geopolitical TensionsStellar economic reports on Wednesday overshadowed the lingering political tensions between Pyongyang and Washington and the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. The second estimate of the gross domestic product showed that the U.S. economy expanded by 3% during the second quarter 2017, whereas the consensus estimated it would grow by around 2.7%, notching its fastest rate of growth in more than two years. This was the result of increased consumer spending and business investment for the quarter.Increase in consumer spending was pivotal in driving the GDP to 3% growth rate. Consumer expenditure was up 3.3% in the second quarter on account of increased expenditure on goods and services which also include car purchases. This is the best increase reported in a year. Moreover, business investment rose 0.6% in the second quarter. Also corporate adjusted pretax profits increased 6.7% over the past year.Meanwhile, ADP released its employment report for August which showed that the private sector has added a total of 237,000 jobs to the U.S. during this month, significantly higher than the estimate of 185,000 job additions. This is the highest growth it experienced since March when a total of 255,000 jobs were added.Such stellar economic data boosted investor sentiment, leading to broad based gains for the market. Consequently, analysts expect a rate hike by the Fed possibly in December due to strong economic results.  Economists believe President Trump will bank on the current rate of economic growth to pay for his planned tax cuts and increase infrastructural spending.Early on Tuesday, North Korea tested a missile over Japan, inviting criticism from across the world. This did little to deter the investors’ spirit as it was outdone by great economic reports. Trump tweeted on Wednesday: “The U.S. has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years,” adding that “talking is not the answer!” Measured statements from leaders across the globe also added to gains for the market.Also, Hurricane Harvey has halted more than 16% of the country’s total refining capacity sending gasoline futures higher and oil prices lower. This too failed to have an overall impact on the market due to splendid economic results.Trump’s Tax Speech in SpringfieldIn a speech in Springfield, President Trump announced that he wanted the U.S. corporate tax rate to decline to 15%. Trump believes that this would create additional jobs and increase wages at the same time. Such comments boded well for the investors and markets gained following Trump’s speech. However, the administration has not laid out a detailed plan on tax reforms and has left it to Congress to take a decision on this issue.S&P 500, Nasdaq Post Stellar ShowingThe S&P 500 posted gains for the fourth straight session on Wednesday. Eight of its 11 main sectors finished higher. Such performance was achieved not only due to strong economic conditions but also due to a near 0.8% increase in the tech shares. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) was up 0.7% after shares of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) increased 1.1% and 0.2% respectively. This was the S&P 500’s longest winning streak in last three months. Both the companies possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Nasdaq also gained on Wednesday, notching up 66.42 points and outshining other benchmarks. Such a showing was possible due to a rally in tech and biotech shares. Shares of Gilead SciencesInc. (GILD  -  Free Report) and BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report) notched up 7.3% and 5.6% respectively. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) gained 1.9% on Wednesday.Stocks That Made HeadlinesChico's Falls on Earnings & Sales Miss, Guides LowChico's FAS, Inc. (CHS  -  Free Report) disappointed the investor community again with dismal second-quarter fiscal 2017 financial results.  (Read More)Campbell Misses on Q4 Earnings & Sales, Stock Loses 5%Campbell Soup Company(CPB  -  Free Report) posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both earnings and sales came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with sales marking its third straight miss.

Last quarter, the company beat earnings estimates by 16.7%.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteBristol-Myers’ stock has lost 26.4% in the past year, underperforming the industry, which remained flat in that period.Bristol-Myers has a decent track record so far. The company’s earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 8.39%. Will Bristol-Myers surpass expectations this time as well?Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to Impact This QuarterBristol-Myers’ high-profile immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo, should continue to drive the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Opdivo’s U.S. sales are driven by the melanoma, second-line non-small-cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma indications.Recent label expansions into the classical Hodgkin lymphoma and head and neck cancer indications should boost the drug’s sales.  However, the lung-cancer market in the U.S. became more competitive in 2016 due to the entry of Tecentriq.Bristol-Myers expects the second-line lung cancer business to be under competitive pressure. As a result, sales of the drug in the U.S. market is projected be flat in 2017. Although the first quarter saw some stability in the second-line lung cancer, the recent FDA approval of Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC will further impact sales.On the other hand, the virology business is expected to decline significantly in 2017 due to competition from Epclusa. The HIV business continues to face competitive pressure. Recent launches by other companies in the same space are expected to further impact the Sustiva franchise.Bristol-Myers is also looking to diversify its portfolio with the development of BMS-986036 for NASH.On a positive note, Bristol-Myers raised its earnings expectations for 2017 concurrent with the first-quarter results. The company now projects earnings in the range of $2.85–$3.00 per share (old guidance: $2.70 to $2.90). Revenues are expected to grow in mid- to single-digit range due to strong trends across the business, particularly in key products like Opdivo, Eliquis and Yervoy. Gross margins are projected to decline as the year progresses and are estimated in the 72–73% range.  R&D expenses are expected to increase in the low-double digit range.In the second-quarter earnings call, investors are expected to focus on the company’s performance and label expansion efforts for Opdivo, along with updates on business development activities.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Bristol-Myers is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Bristol-Myers is 0.0% since both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 73 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Bristol-Myers currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its 0.0% ESP makes it unlikely for the stock to beat earnings this quarter. As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +66.7% and carries a Zacks Rank #1.

3594,GILD,"HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25, before the market opens.Last quarter, this hospital company posted in-line results. It has, however, surpassed earnings estimates in three out of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 6.47%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackThe company’s commercial volumes have been stressed over the past few quarters. It has taken  efforts to build out its local networks and create greater patient access both from an outpatient facilities standpoint and a digital media standpoint to address the issue. We, however, don’t expect to see any major improvement in this business in the second quarter.Last quarter, the company reported the 12th consecutive quarter of equivalent admission growth for HCA and we expect the trend to continue in the second quarter.HCA Healthcare consistently makes capital expenditure for the expansion of services and capacity in its large fast growing urban markets. In 2016, it incurred $2.76 billion in this regard and expects to invest $2.9 billion in 2017. The company has also made a number of acquisitions over the past many years to expedite growth. We believe these investments will generate top-line growth by increasing business volumes.Share bought back by the company during the to-be reported will cushion the bottom line. The company has not paid regular dividend since its IPO in 2011. It prefers share buyback over dividend payment for allocating capital and will maintain its current policy on dividend payouts.HCA Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise HCA Holdings, Inc.

3595,GILD,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) will report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25 after the market closes. Amgen delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.0% in the last quarter.Amgen shares are up 22.6% so far this year. This compares favorably with the 10.5% increase registered by the industry during this period.Amgen’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company reporting positive surprises consistently. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 5.31%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayAmgen’s growth products like Prolia, Xgeva, Kyprolis, Vectibix, Nplate, Sensipar are likely to perform well. While new patient adoption and repeat injections might drive Prolia sales, Xgeva is likely to benefit from its superior clinical profile versus competition. Parsabiv (etelcalcetide), for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), was approved in the U.S in Feb 2017 and in EU in Nov 2016. The drug is likely bring in some revenues in the second quarter.However, the company has some challenges in store given the presence of biosimilar competition and slowdown in sales of mature products. Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen sales are expected to be hurt by competition in the EU. Note that Neupogen sales are also being hurt by biosimilar competition in the U.S. mainly from Zarxio, Sandoz’s, Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, biosimilar version of Neupogen, which was launched in the U.S. in Sep 2015. Neupogen is expected to face continued competitive pressure this year from the existing and potential biosimilars.Neulasta and Epogen could start facing biosimilar competition in the U.S. this year, though no biosimilars were launched in the second quarter.Meanwhile, blockbuster drug Enbrel is facing increasing competition in the rheumatology/dermatology segments, which will hurt sales.Volume growth of recently launched products may not be enough to offset the decline in mature brandsThe bottom line will however benefit from the company’s overall cost-cutting efforts and share buyback. The company’s restructuring plan will make it leaner and more cost efficient.Investor focus will remain on the performance of the company’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha. Uptake of Repatha, which gained FDA approval in Aug 2015, has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions.A phase III cardiovascular outcomes study (FOURIER) on Repatha had revealed significant reduction in myocardial infarctions and strokes in the first quarter. The data is key to the commercial success of Repatha as it would broaden the use of the drug. Though data from the study looks good, it is not very clear if payers will be willing to improve access to Repatha based on this data. Amgen filed regulatory applications in both the U.S. and EU to include FOURIER data on Repatha’s label in Jun 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Amgen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -0.32% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at $3.08 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $3.09. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Amgen’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP.

3597,GILD,"Following the investment track of Oracle of Omaha, we can see how, in quest of excellence, this pure play value investor gradually shifted to become a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) investor. According to him, while picking undervalued stocks, investors also need to focus on its earnings growth potential.GARP combines both growth and value investing principles and offers a mixed investing strategy that has a proven track record of success.What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).And here lies the importance of a not-so-popular fundamental metric, the price/earnings growth (PEG) ratio. Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P/E ratio with future earnings growth rate.While P/E alone only gives the idea of stocks, which are trading at a discount, PEG while adding the GROWTH element to it, helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock’s P/E ratio is 10 and expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company’s PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors’ limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rates followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose.)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1  or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 28 stocks that qualified the screening:Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V.

3598,GILD,"It’s not been a good quarter for Israel-based generic drug maker, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report). Teva missed on both second quarter earnings and revenues and lowered its outlook for 2017. The company’s shares are down significantly following the release of disappointing second quarter results. Year-to-date (YTD), Teva has lost 52.6% of its value versus the 17.4% decline of its industry.What Went Wrong?A key reason for Teva’s dismal performance was generic pricing erosion. The sharp decline in generic drug prices, while a blessing for patients, is proving to be a major challenge for generic drugmakers as well as drug distributors.On its second quarter call, Teva said that the ongoing consolidation of customers has led to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume. The consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs. Teva said that the finalization of both prices and volumes of its inline products with one of its largest customers, Claris One, and other new contracts had a greater-than-expected negative impact on second quarter results and the outlook for the rest of the year.Moreover, the FDA is speeding up the approval of generic drugs which means more competition, increasing price cuts and decreasing volume. Teva said that price erosion was around 6% in the second quarter and is expected to increase to high-single digits over the remainder of the year. All these headwinds will persist for the U.S. Generics unit in the near future, resulting in lower revenue and profit in this segment in 2018 and potentially 2019.Meanwhile, the company said that it does not expect any earnings contribution from its businesses in Venezuela given the significant devaluation of the Venezuelan currency.Teva also cut its dividend by 75% and could be at risk of breaching its covenants if cash flow is hit by lower-than-expected proceeds from potential divestments or if there is a delay into early 2018 (Also read: Teva Plunges to 10-Year Low, Credit Rating in Jeopardy).Zacks Rank & Estimate RevisionsTeva is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock. With the company reporting disappointing results and lowering its outlook, Teva has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 10.3% downward over the last 7 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings was revised 14.9% downward over the last 7 days.  Teva has many challenges ahead – paying down debt, divesting non-core businesses to increase focus on core areas and generate cash, hiring a permanent CEO, delivering on the pipeline and getting the U.S. generics business back on track.While Teva deals with these challenges, here is a look at 4 drug companies that sport a strong Zacks Rank and look well-positioned.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report): New Haven, CT-based Alexion reported a “beat and raise” quarter with flagship product, Soliris (eculizumab) continuing to perform well. Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label and has a key catalyst coming up with a decision from the FDA expected by Oct 23, 2017, regarding the approvability of Soliris for refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). Meanwhile, a decision in the EU, where a positive CHMP opinion was received, is also expected in the third quarter.Alexion, which had a rough 2016 with shares falling 35.9%, looks set to recover lost ground with shares increasing 8.1% so far in 2017, outperforming the 5.6% rally of the industry it belongs to. The company’s new management team is focusing on Alexion’s expertise area of complement biology and core therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology, and metabolic disorders. Alexion will be working on growing its rare disease business. A Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, Alexion has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 4.8% upward over the last 30 days. Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 26.1%.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report): Regeneron's key focus areas include eye diseases, heart disease, allergic and inflammatory diseases, pain, cancer, infectious diseases and rare diseases. While eye drug, Eylea, the company’s key growth driver continues to perform well, Regeneron has been working on diversifying its portfolio and gained FDA approval for two drugs this year -- Dupixent (moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis) and Kevzara (moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis). Both drugs have blockbuster potential. The company also has a strong pipeline comprising 17 candidates including for cancer and has key data readouts lined up for the second half of the year. Regeneron has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 31.3% upward over the last 7 days.Regeneron, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 25.3% year to date, substantially outperforming the 5.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.

Sanofi has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 3.1% upward over the last 30 days.

3599,GILD,"The equity markets remained relatively skittish over the last few days as a range of geopolitical issues took center stage. These included constant conflict between the U.S. and North Korea regarding nuclear arsenal and prolonged standoff between China and India over sovereignty. As sublime tensions continue to raise an element of caution, investors are on the lookout for ‘cash cow’ stocks that will offer high returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is increasing its profits without investing new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screen:Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report): Broadcom is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog III-V based products.

3600,GILD,"We issued an updated report on Endo International plc (ENDP  -  Free Report) on Aug 24.Endo, a global specialty pharmaceutical company focused on branded and generic pharmaceuticals, was formed following the acquisition of Paladin Labs.Revenues from the Generics base business is under significant pressure due to intensifying consortium pricing pressures and additional competitive entrants and product discontinuations as well as discrete factors, including destocking and shifts in purchase timing due to market conditions. Revenues from the segment is projected to decline in the high single-to low double-digit percentage range in 2017 due to base business sales decline, partially offset by revenues growth in sterile injectables and new launch in alternative dosages which will be partially offset by growth in its sterile injectables and new launch revenues respectively.Endo’s Branded segment continues to be under pressure due to additional competitive entrants as well as a continuous rise in the number of public policy and regulatory actions including the recent CDC guidelines related to opioid prescribing and use and divestiture of Strenda.In a major setback, Endo withdrew opioid pain medication Opana ER (oxymorphone hydrochloride extended release) from the market following FDA’s request in June. In March 2017, the FDA Drug Safety Risk Management and Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committees voted in the ratio of 18 to 8 and consented that reformulated Opana ER did not outweigh public health risks.A few members stated that the benefits are now overshadowed by the continuing public health concerns around the product's misuse, abuse and diversion. In June, the FDA directed the company to remove the drug from the market. The move comes in wake of the widespread opioid abuse epidemic. The drug represented 4% of total 2016 revenues.International revenues in 2017 is expected to decline in the mid to low 20% range, reflecting the divestiture of Litha and Somar.Meanwhile, Endo stock has declined 46.7% in the year so far compared to the industry’s gain of 2.2% during the same period.The company lowered is revenue guidance range by $70 million and now expects revenues in the range to be $3.38 billion to $3.53 billion. The guidance was lowered due to withdrawal of Opana ER and discontinuation of products associated with recently announced manufacturing restructuring.Zacks Rank & Key PicksEndo currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

3601,GILD,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved breast cancer drug Kisqali (ribociclib).The EC approved the drug in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer as initial endocrine-based therapy.We remind investors that Kisqali is the first CDK4/6 inhibitor approved in Europe.  An approval was in the cards as the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gave a positive opinion in June 2017.In March 2017, the FDA also approved Kisqali in combination with any aromatase inhibitor, as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer.The drug in combination with letrozole was added to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) as a category 1 option for HR+/HER2 postmenopausal metastatic breast cancer patients.Novartis stock has rallied 13.0% in the year so far compared with the industry’s 11.3% gain.Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu and an improved formulation of Exjade.The company is making significant progress on its immuno-oncology pipeline.

This provided a major boost to Novartis. CTL019 could become the first CAR-T cell therapy if approved. A potential approval will also open new frontiers in the treatment of cancer by advancing immunocellular therapy for children and young adults with r/r B-cell ALL.We note that Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) is a leading company in breast cancer drugs with a strong portfolio of drugs like Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla.Zacks Rank & Key PicksNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the healthcare sector include Gilead Sciences, Inc.

3602,GILD,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul  27, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, Alexion’s earnings surpassed Zacks Consensus Estimate. Alexion’s track record is excellent as the company has consistently beaten expectations in the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 7.49% over the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.A look at Alexion’s share price movement year to date shows that the stock has underperformed the Zacks classified Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry.  While the company’s shares have gained 4.1%, the industry witnessed an addition of 10.6% in the same period.Factors Likely to Impact Q2 ResultsAlexion continues to identify and treat a consistently high number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) with Soliris, across its 50-country operating platform. In order to further increase the commercial potential of the drug, Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label into additional indications. Label expansion into additional indications would give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly. Additionally, the company is working on the launches of both Strensiq and Kanuma.Strensiq continues to perform well with revenues benefiting from a growing number of patients (both children as well as adults with pediatric onset disease) owing to HPP disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives. These initiatives are leading to steady identification of new patients with hypophosphatasia (HPP). In fact, the company expects Strensiq to be an additional growth driver in 2017, and beyond.Alexion is also looking to achieve annual cost synergies, which are expected to touch at least $150 million in 2017.Meanwhile, Alexion continues to progress with in-country funding processes for both the products in additional countries in the EU this year.Notably, the company’s efforts to develop its pipeline are impressive, particularly in case of ALXN1210. Currently, it is evaluating ALXN1210 (a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody that inhibits terminal complement) in phase III studies for both PNH and aHUS. Additionally, the company is conducting a phase I study on a new formulation of ALXN1210, when administered subcutaneously in healthy volunteers.Alexion plans to initiate a phase III PNH switch study of ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks compared to patients currently treated with Soliris. in 2017. Therefore, we expect investors to focus on updates from ALXN1210 as the successful development and commercialization of the drug will boost growth prospects.However, with Soliris accounting for majority of revenues at Alexion, the company relies heavily on the drug for growth. Going forward, Soliris’ below-par performance might hurt the stock severly as it is considered to be Alexion’s key growth driver. It is to be noted that the drug is already witnessing challenges in Latin America. Also, Soliris’ quarter-to-quarter revenue growth will be impacted by the enrollment ramp-up of trials on ALXN1210 (by $70 million–$110 million), particularly in the second half of 2017.  Soliris revenues are expected to be down in the second quarter of 2017.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Alexion is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – which have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Zacks ESP: Alexion has an Earnings ESP of +6.48% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.15 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.08. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Alexion carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP of +6.48% makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

3603,GILD,"Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 0.92%.Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Gilead Sciences, Inc. QuoteGilead’s track record is pretty mixed, with the company beating estimates in three of the last four and missing in the other one. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 3.52%.Shares of Gilead have moved up 1.5% in the year so far, underperforming the Zacks classified Medical-Biomedical and Genetics industry’s gain of 10.5%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this biotech major for this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Gilead is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +3.32%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $2.18 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $2.11. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayConcurrent with the first-quarter earnings call, Gilead reiterated its guidance for annual guidance for 2017.  Gilead expects net product sales in the range of $22.5–$24.5 billion. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $15 billion and $15.5 billion.  HCV product sales are projected between $7.5 billion and $9.0 billion.Strong performance by HIV and other antiviral product sales driven by continued uptake of its tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) based products – Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey continue to boost sales. We expect the trend to continue in the second quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch.By the end of first-quarter 2017, the TAF-based regimens made up 42% of Gilead's HIV prescription volume in the treatment market. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is also expected to boost sales.  However, Gilead will lose exclusivity for Viread in 2017 in some countries outside the U.S. which might impact sales.However, the HCV franchise continues to be under competitive and pricing pressure leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales in 2016. Harvoni and Sovaldi has been facing competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others. Higher discounts and payer mix continue to impact sales adversely. Total HCV treatment starts in the U.S. were an estimated 231,000 in 2016, approximately 25,000 less than 2015. The company expects a further decline in patients starts in 2017.On a positive note, the HCV portfolio received a major boost when Epclusa gained approval in 2016 to become the first and only all-oral, pan-genotypic, STR consisting of Sovaldi and velpatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), for the treatment of adults with genotype 1–6 chronic HCV infection. Initial uptake of Epclusa has been encouraging while formulary reviews are on track. The recently approved HBV drug Vemlidy is also expected to start contributing to the top line. The FDA recently approved Vosevi (Sovaldi, velpatasvir 100 mg/voxilaprevir 100 mg) tablets as a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the re-treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, previously treated with an NS5A inhibitor-containing regimen, or with genotype 1a or 3 previously treated with a Sovaldi-containing regimen without an NS5A inhibitor.During the second-quarter call, investors are likely to keep an eye on Gilead’s performance while pipeline updates will also be keenly awaited. Focus would also be on the performance of Epclusa and TAF-based regimens.Other Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +66.7% and a Zacks Rank #1. The company is scheduled to release results on Jul 26. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

3604,GILD,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved Vosevi (Sovaldi, velpatasvir 100 mg/voxilaprevir 100 mg) tablets. The drug is a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the re-treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, previously treated with an NS5A inhibitor-containing regimen, or with genotype 1a or 3 previously treated with a Sovaldi-containing regimen without an NS5A inhibitor.The approval came on the back of positive data from the phase III studies – POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4 studies. The studies evaluated 12 weeks of Vosevi in direct-acting antiviral-experienced chronic HCV-infected patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.However, Vosevi has been warned for its product label regarding the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in HCV/HBV co infected patients.Nevertheless, the approval makes Vosevi the first once-daily STR available as a salvage therapy for patients infected with HCV genotype 1–6 who have failed prior treatment with DAA regimens including NS5A inhibitors. The approval is expected to boost Gilead’s strong HCV portfolio.Gilead has a strong presence in the HCV market due to its blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni. While Sovaldi continues to be a very important product for the company, Harvoni’s label has been expanded twice in the U.S. since approval and is now approved for use in a broader range of patient population. The HCV portfolio got a huge a boost when Epclusa gained approval in both the U.S. (Jun 2016) and the EU (Jul 2016) to become the first and only all-oral, pan-genotypic, STR consisting of Sovaldi and velpatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection. Initial uptake of Epclusa has been encouraging while formulary reviews are on track. Gilead expects to launch Epclusa in other large EU markets once pricing and reimbursement is in place by the second half of 2017, which should boost sales further.Last month, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion on the company’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Vosevi following an accelerated assessment procedure.Gilead’s HCV franchise is under pressure due to intense competition and pricing issues. HCV product sales were weaker than expected mainly due to fewer new patient starts for Harvoni and lower revenues per patient. Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa has being facing competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR, Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Olysio.The company expects that the persistent decline in HCV patient starts will be the primary factor behind the year-over-year decrease in revenues in 2017 along with increased competition which will impact patient share and pricing.Shares of Gilead have underperformed the Zacks classified Medical-Biomedical and Genetics industry in the year so far, with the stock losing 0.1% during this period, against the industry’s gain of 8.8%. Nevertheless, the HIV franchise of Gilead is performing well and is expected to help the company combat the persistent decline in HCV franchise.Zacks Rank Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing UpsiZacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3606,GILD,"Key highlights this week include impressive data from Vertex’s (VRTX  -  Free Report) cystic fibrosis (CF) pipeline while companies like Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) and Puma (PBYI  -  Free Report) got FDA approval for their hepatitis C virus (HCV) and breast cancer treatments, respectively.  Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesVertex CF Data Impresses: Vertex got a major boost with positive data on three different triple combination regimens in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation (F508del/Min). These are the first data to show the potential to treat the underlying cause of CF in these patients, who have a severe and difficult-to-treat type of the disease. The company is looking to start a pivotal program in the first half of 2018. Vertex’s shares were up significantly in pre-market trading.CRL for Amgen/UCB Osteoporosis Drug: Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner UCB got a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA for Evenity (romosozumab), their investigational treatment for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. However, the CRL doesn’t come as a surprise considering the emergence of a new safety signal in a late-stage study (ARCH). Although Evenity met both the primary endpoints and the key secondary endpoint in the study, the companies said that an imbalance in positively adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events was observed.The FDA has asked the companies to include data from the ARCH study in the resubmission as well as data from the BRIDGE study in men with osteoporosis (Read more: Amgen Gets CRL for Osteoporosis Drug Evenity's BLA). Amgen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.FDA Nod for Gilead HCV Drug: Gilead has added another drug to its hepatitis C virus (HCV) portfolio with the FDA granting approval to Vosevi, a single-tablet regimen for the re-treatment of adults with chronic HCV. Vosevi provides physicians with a new therapeutic option for their hardest-to-treat patients. However, Vosevi comes with a boxed warning regarding the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in HCV/HBV co-infected patients -- this could limit uptake.Gilead’s HCV franchise, which was a major revenue generator, is under considerable strain due to new competition and pricing pressure. The company has underperformed the Zacks-categorized Medical-Biomedical/Genetics industry so far in 2017 with shares gaining 0.1% while the industry is up 8.9%.Puma Up on FDA Approval of Nerlynx: Puma gained FDA approval for its breast cancer treatment, Nerlynx (neratinib), which has blockbuster potential. Nerlynx, the first approved drug in Puma’s portfolio, is indicated for the extended adjuvant treatment of early-stage, HER2+ breast cancer, an aggressive type of tumor. This means that Nerlynx can be taken after an initial treatment so that the risk of the cancer coming back can be reduced further. Nerlynx’s approval was in line with expectations considering a favorable advisory panel vote earlier this year. Puma’s shares were up 8.5% on the news. Year-to-date (YTD), Puma’s shares are up a whopping 204.4%.Sarepta-BioMarin Settle Patent Dispute: Sarepta (SRPT  -  Free Report) and BioMarin settled their patent dispute regarding the use of Sarepta’s Exondys 51 and all future exon-skipping products for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The companies signed a licensing agreement providing Sarepta with global exclusive rights to BioMarin’s DMD patent estate for Exondys 51 and all future exon-skipping products. BioMarin has the option to convert the license to a co-exclusive right if it decides to proceed with an exon-skipping therapy for DMD.

3610,GILD,"Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRX  -  Free Report) surged 1.76% after the company announced that it is on target with its debt reduction plans.Valeant’s stock lost 12% against the industry’s gain of 5.5%.The company’s adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents.However, total revenue came in at $2.2 billion, roughly in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.2 billion but declined 7.7% from the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decline was due to lower volume and price in the U.S. Diversified Products segment, as a result of the loss of exclusivity for a number of products and the dermatology business.Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. QuoteQuarter in DetailRevenues in the Bausch + Lomb / International segment were $1.2 billion, down 3% year over year due to impact of divestitures. Excluding the impact of the skincare divestiture and foreign exchange, the Bausch + Lomb/International segment organically grew by approximately 6%.The Branded Rx segment revenues were $636 million, down 3% due to lower volumes in the dermatology business and the impact of divestitures and discontinuations in the Salix business which was partially offset by 13% revenue growth in the Salix business.The U.S. Diversified Products segment revenues were $356, down 27% year over year due to decreases in volume and price attributed to the previously reported loss of exclusivity for a basket of products.Research and development expenses were $94 million in the reported quarter, down 24.2% from the year-ago quarter.Selling, General and Administrative costs were $659 million compared with $671 million in the year-ago quarter.During the quarter, the company completed sale of Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC and used net proceeds to pay down $811 million of senior secured term loan. Valeant will also redeem the remaining $500 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018. The company has also decided to sell iNova Pharmaceuticals and Obagi Medical Products businesses for $930 million and $190 million in cash, respectively (to close in the second half of 2017).On a positive note, the company received FDA filing acceptance for the NDA for Plenvu (NER1006), a novel, low volume polyethylene glycol-based bowel preparation for colonoscopies. Earlier, the FDA approved its new psoriasis treatment, Siliq. The company had an agreement with AstraZeneca plc (AZN  -  Free Report) for Siliq but the agreement has been amended.2017 Guidance TrimmedThe company expects total revenue in the range of $8.70–$8.90 billion, down from $8.90–$9.10 billion projected earlier. The updated guidance reflects the impact of the sale of the CeraVe, AcneFree and AMBI skincare brands and the sale of Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC. However, the guidance does not reflect the impact of the sales of the iNova Pharmaceuticals and Obagi Medical Products businesses, which are both expected to close in the second half of the year.Our TakeAlthough second-quarter results were encouraging, the company trimmed its guidance due to recent divestitures. The company expects to meet its target of $5 billion debt reduction ahead of schedule. The Bausch + Lomb/International segment and Salix businesses together represented 73% of revenue in the quarter.After a tumultuous period, Valeant started a rebuilding process with its new CEO, Joseph C. Papa. Even though it is still early to comment on the rebuilding process, but the company’s efforts to sell non-core assets and pay down huge levels of debt is commendable and should bode well in the upcoming quarters. The company still has $27.6 billion of debt as of Jun 30, 2017.Zacks Rank & Key PicksValeant currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the health care sector are Aduro Biotech, Inc.

3611,GILD,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) reported disappointing second-quarter 2017 results wherein both earnings and sales missed estimates. The company also lowered its guidance. Shares are trading down due to dismal results.Mylan’s stock fell 16.7% year-to-date compared with the industry’s decline of 14.9%.The company reported earnings of $1.10 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18 and was down from $1.16 reported in the year-ago quarter.Second-quarter revenues of $2.96 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.00 billion. Nevertheless, the top line recorded 15.7% year-over-year growth on the back of acquisitions.Mylan N.V. Price and EPS Surprise  Mylan N.V. Price and EPS Surprise | Mylan N.V. QuoteQuarter in DetailThe company report results in three segments on a geographic basis – North America, Europe and Rest of World.North America segment third party net sales came in at $1.28 billion, down 9% due to a decline in sales of existing products as a result of lower volume and pricing which more than offset the acquisitions of Meda AB and the non-sterile, topicals-focused business of Renaissance Acquisition Holdings, LLC. Sales of the EpiPen Auto-Injector declined in the current quarter due to increased competition and the impact of the authorized generic launch. Generics products experienced price erosion in the mid-single digits.Third party net sales from Europe were $954.3 million, up 59% propelled by the acquisition of Meda which was partially offset by lower volume on existing products. Unfavorable foreign currency translation had an impact of 3% within Europe.Rest of World segment third party net sales of $692.6 million was up 29% fueled by the Meda acquisition. Moreover, net sales from existing products increased due to higher sales from the anti-retroviral franchise while sales from new products and higher volumes on existing products more than offset lower pricing. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of 2%.Adjusted gross margin declined to 54% from 56% in the year-ago quarter due to lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America, including the EpiPen Auto-Injector, partially offset by the contributions from the acquired businesses.2017 Outlook LoweredMylan now expects revenues of $11.5–$12.5 billion in 2017, down from the earlier projection of $12.25–$13.75 billion in 2017. The company now projects earnings in the range of $4.30–$4.70, down from the previous projected range of $5.15–$5.55. The guidance was lowered as a result of expected delays in the timing of certain key new product launches.Ongoing challenges in the U.S. and uncertain regulatory environment in the region has led the company to defer all major launches in the U.S. from the 2017 guidance to 2018 including generic Advair and generic Copaxone. Pricing in generics is expected to decline in mid-single digits globally, with high-single-digit erosion expected in North America.Our TakeMylan’s second-quarter results were dismal as the company missed on both earnings and sales estimates due to challenges in North America. Pricing continues to impact results and the company projects mid-single digit price erosion globally. The decrease in guidance was also disappointing. The company recently suffered a few setbacks.Mylan received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding its abbreviated new drug application ANDA for the generic version of GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) asthma drug Advair Diskus.On a positive note, the FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee recently unanimously recommended approval of Mylan's biosimilar version of Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) breast cancer drug Herceptin.Zacks Rank & Key PickMylan currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the health care sector is Gilead Sciences, Inc.

3612,GILD,"Prothena Corporation plc (PRTA  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 46 cents per share in the second quarter of 2017, narrower than the year-ago loss of $1.18 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of 89 cents.Prothena Corporation PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Prothena Corporation PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Prothena Corporation PLC QuoteMoreover, quarterly revenues came in at $26.8 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.9 million and were up from $0.3 million in the year-ago quarter.Prothena’s stock has moved up 25.4% in the year so far compared with the industry’s gain of 8.7%.Quarter in DetailThe increase in revenue was primarily due to achievement of a clinical milestone from Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) of $30.0 million (of which $26.6 million was recognized as collaboration revenue and $3.4 million was recognized as an offset to research and development expenses).R&D expenses were $34.0 million, up 5.2% year over year primarily due to higher clinical trial and personnel cost offset in part by lower external expenses for product manufacturing.General and administrative expenses were $10.9 million, up 34.2% year over year due to higher personnel costs.2017 OutlookProthena expects net cash from operating and investing activities in the range of $160–$170 million. The projected range includes the milestone from Roche earned in the second quarter of 2017 upon initiation of the phase II study of PRX002. The company expects to end 2017 with approximately $375 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (midpoint).Pipeline UpdatesProthena continues to progress with its pipeline candidates. The company is evaluating its lead candidate NEOD001 in the phase III VITAL Amyloidosis study in newly diagnosed treatment-naïve patients with AL amyloidosis and cardiac dysfunction. Enrolment was completed in the VITAL study. The original target enrolment of 236 patients was exceeded and 260 patients have been randomized into the study. Prothena is also evaluating the candidate in a phase IIb study, PRONTO, in previously treated patients with AL amyloidosis and persistent cardiac dysfunction. The company completed enrolment in this study and top-line results from the study are expected following the 12-month study period in the second quarter of 2018.Moreover, Prothena is evaluating PRX002, in collaboration with Roche, for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other related synucleinopathies. The company initiated a phase II study, PASADENA, on PRX002 in patients suffering from Parkinson`s disease which triggered a $30 million milestone payment from Roche to Prothena.The company expects to report top-line data from a phase Ib multiple ascending dose, proof-of-biology study on PRX003 in patients with psoriasis in Oct 2017.Alongside, Prothena is also working to advance PRX004 in a phase I study in patients with ATTR amyloidosis. The candidate is expected to enter clinic in mid-2018.Our TakeThe narrower-than-expected loss in the second quarter was encouraging. The company’s efforts on developing its pipeline are encouraging.

3613,GILD,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) enjoys a diversified base and presence in different geographical areas. GlaxoSmithKline reshaped its business following the Mar 2015 completion of the three-part, inter-conditional transaction with Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report). Under the deal, Glaxo sold its oncology assets to Novartis and acquired Novartis’ Vaccines business (excluding influenza vaccines). Following the completion of the deal, Glaxo now intends to focus on its three core businesses – Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare.The Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines business units of this Brentford, United Kingdom based pharma and consumer giant have performed significantly well, a trend which is likely to continue in the second half of the year.Importantly, new products Tivicay and Triumeq (both HIV), Relvar/Breo, Anoro, Incruse, Nucala (all respiratory) and Menveo, Bexsero (meningitis vaccines) are all doing well and should continue to perform well and boost revenues significantly. These new products generated 22% of Glaxo’s Pharmaceuticals and Vaccine sales in 2016 and 29% in the first half of 2017.Going ahead, Glaxo expects new pharmaceutical and vaccine products including contributions from the yet-to-be approved Shingrix to deliver sales of £6 billion per annum by 2018. Glaxo is also working on expanding the label of marketed products like Nucala.Despite the success of new products, Glaxo believes that its overall performance has been weaker than it would have liked due to some slow starts or missed launches, insufficient R&D progress, stiff competition, genericization of some key drugs and pricing pressure along with slowing growth in emerging markets. In particular, pricing dynamics and competitive pressure are hurting sales of its top-selling drug, Advair. Meanwhile, Advair is expected to face generic competition in the United States next year, which will further hurt sales.Glaxo’s shares have underperformed the industry this year so far. Glaxo’s shares are up 5.5% during this period, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 6.4% for the industry.To improve its performance, at the second quarter conference call held last month, Glaxo laid out plans to overhaul its R&D efforts. New CEO, Emma Walmsley discussed plans to reallocate spending to high priority areas. By 2020, the company plans to terminate, partner or divest about 30 pre-clinical and clinical programs and allocate 80% of capital to priority programs in two current areas - Respiratory and HIV/infectious - and two potential areas - Oncology and Immuno-inflammation.Glaxo’s promising pipeline candidates, at present, in late-stage development or under regulatory review include Shingrix (prevention of shingles – regulatory application filed in both the U.S. and the EU), Closed Triple therapy (COPD - regulatory application filed in both the U.S. and the EU; asthma – phase III), two drug dolutegravir + rilpivirine regimen (HIV infections - under review in U.S. and EU), dolutegravir + lamivudine (HIV infections – phase III) and cabotegravir (HIV prevention [monotherapy] – phase III and HIV infection [in two drug regimen with rilpivirine] – phase III).Glaxo announced renewed cost savings initiatives. It intends to focus on new business priorities, improve supply chain efficiency, simplify operations, improve procurement savings and reduce administrative costs. The company’s extended cost-reduction initiatives are expected to lead to additional £1 billion annual cost savings by 2020. The costs saved will be invested to support new product launches, strengthen the R&D pipeline and to help mitigate pricing pressure on margins.Glaxo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3615,GILD,"The second-quarter 2017 earnings season is nearing its last leg and the picture so far appears to be quite encouraging.  After a few turbulent quarters, earnings for the second quarter of 2017 showed solid strength. As of Aug 4, approximately 420 S&P 500 companies or 86.1% of the index’s total market capitalization have reported results.  A deep look into the results show that earnings for the companies reported are up 11.6% year over year on 5.6% higher revenues. Of these, 74.3% have topped earnings estimates while 68.3% have beat on revenue estimates resulting in a blended beat of 55.0%.Growth in the second quarter came on the back of strong contribution from the Finance, Technology and Energy sectors. The growth is expected to persist in the second half of 2017 as well. Even though the pace of growth has been sluggish, total Q2 earnings for the index are currently up 10% from the same period last year on 5.1% higher revenues, much better than the 7.9% earnings growth projected at the start of the quarter. Going forward, the estimate for Q3 growth is 4.3%, down from 6.3% projected at the start of July.How Did the Medical Sector Perform?The Medical sector has more or less combated the overall decline in the financial markets and maintained momentum. So far 83.6% of the companies in the sector have reported results. Earnings are up 7.1% on 4% higher revenues resulting in a blended beat of 65.2%.  Among these, industry bellwether Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) reported mixed second-quarter results, beating on earnings but missing on sales estimates. Biotech giants Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) and Biogen Inc. surpassed expectations both for earnings and sales in the second quarter of 2017 and raised their annual guidance.Let’s take a look at the pharma/biotech companies that are set to report second-quarter results on Aug 8.ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.

3617,GILD,"Alkermes plc (ALKS  -  Free Report) initiated the rolling submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for pipeline candidate ALKS 5461.The NDA seeks FDA approval for ALKS 5461 for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). The company expects to complete the submission by year-end 2017.In June 2017, Alkermes initiated study 217, a phase IIIb study of ALKS 5461, for the adjunctive treatment of MDD. In October 2013, the FDA granted Fast Track status for ALKS 5461 for the adjunctive treatment of MDD in patients with an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies.

3618,GILD,"Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (INFI  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 34 cents per share in second-quarter 2017, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of 22 cents. The company had reported a loss of 12 cents in the year-ago quarter.Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteSince Infinity does not have any approved product in its portfolio, the company earns revenues in the form of royalties, license and milestone payments as well as research and development (R&D) support fees paid by its partners.Infinity did not record any revenues during second-quarter 2017. However, it recorded collaboration revenues of $9.5 million in the year-ago quarter, related to Infinity's previous collaboration agreement with AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).Infinity’s share price has increased 0.7% year to date compared with the industry’s gain of 1.0%.Quarter in DetailIn the reported quarter, R&D expenses plummeted to $3.9 million from $52.9 million. The decline was mainly related to a decrease in clinical development expenses for duvelisib in addition to the company's 2016 restructuring activities.General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $6.2 million for the reported quarter, down from $15.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was mainly due to the company's 2016 restructuring activities.2017 Outlook ReiteratedInfinity expects net loss to be in the range of $40–$50 million in 2017. The company anticipates ending 2017 with year-end cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities balance in the $40–$50 million band. Moreover, Infinity expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents as of Jun 30, 2017, should be adequate to fund the company's capital needs into the first-quarter 2019.Pipeline UpdateCurrently, Infinity is evaluating IPI-549 as a monotherapy and in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo (nivolumab) in a phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumors.The company completed an evaluation of escalating monotherapy doses of IPI-549 ranging from 10 – 60 mg QD once daily and has determined the 60 mg dose for evaluation in the expansion component of the study. The selection of the mentioned dose was based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic analyses, which showed that IPI-549 maintained full suppression of PI3K-gamma at this dose level.Further, data from the study also showed that the IPI-549 dosed at 60 mg QD was well tolerated, and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Subsequently, the monotherapy expansion component of the study is now available for enrolment. The study will evaluate the safety and activity of IPI-549 dosed at 60 QD in approximately 25 patients.Meanwhile, dose escalation evaluating IPI-549 in combination with Opdivo is currently ongoing. The company plans to initiate the combination expansion component of the study in the second half of 2017.On the other hand, the company amended its license agreement with Takeda Oncology in Jul 2017 for IPI-549. Per the amended agreement, the company will no longer have an obligation to pay Takeda future royalties on worldwide net sales of selective inhibitors of PI3K-gamma, including IPI-549. In lieu, Infinity issued unsecured convertible notes of $6.0 million to Takeda that mature in 2018 and accrues interest at an annual rate of 8%.Our TakeThe wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter was disappointing. Infinity received a huge setback when AbbVie terminated their collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of duvelisib. Hence, we expect investor focus on pipeline progress in the upcoming quarters.Zacks Rank & Key PickInfinity currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Gilead Sciences.

3619,GILD,"The pharma/biotech sector has picked up this year after being battered by the drug pricing controversy in 2016. The first half has been pretty strong for companies in the space.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index has risen almost 9.8% year to date (YTD) after declining almost 10% last year. NASDAQ Biotechnology Index is up 17.7% YTD after sliding 19.1% in 2016.The sector does have its share of challenges in the form of rising competition, high profile pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and the loss of exclusivity for certain key drugs. Though the drug pricing issue still prevails, investors, lately, are hoping that steep pricing will not be as damaging as feared previously.Nonetheless, strong performance of newer drugs, evolving pipelines, impressive clinical trial results, new drug approvals, continued strong performance of legacy products and rising demand are some of the factors that promise a sustained recovery in the sector.Meanwhile, there have been many more FDA drug approvals so far this year than in 2016.  A total of 23 drugs have gained FDA approval YTD, beating the total of 22 for the whole of 2016. With acceleration in the drug approval process, more innovation and a surge in new drug approvals are expected.Though M&A activities and collaborations/deals have slowed down this year, chances are that they will pick up in the second half. With President Trump promising a major tax reform that will allow companies to bring back cash held overseas, acquisition activities are expected to pick up pace. Then again, the number of deals will still be less than the pharma industry, as it has been for many years.Finally, the Republican administration’s vow to ""repeal and replace"" Obamacare bodes well for the sector’s growth.How to Pick Likely Q2 WinnersGiven the enormity of the healthcare space, selecting stocks that have the potential to beat estimates could appear to be quite daunting. But our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple. One way to narrow down the list of choices this earnings season is by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP.  More often than not, a positive earnings surprise delivered by a company leads to stock price appreciation.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Here are five healthcare stocks that are poised to beat estimates in the second quarter according to our methodology.Our first pick is healthcare bellwether, Merck & Co., Inc.

3620,GILD,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) posted a loss of $1.58 per share in the second quarter of 2017, wider than the loss of $1.01 per share in the year-ago quarter and wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of $1.35. The year-over-year increase in net loss was attributable to an increase in general and administrative expenses.Radius’ share price increased 13.3% year to date against the industry’s gain of 1%.The company reported sales of Tymlos (abaloparatide) of $1.0 million from the first four weeks of launch, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.96 million.Quarter in DetailResearch and development expenses for the reported quarter were $19.6 million, down 27% year over year due to a decrease in regulatory and professional fees associated with abaloparatide-SC regulatory applications, decrase in elacestrant (RAD1901) project costs and a decrease in development costs associated with abaloparatide-TD.General and administrative expenses for the reported quarter jumped to $50.1 million from $17.2 million. The increase was attributed to growth in professional support costs, including the costs associated with increasing headcount for the commercialization of Tymlos. Higher compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount were also responsible for increased costs.Radius Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Radius Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Radius Health, Inc. QuotePipeline UpdatesOn Apr 28, the FDA approved Radius Health’s lead candidate Tymlos injection for the treatment of postmenopausal women with high risk osteoporosis for fracture – defined as history of osteoporotic fracture – multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.The company is developing two formulations of abaloparatide- abaloparatide-SC and abaloparatide-transdermal.Meanwhile, Radius Health’ Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for Eladynos (abaloparatide-SC) for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in Europe is under review by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency. The company however suffered a setback when the CHMP issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues. Consequently, Radius is working with the CHMP to address these issues and the company expects a response prior to the end of 2017.In May, Radius Health announced positive top-line results from the completed 24-month ACTIVExtend clinical trial on Tymlos, which met all of its primary and secondary endpoints. The company expects to submit a sNDA to the FDA in connection with the ACTIVExtend results by year end.The company reported positive data from its ongoing phase I dose-escalation and expansion study on elacestrant in advanced metastatic breast cancer. The company discussed these data from the ongoing phase I studies with the FDA to determine the next steps for elacestrant breast cancer program, including the design of a phase II trial.Following this discussion, the FDA agreed that a single-arm monotherapy phase II study of under 200 patients is appropriate. The agency also provided additional feedback on the proposed clinical protocol, including confirmation that the primary endpoint will be objective response rate, along with durability of response. The FDA also stated that if the study results demonstrate superiority to the then-available therapies, the single-arm phase II trial could be considered a pivotal study for accelerated approval as long as the company has also commenced a confirmatory study by the time of its new drug application (NDA) submission.In addition, elacestrant is also being evaluated at low doses as an estrogen receptor ligand for the potential relief of the frequency and severity of moderate to severe hot flashes in postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms. The company expects to report results from its phase IIb clinical study of elacestrant for the potential treatment of postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms in the second half of 2017.Our TakeThe company’s wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter was disappointing as expenses continue to increase with the launch of Tymlos.

3621,GILD,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter of 2017 results wherein both earnings and sales beat expectations on the back of strong performance of eye-care drug Eylea.Regeneron’s stock has gained 29.9% year to date outperforming the industry’s 9.9% rally. Shares are up in pre-market trading and we expect shares to gain further momentum.The company reported earnings (including the impact of share-based compensation expenses and tax adjustments) of $3.88 per share in the second-quarter beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.67.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteExcluding share-based compensation expenses, Regeneron’s earnings came in at $4.17 per share, up from $2.82 reported in the year-ago quarter.Total revenue in the second quarter increased 21.2% year over year to $1.47 billion driven by strong sales of eye treatment drug, Eylea. Revenues were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36 billion.We note Regeneron has co-developed Eylea with the HealthCare unit of Bayer AG (BAYRY  -  Free Report). The company is solely responsible for the U.S. sales of the eye drug and is entitled to profits. However, it shares profits and losses equally with Bayer from ex-U.S. Eylea sales, except in Japan, where the company receives a royalty on net sales.Quarterly HighlightsNet product sales increased to $924.1 million in the reported quarter, up 10.8% year over year. The majority of sales came from Eylea in the U.S. ($919 million, up 10.6%). Sales of Eylea in ex-U.S. markets were $542 million, up from $486 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Revenues also include Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and Bayer collaboration revenues of $432 million, compared with $355 million in the year-ago quarter. Collaboration revenues from Sanofi were $222.1 million in the quarter, compared with $163.4 million a year ago. Praluent recorded global net sales of $46 million in the reported quarter, up from $24 in the year-ago quarter.  We note Praluent has been co-developed in collaboration with Sanofi. Product sales for Praluent are recorded by Sanofi, whileRegeneron shares profits or losses from the commercialization of the drug.Dupixent sales came in at $29 million. The drug was approved earlier in 2017 for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD).R&D expenses decreased 8.9% while selling, general and administrative (SG&A) increased 5.1% during the quarter.2017 Outlook UpdatedBased on a strong first half, the company raised its sales guidance for Eylea.  In 2017, Regeneron expects U.S. Eylea net sales to grow around 10% (earlier guidance: growth in single digits). The company now expects adjusted unreimbursedR&D expenses in the range of $925–$965 million, down from the earlier guidance of $950–$1,025 million.We note that the European Medicine Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) rendered a positive opinion for the marketing authorization of Dupixent, recommending its approval for use in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy in Jul 2017. Meanwhile, a phase III study of Dupixent in pediatric patients (6-11 years of age) with uncontrolled persistent asthma was initiated in second-quarter 2017.In May 2017, the FDA approved Kevzara for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The drug was also approved in Europe in Jun 2017.In Jun 2017, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Kevzara in combination with methotrexate (MTX) for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more DMARDs; Kevzara may be used as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when treatment with MTX is inappropriate.Our TakeRegeneron’s second-quarter results were impressive as both earnings and sales beat estimates driven by strong Eylea sales. The increase in guidance was also encouraging. Dupixent launch in the U.S. for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitisis progressing well and a potential approval in the EU in the second half of 2017 will further boost sales. Moreover, the company is also looking to expand Dupixent’s label in uncontrolled asthma.Zacks Rank& Key PickRegeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Gilead Sciences.

3622,GILD,"Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AERI  -  Free Report) posted second-quarter 2017 loss of 82 cents per share (including stock-based compensation), narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 84 cents and the year-ago loss of 87 cents.Being a development-stage company, Aerie has not generated any revenues from product sales yet.We note that shares of Aerie have rallied 39.9% in the year so far outperforming the industry‘s 2.9% rally.Quarter in DetailIn the reported quarter, research and development expenses declined 20.3% to $10.6 million as the company completed trials in the U.S. General and administrative expenses increased 82.7% to $17.1 million. The higher operating expenses in the quarter were attributed to expansion of the employee base to support operations and commercialization preparatory activities, including commercial manufacturing costs for Rhopressa.Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuotePipeline UpdatesOn Feb 28, the company resubmitted a new drug application (NDA) for lead candidate Rhopressa 0.02% and expects a review period of 12 months. We note that Aerie withdrew the Rhopressa NDA filed in September as a third party manufacturing facility in Tampa, FL was not ready for pre-approval inspection by the FDA. The company initiated preparations to bring a second contract manufacturer online in 2018.Apart from Rhopressa, Aerie is evaluating Roclatan, a once-daily, quadruple-action fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa and Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xalatan. The company reported positive top-line 90-day efficacy and safety data from the second phase III clinical trial, Mercury 2. Data from Mercury 1 is expected in third-quarter 2017. If Mercury 1 and Mercury 2 are successful, the NDA for Roclatan is expected to be filed in early 2018.The company also expects to commence a trial, Mercury 3, in the third-quarter of 2017, in Europe to support filings there. The trial will be a non-inferiority trial comparing Roclatan to prescribed fixed dose combination of Ganfort (a combination of the bimatoprost along with timolol), marketed by Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) in Europe.Meanwhile, the company recently inked acollaboration agreement with DSM with primary focus on the potential of Aerie compounds to treat retinal diseases.Our TakeThe narrower-than-expected loss in the second quarter was encouraging. We are encouraged by the company's efforts in developing its pipeline candidates. A potential approval of Rhopressa in early 2018 will significantly boost growth prospects.Zacks Rank & Other Key PickAerie currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Another top-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Gilead Sciences.

3623,GILD,"Major biotech stocks like Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report), Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report), Alexion, AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) reported second quarter results over the last few days. Companies like Gilead and Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) also provided regulatory updates. Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at Q2 Earnings Results: Gilead’s results were strong with the company’s HIV franchise putting in a strong performance and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise performing better than expected. The company raised its revenue outlook including for the HCV franchise (Read more: Gilead Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenue Estimates, Stock Up). Celgene also topped estimates and raised its earnings guidance for the year (Read more: Celgene Beats Q2 Earnings & Sales Estimates, Ups View) as did Alexion (Read more: Alexion Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenues, Ups 2017 View). Vertex (Read more: Vertex Q2 Earnings Top on Solid Cystic Fibrosis Sales) and AbbVie too topped expectations (Read more: AbbVie Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenues, Outlook Intact).Earlier-Than-Expected FDA Approval for Celgene/Agios Cancer Drug: Celgene and partner, Agios (AGIO  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for Idhifa (enasidenib) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) with IDH2 mutation as detected by an FDA approved test. The approval came ahead of the FDA action date of Aug 30, 2017.This makes Idhifa the first and only FDA-approved therapy for this patient population, which represents 8 – 19% of AML patients, as per information provided by the companies. More than 21,000 new cases of AML are detected every year in the U.S. with the majority of patients seeing their disease relapse eventually. The prognosis for R/R AML is poor with overall survival for this patient population estimated to be less than six months. Although Idhifa comes with a boxed warning regarding differentiation syndrome, uptake should be strong given the significant unmet medical need.Will it be Third Time Lucky for Dynavax’s Heplisav-B? Dynavax’s (DVAX  -  Free Report) shares shot up on a favorable recommendation (12-1) from the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) for Heplisav-B, a vaccine for immunization against hepatitis B infection in adults. With the positive vote, expectations are high that the company will finally gain approval for the vaccine which had previously received two complete response letters (one in Nov 2016 and the other in Feb 2013). A decision from the agency is expected on Aug 10. If approved, Dynavax plans to launch the vaccine early next year. Dynavax’s shares are up a whopping 284.8% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 9.8% rally (Read more: Dynavax Shares Jump 75% after FDA Committee Approval).Vertex Ups CF Outlook on Kalydeco Label Expansion: Vertex’s cystic fibrosis (CF) drug Kalydeco’s label has been expanded in the U.S. and can now be used in the more than 600 CF patients (2 years and older) who have one of five residual function mutations that result in a splicing defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. With this label expansion, Vertex upped its 2017 sales guidance for the drug to $770 million - $800 million (old guidance: $740 - $770 million). Vertex now expects total CF product revenues of $1.87 billion - $2.1 billion (old guidance: $1.84 - $2.07 billion), including Orkambi sales of $1.1 billion - $1.3 billion (unchanged).Regulatory Updates from Amgen and Gilead: Amgen provided quite a few regulatory updates over the last few days. The company said that it has submitted a regulatory application in the U.S. seeking label expansion for Prolia for the treatment of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP). Prolia brought in sales of $930 million in the first half of 2017.Amgen along with partner Allergan also said that they have filed for FDA approval of ABP 980, a biosimilar candidate to Roche’s Herceptin (trastuzumab). Herceptin is approved for the treatment of HER2+ adjuvant breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer in the U.S.Meanwhile, Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, got priority review in the U.S. for the inclusion of FOURIER cardiovascular outcomes study data on the reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events. A decision from the agency is expected on Dec 2, 2017. Amgen said that a second application for the expansion of the lipid-lowering indication to include additional patient populations studied was also accepted by the agency.Gilead also had some updates on the regulatory front. The company said that its HCV drug, Epclusa’s label was updated in the U.S. to include use in patients co-infected with HIV. Epclusa, which initially gained approval in Jun 2016, is an all-oral, pan-genotypic, once-daily single tablet regimen. The label expansion provides co-infected patients with a convenient one-pill-a-day regimen that works across all HCV genotypes and is compatible with widely-used antiretroviral regimens. Epclusa sales crossed $2 billion in the first half of 2017.Moreover, Gilead’s latest HCV offering Vosevi gained approval in the EU for the treatment of all genotypes. The marketing authorization for Harvoni in the EU was also extended allowing use in the adolescent population. Vosevi was approved in the U.S. a few weeks back in July.Gilead is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declined 2.5% over the last five trading sessions.

3624,GILD,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced that its pan-genotypic regimen of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P), Mavyret, has been approved of in Canada for treating chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection across all major genotypes (GT1-6).It is important to note that the ribavirin-free Mavyret recently gained an approval in  the United States and the EU. The combination medicine is under priority review in Japan for the same indication.AbbVie’s shares have marginally outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has rallied 11.5% compared with the broader industry’s increase of 9.8%.The approval in Canada was backed by data from nine registration studies in AbbVie’s G/P clinical development program. The clinical trials were conducted on more than 2,300 patients across major HCV genotypes. Data from these studies showed that eight weeks of treatment with G/P achieved 97% cure rates across all major genotypes of chronic HCV.Significantly, glecaprevir (GLE) is a potent protease inhibitor while pibrentasvir (PIB) is a new NS5A inhibitor. Glecaprevir was discovered under a collaboration agreement with Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA  -  Free Report) for HCV protease inhibitors.Per the company’s press release, three million Canadians are chronically infected with HCV. More than 10,000 new cases of hepatitis C were reported in 2012 with approximately 40% of patients estimated to be unaware of the disease. Also, while GT1 is the most common genotype in Canada, GT3 is the most difficult to treat and cure. Hence, the drug’s approval is expected to provide the company access to a market with huge potential.We remind investors that Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) launched Epclusa, the first all-oral, pan-genotypic, single tablet regimen for treating adults with genotype 1-6 HCV infection in the United States and the EU last year. This could lend a strong competition to Mavyret.To those not informed, Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) is also evaluating an all-oral triple combination therapy MK-3682B, a mix of MK-3682, grazoprevir and ruzasvir1, for treatment of chronic HCV genotype (GT) infection.Pricing pressure in the HCV market is increasing. The company said that it experienced market share loss and price erosion due to competitive dynamics within the HCV arena. This downturn continues this year with Viekira (HCV treatment) sales expected to decline to $1 billion in 2017.AbbVie Inc. PriceAbbVie Inc. Price | AbbVie Inc.

3625,GILD,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that Health Canada has granted a Notice of Compliance for its single-tablet regimen, Vosevi (sofosbuvir 400 mg/velpatasvir 100 mg/voxilaprevir 100 mg), for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.Vosevi has been approved for the treatment of HCV infection in adults with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 previously treated with an NS5A inhibitor-containing regimen, or with genotype 1, 2, 3 or 4 previously treated with sofosbuvir-containing regimen without an NS5A inhibitor. The drug is already approved in the U.S.Gilead is known for its presence in the HCV market because of its blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni. The HCV portfolio received a huge a boost when Epclusa gained approval in both the U.S. (Jun 2016) and EU (Jul 2016) to become the first and only all-oral, pan-genotypic, STR consisting of Sovaldi and velpatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection. The approval of Voseviwill further boost Gilead’s strong HCV portfolio.However, the HCV franchise is under pressure as a result of competition and pricing issues. We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa, face competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR and Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza among others. Competition as well as pricing pressure intensified further with the launch of Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier. Gilead’s stock has moved up 1.0% in the year so far compared with the industry’s gain of 7.3%.Meanwhile, the HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens in the U.S. and EU, which now represent 51% of total prescription volume. Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is expected to further boost sales. However, Gilead will lose exclusivity for Viread in 2017 in some countries outside the U.S. which will impact sales.Zacks Rank Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3626,GILD,"Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ICPT  -  Free Report) reported a loss of $3.46 per share in the second quarter of 2017, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $3.62 but wider than the year-ago loss of $3.14.Quarterly revenues were $30.9 million, up significantly from $5.5 million in the year-ago quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.0 million. Intercept’s share price movement in the year so far indicates that the stock has underperformed the industry. The company’s shares have gained 7.9% during this period, lower than the industry’s gain of 9.9%.Quarter in DetailOcaliva recorded $30.4 million of sales in the second quarter of 2017, up from$20.6 million sales in the first quarter of 2017. Note that in May 2016, Ocaliva was approved in the U.S., in combination with ursodeoxycholic (UDCA) for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults who are unable to endure UDCA. The drug was also granted conditional approval by the European Commission in Dec 2016.Sales from the U.S. markets came in at $27.9 million, up from $19.8 million recorded in the first quarter as prescriptions continue to grow steadily. Revenues from international markets were $2.5 million driven mainly by sales in Germany and France.Research and development expenses increased 26.6% year over year to $44.2 million primarily driven by increases in clinical development programs for OCA and infrastructure to support such programs.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $66.9 million, up from $48.7 million in the year-ago quarter driven by expenses related to Ocaliva’s commercialization activities and additional personnel-related costs to support commercial and international initiatives.2017 Outlook ReiteratedIntercept expects operating expenses to be in the range of $380–$420 million in 2017.The company believes that continued commercialization of Ocaliva in PBC in the United States and other markets, sustained clinical development for OCA in PBC and NASH and the continued advancement of INT-767 and other pipeline programs are likely to drive growth.Demand in the third quarter will however reflect the typical summer trends but is expected to pick up again in the fourth quarter.Pipeline UpdateOcaliva is being evaluated for other indications including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).Concurrent with the second-quarter earnings, Intercept announced trial results from two phase II trials–CONTROL (Combination OCA aNdsTatins for monitoRing Of Lipids) and AESOP for PSC. CONTROL study is being conducted to evaluate the effect of Ocaliva in combination with statin therapy on lipid metabolism in patients with NASH.  Results from AESOP revealed that OCA met the primary endpoint of statistically significant reduction in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) while results from CONTROL showed that the company achieved its objective in demonstrating that the lowest available dose of atorvastatin rapidly reverses OCA associated LDL changes to below baseline levels in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis.The FDA has earlier approved a redesign of the phase III trial, REGENERATE on Ocaliva for the safety and efficacy in treating NASH patients with liver fibrosis. The company now needs to achieve only one co primary endpoint- either fibrosis improvement or NASH resolution as compared withthe earlier target of achieving both.The sample size of the trial has also been reduced to approximately 750 patients or about 250 patients per arm. The company completed enrolment for the interim analysis cohort in the REGENERATE trial (data readout in the first half of 2019).The company also plans to initiate a phase III trial on Ocaliva in NASH patients with cirrhosis in the second half of 2017. The company will also initiate a phase II trial on another candidate, INT-767, in NASH patients with fibrosis in the second half of 2017.The company also continues to enrol in its phase IV trial, COBALT, to confirm Ocaliva's clinical benefit on outcomes in PBC.Exelixis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Exelixis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Exelixis, Inc. QuoteOur TakeIntercept’s second-quarter results were encouraging as the company reporteda narrower-than-expected loss and beat on revenues. Demand for Ocalivais steadily increasing and we expect sales of the drug should pick up further in 2017 as international demand picks up in the second half. However, expenses are expected to rise as the company plans to invest in commercial activities related to Ocaliva.We remind investors that some other companies like Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) and Gilead Sciences, Inc.(GILD  -  Free Report) have FXR agonists in phase II or earlier stages of clinical or preclinical development that canbe used to treat PBC, NASH and the other liver diseases.Zacks Rank & Key PickIntercept currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Exelixis, Inc.

3628,GILD,"United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of $4.41 per share (including stock-based compensation benefit but excluding charges) for the second quarter of 2017, which were better than $4.39 per share in the year-ago quarter.United Therapeutics said it has set aside $210 million for a potential settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to resolve an investigation related to its contribution to non-profit organizations that provide financial assistance to patients, thereby violating federal securities laws. In the quarter, the company recorded a $210 million charge as an estimated loss contingency in relation to this matter. It also recorded an impairment charge related to cost method investments in a privately-held company, which experienced an event triggering an impairment analysis.Including these charges and stock-based compensation benefit, the company incurred a loss of $1.25 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.61 by 134.63%.Revenues for the reported quarter rose 8% year over year to $445.0 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $402 million. Stronger sales across the pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) franchise pulled up the top line in the quarter.Despite the better-than-expected sales performance, shares declined almost 5% on Thursday in response to the potential settlement expense. A look at United Therapeutics’ share price movement shows that the stock has underperformed the industry this year so far. United Therapeutics stock has declined 12.8% during this period, while the industry rose 7.1%.The Quarter in DetailUnited Therapeutics markets four products for the treatment of PAH – Remodulin, Tyvaso, Adcirca and Orenitram.Orenitram reported sales of $46.0 million in the quarter, up 21% year over year. Adcirca sales were $120.6 million, up 33% year over year. Tyvaso sales totaled 104.2 million, down 3% year over year. Remodulin sales were $157.7 million, down 1% year over year. However, sales of both Tyvaso and Remodulin improved sequentially in the quarter. Unituxin (for the treatment of pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma) sales of $16.1 million were down 10% year over year.Lately, the growth of United Therapeutics’ PAH drugs Orenitram, Tyvaso and Remodulin have slowed down due to competition. Last quarter, the company had said that patients were staying longer on front-line oral AMBITION therapy (Adcirca + Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Letairis) and delaying the transition to inhaled/injectable therapies like Tyvaso/Remodulin, thereby hurting their demand.Meanwhile, the drugs are also facing strong competition from Actelion’s, now a part of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), new drug Uptravi (selexipag).Initial treatment in PAH is typically with orally delivered drugs followed by prostacyclins therapies. At the first quarter earnings call, management had said that the longer use of oral therapies resulted in a large backlog of patients eligible for prostacyclin therapy like its PAH medicines – suggesting that sales trends could improve. With sales of Tyvaso, Remodulin and Orenitram improving in the second quarter from first quarter levels, management believes that it is seeing early signs of this transition from ambition regimen back to its PAH drugs.Research and development (R&D) expenses (including stock-based compensation benefit) increased 70% to $59.8 million due to higher costs to support its pipeline of cardiopulmonary and cancer drugs and to develop organ manufacturing projects.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses (including stock-based compensation benefit) declined 7% to $67.4 million as lower consulting and marketing costs offset higher legal costs.Pipeline UpdateUnited Therapeutics is working with medical device maker Medtronic, Inc. (MDT  -  Free Report) to get an implantable pump for delivering Remodulin (RemoSynch) approved by the FDA. In order to launch RemoSynch in the U.S., United Therapeutics and Medtronic are pursuing parallel regulatory filings related to the device and the drugWe remind investors that in April, United Therapeutics announced that regulatory issues will delay the planned U.S. launch of RemoSynch. The company now expects to launch RemoSynch sometime in 2018 against the first half of this year, as expected previously.  United Therapeutics is also working with DEKA for the development of a pre-filled, semi-disposable pump system for the subcutaneous delivery of Remodulin (RemUnity- launch expected in 2019). Clinical studies on RemoPro, a pain-free new chemical entity version of treprostinil, are expected to begin this year.Other phase III pipeline programs include an oral combination therapy of Orenitram - OreniPlus (FREEDOM-EV study), Tysuberprost (esuberaprost in combination with Tyvaso), Tyvaso-ILD (Tyvaso being evaluated in patients with PAH associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) and OreniLeft (PAH with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction).United Therapeutics is also developing dinutuximab, the active ingredient in Unituxin, for small cell lung cancer (phase III) and other high-risk forms of cancer with GD2 expressing cell tumors such as ovarian cancer and several sarcomas.United Therapeutics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3629,GILD,"Every year on Jul 28, World Hepatitis Day (WHD) is observed to raise awareness about viral hepatitis, one of the leading causes of death across the world.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), viral hepatitis caused 1.34 million deaths across the world in 2015 and many people remain unaware of being infected by the same. While there are five types of hepatitis (A, B, C, D and E), hepatitis B and C are the two main killers with 257 million people living with hepatitis B and 71 million people living with hepatitis C.About 90% of people living with hepatitis B and 80% living with hepatitis C are unaware of their status. Hepatitis B and C together account for 80% of liver cancer cases across the world.Considering these numbers, it is not a surprise that quite a few pharma and biotech companies are working on bringing innovative treatments in this area to the market. However, challenges in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) market exist in the form of intense competition and pricing pressure.  Stocks in FocusHere is a look at some of the key players in the hepatitis B and/or C markets.Biotech major, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) is perhaps the most well-known name in the HCV market. HCV drugs include Harvoni, Sovaldi, Epclusa and the recently approved Vosevi while HBV offerings include Viread and Vemlidy.However, the Foster City, CA-based company has seen a lot of ups and downs in this market. Gilead’s HCV franchise was a major revenue contributor bringing in multi-billion dollar sales but increasing competition and pricing pressure resulted in a significant decline in HCV product sales in 2016. Even though Gilead recently raised its 2017 guidance for its HCV franchise, sales are nevertheless expected to witness a significant decline.  Gilead launched an educational campaign in 2016 to encourage baby boomers to get tested. According to the company, there has been an 80% increase in HCV antibody screening by baby boomers since the campaign started resulting in an increase in diagnosis as well. The company estimates that about 190,000 people were newly diagnosed with HCV in 2016, up 32% from 2015.Gilead is conducting additional studies on Harvoni as well as Vemlidy and has an early-stage HBV candidate in its pipeline (GS-9688, a TLR-8 agonist). Gilead is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Year-to-date (YTD), the company’s stock is up 4.7%, lagging the 10% rally of the industry it belongs to. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Large-cap pharma company, Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), is another big name in the HCV market. According to information provided by Merck, about 3.5 million people in the U.S. have chronic HCV infection. Merck’s HCV portfolio comprises Zepatier, which was launched last year, PegIntron and Victrelis. However, the company’s HCV franchise is not a major revenue generator. Earlier this year, Merck took a major impairment charge related to an HCV candidate that became a part of its pipeline following the 2014 acquisition of Idenix. The decision was taken based on changes to the product profile, as well as changes to the company’s expectations for pricing and the market opportunity. Merck is a Zacks Rank #2 stock. YTD, the company’s stock is up 8.2%, lagging the 10.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) also has a major presence in the HCV market. The company’s HCV products include Viekira Pak and Technivie. AbbVie is currently seeking approval for Maviret, an investigational, pan-genotypic regimen of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P). The once-daily ribavirin-free treatment has the potential to provide a faster path to virologic cure for all major HCV genotypes (GT1-6). Maviret represents blockbuster potential and could help AbbVie gain major market share once approved and launched.AbbVie is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. AbbVie stock has gained 14.6% YTD, performing better than the industry it belongs to.Watertown, MA-based Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ENTA  -  Free Report) has a collaboration with AbbVie for its protease inhibitors – paritaprevir and glecaprevir. While paritaprevir is a key compound in AbbVie’s direct-acting-antiviral (DAA) regimen Viekira Pak and its other 3-DAA and 2-DAA treatment regimens currently on the market for HCV, glecaprevir in combination with pibrentasvir (G/P, Maviret) is currently under regulatory review. Enanta earns royalties from AbbVie on product sales. Meanwhile, Enanta is also working on developing its HBV pipeline -- the focus is currently on core inhibitors with clinical candidate identification planned for 2017.Enanta is a Zacks Rank #3 stock. YTD, Enanta stock has gained 13.6%, outperforming the 5.5% rally of the industry it belongs to.Bottom LineThe HCV market will continue to face challenges as more treatments enter the market resulting in increased competition and additional pricing pressure. In fact, HCV drugs have faced immense scrutiny due to their high prices. That said, the market nevertheless represents significant commercial opportunity. As per information provided by Enanta, the market for HCV therapies was worth about $16 billion in 2016. HCV patient starts usually witness a surge following the introduction of new drugs in the market. With a major part of HCV-infected people remaining undiagnosed, there remains significant opportunity in this market as awareness increases and newly diagnosed patients seek treatment.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

3630,GILD,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that its leukemia candidate, Besponsa (inotuzumab ozogamicin) has been approved by the FDA, though with a boxed warning on the label.Pfizer’s shares were down more than 1% on Thursday. So far this year, Pfizer’s shares are up 4.5%, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 13.8% for the industry. Besponsa has been approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The drug was approved in the EU last month.The U.S. approval was based on data from a pivotal study, INO-VATE ALL, which demonstrated that patients treated with Besponsa showed significant improvement in complete response (81% in Besponsa arm versus 29% for chemotherapy), thereby meeting the primary endpoint. The study, however, failed to reach statistical significance in the analysis of overall survival (OS).The median OS in the Besponsa arm was 7.7 months versus 6.2 months for patients treated with chemotherapy.Importantly, the U.S. label of the drug will include a boxed warning for hepatotoxicity i.e. liver damage, including hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD). The label will also have a warning related to increased risk of non-relapse mortality in patients who take the medicine post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).We remind investors that inotuzumab ozogamicin was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation in the U.S. for ALL.Meanwhile, Pfizer boasts a strong oncology pipeline. Its key cancer candidate, Bavencio/avelumab received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in Mar 2017 and for advanced bladder cancer in May. Bavencio is under review in the EU for MCC with a decision expected in the third quarter of 2017. Bavencio is being touted as a significant top-line driver for this New York-based pharma giant. Meanwhile, Pfizer is exploring the possibility of expanding the label of its breast cancer drug, Ibrance, into recurrent and subsequent early breast cancer as well as several non-breast cancer indications like pancreatic and head and neck cancers.Other cancer candidates include talazoparib (advanced breast cancer) and dacomitinib (advanced lung cancer with EGFR activating mutations).At the Q1 conference call, Pfizer had mentioned that approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals are expected over the next five years. These include around 15 products that have blockbuster potential.  Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(REGN  -  Free Report), Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report). While Regeneron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Sanofi and Gilead have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Regeneron’s shares up 26.4% this year so far.

3631,GILD,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) announced disappointing results from a phase III study, NURSERY Pre-term on suptavumab (REGN2222), an antibody to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).The study was initiated in 2015 and completed enrolling patients in the first quarter of 2017. The double-blind, placebo-controlled global study enrolled 1,149 healthy pre-term infants. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three study groups: suptavumab 30 mg/kg as a single dose; suptavumab 30 mg/kg administered as two doses 8 weeks apart; or placebo. Pre-term infants in the study had a gestational age of less than 36 weeks and were 6 months old or younger at the beginning of the study.The study did not meet its primary endpoint of preventing medically-attended RSV infections in infants.The FDA granted Fast Track designation to suptavumab for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV. However, Regeneron plans to discontinue further clinical development of this antibody given the dismal results from the NURSERY study.We remind investors that the company relies heavily on funding from Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) for its immuno-oncology research and development programs. However, Sanofi had earlier decided not to continue the co-development of fasinumab, suptavumab, and trevogrumab.Regeneron’s stock has gained 28.7% year to date outperforming the industry’s 7.1% rally. Meanwhile, Regeneron’s second-quarter results were impressive as both earnings and sales beat estimates on the back of strong Eylea sales which grabbed additional market share. Regeneron’s key growth driver, Eylea, continues to drive revenues and the company is expanding the drug's label for additional indications. The increase in guidance was also encouraging.Regeneron has co-developed Eylea with the HealthCare unit of Bayer AG (BAYRY  -  Free Report). The FDA’s approval of Dupixent was a major boost to the company’s portfolio and the company is working to expand its label.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

3632,GILD,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in MYL.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen six estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $5.24 a share a month ago to its current level of $4.56.Also, for the current quarter, Mylan has seen five downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to $1.20 a share from $1.45 over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 23.5% in the past month.Mylan N.V. Price and Consensus  Mylan N.V. Price and Consensus | Mylan N.V.

3633,GILD,"With earnings season drawing to a close, focus is back on pipeline and regulatory updates. While Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report), which has several pipeline catalysts lined up for the second half of the year, reported data on one of its late-stage pipeline candidates, Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) got priority review for its investigational HIV treatment.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesRegeneron Shelves RSV Antibody on Study Failure: Regeneron’s investigational antibody, suptavumab (REGN2222), for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage study conducted in infants. Regeneron has decided that it will not continue with the development of this candidate. Regeneron has several pipeline catalysts lined up for the second half of the year. Later this quarter, the company expects to report top-line phase III data on Dupixent for asthma – positive data would allow the company to go ahead with a U.S. filing in the fourth quarter. Another important data readout scheduled for the second half of the year is on the company’s PD-1 antibody REGN2810, for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), the second most common skin cancer after basal cell carcinoma and the second deadliest skin cancer after melanoma. Meanwhile, Eylea is being evaluated in combination with nesvacumab with top-line data from two phase II studies (wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema) expected in the fourth quarter of the year.Regeneron is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Priority Review for Gilead HIV Drug: Gilead gained priority review in the U.S. for its investigational, fixed-dose combination of bictegravir (50mg) (BIC), a novel investigational integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (200/25mg) (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone, for the treatment of HIV. Gilead had used a Priority Review voucher at the time of filing the regulatory application. With the combination gaining priority review, a response from the FDA should be out by Feb 12, 2018. The combination is under review in the EU as well. Gilead’s HIV franchise is a major contributor to sales with approved drugs like Genvoya, Truvada, Atripla, Stribild, Descovy, Odefsey and Complera bringing in sales of $6.2 billion in the first half of 2017. Gilead’s shares are up 2.1% year to date, lagging the industry’s 7.4% rally (Also read: Gilead NDA for HIV Combo Regimen Gets Priority Review).Another Late-Stage Failure for Ophthotech Eye Drug: Ophthotech (OPHT  -  Free Report), which is focused on the development of treatments for eye diseases, announced that Fovista failed to meet the primary endpoint in another late-stage study. The superiority study was evaluating Fovista anti-PDGF therapy in combination with Eylea (aflibercept) or Avastin (bevacizumab) anti-VEGF therapy compared to Eylea or Avastin monotherapy for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The study failed to achieve the primary endpoint. The company had anyway attributed a low likelihood of success to the study given Fovista's earlier failure in two phase III studies as well as the failure of a mid-stage study conducted by a competitor on a PDGF inhibitor and a VEGF inhibitor combination for AMD.Ionis Retains Full Rights to Inotersen and IONIS-FB-LRx: Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS  -  Free Report) said that Glaxo has declined its options for two drugs, inotersen and IONIS-FB-LRx, in keeping with its decision to reprioritize its pipeline and review its Rare Diseases business. The company, however, will continue to collaborate with Ionis for IONIS-HBVRx and IONIS-HBV-LRx, which are being evaluated for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.With Ionis retaining rights to these two investigational drugs, the company laid out its plans and said that it will be filing for approval of inotersen in 2017 followed by launch in 2018. The initial indication for inotersen, which has been designed to treat patients with TTR amyloidosis (ATTR), is expected to be for the treatment of patients with polyneuropathy due to hereditary TTR amyloidosis (hATTR-PN).Ionis said that it is considering setting up a commercial subsidiary to commercialize or co-commercialize inotersen in North America. The company is evaluating other options as well including a partnership deal.Meanwhile, IONIS-FB-LRx is slated to move into a mid-stage study in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) later this year (Also read: Ionis Pharmaceuticals Retains Rights to Inotersen, Stock Up).Galapagos Up on IPF Data: Galapagos NV’s (GLPG  -  Free Report) shares were up 10.8% on positive data from a mid-stage study on the company’s investigational idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) drug. GLPG1690 halted disease progression in IPF patients in the study and is the first autotaxin inhibitor to show effect in an IPF study. Galapagos now intends to move the candidate into a late-stage study and is already in discussions with regulators regarding the study design.Galapagos’s data comes shortly after FibroGen’s investigational IPF drug, pamrevlumab, fared well in a mid-stage study as well as two combination safety sub-studies. Pamrevlumab is an anti-connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) antibody.The IPF market represents huge commercial potential – IPF or abnormal scarring of the lungs is a rare and serious lung disease with survival rates comparable to those of some of the deadliest cancers. Currently approved IPF drugs include Esbriet and Ofev.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declined 1.6% over the last five trading sessions.

The decline was due to lower hepatitis C virus (HCV) sales, partially offset by higher sales across HIV and other therapeutic areas.Antiviral product sales, which include Gilead's HIV and liver disease portfolios, came in at $6.4 billion in the reported quarter, down 9.8%.HCV product sales, which include Harvoni, Sovaldi and the recently launched Epclusa, were $2.9 billion, down from $4.0 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was mainly attributed to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets, partially offset by sales of Epclusa (launched in 2016) across various locations.Sales of Harvoni declined 46.1% year over year to $1.4 billion in the reported quarter. The decline was mainly due to lower sales in the U.S and Europe. Further, Sovaldi sales recorded a steep year-over-year decline of 76.8% to $315 million.Epclusa garnered sales of $1.2 billion in the reported quarter, lower than the prior-quarter figure of $892 million. We note that Epclusa was launched in the U.S. and Europe in June and Jul 2016, respectively.Meanwhile, HIV and HBV product sales came in at $3.6 billion, up 16.1% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by continuous strong uptake of tenofoviral afenamide (TAF)-based products such as Genvoya, which generated sales of $857 million, up from $302 million in the year-ago quarter, Descovy, which recorded sales of $286 million, up from $61 million, and Odefsey, which registered sales of $258 million, up from $58 million. HIV treatments like Stribild and Complera/Eviplera sales declined. Viread sales were up at $300 million, up 4.5%. Atripla sales tanked 29.4% to $475 million, while Truvada sales fell 13.8% to $812 million.Other products like Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig recorded sales of $230 million (up 13.3%), $200 million (up 30.7%), $92 million (up 8.2%) and $35 million (down 14.6%), respectively.Research & development (R&D) expenses declined 41.8% to $864 million due to purchase of Nimbus Apollo, Inc. and a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) priority review voucher. On the other hand, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were roughly flat at $897 million. Adjusted product gross margin was 87.3%, up from 91.5% in the year-ago period.2017 Guidance UpdatedBased on a better-than-expected performance in the first half of 2017 specifically in the U.S, Gilead raised its guidance for 2017. Gilead now expects net product sales in the range of $24.0–$25.5 billion, up from $22.5–$24.5 billion provided earlier. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $15.5 and $16.0 billion (earlier projection: $15 and $15.5 billion). HCV product sales are projected between $8.5 and $9.5 billion (earlier projection: $7.5 and $9.0 billion). Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are now projected in the range of $3.2–$3.4 billion and $3.2–$3.4 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 86–88%. Earnings per share are now projected around 86 – 93 cents (earlier projection: 84 – 91 cents).Dividend and Share RepurchaseConcurrently, Gilead declared a cash dividend of 52 cents per share of common stock for third-quarter 2017. The dividend is payable on Sep 28 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Sep 15. During the second quarter, the company paid cash dividends of $680 million and repurchased 2 million shares for $130 million.Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Gilead Sciences, Inc. QuoteOur TakeThe better-than-expected performance in the second quarter was driven by positive trends in the non-HCV business and better-than-expected results from HCV business (market share of 80%), particularly in the U.S due to rapid uptake of Epclusa. The HCV franchise was boosted by the FDA approval of Vosevi. HCV patient starts in the first six months were better than the company’s expectation. The company, however, expects a gradual decline in the second half of the year (market starts of 185,000 to 200,000 in the U.S) for 2017 due to increased competition. We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa, face competition from AbbVie’s, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza among others.Meanwhile, the HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens in the U.S. and EU. The TAF-based regimens now represent 51% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and the launches of Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%.Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is alsoexpected toboost sales as the company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with an estimated 136,000 patients using Truvada by the end of the second quarter. However, Gilead will lose exclusivity for Viread in 2017 in some countries outside the U.S. which may impact sales.Zacks Rank & Key PickGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).   A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Exelixis, Inc.
