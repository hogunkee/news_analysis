1,APA,"Markets closed slightly lower on Thursday after President Donald Trump scrapped his planned meeting with North Korea’s premier Kim Jong Un. Further, Trump also threatened to impose import duty on cars and trucks that took a toll on the markets. Moreover, the broader energy sector took a hit as investors dumped energy stocks as oil prices declined on news that Opec members could escalate production to ease supply restraint from Iran and Venezuela.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) declined 0.3% to close at 24,811.75. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% to close at 2,727.76. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed almost unchanged at 7,424.43, declining less than 0.1%. A total of 6.3 billion shares were traded on Thursday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.6 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.03-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.How did the Benchmark Perform?The Dow lost 75.05 points after hitting a lot of as much as 280.91 points on news of Trump cancelling the Singapore summit. However, the losses were pared by gains in Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and General Electric (GE  -  Free Report).The S&P 500 lost 5.53 points, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) and Financial Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) losing 1.7% and 0.8%, respectively.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq made a marginal loss of 1.53 points.Trump Cancels Meeting with Kim Jong UnTrump on Thursday cancelled the scheduled June 12 Singapore summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. Trump cited “open hostility” from North Korea as the reason behind the cancellation of the meeting. This would have been the first face-to-face meeting with an U.S. president and a North Korean leader.The cancellation followed even though North Korea kept its promise to blow up tunnels at its nuclear test site. The news dented investors’ confidence, with stocks taking a hit immediately. However, the initial losses were pared later after shares of Netflix and General Electric rallied. Netflix’s market value jumped to $153 billion, surpassing Walt Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) for the first time to make it the world’s most valuable entertainment company.Oil Prices Fall Investors shunned energy stocks on Thursday, on possibilities of easing oil production caps by Russia and Opec countries sending crude oil prices lower. News of Opec members planning to increase the production of oil in order to ease supply constraints from Venezuela and Iran, saw investors panicking over crude oil prices going down. Both Iran and Venezuela are under threat from U.S. sanctions.This saw major energy stocks plummeting with Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD  -  Free Report) and Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) declining 3.1% each.

2,APA,"It was a week where oil prices consolidated above $70-a-barrel and natural gas futures got a lift from growing cooling demand.On the news front, energy major TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) signed a natural gas resources development deal with the Government of Oman, while U.S. oil and gas provider Rex Energy Corp.  confirmed filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Overall, it was another good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 0.8% to close at $71.28 per barrel, while natural gas prices rose some 1.5% to $2.847 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Occidental, Cheniere & Petrobras' Earnings Impress)The U.S. oil benchmark hit a new three-and-a-half-year high last week on bullish EIA inventory numbers, a looming drop in Iranian crude exports and alarming drop in Venezuelan crude output.The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude stockpiles registered a fall of 1.4 million barrels, the second weekly decrease in a row. On a further bullish note, the report revealed that refined product inventories, gasoline and distillate, both dropped from their week earlier levels.The commodity was also supported by U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent withdrawal from a nuclear deal with OPEC’s third-largest producer Iran and a pledge to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The action has stoked worries about an expected cut in Iranian oil exports by around 1 million barrels per day from current levels and lead to a supply shortage in an already ‘tight’ oil market.Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters. With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse, oil output has dwindled by almost 50% since 2005. Venezuela currently churns out less than 2 million barrels per day, much lower that its pledge per the OPEC-led supply cuts.Natural gas prices also moved northward last week. While the weekly inventory release showed a larger-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies, the report pointed to a tightening market dynamic and boosted the fuel’s price. In particular, total consumption of natural gas averaged around 57.5 Bcf per day, 4% higher on a weekly basis due to rising usage for power generation.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    TOTAL S.A. recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Oman to develop natural gas resources in Oman. The agreement covers both the upstream and downstream businesses of the company. TOTAL’s involvement in the above project will increase its production from Oman, which was 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d) in 2017.TOTAL, along with Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), will develop several natural gas discoveries located in the Greater Barik area on onshore Block 6. Shell will be the operator with 75% stake and TOTAL will have 25% interest in these natural gas discoveries. Initial gas production will be 500 million cubic feet per day, with the potential to increase to 1 billion cubic feet.TOTAL has plans to utilize its equity gas entitlement from the Oman project as feedstock to develop a regional hub for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) bunkering service to supply LNG as a fuel to marine vessels. A small-scale liquefaction plant will be built in Sohar port and TOTAL will utilize this plant to convert natural gas to LNG. In addition, TOTAL may benefit from improving natural gas demand in Oman.

Hit by the industry downturn, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company had been contemplating Chapter 11 filing for quite some time. Amid elevated leverage metrics, challenges in refinancing its 2020 debt maturities along with weak natural prices creating further pressure, the company is headed toward debt restructuring. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In fact, it has reached a restructuring support deal with 100% of its first-lien lenders and 72% of second-lien bondholders. U.S. oil and gas provider, Rex Energy believes that comprehensive debt restructuring will enable it to overcome the challenging times that the company has been facing. Rex Energy has secured $100 million in financing from first-lien lenders, which along with its operating cash flow would be sufficient for the company to maintain normal operations during bankruptcy proceedings.Notably, the Appalachian Basin-focused company had got delisted from the Nasdaq stock market effective Apr 12. In its latest quarterly report, the company disclosed that it could not come into an agreement with the lenders, after it failed to make an interest payment in April. Apart from defaulting on the interest payment on its senior notes, Rex Energy also failed to supply timely financial statements and other important disclosures to its lenders.

The company is likely to use NuStar Energy L.P.’s (NS  -  Free Report) infrastructure, which includes the midstream company's Nuevo Laredo storage terminal in Mexico and its related pipelines. The terminal has five storage tanks that hold 34,000 barrels of refined products, which is likely to be increased to meet Valero's requirement. By 2018-end, Valero is expected to start shipping fuel to the storage terminal.The deal is in line with Valero's strategy of expanding its supply chain in a growing market. Notably, the company has an existing deal made in August 2017, to supply fuels in central Mexico. We note that SENER, Mexico’s Ministry of Energy, had issued renewable permits to Valero for importing almost 54 million barrels of gasoline along with more than 56.7 million barrels of diesel per annum. Notably, the latest accord comes right after the company signed a contract to foray into the South American infrastructure market through the acquisition of Pure Biofuels del Peru S.A.C.(Read more Valero Expands Into Northern Mexico Refined Product Market)4.    Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) recently inked an agreement to build a new natural gas liquids (NGL) project, in a bid to advance the infrastructural development in its Alpine High play in the Permian Basin. The project, titled SCM Alpine, LLC, will be developed by Apache’s subsidiary Apache Midstream, ARM Energy Holdings LLC and its affiliate Salt Creek Midstream LLC. Notably, Salt Creek is a joint venture formed last month by Ares Management and ARM Energy to develop midstream infrastructure in the Delaware Basin.The firms intend to build a NGL header system with a takeaway capacity of 445,000 barrels per day for catering to the growing production in the Delaware sub-basin of the Permian play. The project will include two pipeline segments, originating at the Salt Creek and Apache processing facilities in Reeves County, Texas. SCM Alpine is supported by 10-year commitments from both Salt Creek and Apache, which are open to renewal twice for an additional five years. With the construction work already been commenced, the project is likely to become functional in the first quarter of 2019.The pipeline will transport NGLs to the Waha Hub, where it would interconnect with the downstream pipelines, providing access to Mont Belvieu and Corpus Christi fractionation facilities in Texas. By gaining access to the emerging Waha area, Apache’s long-term opportunities and optionality will be enhanced, providing it a competitive edge.

(KMI  -  Free Report) is going through a roller coaster ride with its Trans Mountain expansion project in Canada, where political uncertainty is playing a major role in deciding its future. Recently, the company received assurance from the Canadian government that losses related to politically-triggered delays in the project will be covered.As the future of the project seemed in jeopardy, the company started to rethink over the matter. Kinder Morgan was thinking of walking away from the project if further delays would hamper the company’s plans. The recent bottleneck in Canada’s pipelines has forced the government to take steps in this expansion project. The New Democratic Party led government of British Columbia, however, criticized the decision. The party has support from the Green Party, an environment-focused federal political party in Canada.Canadian Finance Minister, Bill Morneau stated that if Kinder Morgan leaves the Trans Mountain project, the government will be ready to provide the financial assurances as and when any company steps in to take over.

4,APA,"Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) recently agreed to participate in the EPIC Crude Oil Pipeline, run by EPIC Midstream Holdings, LP. The strategic alliance also includes Noble Energy, Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report). The pipeline will connect southeastern New Mexico to Corpus Christi, TX and transport crude from the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale. The under-construction pipeline will help to clear the infrastructure bottleneck caused by excessive production in the Permian, resulting in lower prices.The Strategic Alliance Being one of the largest acreage holders in the prolific Permian Basin, Houston, TX-based Apache's commitment of 75 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d) in the pipeline is expected to secure the project’s future. Noble Energy, headquartered in the same area, also secured 100 MBbl/d in the pipeline. Per the agreement, Apache and Noble Energy hold an option of acquiring as far as 15% and 30% stake in the pipeline, respectively. These options can be exercised by the first three months of 2019.Oil producers in the Permian Basin have recently seen their product price decline due to the increase in production, which overwhelmed the infrastructure that ships crudes to ports. The situation is alarming for the producers in the area, as their profit margin is threatened by the discounted crude prices. The strategic alliance thus gives Apache, as well as Noble Energy a chance to improve margins.About the Pipeline The pipeline is expected to have an initial oil transport capacity of 590 thousand MBbl/d. Around 74.6% of the total capacity will come from the Permian Basin while the rest from the Eagle Ford. The pipeline will have an option of upsizing to a 30-inch line that will further increase the shipping capacity from the Permian Basin to 675 MBbl/d.Incorporating Apache and Noble Energy’s committed acreages, more than 500,000 acres were devoted to the pipeline and at least 10% of its total capacity is planned to be kept for uncommitted shippers.The 730-mile crude pipeline will run beside EPIC's natural gas liquids pipeline. Construction of the pipeline is anticipated to start in the October-December period of 2018 and it will come online in 2019's second half. The EPIC Crude Oil Pipeline has the capital commitment support from funds managed by Ares Management, L.P.'s (ARES  -  Free Report) Private Equity Group.Price Performance of ApacheThe upstream oil major has lost 18.8% in the past year against the 5.3% gain of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderApache has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the Energy sector can opt for a better-ranked stock in the same space, namely Nine Energy Service, Inc.

5,APA,"Noble Energy, Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report) finalized an agreement with EPIC Pipeline, LP (“EPIC”) to transport crude oil from Delaware Basin area to Corpus Christi, TX. Per the contract, the company will start transporting 100 thousand barrels of oil per day (MBbl/d) through EPIC pipelines for a period of 10 years starting from the second half of 2019.  The 730-mile EPIC crude oil pipeline has a total capacity of 590 MBbl/d and will connect the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford area to the Port of Corpus Christi. Along with Nobel Energy, Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) — one of the largest acreage holders in the Permian Basin — has secured oil transportation of 75 MBbl/d.Details of the DealNoble Energy consistently focuses on U.S. onshore operations to strengthen cash flow and margin. The company is planning to invest nearly 70% of its planned 2018 capital expenditures for the development of these assets.Going forward, onshore production is projected to be a major contributor to Noble Energy’s total output. The company focuses on the Delaware Basin and expects higher volumes from this region.Further, the deal will diversify Noble Energy’s onshore marketing outlets with access to global markets at an attractive pipeline transport cost.What Comes Next?Per the deal, Noble Energy has secured options to acquire up to 30% ownership in the EPIC crude pipeline and around 15% ownership in the EPIC NGL pipeline.  The company is require to exercise the options by the first quarter of 2019.Rising production volumes in the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford area will increase the importance of EPIC’s pipelines. We believe that acquiring a portion of the pipeline will act as a tailwind for Noble Energy and boost earnings.Price PerformanceShares of Noble Energy have outperformed the industry in the last 12 months.

6,APA,"U.S. energy firm Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter earnings per share – excluding one-time items – of 32 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents and the year-ago adjusted profit of 8 cents. The outperformance stems from higher oil realizations and greater-than-expected volumes from the key Permian Basin region.Revenues of $1,742 million were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,648 million but was 7.2% below the first-quarter 2017 sales of $1,878 million.Production Growth, Higher Selling PricesThe production of oil and natural gas (excluding divested assets and non-controlling interests) averaged 366,965 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d) (67% liquids), up 6% from last year. Apache’s production for oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) was 247,035 barrels per day (Bbl/d), while natural gas output came in at 719,565 thousand cubic feet per day (Mcf/d).In the company's Permian Basin acreage, average production volumes improved to a record 182,972 BOE/d from 146,448 in the first quarter of 2017. Results were also above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 177,000 BOE/d, helped by operational progress and the high quality of Apache’s inventory. For 2018, the company forecasts its Permian resources to continue the high-return growth.The average realized crude oil price during the first quarter was $64.27 per barrel, representing an increase of 25.5% from the year-ago realization of $51.20. Moreover, the average realized natural gas price during the March quarter of 2018 was $2.77 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 1.1% from the year-ago period.Apache increased its 2018 annual production guidance to 250,000-258,000 BOE/dfrom 245,000-255,000BOE/d, representing annual production per share growth of 14%. The expected improvement in this year’s volume is driven by higher number of operating wells in the first quarter.Apache Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Apache Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Apache Corporation QuoteBalance Sheet, Capital Spending & Lease Operating ExpensesAs of Mar 31, 2018, the oil giant, with a market capitalization of just over $15 billion, had approximately $1,077 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company had long-term debt of $7,936 million, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 51.4%.During the oil rout, Apache– like many other oil and gas players including ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) – aligned its spending plans with the low-price environment.But Apache has since then increase its capital investment after achieving cost rationalization. With returns-focused growth in mind, Apache shelled out $3,089 million in 2017, representing a 75% increase over its 2016 spend. Keeping with the company’s planned shift in strategic objective, Apache’s guidance for oil and gas investments for this year remains unchanged at $3,000 million.  Apache’s first-quarter lease operating expenses totaled $349 million, up 3.9% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, total operating expenses edged up 1% from the corresponding period of 2017 to $1,354 million.Zacks Rank & Stock PicksApache currently retains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Meanwhile, one can look at a better-ranked energy player like Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) - a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Wildhorse is a company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and operation of unconventional, onshore oil and gas properties in the northeastern end of the Eagle Ford Play in South Texas.

7,APA,"Independent oil and gas explorer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ  -  Free Report) is set to release its first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Thursday, May 3. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 57 cents on revenues of $4,160 million.In the preceding three-month period, the Calgary, Alberta-based upstream player reported profit of 37 cents.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the company is on a bit of a slippery slope, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the last four reports. This is depicted in the graph below:Canadian Natural Resources Limited Price and EPS Surprise Canadian Natural Resources Limited Price and EPS Surprise | Canadian Natural Resources Limited QuoteInvestors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Canadian Natural surpasses earnings estimate this time around. Let’s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results.Factors to Consider This QuarterWe believe that the improving oil price environment amid a favorable shift in Canadian Natural’s product mix toward the commodity bode well.Canadian Natural is engaged in the acquisition, development and exploitation of crude oil and natural gas properties. The company has a strong and diverse production base with long-life and low decline rate assets. In the last quarter, the company witnessed a 19% year-over-year increase in production. With Canadian Natural’s solid assets and strong project execution, we expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter as well.Moreover, the upstream player is poised to benefit from higher crude price realizations. Benchmark crude oil prices have risen sharply over the past nine months amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the average sales price for crude oil in first quarter 2018 is $61 per barrel, up from $45 a year earlier.However, the shortage of pipelines and rail transportations has disrupted the production schedule of the companies in Western Canada. The likes of Canadian natural had to slow down their activity levels due to difficulty in crude transportation. This might lead to lower-than-expected quarterly production.Moreover, Canadian Natural pursues long-term oil projects, which call for large capital outlays and several years of development before any cash flow is realized. Therefore, cost and time overrun in the ongoing projects may have a negative impact on the stock’s company’s upcoming quarterly performance.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Canadian Natural will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, for Canadian Natural stands at 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at 57 cents.Zacks Rank: Canadian Natural has a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Canadian Natural, here are some energy companies you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.33% and a Zacks Rank #1. The firm is anticipated to release earnings on May 3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.29% and a Zacks Rank #3. The firm is likely to release earnings on May 2.Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.10% and a Zacks Rank #3. The utility is likely to release earnings on May 2.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

8,APA,"Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) is expected to beat expectations in first-quarter 2018 results, when it releases earnings on May 2, after the market closes. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 27 cents on revenues of $1,640 million.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 57.1% by reporting adjusted earnings of 33 cents per share against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents. The outperformance stemmed from higher oil and gas realizations, and lower costs.Moreover, as far as earnings surprise history is concerned, the Houston, TX-based upstream operator delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 62.4% in the trailing four quarters.Apache Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Apache Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Apache Corporation Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? As we believe that improving realized prices will enhance earnings of the company, Apache’s high production growth from the Permian operations keeps us excited.The analysts polled by Zacks envision the average price of oil from the Permian Basin in the first quarter of 2018 to come in at $60 per barrel. It is higher than the year-ago quarter’s figure of $49.16 per barrel and $53.22 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017. Average price of natural gas per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) is expected at $2.87, up 4.4% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for natural gas production volume per day in the Permian Basin is 335 Mcf, higher than the year-ago period’s 228 Mcf and last reported quarter’s 320 Mcf. Moreover, natural gas volumes from the North America are expected at 456 Mcf per day, up 3.4% sequentially.Additionally, the company expects its unrealized gain on oil and gas price derivatives (before tax) to be $49 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Apache is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Positive Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +0.29%. This is a very meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Apache carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with +0.29% ESP makes us confident about an earnings beat.Note that stocks with a Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Other Energy Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some other companies from the same sector, which according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.Calgary, Canada-based Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PBA  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #1 and has an Earnings ESP of +3.87%. The company will report earnings on May 3.Frisco, TX-based Comstock Resources, Inc. (CRK  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +51.83%. The company will report earnings on May 14.Fort Worth, TX-based Emerge Energy Services LP (EMES  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +16.67%. The company will report earnings on May 1.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

9,APA,"Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 27.The company is an upstream energy entity, which delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2% in the trailing four quarters, missing estimates on two occasions.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this Houston, TX-based Cabot Oil & Gas prior to the earnings announcement.Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation QuoteWhich Way are Estimates Trending?Let’s take a look at the estimate revisions to draw a clear picture of analysts’ thoughts on the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents for the first quarter has seen two upward and one downward revision by firms in the last 60 days, reflecting year-over-year growth of about 42.1%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $463.8 million in the upcoming results, representing a 10.4% decline from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter total equivalent production is 167 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe), lower than 170.1 Bcfe in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate total natural gas production to be 162 billion cubic feet (Bcf), 1.2% down year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for crude oil and condensate production is 703 thousand barrels (MBbl), down 43.2% sequentially and 23.7% year over year.Additionally, the consensus mark for average natural gas sales price (including hedging) per thousand cubic feet is $2.50, down from $2.64 in the year-earlier quarter but up from $2.18 reported last quarter. The consensus estimate for crude oil and condensate price (including hedging) is pegged at $56 per barrel, up from $46.73 in first-quarter 2017 and marginally up from $55 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Revenues from operations will likely decline in the to-be-reported quarter compared with year-ago period due to lower equivalent production and an estimated decline in gas prices.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating revenues from crude oil and condensate stands at $41.8 million, down from the year-ago quarter’s $43 million and the prior quarter’s $68 million. Analysts polled by Zacks project operating revenues from natural gas production at $412 million, 4.8% down year over year. However, the figure is 16.4% above the previous quarter’s result.Additionally, the company’s Marcellus program is ramping up with exceptional results. The company has around 200,000 net acres in the prime Marcellus acreage with an estimated 3,000 remaining undrilled locations. This high-quality asset base in the prolific region can benefit it in its first quarter operations.What Does Our Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cabot Oil & Gas is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Cabot Oil & Gas has an ESP of -6.23% as the Most Accurate estimate of 25 cents is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents. The figure represents the percentage difference between the two above-mentioned estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cabot Oil & Gas carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP leaves surprise prediction inconclusive as only a positive ESP increases the confidence about an earnings surprise.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Energy Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies from the energy space, which per our model, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around.Frisco, TX-based Comstock Resources, Inc. (CRK  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +37.34%. The company will report financial numbers on May 14.Houston, TX-based Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of +2.38%. The company will report earnings numbers on May 2.Headquartered at The Woodlands, TX, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) is a Zacks #3 Ranked player and has an Earnings ESP of +12.96%. The company will announce earnings results on May 1.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs Pending A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it.

10,APA,"About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 10.4% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Second-Quarter 2017 ResultsApache reported second-quarter loss per share – excluding one-time items – of $0.21 against the Zacks Consensus Estimate for breakeven earnings. The underperformance stems from a dip in output due to a conservative capital budget over the past two years. However, the bottom line improved from the year-ago loss of $0.26 amid higher realizations.Revenues of $1,384 million were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,419 million but managed to beat the second-quarter 2016 sales of $1,382 million.Operational PerformanceThe production of oil and natural gas (excluding divested assets and non-controlling interests) averaged 387,562 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d) (65% liquids), down 16% from last year. Apache’s production for oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) was 250,251 barrels per day (Bbl/d), while natural gas output came in at 823.9 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d).The average realized crude oil price during the second quarter was $46.89 per barrel, representing an increase of 9% from the year-ago realization of $43.14. Moreover, the average realized natural gas price during the Jun quarter of 2017 was $2.60 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 27% from the year-ago period.Balance Sheet, Capital Spending & Lease Operating ExpensesAs of Jun 30, 2017, Apache had approximately $1,667 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company had a long-term debt of $8,329 million, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 54.7%.During the oil rout, Apache– like many other oil and gas players – aligned its spending plans with the low-price environment.But Apache is now looking to increase its capital investment after achieving cost rationalization. With returns-focused growth in mind, Apache announced a 2017 capital budget of $3.1 billion, representing a 60% increase over its 2016 spend. Keeping with the company’s planned shift in strategic objective, Apache’s oil and gas capital investments totaled $738 million during the Apr-Jun period, 85% higher than the $400 million incurred a year ago.Apache’s second quarter lease operating expenses totaled $372 million, up 4% from the year-ago quarter. However, total costs and expenses fell 17% from the second quarter of 2016 to $1,375 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions lower for the current quarter. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more downward momentum.Apache Corporation Price and Consensus  Apache Corporation Price and Consensus | Apache Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Apache's stock has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall,the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for growth investors than value investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. Interestingly, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are looking for an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

11,APA,"  (0:25) - Oil Industry Setback: Value Investor Buying Opportunity(3:00) - When Insiders Buy, Should you too?(5:20) - Big Cap EMP Stocks: Where Are Insiders Buying?(7:50) - Small Cap EMP Stocks: Insider Buying(11:50) - Stocks With No Insider Buying(14:45) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome to Episode #56 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.Even though stocks are near all-time highs, there are several industries that have broken down and are now trading near lows. Energy is one of those.A few months ago, on the podcast, Tracey covered the Big Oil and E&P companies that had insider buying. But as the shares fell further throughout the summer, she noticed the insiders jumping in again. They’re doubling down.Two Scenarios When Insiders BuyThere are two different scenarios in which the insiders normally buy shares.1.  The shares have plunged and the insiders now think they’re oversold. They consider the shares to be a deal.2.  The shares are trading at or near all-time highs but the insiders think things are so bright at the company that they still want more shares.Most of the insider buys are scenario #1, including right now in the energy industry.Tracey looked at 17 Big Oil and E&Ps for insider buying. She didn’t consider the service companies, the refiners or the pipelines.She also didn’t look at the fundamentals of any of these companies. In that way, they may not have traditional “value” characteristics. All investors should do their own research on company fundamentals.Where Are the Insiders Buying?1.  In the last podcast, the big oil insiders were mostly on the sidelines, including at Exxon (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron and Conoco. Exxon shares are now down 15% year-to-date. Are the insiders jumping in?2.  A cluster of directors bought in both Apache (APA  -  Free Report) and in Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD  -  Free Report). Insiders had been buying at one of them earlier in the year. But at the other, insiders haven’t bought since 2015. Where did the insiders jump in for the first time?3.  Insiders have been buying at many of the smaller E&Ps. Three directors and the CFO bought in July and August at QEP Resources (QEP  -  Free Report). That’s a big cluster buy. Insiders didn’t even buy at the January/February oil stock lows in 2016.4.  Three directors also bought at Range Resources (RRC  -  Free Report) in August. They had been buying in both March and June.5.  Insiders bought in June 2017 at SM Energy and SRCI Energy. Did they buy again in August?Investors can tell a lot by where the insiders are buying, or, in many cases, not buying, as shares slide. Remember, the insiders are risking their own cash.Want to know if the insiders are buying at your favorite oil companies?Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of APA, WLL and SRCI in her personal portfolio.]Want more value investing insights from Tracey?

12,APA,"We issued an updated research report on upstream energy player, Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) on Aug 16. We are upbeat about the company’s promising Alpine High discovery and exit from the high-cost Canadian operations. Meanwhile, the persistent uncertainty in oil prices raises concern.Apache's Alpine High discovery in West Texas is expected to be a game changer. Estimated to hold massive oil and natural gas reserves, the wells are likely to yield high returns.Moreover, management has been actively divesting assets, particularly those that do not fit into its long-term growth plan. As part of this initiative, Apache recently entered into an agreement to divest its high-cost Canadian assets, thereby freeing up capital to focus on longer-term lucrative prospects, especially in the Permian basin. Apache has been focused on streamlining its portfolio and strategically redeploying capital toward the highest value opportunities.On top of that, cash flow for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has exceeded capital expenditure for five quarters in a row. As a result, after following a disciplined capital allocation program over the past two years, Apache is now looking to shift its strategic objective. With returns-focused growth in mind, Apache announced 2017 capital budget of $3.1 billion, representing a 60% increase over its 2016 spend.However, oil prices have been in freefall over the past few weeks, erasing all the gains associated with the OPEC-led output cut. The continued rise in domestic production, thanks to soaring shale output, has dragged down the commodity well below the psychologically-critical $50 level. This will dent Apache's earnings and cash flows considerably. As it is, the effect of the drop in commodity price has been profound on Apache’s top line as the energy explorer did not hedge production.Also, Apache's stock has lost 36% since the start of this year, underperforming the industry’s decline of 31.4%. Further, the company has been witnessing downward estimate revisions with current-year earnings estimates declining 19% over the last seven days.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked players in the energy sector include TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report), Transmontaigne Partners LP (TLP  -  Free Report) and Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report). All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

13,APA,"Investing success hinges upon precise identification of overpriced stocks and fairly priced ones. However, the over-hyped toxic stocks and the correctly priced stocks are mingled in the marketplace in such a way that it becomes very tough to differentiate between them. Investors who can pinpoint the toxic stocks and discard them at the right time are likely to gain.Generally, toxic stocks are vulnerable to external shocks and are loaded with high levels of debt. Also, price of the toxic stocks is irrationally high. The unjustifiably high price of the toxic stocks is only short-lived as the intrinsic value of these stocks is lower than the current bloated price.The inflated price of the toxic stocks can be ascribed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some serious fundamental lacunae in the stock. If you own such stocks for a long period of time, you are likely to witness huge erosion in your wealth.On the other hand, if you can figure out the toxic stocks correctly, you may gain by resorting to an investing strategy called short selling. This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls.While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, picking up toxic stocks and abandoning them at the right time is the key to protect your portfolio from big losses. Profits can be made by short selling them.Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.P/E using 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than -5: Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Zacks Rank more than or equal to #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy-rated stocks that generally outperform the market.Here are five of the 18 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:PTC Inc. (PTC  -  Free Report) is a Needham, MA-based software company engaged in developing, marketing and supporting software solutions.

14,APA,"U.S. energy firm Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter loss per share – excluding one-time items – of 21 cents against the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a profit of a penny. The underperformance stems from a dip in output due to a conservative capital budget over the past two years. However, the bottom line improved from the year-ago loss of 26 cents amid higher realizations.Revenues of $1,384 million were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,419 million but managed to beat the second-quarter 2016 sales of $1,382 million.Operational PerformanceThe production of oil and natural gas (excluding divested assets and non-controlling interests) averaged 387,562 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d) (65% liquids), down 16% from last year.

15,APA,"Markets are a little more than halfway through the Q2 earnings season, with 57.2% S&P 500 members having reported results as of Friday, Apr 28.Picture Emerging Thus FarWe now have Q2 results from 286 S&P 500 members that combined account for 68.8% of the index’s total market capitalization. According to the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies are up 11.3 from the same period last year on 6.1% higher revenues, with 74.5% positive earnings surprises and 69.2% beating revenue estimates.Energy Earnings SoarThe ‘Energy’ sector has been off to a spectacular start. For the 48.5% sector components on the S&P 500 index that have reported Q2 results, total earnings surged 226.2% on 15.5% higher revenues. While 50% of the companies have been successful in beating earnings estimates, 81.3% outperformed the top line.Energy: First Half RecapLast year, 'Energy' was the strongest S&P sector performer, with market-thumping 24% returns. In particular, November's historic OPEC-led production cut deal to alleviate a supply glut managed to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important $50 per barrel threshold. The commodity was on a stellar run on optimism surrounding the agreement, and the outlook for oil stocks was getting better.The seemingly positive developments encouraged investors to bet on firming prices for 2017, with the oil industry finally hoping that 'this would be the year.' True to the strong sentiments, U.S. oil prices reached around $55 per barrel in late February, the highest level in 19 months.However, the situation is drastically different now, with the commodity floundering in recent weeks. By Jun 21, crude had cratered more than 20% from its February highs and officially plunged into the bear territory. In fact, prices ended down 14.3% for the first half of the year – the worst performance since 1998.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the second quarter of this year.Strong Q2 Earnings Growth PredictionA look back at the Q1 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 Index.The Jan-Mar 2017 period turned out to be a rather good one with both oil and natural gas prices benefiting from easier comparison with the year-ago period. While crude slumped to some 12-year low in the first quarter of 2016, natural gas futures dropped to the worst level in almost 17 years.As a result, the sector – whose year-earlier comparison was to an aggregate loss – came out swinging. For the sector components on the S&P 500 Index, total Q1 earnings had very strong year-over-year dollar growth on 33.8% higher revenues. While 69.7% of the companies were successful in beating earnings estimates, 63.6% outperformed the top line.The picture looks rather encouraging for the Q2 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared to the second quarter of 2016 when the energy companies reported unusually low bottom line. While earnings for the Oil/Energy sector are set to jump a massive 249.0% – the highest year-over-year growth among all sectors – the top line is likely to show an improvement of 16.5% from the second-quarter 2016 levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Aug 3Let’s see what’s in store for four energy companies expected to come up with June-quarter numbers on Thursday, Aug 3.First, we have domestic energy explorer Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report), which is expected to report before the opening bell. In the previous quarter, this Houston, TX-headquartered upstream oil and gas player missed estimates, weighed down by a dip in output due to a conservative capital budget over the past two years.Regarding earnings surprises, Apache is on a bit of a slippery surface, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four reports. And our model indicates that the company is unlikely to beat on earnings this time around too.This is because, as per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For the quarter to be reported, Apache has an Earnings ESP of +200.00%. A positive ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. However, Apache currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), which makes surprise prediction difficult. (Read more: What's in the Offing for Apache this Earnings Season?)As it is, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Apache Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Apache Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Apache Corporation QuoteHeadquartered in Oklahoma City, OK, Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report) is also set to report second-quarter 2017 results – before the opening bell. The company – engaged in the acquisition, development, and production of onshore U.S. natural gas resources – has a good track of outperforming estimates in three of the last four quarters.Powered with the right combination of the two key ingredients – an Earnings ESP of +7.14% and a Zacks Rank #3 – our proven model shows that an earnings beat is expected for Chesapeake Energy in the to-be-reported quarter as well. (Read more: Chesapeake Q2 Earnings: Another Beat in the Cards?)You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Chesapeake Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Chesapeake Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Chesapeake Energy Corporation QuoteThen there is Calgary, Alberta-based Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ  -  Free Report) coming up with April-June operational results tomorrow morning.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, Canadian Natural Resources – one of the largest independent exploration and production companies in the country, with extensive heavy crude oil and natural gas developments – has a decent history. It went past the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the last four reports.And, with an Earnings ESP of +19.05% and a Zacks Rank #3, an earnings beat is possible for Canadian Natural Resources in the upcoming quarterly release too. (Read more: Canadian Natural Resources Q2 Earnings: Beat in Store?)Canadian Natural Resources Limited Price and EPS Surprise  Canadian Natural Resources Limited Price and EPS Surprise | Canadian Natural Resources Limited QuoteLastly, we have Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report) reporting second-quarter 2017 results – this time after the closing bell. Coming to the earnings surprise history, this Spring, TX-headquartered energy explorer – with producing properties mainly in the Arkansas side of the Arkoma Basin, as well as in Oklahoma, Texas and Pennsylvania – has been on a mixed run: it went past estimates in two of the last four quarters.But our model does not indicate that Precision Drilling is likely to beat on earnings this time around, as it has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

16,APA,"Independent energy explorer QEP Resources, Inc. (QEP  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 loss per share – excluding special items – of 12 cents, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 19 cents. The company had reported adjusted loss of 23 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The improvement in year-over-year results was primarily driven by decrease in overall operating expenses and increased overall realized price.Quarterly revenues of $383.7 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $411 million as volumes remained stagnant but increased 15% from second-quarter 2016.Volume AnalysisQEP Resources’ overall production in the quarter came in at 13,860.6 million barrels of oil equivalent (Mboe) – essentially flat from the year-ago period. Natural gas volumes increased 6.8% year over year to 45.8 billion cubic feet (Bcf), whereas liquid volumes declined 7.5% to 6,225.2 thousand barrels.Although production in the Permian Basin increased 23% year over year and 38% sequentially, lower production and fewer completions in the Williston Basin and Pinedale dampened overall production in the second quarter.Notably, QEP Resources had divested its Pinedale assets for $740 million as part of its portfolio optimization process.Realized PricesQEP Resources’ average realized natural gas price in the quarter was $2.82 per thousand cubic feet, up 12.4% from the year-ago quarter price of $2.51. Moreover, average oil price realization improved 6.9% year over year to $46.72 per barrel. Overall net realized equivalent price averaged $27.37 per barrel of oil equivalent in the quarter, up 6% year over year.Price PerformanceQEP Resources stock has lost 20.5% in the second quarter of 2017, underperforming the 16.9% fall of the industry it belongs to.Operating Expenses and Capital ExpensesTotal operating expenses for the quarter decreased to $404.4 million from $425 million a year ago, reflecting a reduction of 4.9%. The reduction is primarily attributed to a decrease in purchased oil and gas expense along with general and administrative expenses.Capital investment, excluding acquisitions, was 257% up year over year to $306 million for the second quarter.Permian Basin in FocusQEP Resources has shifted its focus to the Permian Basin, for which it invested $41.5 million in its midstream infrastructure in the region. It is following the footsteps of oil companies like American Midstream , Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report). QEP Resources has also agreed to buy $732 million worth of oil and natural gas properties in the area from an undisclosed seller. Net production from the assets is 635 Boe/d, of which 71% is oil. QEP Resources expects total net recoverable resources in the area to be around 295MMBoe. The asset includes 730 potential horizontal drilling locations.The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Balance SheetAs of Jun 30, 2017, QEP Resources had cash and cash equivalents of $178.8 million.

17,APA,"Investors with an interest in Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States stocks have likely encountered both Devon Energy (DVN  -  Free Report) and Apache (APA  -  Free Report). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Devon Energy is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Apache has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that DVN likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than APA has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.DVN currently has a forward P/E ratio of 24.99, while APA has a forward P/E of 27.87. We also note that DVN has a PEG ratio of 3.57. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. APA currently has a PEG ratio of 3.98.Another notable valuation metric for DVN is its P/B ratio of 1.74. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, APA has a P/B of 2.09.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to DVN's Value grade of B and APA's Value grade of C.DVN has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than APA, so it seems like value investors will conclude that DVN is the superior option right now.

18,APA,"QEP Resources, Inc. (QEP  -  Free Report) recently inked a $155-million deal to offload its oil and gas assets in the Uinta Basin, in a bid to sharpen focus on the prolific Permian play. Middle Fork Energy Partners, LLC will be purchasing the Uinta assets located in Duchesne and Uintah counties in eastern Utah.The divested assets comprise acreage of around 230,000 net acres and incorporate 605 billion cubic feet equivalents of proved reserves as of Dec 31, 2017. QEP Resources' net production in the last reported quarter, from the Uinta assets, was 54 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. Around 26% of the production was liquids.The deal is in line with QEP Resources’ strategy to streamline portfolio. The company has been entering into various strategic deals of late to sharpen focus on the more profitable Permian Basin and upgrade portfolio. QEP Resources currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.QEP Resources, Inc. Price  QEP Resources, Inc. Price | QEP Resources, Inc. QuoteIn 2016, it bought around 9,400 acres in the Permian for $600 million. Last July, it jettisoned its non-core gas assets located in southern Wyoming in a $777.5-million deal. In the same month, it inked another $732-million deal to acquire around 13,800 acres in the Permian Basin. In fact, the company allocated about 65% of its 2018 capital budget for this lucrative play as it aims to transform itself into a Permian pure-play.Even during oil slump, the Permian Basin continued to turn out as a moneymaker for many of the oil producers owing to its low cost-high margin operational structure. The region's extensive pipeline infrastructure, plentiful labour and supplies, and relatively warm winters make year-round work possible. Oil production in the region has been witnessing significant growth, with its current capacity of churning around 3 million barrels per day (Bpd), which is further expected to rise another 2 million Bpd by 2025. Further, with crude pricing strength of late, more and more oil producers are likely to enhance or capitalize their Permian portfolio, increase shareholders’ return and reduce costs.As such, there has been a flurry of deals in the Permian region lately owing to its attractive economics. Oasis Petroleum Inc. (OAS  -  Free Report) dived into the Permian with a $946-million acreage buyout in December 2017. This year Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) inked a mega $9.5-billion deal to acquire RSP Permian Inc. Many notable players like Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report), Noble Energy Inc., Parsley Energy Inc., Marathon Oil Corporation, among others, also entered into strategic deals to expand their Permian foothold.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

19,APA,"It’s time to celebrate President Trump’s second year in office. After all, in two out of every three times, the second years of presidential terms have favored stock investors,.Wall Street, by the way, has shown enough confidence even as concerns about trade war loom large. As a matter of fact, solid job additions last month and an economy poised for growth that could come teasingly close to a milestone achieved in 2005 have instilled confidence among investors.Given the bullishness, investing in stocks with solid growth potential doesn’t seem to be a bad proposition.Wall Street Usually Rises in 2nd Year of Presidential TermsThere is always a 67% chance that the U.S. stock market will scale north during the second years of presidential terms. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, since its inception in 1896, has risen in two out of three times on average during the said period. And when the stock market rises less than 2% in the first half, you can be assured that it’s a done deal. Needless to say, the broader S&P 500 index rose less than 2% in the first half of this year.Even when the markets are fraught with concerns about geopolitical tensions or pending U.S. mid-term elections, you can pin your hopes on the success of the second year of a presidential term. And why not? The stock market is always forward looking and has already discounted such issues. Further, these odds won’t get hampered even if it is an aging bull market. This is why, there is a saying that bull markets don’t die of old age.% of time DJIA rises during the 2nd years of presidential terms (Data: Since 1896)Underlying Fundamentals Point the Way HigherStocks, by the way, have remained resilient to potential threats such U.S.-China trade skirmish after the White House imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, compelling Beijing to retaliate (read more: Think Small As U.S.-China Trade War Breaks Out! 5 Top Picks).Bulls also have solid faith in the underlying strengths of the U.S. economy and perhaps that points the way higher. The United States has been able to create 213,000 jobs in June; a healthy sign that show corporates are finding ways to fill open jobs despite lack of skilled workers. Such hiring figures easily topped analysts’ estimates of 200,000 job additions.Job gains were pretty broad based, with white-collar jobs leading the way with 50,000 job additions. From manufacturers, health-care providers to construction companies, all hired workers, a clear sign of a burgeoning economy.The unemployment rate rose to 4% last month, but for a good reason. The jobless rate went up mostly because of around 600,000 people entering the labor force. This showed that more Americans are searching for jobs as they are easier to find.Companies, in the meanwhile, are raising pay and benefits. Hourly wages rose 5 cents to $26.98. The yearly rate of pay hikes remained unchanged at 2.7%.Ramped up business investments, in a way, is expected to help the economy gain traction. The U.S. economy is projected to expand in the second quarter at an annual pace of nearly 4% after a 2.2% gain in the first three months of this year, economists say. This would put the economy in a solid position this year to meet or even beat 3% growth in gross domestic product (GDP), one of the primary aims of the government (read more: US GDP to Hit Elusive 3% Annual Growth in 13 Years: 5 Picks).Pundits Remain Sanguine About the U.S. Equity OutlookA number of market pundits remain upbeat about the outlook for U.S. equities. They have looked beyond potential headwinds that have been hurting the markets so far this year. In fact, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) have said that upbeat economic data coupled with pro-business policies will help companies register double-digit growth and accelerate buybacks in the near term.Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, the firm’s head of equity strategy, raised his year-end target for the S&P to 3,000 (8.7% upside potential from the current level). Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup’s (C  -  Free Report) chief U.S. strategist, is also upbeat, upgrading his rating to overweight from neutral and setting a price a price target of 2,865 for the S&P (3.8% upside potential from the current level). Andrew Adams, a strategist at Raymond James, in the meantime said that even though this year has seen a more torrid run than last year, he is yet to see red flags that indicate that the bull run is near its end. In fact, he has urged investors to look at the long-term trend and remain bullish.5 Stocks With Solid Upside Potential in the Second halfWall Street is gaining traction despite headlines flashing warnings about trade war. At the same time, statistical evidence shows that Trump’s second year in office will be fruitful for the stock market. Thus, investing in stocks that can make the most of these bullish trends seems judicious.We have, hence, selected five stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B, as it offers the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space.Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) is an independent energy company.

20,APA,"Following the release of EIA crude inventory numbers, worries about tightening global supplies and doubts over OPEC’s ability to boost production, oil prices settled at their highest since 2014 on Wednesday. West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery gained $2.23, or 3.2%, to end the day at $72.76 a barrel in electronic trading - the highest since November 2014.Bullish EIA NewsThe federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 9.9 million barrels for the week ending Jun 22, following a decrease of 5.9 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 2.3 million barrels.Record refinery throughput and booming exports led to the massive stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production remains at 10.9 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 44 of the last 64 weeks and are down more than 90 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 416.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 18% below the year-ago figure and 4% under the five-year average.OPEC Output Agreement, Venezuela and U.S. Curbs on Iran ExportsApart from the bullish government data, oil prices were also supported by OPEC’s recent plans for a smaller-than-expected output raise. Last week, OPEC agreed to stabilize the market by making modest increase in crude output. At the Vienna meeting, top producers came together and decided to raise volumes by about one million barrels per day from July to make up for falling production in Venezuela. The consensus figure was well below some of the numbers that had been floated ahead of the meeting, while the actual addition is expected to be even lesser – at around 700,000 barrels a day – due to several member countries’ inability to boost exports.Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters. With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse, oil output has dwindled by more than 40% since 2016. Venezuela currently churns out around 1.4 million barrels per day, the least since the 1950s and much lower that its pledge per the OPEC-led supply cuts. Fresh U.S. sanctions on the Maduro regime will further strangle the Latin American nation’s struggling energy sector.Finally, oil prices were also supported by United States’ refusal to issue any waivers on cutting crude imports from Iran by Nov 4 when sanctions are imposed against the country. Last month, President Trump withdrew from a nuclear deal with OPEC’s third-largest producer and pledged to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The action has stoked worries about an expected cut in Iranian oil exports – at 2.7 million barrels a day – by around one million barrels and lead to a supply shortage in an already ‘tight’ oil market.Supportive for StocksThe federal data sparked widespread buying in energy stocks, which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – up more than 1.3% Wednesday. The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 were also oil and oil-related stocks.An Opportunity to Build a Position in EnergyA steady drawdown of U.S. supplies, healthy demand and ongoing OPEC-led production cuts have driven oil prices higher. Crude has been inching its way back up after falling sharply from $100 a barrel in 2014, to a low of $30 in 2016. The robust fundamental backdrop, which we expect to further strengthen over the course of this year, has brought life back into the sector.Oil’s recovery to $70 and above, predictably, has had a positive effect on stocks in the sector while positioning certain producers to thrive. During the three-year downturn, oil companies worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques. With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50-$60 oil reality.  High Quality E&P Names Leading the WayWhile all crude-focused stocks stand to gain from the oil rally, companies in the exploration and production (E&P) sector are the best placed, as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Moreover, the firms boast conservative balance sheets with enough cash on hand and manageable leverage. This provides them ample flexibility to make acquisitions or grow internally. Moreover, driven by operational efficiencies, these entities have been able to reduce unit costs -- an impressive achievement amid the tight realization scenario.To guide investors to the right picks, we highlight 5 stocks that carry a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).

22,APA,"Wall Street ended Monday on a disappointing note as all three major stock market indexes declined significantly. Investors’ apprehensions about a trade war between the United States and China as well as with European Union have shaken market confidence. President Trump’s protectionist policies against key trading allies of the United States have generated severe market volatility. Although, yesterday’s decline was broad-based, the technology sector suffered maximum brunt of it. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,252.80, declining 1.3% or 328.09 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) also decreased 1.4% to close at 2,717.07. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,532.01, losing 2.1% or 160.81 points. A total of 7.74 billion shares were traded on Monday, higher than the last 20-session average of 7.32 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 3.29-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners had an edge over advancers by 3.24-to-1 ratio.  The CBOE VIX increased 25.9% to close at 17.33, its highest level in nearly a month.  How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow shed 1.3%, its biggest one-day drop since May 29. The blue-chip index closed at its lowest level since May 4. Moreover, the Dow ended below its 200-day moving average, a psychological barrier to gauge its long-term momentum trends. This happened for the first time since June 2016. Notably, 26 of the 30-stocks index closed in the red while 4 traded in the green.The S&P 500 dropped 1.4%, its biggest daily decline since April 6. This was also the index’s lowest close since May 31. During yesterday’s trading, the benchmark index fell below its 50-day moving average. However, it recovered from there and finally closed above the technical barrier.The S&P 500’s decline was primarily led by 2.2% loss of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY), 2.1% decrease of both Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) and Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and 2% decline of Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE). Notably, nine out of 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory.Nasdaq Composite decreased 2.1%, reflecting the index’s second straight losing session and its biggest one-day percentage loss since Apr 6. Large-cap tech behemoths and semiconductor stocks suffered significantly which pushed the tech-heavy index in the negative territory. Global Trade War Fears Intensify Ongoing trade related conflicts between the United States and its major trading allies like China, European Union, Canada, Mexico, to name a few are worsening day by day. Trade conflict between the United States and China has heightened to a position that imposition of tariffs and retaliatory traffic may go up to $450 billion on either side. In addition, President Trump desire to restrict Chinese companies to invest in U.S. tech firms block technology export to China by any U.S. companies will further escalate the tensions.Moreover, Trump has indicated that United States may impose 20% tariffs on auto imports from the European Union (EU) as a retaliatory move of EU’s decision to impose tariffs on U.S. auto exports.Yesterday, stock price of motorcycle giant Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) declined 5.8% after the announcement that the EU tariff on its motorcycles has been raised to 31% from 6%. The company plans to shift production of EU-bound motorcycles to international facilities from U.S. facilities to avoid the tariff burden. Harley-Davidson carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Per the report, any company with 25% or more Chinese ownership will be barred from investing in any U.S. tech companies. Likewise, U.S. tech companies will not be allowed to export technology to China.On Monday, the technology sector suffered a severe blow as China is the most lucrative market for tech behemoths. U.S. tech giants operating in the fields of smartphone, software and Internet-based services, online video streaming and social networking generates a large chunk of their revenues from China. Moreover, China accounted for over 50% revenues for some of the leading semiconductors developers.China is sure to take retaliatory measures against U.S. restrictions which will significantly affect the business model of these large tech companies. Consequently, Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) declined 6.5%, its biggest drop since July 2016. Other FAANG stocks also follow suite. Leading tech stock Stitch Fix Inc. (SFIX  -  Free Report) plunged 11%. Semiconductor majors like Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report) shed 6.9% and 4.7%, respectively.Economic DataThe Commerce Department reported that New-home sales stood at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 689,000 in May better than the consensus estimate of 666,000.

23,APA,"Kinder Morgan, Inc’s (KMI  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline LLC (KMTP) — has inked a letter of intent for the development of the planned Permian Highway Pipeline (PHP) Project with EagleClaw Midstream Ventures, LLCand Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report). EagleClaw is a portfolio company of Blackstone Energy Partners.The PHP project, estimated at $2 billion, will provide a channel to transport the increased natural gas production from the Permian Basin to emerging market areas along the Texas Gulf Coast. The project is intended to transfer about 2 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of natural gas from the Waha area, Texas, to the U.S. Gulf Coast and Mexico markets, via a 42-inch pipeline of about 430 miles. The project is anticipated to come online by late 2020.Kinder Morgan is also appraising the economic and hydraulic viability of a 48-inch pipeline with increased transportation capacity owing to enhanced interest of producers.The PHP Project will receive natural gas supply from numerous locations, including Kinder Morgan’s, EagleClaw’s and Apache’s existing systems in the Permian Basin with additional interconnections to intrastate and interstate pipeline systems in the Waha area. The PHP Project will hold the supply on Kinder Morgan’s intrastate pipeline systems in the market area.Thereafter, the supply will be delivered to various markets, including the Katy market hub, the Agua Dulce market hub, the Coastal Bend and Kinder Morgan Tejas headers connected to the Freeport LNG export facility, the Cheniere header linked to the Cheniere Corpus Christi LNG export facility as well as several pipelines along the Texas Gulf Coast.Initially, Kinder Morgan and EagleClaw will be equal partners in the PHP Project holding 50% each. Apache, who has been jointly developing the planned project, will have the option to purchase about 33% equity in the project from the initial partners.Apache and EagleClaw will be the primary shippers on the planned pipeline, with Apache proposing to consign about 500,000 dekatherms per day. Kinder Morgan, the operator of the pipeline, will also be responsible for construction.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, Kinder Morgan’s shares have gained 13.5% compared with the industry’s 8.1% rise. Zacks Rank & Key PicksKinder Morgan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the same sector are Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) and China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (SNP  -  Free Report).

24,APA,"The sentiments of investors have changed drastically regarding businesses in the U.S. shale spaces. Oil producers are not in a position to give more focus on drilling in the domestic shale resources as investors are demanding further returns from the explorers, stated John Hess — CEO of Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report).Hess added that since 2017, investor’s current priority has changed to ‘show me the money’, from ‘drill, baby, drill’. Lower focus on production will eventually draw less money toward investment. This will be a serious concern as low long-term capital spending will further reduce production in the coming years.Per our proprietary model, through 2017, the companies belonging to the Zacks U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration industry collectively generated $1.2 billion of net operating cashflows, from which $0.9 billion was allocated toward capital spending. The remaining amount of $239 million was free cashflow, from which only $65 million was paid as dividends to the investors. Hence, investors received 6% of the entire operating cashflows.  It seems that investors are not happy with the percentage of return — considering only dividend payments and excluding share buybacks. In other words, they are asking shale explorers not to spend so much capital for operations.Along with long-term production threat, the U.S. shale players are exposed to limited short-term domestic production possibilities — especially in the Permian Basin — following pipeline bottleneck problems. Producers that are exposed to Permian pipeline bottleneck are Energen Corporation (EGN  -  Free Report), Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) and Noble Energy Inc (NBL  -  Free Report).The Permian region has always been in the spotlight when it comes to oil and natural gas production in the United States. In terms of production, Permian has recorded higher reserve than Anadarko, Appalachia, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Niobrara. From nearly 1 million barrels a day of crude at the beginning of 2009, Permian’s daily production is now heading toward 3.5 million barrels, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).  However, Permian is now facing limited pipeline capacity for transporting oil to Gulf Coast export facilities, major refinery terminals and principal hubs like Cushing. This is because drillers have been pumping out more oil as crude prices are favorable, which exceeds the capacity of the Permian.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

25,APA,"Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) is looking like an interesting pick from a technical perspective, as the company is seeing favorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for APA broke out above the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved higher by 7.5% in the past four weeks.

26,APA,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a large weekly draw on the back of strong refinery runs. As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1.8% (or $1.15) to $66.22 per barrel yesterday.The federal data sparked widespread buying in energy stocks. In fact, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report), Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report) and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, the commodity continues to remain under pressure from reports that top suppliers Saudi Arabia and Russia are likely to step up output amid reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela. As of now, all eyes are on the oil producers’ meeting set for Jun 22 in Vienna, which will decide what happens next regarding their supply curb policy.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 5.9 million barrels for the week ending Jun 15, following a decrease of 4.1 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 3.7 million barrels.Record refinery throughput led to the larger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production remains at 10.9 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 43 of the last 63 weeks and are down more than 80 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 426.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 16% below the year-ago figure and 2% under the five-year average.Moreover, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – fell 1.3 million barrels to 32.6 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 25.2 days in the previous week to 24.5 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.5 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies were up for the fourth time in five weeks as demand weakened. The 3.3 million barrels gain – defying the polled number of one million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 240 million barrels. Following last week’s addition, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product inched closer to the year-earlier level and is 6% over the five-year range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went up 2.7 million barrels last week, again contrary to analysts’ expectations for 700,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to lower demand. At 117.4 million barrels, current supplies are 23% below the year-ago level and 14% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1% from the prior week to 96.7% - the highest in 2018.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) may be an excellent selection.

28,APA,"Lilis Energy, Inc. (LLEX  -  Free Report) recently entered into an acreage swap transaction in a bid to upgrade its portfolio in the Permian Basin. The pure-play Permian operator is set to trade its non-operated holdings with 1,500 acres of West Texas land in the Delaware Basin. The company, with which it has entered into the swap deal, has not been undisclosed yet. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, the deal is set for closure by the end of July.The acquired acreage located in Winkler and Loving counties of West Texas will add more than 100 operated locations in its core holdings in the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring zones; thereby boosting the company’s working interest in the Delaware Basin by about 35%. The Houston-based upstream player will hold more than 19,000 acres in the prolific Delaware Basin. The deal will lead to immediate increase in its proved developed and undeveloped reserves.The company expects the added assets to be highly accretive and support long-lateral developments. The transaction advances the company closer to its 2018 production target of 7,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which it now expects to surpass before the year-end.Lilis Energy has been working to boost its acreage in the lucrative Delaware basin since quite some time. In March 2018, it closed a $65 million acquisition that added around 2,798 acres to its core holdings.

29,APA,"It was a week where oil prices slumped below $70-a-barrel. However, natural gas futures edged closer to the psychologically important $3 level.On the news front, energy major Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) made a significant discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, while natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report) took the final investment decision to construct a third liquefication unit at its Corpus Christi export terminal in Texas.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 4.9% to close at $67.88 per barrel, natural gas prices rose some 3.2% to $2.939 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: TOTAL's Oman MOU, Rex Energy's Bankruptcy & More)The U.S. oil benchmark posted its first weekly loss in almost a month on fears of supply increase, bearish EIA inventory numbers, and soaring rig count.Oil futures fell after reports emerged that Saudi Arabia and Russia were in discussion to step up output amid reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela.The commodity was also spooked by the federal government’s EIA report that revealed crude stockpiles climbed by 5.8 million barrels, contrary to market expectations for 1.7 million barrels decline. On a further bearish note, the report revealed that U.S. output edged up 2,000 barrels per day last week to nearly 10.73 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs climbing – this time by 15, the most in more than three months – brought further downside.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved northward last week. Apart from the weekly inventory release showing a smaller-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies, the commodity got a leg up from warm weather forecasts.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Royal Dutch Shell recently discovered a large deepwater well in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GoM), providing a breather to the offshore oil industry of the United States, which has been gasping for breath since the crude downturn. The Dover well — in the Norphlet geologic play in the U.S. GoM — marks the sixth oil and natural gas find that Shell has struck in the region.The company has been focusing on exploration opportunities in the prolific Norphlet play, which will be moored by its multibillion-dollar offshore project Appomattox, production from which is expected to commence before 2019 end.The Dover well, drilled in Mississippi Canyon about 170 miles offshore southeast of New Orleans, is located in 7,500 feet of water. It was drilled to a depth of 29,000 feet vertically. The prospect lies 13 miles from the Appomattox project that was completed and launched into GoM earlier this month. The new discovery is thus poised for further drilling and development through potential tiebacks to Appomattox rather than building new platforms, which will in turn result in cost savings for the company.Notably, Appomattox is the first major deepwater project authorized by Shell since the oil slump. In fact, since then only two other projects — namely Mad Dog Phase 2 and Vito — have been going forward in the Gulf platforms. (Read more Offshore Industry Gets Respite from Shell's New GoM Find)2.    Cheniere Energy recently gave its final approval regarding the construction of its third liquefaction unit or Train 3 at its Corpus Christi export terminal in Texas. The approval of the project marks the first final investment decision on the new LNG project in the United States since 2015. Building of the third train will be handed over to contractor Bechtel Oil, Gas and Chemicals, Inc., which had started with its initial construction in late 2017.Notably, under the Corpus Christi LNG project, the company intends to develop three trains each having a nominal production capacity of 4.5 million metric tons per year of LNG. The first two trains are expected to come online next year.However, the cost and timeline of the third train has not yet been disclosed and its construction is likely to take around four years. Cheniere’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Cheniere Corpus Christi Holdings has credit facilities worth $6.1 billion, which are likely to be utilized to finance a portion of the construction and operation of the trains.Further, Cheniere Energy intends to develop seven midscale liquefaction trains adjacent to the Corpus Christi project. The company has also initiated the regulatory approval process regarding the same. The total production capacities of these trains are expected to be approximately 9.5 million tons per annum. (Read more Cheniere Green Lights Train 3 of Corpus Christi Project)3.    Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) recently inked the unconventional gas stimulation services three-year contract with Saudi Aramco, in a bid to unleash a natural gas revolution in Saudi Arabia. Per the deal, the oilfield services major will provide project management, hydraulic fracturing and well intervention services to meet Saudi Aramco’s production targets and improve the economics of its unconventional resources program. The program mainly covers three regions, namely Northern Kingdom, South Ghawar and Jafurah Basin.Though Saudi Aramco is the world’s top exporter of oil, Saudi Arabia also has a huge natural gas potential, holding the world’s fifth-largest gas reserves. By 2026, the government aims to produce some 651 billion cubic meters of natural gas per day -- almost double its current output.However, much of it is difficult to recover from shale rock and tight sand. Hence, the company intends to utilize Halliburton’s specialized technological services to tap into those resources.The contract will boost Saudi Aramco’s efforts to spur natural gas production for meeting the domestic needs as well as shoring up its evolving chemical industry, by providing the essential raw materials. The state-run company also intends to reduce its practice of burning oil for domestic power, thus freeing up more barrels for exports. Notably, over the past year, Saudi Aramco has awarded $4.5 billion worth contracts to international oil service companies, for increasing the country’s gas output.4.    Cimarex Energy Company (XEC  -  Free Report) has inked a purchase and sale agreement with Callon Petroleum Company to divest oil and gas properties located in Ward County, TX. The sale is expected to raise cash proceeds of about $570 million.Production from these properties, majority of which has been derived from the Bone Spring formation, is about 6,831 barrels of oil equivalent per day (73% oil). Net Wolfcamp acreage of about 18,925 is undeveloped. The transaction is likely to close in the third quarter of 2018.This sale reflects Cimarex Energy’s strategy to consistently upgrade and optimize its portfolio. Cimarex Energy was among the first horizontal operators in the Bone Spring formation in Ward County. The area has delivered good returns over the years. However, the remaining Wolfcamp prospects require more capital compared with other projects. (Read more Cimarex Energy to Divest Ward County Assets for $570M)5.    Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD  -  Free Report) has signed a natural gas liquids (NGL) transportation deal with Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report).Per the accord, the Shin Oak pipeline of Enterprise Products will likely be utilized by Apache for carrying NGL from the Alpine High project to the storage facility of the partnership in Mont Belvieu, TX.In the Delaware Basin’s Alpine High discovery, Apache’s presence spreads over 336,000 net acres. The company is willing to transport all produced NGL from the resources through the Shin Oak pipeline. The partnership has committed to transport at least 205,000 barrels of NGL daily through the pipeline.Investors should know that the Shin Oak pipeline, which is being built by Enterprise Products, will spread over roughly 658 miles to the NGL fractionation and storage unit in Mont Belvieu, TX, from Reeves County. The construction of the Shin Oak pipeline will likely close by the second quarter of 2019. Enterprise Products projects the initial daily liquid transportation capacity of the pipeline at 550,000 barrels.The latest transportation commitment will likely provide Enterprise Products with steady fee-based revenues. Apache will also gain as the pipeline will help the company to persistently transport its growing production from the prospective Alpine High prospect.(Read more Enterprise Products, Apache Sign NGL Transportation Accord)Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months.CompanyLast Week Last 6 MonthsXOM-3.2%-4.3%CVX-4.4%+4.3%COP-5.9%+28.7%OXY-3.5%+17.9%SLB-7.7%+10.4%RIG-10.1%+23.6%VLO-1.5%+42.5%MPC-3.2%+34.3%Reflecting the week’s negative oil market sentiment, the Energy Select Sector SPDR – a popular way to track energy companies – generated a -4.5% return last week.

Investors should also note that Transocean hasn’t missed earnings estimates since 2013.Transocean Ltd. Price and Consensus  Transocean Ltd. Price and Consensus | Transocean Ltd. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence the QuarterPer EIA data, the commodity rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at $64.87 per barrel. In fact, the first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite a record high domestic production. Crude was supported by various catalysts including strong demand, and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies. The recovering commodity market calls for higher investments from oil majors, translating into more contracts from drilling giants like Transocean.The acquisition of Norwegian contractor, Songa Offshore has boosted the backlog and sales of Transocean, and enhanced its long-term opportunities in the Norwegian markets. Transocean’s strong backlog, which stands at $12.5 billion, reflects steady demand from its customers. It enables Transocean to navigate the current uncertain environment, better than many of its peers.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for contract drilling revenues is pegged at $602 million, above $589 million recorded in the last reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating revenues from the Harsh Environment Floaters is $193 million, higher than the prior-year quarter’s figure of $122 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating revenues from Midwater Floaters is $18 million, higher than the year-ago quarter’s $13 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Deepwater Floaters is pegged at $36.30 million, compared with $35 million reported in the year-ago period.We also appreciate Transocean's aggressive cost-reduction programs, which will enable it to shore up its operational performance. The company’s total operating expenses in 2017 declined 26% to stand at $1,388 million.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Transocean is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for this company is +2.64%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Transocean carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have significantly higher chances of beating estimates. On the other hand, Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Other Energy Stocks With Favorable CombinationTransocean is not the only energy firm looking up this earnings season. Here are some other companies within the same industry, which according to our model also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.38% and a Zacks Rank #3. The upstream player is anticipated to release earnings on May 2.NOW Inc. (DNOW  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +15.29% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. The energy equipment maker is expected to release earnings results on May 2.Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +12.96% and a Zacks Rank #3.

31,APA,"Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 27.In the preceding three-month period, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 42.52%. However, the bottom line improved significantly from the year-ago period on the back of rebounding commodity prices and production gains. The company also has an impressive earnings surprise history, surpassing estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 7.41%.Chevron Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Chevron Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Chevron Corporation QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.43 for the first quarter has been revised downward by 5 cents in the last seven days. However, the estimate of $1.43 reflects year-over-year growth of 1.4%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $38,737. for the first quarter, up 16% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayPer EIA data, crude oil rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to end the quarter at $64.87 per barrel. In fact, the first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark to attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite a record high domestic production. Crude was supported by various catalysts including strong demand, and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies. The upstream segment of Shell is likely to benefit from higher crude price realizations.The upstream segment of Chevron is also expected to realize the benefits of higher production volumes on the back of major capital projects including Gorgon, and core developments in the Gulf of Mexico and Permian Basin. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter’s total international output is 2,143 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d), compared with $2,004 MBOE/d in the prior-year quarter. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the total quarterly U.S. output is also pegged higher at 693 MBOE/d, compared with the year-ago output of 672 MBOE/d. As such, income from the upstream segment for the to-be-reported quarter is estimated to be $2,593 million compared with $1,517 million in the prior-year quarter.However, the downstream segment is likely to bear the brunt of lower refinery input per day. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total refinery input is estimated to decline to $1,633 thousand barrels per day(Mbbl/d) in the quarter under review compared with $1,665 Mbbl/d in the year-ago quarter. As such, according to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the segmental income is expected to deteriorate to $865 million versus $926 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Chevron is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat EarningsWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Shell, one can consider firms from the energy space having the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.38% and a Zacks Rank #3.

32,APA,"Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 26.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.96% on the back of rebounding commodity prices and cost-cut initiatives. Notably, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history, surpassing estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 9.34%. Investors are keeping their fingers crossed, expecting the Anglo-Dutch giant to top earnings estimate this time too.Royal Dutch Shell PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Royal Dutch Shell PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Royal Dutch Shell PLC Quote The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22 for the first quarter has been revised upward by 8 cents in the last seven days. The estimate of $1.22 also reflects a year-over-year decline of 48.8%.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that are likely to influence Shell’s earnings this quarter.Factors at PlayPer EIA data, crude oil rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to end the quarter at $64.87 per barrel. In fact, the first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark to attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite a record high domestic production. Crude was supported by various catalysts including strong demand, and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies. The upstream segment of Shell is likely to benefit from higher crude price realizations.Last month, the company also raised the outlook for its downstream segment, which is poised for strong growth over the coming years. Shell plans to make a yearly investment of around $7-$9 billion in its downstream segment, forecasting a return on average capital employed of more than 15%. Importantly, the Chemicals business, which had a record year in 2017, is set to be the driving factor for the downstream business of the company.Shell’s $50-billion buyout of BG Group has boosted its strong and diversified portfolio of global energy businesses that offer promising long-term growth opportunities. We appreciate the company’s cost-reduction initiatives and efficiency gains. Last quarter, Shell raked in $6,610 million free cash flow compared with $5,741 million a year ago. The trend is expected to continue and drive the financials of the company.Moreover, Shell, which remains focused on reorienting and re-strategizing its portfolio, entered into various divestment deals this quarter — including the sale of Borssele wind project, coal gasification technology unit, West Qurna 1, Majnoon Field and a few others — to offload its non-core assets and buoy finances.Though these deals will strengthen financials and credit metrics of the company, it might affect volume growth adversely. As it is, Shell's fourth-quarter 2017 oil and gas production declined sequentially as well as from the year-ago period.Further, per EIA, prices of natural gas — which accounts for more than 40% of Shell’s total volumes — suffered a decline of 7.4% to end the quarter at $2.73 per million British thermal units, which can adversely impact the overall revenues.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Shell is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

34,APA,"Investors in Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Apr 20, 2018 $65.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Apache shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Apache is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry that ranks in the Bottom 35% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while three have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 39 cents per share to 40 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Apache right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

35,APA,"It was a week where oil rebounded to levels not seen since January but natural gas futures settled down further.On the news front, European supermajor Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) sold its entire stake in Iraq’s West Qurna 1 oilfield to a Japanese firm for $406 million, while independent explorer Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) made a significant oil discovery in the North Sea.Overall, it was another mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained around 5.6% to close at $65.88 per barrel, natural gas prices fell 3.6% to $2.591 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Shell Quits New Zealand, Statoil to Become Equinor)The U.S. oil benchmark jumped above the psychologically important $65 per barrel level last week following the release of EIA crude inventory numbers, renewed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Fed announcement on interest rates.The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 2.6 million barrels for the week ending Mar 16. Stockpiles have shrunk in 36 of the last 50 weeks and are down more than 105 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 428.3 million barrels, current crude supplies are 19.7% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.Apart from the bullish government data, oil prices were also supported by growing concerns over tensions between major crude producers Iran and Saudi Arabia. There is widespread speculation that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ongoing state visit to Washington is aimed at ramping up pressure to reimpose sanctions on Iran. Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters.Finally, oil prices were also supported by the Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates. As widely expected, the U.S. central bank opted to hike the benchmark lending rate a quarter-point to between 1.5% and 1.75%. This led to dollar weakness that made the greenback-priced crude more affordable for investors holding foreign currency.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved lower last week following a smaller-than-expected decrease in supplies. The 86 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was also below last year’s net shrinkage of 137 Bcf for the reported week. The continued strength in production also played spoilsport.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Royal Dutch Shell plc is set to offload its entire stake in Iraq-based West Qurna 1 oil field through a $406 million deal, moving ahead with its divestment goals. This represents the second international divestment deal that the company announced in a week after declaring its intention to exit New Zealand by selling its portfolio of energy assets in a $578 million deal.Per the latest divestment deal, the Anglo-Dutch supermajor will vend 19.6% interest in the West Qurna 1 oil field to Japan's Itochu Corp. According to the agreement, Itochu will assume a debt of $144 million. The deal has already received necessary regulatory approvals and is scheduled for completion within a next few days.The move will help Shell proceed with its $30-billion divestment program. The deal provides the company with a major uplift in its drive to decrease debt following the acquisition of BG Group for $47 billion. The divestment is expected to reduce the company’s cost and enhance cash flow as well as return to capital.2.    Apache Corp. recently announced that it has made an oil discovery at its Garten prospect on Block 9/18a Area-W of the North Sea. The significant finding falls in the United Kingdom sector, near the Beryl Alpha Platform, where the independent energy company is focused for future potential.The Garten prospect encountered more than 700 feet of net oil pay in its reservoirs. Per the company, the recoverable resource from the prospect can surpass 10 million barrels of light oil - at the upper-end mark of its pre-drill measures. Apache owns a 100% working interest in the prospect. The new find is the 2500th exploration well off the coast in the UK Continental Shelf. Apache has used modern data and technologies to discover new possibilities in the area, per its latest efforts to improve capital efficiency.Notably, the latest discovery is Apache's fourth commercial find in the Beryl region in the preceding three years. The well, located 6 kilometers south of the Beryl Alpha platform, will be tied back to the facility. This is in line with the company’s strategy of focusing on exploration near its already operated fields to avoid the long cycle time of large-scale projects. Apache is working with the U.K. Oil and Gas Authority for achieving regulatory approvals of production in the Garten prospect, which is expected in 2019's first quarter. (Read more Apache Finds Oil at Garten Prospect in UK North Sea)3.    SandRidge Energy, Inc. , an oil and gas player, recently aborted plans to merge with Tulsa-based rival Midstates Petroleum Company, in an all-stock deal. Last month, Midstates Petroleum had made the proposal to merge with SandRidge after the latter dropped its plan to acquire Colorado-based Bonanza, Creek Energy, Inc. following intense opposition from its shareholders.Had the deal been finalized, it surely would have improved the scale and value for both the players by creating one of the largest entities in the Mississippian Lime shale formation, as both the companies have a strong presence in the region. However, the merger would entail a significant risk as Mississippi Lime requires much higher commodity prices to prove highly productive.The company is skeptical about Midstates’ reserves, and the economic feasibility of drilling locations at current oil and gas prices. Further, SandRidge believes that the merger is not likely to unlock substantial synergies unless the company employs Midstates’ assets with high operational efficiency. As such, SandRidge does not support Midstates’ estimate that the merger would result in free cash flows of $320-$400 million over the next four years. The company thus views the collaboration as highly dilutive and not in the best interests of shareholders. (Read more SandRidge Nixes Merger Plan With Midstates Petroleum)4.    PetroChina Company Ltd. (PTR  -  Free Report) recently received stakes in two offshore oil concessions from the national oil company of UAE, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (""ADNOC""), for a total consideration of $1.18 billion. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Chinese oil company signed the agreements that have a term of 40 years. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Per the deal, PetroChina paid a fee of $600 million for a 10% stake in the Lower Zakum concession, and $575 million for 10% interest in the Umm Shaif and Nassr concession. While operator ADNOC retains the majority shares (60%) in both the concessions, other oil companies are also present in the projects.Crude production capacity from the Umm Shaif field combined with the Nasr field is 460,000 barrels per day. ADNOC intends to reduce Abu Dhabi’s dependency on imported gas by processing 500 million standard cubic feet of gas per day from the Umm Shaif for the rising domestic energy demand.(Read more PetroChina Buys Oil Stakes in UAE for $1.18 Billion)5.    BP p.l.c. (BP  -  Free Report) has selected Susan Dio as the chairman and president of its vast operations in the United States.The British energy giant manages a large-scale business in the United States including both upstream and downstream activities. The company also focuses on renewable energies in the country. Notably, since 2005, the company has hitherto spent more than $100 billion for all its U.S activities.With Susan Dio’s election, BP is going to hand over the reins of responsibility of its vital US operations to a woman for the first time. During 2017, the company’s businesses in the United States contributed to $88.7 billion, representing nearly 34% of the total sales and other operating revenues.

40,APA,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices logged gains.On the news front, upstream energy biggies Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) and Devon Energy Corp. (DVN  -  Free Report) came up with their respective earnings reports, while natural gas operator EQT Corp. (EQT  -  Free Report) announced plans to separate its midstream business into a new publicly traded company.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 3.3% to close at $63.55 per barrel, while natural gas prices increased 3.9% to $2.657 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Occidental, Williams, Marathon Report Strong Q4)The U.S. oil benchmark scored its second consecutive weekly bump. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded a surprise drop.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 35 of the last 46 weeks and are down more than 110 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall – stemming from a combination of lower imports and spiraling exports – has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 420.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 18.9% below the year-ago period.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved higher last week following a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. The improvement was primarily on account of strength in the commodity’s production amid the upcoming conclusion to the winter heating season.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Concho Resources reported strong fourth-quarter results on the back of higher commodity price realizations and robust production growth. The independent energy explorer came out with net earnings per share of 66 cents, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. The bottom line also improved significantly from the prior-year quarter adjusted income of 20 cents per share.Concho Resources' average quarterly volume increased 28% year over year to 211 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (exceeding the high-end of the company’s guidance range), of which 61.6% was liquids. Overall, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company fetched $40.18 per barrel compared with $34.70 a year ago. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Concho Resources has provided a preliminary guidance for 2018. The company expects its total production to grow 16-20%, with crude oil growth about 20%. The upstream player forecasts its output to grow at 20% CAGR over the 2017-2020 timeframe. Capital expenditures for 2018 are estimated to be around $2 billion. (Read more Concho's Q4 Earnings Top on Price, Output Gains)2.    Devon Energy reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 38 cents, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents by 36.7%. The underperformance primarily stemmed from an accounting change and lower-than-expected production volumes, partly offset by higher realized prices.In the fourth quarter of 2017, total production touched 548,000 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day. The actual production was lower than the expected range of 551,000-571,000 Boe per day. Meanwhile, realized oil prices in the quarter were $42.21 per barrel, up 20.9% from $34.90 per barrel in the year-ago quarter. Realized prices for natural gas were up 11.2% to $2.48 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) from $2.23 per Mcf in the prior-year quarter.Devon estimates total production from its assets in the first quarter of 2018 in the range of 530,000-554,000 Boe per day. Full-year production is expected in the range of 552,000-576,000 Boe per day. Capital expenditure (capex) in the first quarter of 2018 is anticipated within $585-$700 million. 2018 capex is expected in the range of $2.33-$2.61 billion.(Read more Devon's Q4 Earnings Lag Estimates, Expands Reserves)3.    Natural gas producer EQT Corporation’s board of directors has finally succumbed to months of pressure from investors and agreed to separate the company's upstream and midstream businesses. It will form an independent publicly traded company (NewCo), whose operations will focus on the midstream businesses of EQT. The deal is devised to be tax-free for the company's shareholders, who will retain their EQT shares and receive a pro-rata share of the NewCo.The spin-off is expected to enable the company to concentrate on its upstream assets, and exploration and production business. The deal will leave EQT with 680,000 core Marcellus acres and 65,000 Ohio Utica acres.With the shale production to ramp up in the coming quarters, this move can help the company benefit largely through efficient allocation of capital, compared with the previous company set-up that constrained the company's returns in the recent years. Additionally, $2.3-$2.8 billion of free cash flow over the 2019-2023 timeframe is expected to trickle down from the move, which forecasts 10-15% annual production growth. (Read more Will EQT's Spin-Off of Midstream Businesses Prove Beneficial?)4.    U.S. energy firm Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter earnings per share – excluding one-time items – of 33 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents. The bottom line also turned around from the year-ago adjusted loss of 6 cents. The outperformance stems from higher oil realizations, and lower cost.The production of oil and natural gas (excluding divested assets and non-controlling interests) averaged 362,251 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d) (68% liquids), essentially flat from last year. The company aims to grow production by 7-13% in the next year. The average realized crude oil price during the fourth quarter was $58.36 per barrel, representing an increase of 23.1% from the year-ago realization of $47.39.Apache’s fourth quarter lease operating expenses totaled $334 million, down 10.9% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, total costs and expenses fell 16.4% from the fourth quarter of 2016 to $1,308 million. (Read more: Apache Posts Q4 Earnings Beat on Oil Price, Cost Cuts)5.    U.S. gas exporter Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report) reported strong fourth-quarter results on robust production volumes and strong pricing. The company’s net income per share came in at 54 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents and the comparable 2016 period profit of 48 cents.During the quarter, the company shipped 70 cargoes from Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas terminal in Louisiana. Total volumes lifted in the reported quarter were 252 trillion British thermal units.Overall costs and expenses soared 190% to $1,305 million from the same quarter last year. The increase is mainly attributed to the higher cost of sales which jumped to $980 million compared with $229 million in the prior-year quarter, while operating and maintenance expenses rose 87.7% year-over-year to $137 million.Cheniere Energy raised its EBITDA guidance for full-year 2018 following the better-than-expected profit. The upbeat forecast reflects higher-than-anticipated realized margins on marketing volumes. The adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $2,000 million and $2,200 million, compared to the prior guidance of anything between $1,900 million and $2,100 million.Meanwhile, distributable cash flow is likely to be between $200 million and $400 million, in line with the previous prediction.

43,APA,"Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 22, before the market opens.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 180% by reporting adjusted earnings of 4 cents per share against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 5 cents. The outperformance stemmed from higher oil and gas realizations, and lower costs.However, as far as earnings surprise history is concerned, the Houston, TX-based upstream operator is on a bit of a slippery ground, posting an average negative earnings surprise of 23.33% in the trailing four quarters.Apache Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Apache Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Apache Corporation Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Which Way Are Estimates Headed?Let’s look at the estimate revision trend to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents for the fourth quarter has been revised upward by a penny in the last 30 days. It reflects growth of almost 135% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,545 million for the quarter, up 6.5% from the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayWhile we believe that improving realized prices will enhance the earnings of the company, Apache’s tepid production growth from the international operations keep us on the sidelines.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total daily production is pegged at 441 thousand oil-equivalent barrels (MBOE), lower than 448 MBOE/d and 490 MBOE/d reported in the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter respectively.In fact, last month the company released a drab production update for the fourth quarter owing to weaker-than-expected performance of some of its projects in the North Sea. The company currently expects fourth-quarter production values from international operations to be in the range of 138,000-140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) compared with prior forecast levels of 150,000-160,000 BOE/d. This compares unfavorably with 144 BOE/d and 158 BOE/d levels recorded in the last quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.Nevertheless, the company expects its output in the United States to be at the high end of its guidance range of 218,000-224,000 BOE/d for the fourth quarter driven by strong performance in the Permian shale play. However, the total production is likely to be hurt owing to international shortfall.As it is, the company has been bearing the brunt of contracting production volumes in all of the last three reported quarters. From January to September 2017, Apache’s production averaged 345,495 BOE/d, down 13% from the first nine months of 2016.Nevertheless, Apache expects improved realized prices to offer respite amid the declining volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average price of oil in the Permian Basin — where Apache’s operations are primarily focused — is expected to improve 8.2% from the year-ago quarter to stand at $49.55 a barrel. Further, the analysts polled by Zacks also envision a year-over-year increase of 5.3% and 44% in the realized prices of natural gas and natural gas liquids respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model too does not conclusively show that Apache will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -10.80%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 18 cents, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents.Zacks Rank: Apache carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes a surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks With Favorable CombinationThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for Apache, here are some firms from the energy space you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Keane Group, Inc. (FRAC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.36% and a Zacks Rank #1. The company is likely to release fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 26.

46,APA,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices logged handsome gains.On the news front, Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) agreed to acquire a 43.8% stake in Silicon Ranch – a solar energy company, while upstream players Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) and Encana Corp. (ECA  -  Free Report) provided updates regarding their fourth-quarter production outlook.Overall, it was a bullish week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 4.7% to close at $64.30 per barrel, while natural gas prices soared nearly 15% to $3.20 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Hess' Oil Find, Petrobras' $2.95B Settlement & More)Building on its second annual gain in a row, oil prices maintained its solid start to the New Year. The second week of 2018 saw U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest closing since December 2014. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another higher-than-expected weekly draw. On a further bullish note, domestic oil production snapped its steadily rising trend and fell for the second time since October.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 32 of the last 40 weeks and are down almost 114 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 419.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 13.2% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015.Meanwhile, natural gas – one of 2017’s worst-performing commodities – registered a big jump following a record decrease in supplies. The massive, 359 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was blamed on strong demand due to freezing temperatures over bulk of the country.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    In a bid to bolster its renewable energy business, Royal Dutch Shell recently inked a deal to acquire a 43.8% stake in Silicon Ranch Corporation from Partners Group. The deal will help Shell leverage its position as one of the top three wholesale power sellers in the United States along with boosting its New Energies division.Silicon Ranch is a leading solar energy company in the United States and the deal will make Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Shell its largest stakeholder. Silicon Ranch operates around 100 solar facilities across the United States, having about 1.9 gigawatts of solar-based power facilities in its development portfolio. Per the deal, the company will continue to operate under its existing management and retain its brand. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The transaction could be valued up to $217 million in cash, contingent on Silicon Ranch’s performance. Subject to regulatory approvals and satisfactory closing conditions, the deal is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2018. Further, the deal also provides Shell an opportunity to increase its stake in Silicon Ranch after 2021.

Houston-based upstream player estimates fourth-quarter production from international operations to miss the prior guidance — provided in October 2017 — owing to weaker-than-expected performance of some of its projects in the North Sea.The company currently expects the fourth quarter production values from international operations to be in the range of 138,000-140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) compared with its prior forecast levels of 150,000-160,000 BOE/d. Unexpected shutdown of Forties Pipeline System and underperformance of wells in the Beryl area have been the primary factors for the lower forecast. Nevertheless, Apache expects improved realized prices to offer respite amid the declining volumes.As it is, the company has been bearing the brunt of contracting production volumes in all the last three reported quarters. From January to September 2017, Apache’s production averaged 345,495 BOE/d, down 13% from the first nine months of 2016. (Read more Apache Stock Down on Production Guidance Cut for Q4)3.    Shares of Encana moved up around 2.5% to eventually close the day at $13.64 on Jan 9 after the company announced that fourth-quarter production volumes from core assets beat estimates. The upstream operator has successfully repositioned its asset base and shifted focus to four key growth areas namely Montney, Duvemay, Eagle Ford and Permian.On the back of the strength of core assets, Canadian energy behemoth delivered year-over-year production growth of approximately 31% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Further, the output also topped the high end of the company’s guidance range of 25-30%.While the exact total production figures have not been released, an increase of around 31% implies that the output from the core assets jumped to around 310,601 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) in the fourth quarter of 2017 as against the 237,100 BOE/d (or 74% of the total production) recorded in the year-ago quarter. (Read more Encana Gains as Output From Key Assets Tops Estimates in Q4)4.    The Williams Companies, Inc.’s (WMB  -  Free Report) Constitution Pipeline project recently suffered a major setback when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) refused to rescind New York’s denial of a water permit to the project. The ruling has come as a blow to pipeline developers’ endeavors to transport additional natural gas to New England, which relies heavily on pipeline imports from Canada and overseas.Williams Companies applied for the water permit in August 2013. However, the company withdrew and resubmitted the application twice, which led to the resetting of the one-year deadline by New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). In 2016, the DEC announced its decision not to grant the water permit to Williams Companies.From Interestingly, the project had received FERC’s approval in early 2016. However, the DEC denied issuing a water quality permit to the pipeline claiming that the owners of the project and the FERC did not analyze the environmental impacts of the project adequately and the pipeline will possibly impact over 250 streams adversely.

The transaction with an effective date of Oct 1, 2017, is scheduled to close in the first quarter of 2018, and is subject to the fulfillment of the necessary closing conditions. The closure of the transaction may be deferred.The proceeds from the transaction will be used for general corporate purposes, including lowering of debt. The sale is in line with its strategy to focus on development of Midland Basin and Eagle Ford assets. Based on this transaction, as of the end of third-quarter 2017, there will be a likely lowering in net debt by about 20% and net debt to EBITDAX ratio to less than three times.

47,APA,"Shares of Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) fell around 3% to eventually close the day at $44.55 on Jan 9 after the company issued drab production outlook for the fourth quarter of 2017. Houston-based upstream player estimates fourth-quarter production from international operations to miss the prior guidance — provided in October 2017 — owing to weaker-than-expected performance of some of its projects in the North Sea. The company currently expects the fourth quarter production values from international operations to be in the range of 138,000-140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) compared with its prior forecast levels of 150,000-160,000 BOE/d. Unexpected shutdown of Forties Pipeline System and underperformance of wells in the Beryl area have been the primary factors for the lower forecast. Nevertheless, Apache expects improved realized prices to offer respite amid the declining volumes.As it is, the company has been bearing the brunt of contracting production volumes in all the last three reported quarters. From January to September 2017, Apache’s production averaged 345,495 BOE/d, down 13% from the first nine months of 2016.   Meanwhile, despite the international shortfall, the oil producer is expected to meet its fourth-quarter production target on the back of its U.S. operations. The company expects its output in the United States to be at the high end of its guidance range of 218,000- 224,000 BOE/d for the fourth quarter driven by strong performance in the Permian shale play. The company expects to have achieved its production target of 25,000 BOE/d at Alpine High.In fact, Apache has been banking on its Alpine High discovery in West Texas to remain afloat in the market, which could be its major growth driver in 2018. Estimated to hold massive oil and natural gas reserves, the wells are expected to drive strong economics and top-tier returns. The company expects to more than double its product portfolio by virtue of its Alpine High shale play in 2018 compared with the last year’s tally as it has initiated drilling operations in more than 5,000 locations. Notably, Apache intends to invest $1 billion in the region in 2018 toward this end.Apache currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of Apache have tumbled 33.8% over a year compared with the industry’s decline of 15.6%. Investors interested in the same space can consider some better-ranked players like Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Denbury Resources, Inc.

48,APA,"In 2017, oil prices recovered significantly. Posting its second annual gain in a row, the commodity closed 2017 up more than 12%. The U.S. oil benchmark ended the year at $60.42 per barrel -- its highest closing since June 2015.However, this wasn’t reflected in the budgeted exploration spending in 2018. The companies are still allocating capital on existing assets and ongoing developments. Oil giants like Anadarko Petroleum and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) have announced exploration budget for 2018, which is lower or almost in line with 2017 figures.For 2018, Anadarko Petroleum announced exploration budget of $350 million, down more than 50% from $770 million in 2017. Chevron’s exploration funding is estimated at $1.1 billion, almost at par with $1 billion in 2017. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The companies are not likely to initiate exploration activities unless they generate larger cash flows with higher oil prices. Only a sustainable rate of above $60 per barrel and robust results of drilling will drive exploration spending in new offshore deepwater frontiers. On the other hand, if the oil prices decline, the companies’ cash flow will be dented. This will compel them to cut exploration budget and defer exploration drilling plans in 2018.Looking Back at 2017In 2017, most of the exploration and production (E&P) companies were struggling to cope with the bumpy oil market ride. While oil prices continue to head higher, they are way off the triple-digit territories of 2014 as prices crashed due to oversupply, the number of finds declined along with the companies’ spending budget.Per oil-and-gas consultancy Rystad Energy, oil discoveries in 2017 totaled approximately 7 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe), whichwas the lowest since the 1940s. Yes, a few more discoveries will be reported later through annual reports but the amount is not expected to increase the total by more than10%.Some Important StatisticsRystad analysis has also found that explorers are finding fewer resources per field. In 2017, an average offshore discovery held about 100 million boe, down from 150 million boe in 2012.In 2006, the so-called reserve replacement ratio – the quantity of proved reserves added to a company's reserve base in a year relative to the amount of oil and gas production – reached 100%. Consequently, it fell to 11% in 2017 from 50% in 2012. It was also reported that the volume of resources per discovered field plunged in 2017.Though the alarming figures indicate toward the depletion of oil reserves, it is also known that major oil producers have emergency reserves. There is a time lag between when an oil firm makes a large discovery and when it's brought online.It should be also considered that low resources per discovered field influence feasibility. Under the current base price scenario, it is estimated that more than1 billion boe discovered during 2017 might never be developed. New Finds to Watch Out For in 2018Guyana – After having spud the Liza discovery in the Stabroek Block in 2016, ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) started the year with the drilling of the Payara-1 well discovery, following up about six months later with news of more oil discovered at Payara. In the meanwhile, the company hit oil for the third time in the block— Snoek.  In October, another discovery —Turbot — brought the total gross recoverable resources on the block to an estimated 2.75 billion barrels of oil equivalent (Bboe).Currently, ExxonMobil is drilling the latest well offshore Guyana in the Stabroek Block — Ranger-1 — and plans to continue operations in 2018 in the multiple leads already identified. The company has made five discoveries offshore Guyana in the same Stabroek Block.In 2018, two other blocks in Guyana anticipated to be spud are the Tullow-operated Orinduik Block and the Repsol-operated Kanuku Block. In September 2017, 3-D survey acquisition was completed in Orinduik, while Total SA (TOT  -  Free Report) inked an option agreement with Eco Atlantic to obtain a 25% working interests of the block. In 2017, 3-D survey acquisition was also concluded in the Kanuku Block. Kanuku is seen as a good prospect for medium-sized discoveries by Repsol.Brazil – More activity is expected offshore Brazil, which is another area which will witness activity in 2018.Subject to securing regulatory permits, work on Total’s Foz do Amazonas (Mouth of the Amazon) well, is also expected to progress. In 2017, an application to drill was rejected by the environmental regulator Ibama citing lack of information. Per the environmentalists and scientists, the well is in close proximity to the Amazon reef. Moreover, good prospects are anticipated from Espirito Santo basin, which is likely to be drilled by Petrobras.Mexico – Several companies like Pemex, Total and Talos Energy are thronging this region. Mexico state-run Pemex is looking at the Yaxxtaab-1 wild cat in the shallow waters of the Campeche Basin, offshore Mexico. It is known to be the first pre-salt well offshore Mexico. The company is known for to having made the biggest onshore oil find 15 years back when the Ixachi well struck oil in Veracruz. Initially, the volumes were estimated at about 1.5 Bboe. Total intends to develop a wildcat in the Perdido Fold Belt.Moreover, Talos Energy and partners Sierra Oil and Gas and Premier Oil also struck an estimated 2 billion barrels of light oil in shallow water offshore Mexico with Zama-1 well.Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) also raised resource estimates of the Amoca Field to 1 Bboe in place and the Area 1 estimated resource base to 1.3 billion barrels of oil in place.Aruba – a wild cat well is proposed to be drilled by Repsol off this small Caribbean Island.Namibia – In September, Tullow Oil is planning to initiate drilling on the Cormorant prospect in the Walvis Basin, offshore Namibia. While it would not be the largest well, a discovery in Namibia is considered important.Senegal – BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) will commence drilling in the Requin-Tigre (Tiger Shark) well, with Kosmos, outboard of the Tortue discovery. The find is estimated to have a potential of 60 trillion cubic feet (Tcf).South Africa – Total is to start drilling a wild cat well offshore South Africa using the Deep sea Stavanger.West Africa’s Mauritania and Senegal – The region is largely unexplored. It was only after Cairn Energy and Kosmos Energy, which made huge discoveries, that oil majors like BP, ExxonMobil and others were attracted to this region. In 2016, BP partnered with Kosmos Energy in Senegal. ExxonMobil is about to ink a deal to explore oil and gas offshore Mauritania. Total bought new deepwater acreages in Mauritania in 2017. Tullow and Kosmos Energy have been present in the area for long.  The region is likely to witness active exploration and drilling in 2018.Gambia – In late 2018, FAR intends to drill the Samo prospect. It is believed that the properties of Samoare similar to the SNE field, in Senegal. It will be the only exploration well to be drilled offshore the Gambia since the Jammah-1 well was drilled in 1979.Morocco – Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, Eni intends to drill the Rabat Deep Offshore license offshore Morocco using the Saipem 12,000 drillship.Nova Scotia – Beginning in the spring of 2018, BP proposes to drill a single exploration well, in the Scotia Basin, offshore Nova Scotia, Canada. BP will use the semisubmersible West Aquarius to drill the prospect, which is estimated to take 120 days.Norway – In 2017, Statoil ASA  drilling of the Korpfjell prospect was unsuccessful. The company plans to test another reservoir in the same prospect during 2018. Other players like Aker BP and Lundin are also active in Barents Sea offshore Norway but the drilling results were very unsatisfactory in 2017. The companies propose to carry on exploration in 2018.Suriname – In 2017, the region saw active exploration drilling but the companies like Tullow and Apache (APA  -  Free Report) did not attain any success yet. Kosmos Energy owns two blocks — 42 and 45 — in Suriname and proposes to drill two prospects. Apache intends to drill another exploration Block 58, where a 3-D survey was done earlier this year.In 2017, ExxonMobil and Statoil purchased Block 59 and Block 60, respectively. In Suriname, ExxonMobil plans to start initial exploration activities.Eastern Mediterranean Sea — Encouraged by the big Zohr gas discovery in the Mediterranean Sea offshore Egypt, Eni and other oil companies are expected to continue to drill for the next big find in the area, especially offshore Egypt and Cyprus. In Cyprus, Total and Eni plan to drill in Block 6 in 2018, and QP and ExxonMobil plan to drill in Block 10 in 2018.Other areas include Montenegro, Cyprus and Portugal, where Eni is planning to drill. Total is also reviewing Papua New Guinea.In March, Repsol and partner Armstrong Energy encountered a massive oil find in the Nanushuk Play, located in Alaska’s North Slope. The companies claimed that the discovery was the biggest U.S. onshore conventional hydrocarbons discovery in three decades with 1.2 billion barrels of recoverable light oil.Bottom LineWith so many prospects lined up for drilling, we believe oil supply will remain unharmed going forward. But the companies spending will largely impact the outcome, which again will depend on the sustainable oil rate of above $60 per barrel.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

49,APA,"Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report), with a large geographically diversified reserve base, has been bearing the brunt of contracting production volumes and weak cash flows. Shares of Apache have declined 33.8% in a year compared with the industry’s decline of 15.6% and the S&P 500 index’s rally of 18.2%.The company has also reported an average negative earnings surprise of 23.33% in the trailing four quarters.However, it’s not the end of the road for Apache and the company has been leaning on its Alpine High discovery to remain afloat in the market, which could be its major growth driver in 2018.Now let’s delve deep into the troubles looming over this Texas-based upstream energy player and see if its strategic endeavors can help it turn around in the year ahead.Major Deterrents to Apache’s Growth StoryThe three-year oil industry downturn due to the global supply glut had hit Apache hard. The company had to slash its spending and capex budget over the last two years to realign itself with the changed dynamics. This led to lower production in all the three quarters this year and marred the company’s earnings for the first two quarters. The company’s most recent adjusted quarterly output was 7% lower than the year-ago level.From January to September, Apache’s production averaged 345,495 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), down 13% from the first nine months of 2016. The effect of the commodity price slump already hit Apache’s bottom line as the energy explorer did not hedge production to ward off risks.However, with the improving commodity price environment, Apache intends to tap the growth opportunities by increasing its capital investment. With high-yielding growth in mind, Apache announced 2017 capital budget of $3.1 billion, representing 60% increase over its 2016 spending. Nonetheless, the company has not been able to generate a strong cash flow from operations to meet its capex budget unlike other oil producers, which have successfully covered their capex and dividends with the internally generated cash flows.Last quarter, Apache generated $554 million in cash flow compared with a capital investment of $843 million. In the first nine months of 2017, Apache recorded a cash flow deficit of $334 million after incurring capital expenditures.Moreover, Apache is burdened with a high leverage ratio of 53.1%, restricting its financial flexibility and limiting growth in process. The company is compelled to rely on its asset sales to generate funds to clear all debts along with funding capex and dividend payments.Can Alpine High Play Offer Respite in 2018?We consider Apache's Alpine High discovery in West Texas a vital game changer. Estimated to hold massive oil and natural gas reserves, the wells are expected to drive strong economics and top-tier returns.Moreover, Apache has been focused on streamlining its portfolio and strategically redeploying capital to reap maximum value opportunities.In this regard, the company has already departed from its high-cost Canadian operations to increase focus on the Permian basin, known for its high internal rates of return and low costs. Alpine High particularly looks very promising and boasts thousands of highly economic drilling locations.It is likely to aid the company to drive crude production. Apache’s production volumes are expected to ramp up its growth profile, primarily from its US assets, mainly driven by Alpine High and Midland Basin. The company expects to more than double its product portfolio by virtue of its Alpine High shale play in 2018 compared with the last year’s tally as it begins to tap more than 5,000 drilling locations.The company also plans to rapidly develop and deploy infrastructure assets at Alpine High in 2018 with a view to support its production growth.  Having spent around $389 million on developing Alpine High’s midstream assets in the nine months ending Sep 30, 2017, Apache intends to invest $1 billion in the region in 2018.The company has maintained its huge capex of $3.1 billion for 2018. However, whether the increased spending will proportionately contribute to the total production volumes of the company in the near term is something to wait and see. The huge capex might pose cash flow problems as well.Nonetheless, once Apache completes developing infrastructural assets (by late 2018 or early 2019), its Permian Basin volumes will rev up considerably. Henceforth, the capex is also expected to fall. The increased output and reduced capex will thereby drive the free cash flows and earnings, leading to addition in shareholders’ value.Wrapping UpWhile it’s not apparent whether Apache’s cash flow issues will cease to exist in 2018, the company’s operational efficiency and divestment initiatives however, provide enough support in the long term. Also, only if the company generates sufficient cash from operating activities to meet its capex and dividend, the overall financial picture of Apache will then be sound.Now it remains to be seen if the ramped-up production from the much-hyped Alpine High Play can help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company make a comeback in 2018.Meanwhile, one can consider some better-ranked players from the same industry including the likes of Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. (BCEI  -  Free Report), Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report) and Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc (CRZO  -  Free Report). All the three companies sport Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

51,APA,"Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) has announced its intention to invest in the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline Project as majority of the pipeline transportation capacity has been booked by the shippers.The shippers have already committed to utilize 85% of the pipeline’s capacity for transporting natural gas. Per the company’s expectation, the shippers will book the rest of the transportation capacity by the initial phase of 2018. Investors should know that Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), DCP Midstream, LP (DCP  -  Free Report) and Targa Resources Corp. (TRGP  -  Free Report) are among the shippers.The to-be built pipeline project — worth $1.7 billion — will probably have the capacity to carry roughly 1.92 billion cubic feet of natural gas daily to the Texas Gulf Coast area from the Permian Basin. The pipeline, which awaits regulatory consents, is likely to commence operation by October 2019. It is to be noted that Kinder Morgan is likely to start construction by the first quarter of next year. With the operatorship of the project, Kinder Morgan will have 50% stake. Meanwhile, each of Targa Resources and DCP Midstream will probably own 25% stake.Texas-based Kinder Morgan has the largest network of natural gas pipeline in North America that spreads over almost 70,000 miles. Notably, the company’s midstream properties are linked to all the prospective plays in the United States that are rich in natural gas. These extensive pipeline networks, for which billions of dollars has been invested to date, have been providing the company with stable fee-based revenues.However, the stock fell 12.8% year to date, wider than the industry’s 0.7% decline.Consequently, Kinder Morgan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

52,APA,"Crude mostly traded above the $100-per barrel mark before August 2014, arguably the most glorious days for energy explorers. This helped the upstream players rake in significant cash and reward investors handsomely. The healthy pricing scenario convinced U.S. shale players to ramp up production by utilizing new methods such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (or fracking).While major oil producers started ramping up crude production, the energy space changed from an oil deficit one to an oversupplied market which resulted in low oil prices. Even as oil is currently trading above the $55-a-barrel mark, the commodity price is way lower than the mid-2014 level.Along with OPEC’s production cut extension agreement, the tax reform bill will provide a breather to energy players.Senate & House Agree on 21% Corporate TaxThe Republicans in the Senate and House have decided to put the corporate tax rate at 21% instead of 20%, per the accord signed on Dec 13. Even after the slight bump up, the rate is way lower than the current 35%. Meanwhile, President Trump applauded the move and is content with the 21%.How Will the Energy Sector Benefit?The Energy sector has long been a major tax payer with a median tax rate of 36.8% for the last 11 years, as per the corporate tax calculator of MarketWatch. Over the same time frame, the average tax rate for the S&P 500 universe has been estimated at 30% by MarketWatch. Hence, energy companies in general have been losing money more than the majority of S&P 500 companies in the form of taxes.  To date, energy firms like Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report), ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report), Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) have paid high median effective annual tax rates of 49.9%, 46.9%, 45.5%, 42.6%, and 42.4%, respectively, per MarketWatch.Marathon Oil, Hess, Apache and Chevron carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while ConocoPhillips carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.With a 21% tax rate, oil and gas companies will definitely save a lot of money, which could be directed toward growth and maintenance projects.More DetailsEnergy companies invest significantly as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. For example, the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), has announced a $22-billion capital plan this year, while Chevron has set its capital spending budget for 2017 at around $20 billion.In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. Consequently, U.S. companies need to plan their capital expenditure judiciously. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately, as per the provisions of the tax reform bill. Naturally, this aspect of the bill hugely favors the oil industry.In the event of companies being able to deduct capital expenses in the year of their occurrence, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This will leave more cash in the hands of these companies which can be used to make capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it.

53,APA,"The increase in oil exports from the United States into the Asian markets can put pressure on the world markets as the supplies from OPEC may eventually be replaced with that of the United States.U.S. crude oil exports to Asia last week hit the highest in two months, and the second-highest on record, at 877,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to data from Kpler. Of the total export, South Korea was the biggest buyer with imports of 357,000 bpd. It was followed by China and India who had imports of 222,000 bpd and 151,000 bpd, respectively. Indonesia and Japan were close with imports of 99,000 bpd and 47,500 bpd, respectively. In the first three weeks of November, the average export rate for U.S. crude to Asia was at 470,330 bpd.Reasons Behind Growing U.S. ExportsThere are two mains reasons behind the spur in US exports over the last few years.In 2015, Washington lifted the forty-year old ban on oil exports. Per CNBC, the United States has never exported more than 2 million barrels of crude oil per day. During the week through Oct 27, the nation exported 2.13 million barrels a day of light oil, higher than 400,000 barrels shipped at the end of 2015.On Nov 30, 2016, OPEC signed a landmark deal to curb oil output by 1.2 million barrels a day. Following the footsteps of the cartel, non-OPEC players headed by Russia decided to lower oil output by 558,000 barrels per day in December 2016.Collectively, they decided to reduce crude production by 1.8 million barrels each day. On May 25, the cut in oil production was extended until the first quarter of 2018. It is expected that OPEC can extend the agreement through the end of 2018.On Nov 30, OPEC and non-OPEC players will hold a meeting to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord beyond first-quarter 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, will participate in the Vienna meeting. The agreement entails putting roughly 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market.It can be assumed that the United States is gaining an edge over OPEC in the global crude market especially in Asia, considering that the cartel is lowering supplies to major crude buyers in compliance with the accord.Why the Interest in U.S. Crude?There are three main reasons behind the surging demand for U.S. crude. The crude is appropriate with the configuration of Asian refineries. These refineries process high quality so-called light, sweet crude that produce petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel.U.S. crude is less expensive as the WTI trades at a steep discount to other oil benchmarks like Brent.The cargoes are bought on a spot basis, providing refiners flexibility to balance the conventional Middle Eastern supplies that are sourced via long-term contracts.Other ReasonsPolitical reasons also at play for this boom in US exports to Asia, per oil traders and refining executives. Sources believe that all regions including Tokyo, Beijing and Asian governments are trying to improve trade relationship with America. Hence, buying crude from the nation is considered a medium to promote the relationship with Washington.GainersAs per rig count data provided by Baker Hughes, a GE company, total U.S. drilling rigs increased dramatically from 404 — the lowest hit in May, 2016 — to 923 as of Nov 22, 2017. The current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 588. This signifies that more shale players have gathered in the United States, which has led to higher U.S. oil production and export.Growing crude export is expected to benefit shale players like EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report), Whiting Petroleum Corp. (WLL  -  Free Report), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) and Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD  -  Free Report).These players will be able to sell their production. Amid low oil prices, these companies will benefit from low cost and high yielding assets.Pipeline companies like Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD  -  Free Report) and Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) are expected to gain from increasing exports.These companies will witness an increase in transportation activities. The companies’ operations were hampered after the oil crash, which resulted from sluggish activities and lower oil demand.Pioneer holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while EOG Resources, Whiting Petroleum and Apache carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). ExxonMobil — the largest publicly trading oil company — sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

54,APA,"Share price movement of upstream player Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) has been weak, both in absolute and relative terms. Year to date, Apache’s shares have plunged 36%, underperforming the industry’s decline of 22%. The Texas-based energy company failed to impress investors this year, delivering weaker-than-expected numbers in the first two quarters. Though the company managed to post strong performance in the third quarter, it recorded lower production volumes and weak cash flows.What’s Troubling Apache?The three year oil slump due to the global supply glut had hit Apache hard. The company had to slash its spending and capex budget over the last two years to realign itself to the changed dynamics. This led to lower production in all the three quarters this year and marred the company’s earnings for the first two quarters. The company’s most recent adjusted quarterly output was 6.5% lower than the year-ago level. The effect of the commodity price slump has been profound on Apache’s bottom line, as the energy explorer did not hedge production.However, with the improving commodity price environment, Apache intends to tap on the growth opportunities thereby increasing its capital investment. With returns-focused growth in mind, Apache announced 2017 capital budget of $3.1 billion, representing 60% increase over its 2016 spending. However, the company has not been able to generate strong cash flow from operations to meet its capex budget unlike other oil producers who have successfully covered their capex and dividends with the internally generated cash flows.In the recent quarter, Apache generated $554 million in cash flows as against the capital investments of $843 million. In the first nine months of 2017, Apache recorded a cash flow deficit of $334 million after accounting capital expenditures. Apache’s Alpine High Discovery still needs a significant infrastructure development which might hurt the capital efficiency of the firm. Moreover, Apache is burdened with high leverage ratio of 53.1%. The company is compelled to rely on asset sales to generate funds to clear debt along with funding capex and dividend payments.What Lies Ahead?In a bid to streamline its portfolio, Apache made an exit from its Canadian Operations to increase its focus on the Permian basin — known for its high internal rates of return and low costs. In particular, Apache’s Alpine High play is expected to help the company drive crude production. We see Apache's Alpine High discovery in West Texas as a game changer. Estimated to hold massive oil and natural gas reserves, the wells are expected to have strong economics and top-tier returns.However, the company has maintained a capex of $3.1 billion for 2018, in line with this year. Out of this, $500 million will be allocated for the development of Alpine High Infrastructure. The huge capex budget might pose cash flow problems in 2018 as well. Nonetheless, we appreciate the operational effiency and divestment initiatives of the firm which provide enough support to its financials. Only if the company generates enough cash flow from operations to meet its capex and dividend, the overall financial picture of Apache will  be sound.Zacks Rank and Key PicksApache currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the same industry are Denbury Resources, Inc. (DNR  -  Free Report), Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report) and Bill Barrett Corporation .

55,APA,"Investors with the ability to differentiate between overhyped and pricey toxic stocks and the correctly priced ones emerge winners at the end. However, precise identification of these two types of stocks is not simple as these are entangled in the market place in a very complex way. Investors who can accurately spot toxic stocks and get rid of them at the right time are set to gain.Most of the times, the overpriced toxic stocks are susceptible to external shocks and are loaded with a hefty amount of debt. Moreover, the price of toxic stocks is unrealistically high. The high price of toxic stocks is only short-lived as the intrinsic value of the toxic stocks falls short of the current bloated price.The irrationally high price of toxic stocks can be attributed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some fundamental drawbacks associated with the stock. Owning such stocks for an inordinate period of time is harmful to investors and may lead to huge erosion of wealth.On the other side, investors may benefit from the accurate identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy called short selling. This strategy allows them to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls.While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, figuring out toxic stocks and discarding them at the right time is the key to protect your portfolio from big losses. Profits can be made by short selling them.Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.P/E using 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than -5: Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Zacks Rank more than or equal to #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy-rated stocks that generally outperform the market.Here are five of the 24 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:Houston, TX-based Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) is engaged in exploration, development and production of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids.

56,APA,"It was a week where the price of oil spiked to its highest mark in more than two years and natural gas futures rose marginally.On the news front, integrated major Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), as well as Permian-focused upstream oil and gas explorers –  EOG Resources Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) – came up with stronger-than-expected earnings reports, driven by higher commodity prices.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 3.2% to close at $55.64 per barrel, while natural gas prices edged up 0.7% to $2.984 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Exxon, Chevron, TOTAL Report Strong Q3.)The U.S. oil benchmark rallied to its highest settlement since July 2015 on expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March. The agreement, already renewed once, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Further support came from the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release, which showed steep declines in domestic gasoline and distillate inventories, apart from a bigger-than-expected fall in domestic crude supplies.Upbeat U.S. economic data sets and signs of recovery in global demand growth was also bullish for oil prices.Meanwhile, natural gas futures logged a small gain following an in-line increase in supplies. Favorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s demand provided further upside.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Europe’s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell reported strong third-quarter results on all round contribution from all its segments. In particular, rebounding commodity prices and cost cuts helped the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company come out with better-than-expected numbers. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.During the quarter under review, Shell generated cash flow from operations of $7,582 million, returned $4,000 million to shareholders through dividends and spent $5,742 million on capital projects. Despite falling from the year-ago period, the company’s resilient cash generation has helped it to cover dividend payments. Importantly, the group raked in $3,670 million in free cash flow during the third quarter, up from $3,324 million a year ago.As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had $20,699 million in cash and $88,356 million in debt (including short-term debt). Net debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 25.4%, down from 29.2% a year ago following the BG Group acquisition. The improvement in the group’s debt ratio was helped by cost cuts and asset sales (worth more than $26 billion since 2016). (Read more: Shell's Q3 Earnings Beat Amid Higher Oil, Cost Cuts.)2.    Upstream energy company EOG Resources reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 19 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents supported by higher oil equivalent production and increased commodity price realizations. The bottom line also compared favorably with the year-ago quarter loss of 40 cents per share.In the quarter, EOG Resources’ total volume improved 7.6% year over year to 55 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe). Average price realization for crude oil and condensates rose 10.3% year over year to $48.11 a barrel. Quarterly NGL prices also improved 50% year over year from $14.92 to $22.38 per barrel. Natural gas was sold at $2.19 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 12.3% year over year.The company expects crude oil equivalent volumes in the fourth quarter of 2017 to be in the range of 328.1-662.2 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Capital expenditure for the fourth quarter is expected to lie within $3,000-$3,350 million.Along with the strong results, the company announced that it has added two premium crude acreages to its portfolio with net resource potential of 750 million barrels of oil equivalent. (Read more EOG Resources Q3 Earnings Gain on Increased Volumes.)3.    Permian-focused energy explorer Concho Resourcesreported strong third-quarter revenues and earnings results on the back of higher commodity price realizations and robust production growth.Concho Resources' average quarterly volume increased 26% year over year to 193.2 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (exceeding the high end of the company’s guidance range), of which 62% was liquids. Daily oil output was up 31% to 119.6 thousand barrels, while natural gas production came in at 441.6 million cubic feet (up 19%).The average realized natural gas price jumped 31% from the year-ago quarter to $3.18 per thousand cubic feet, while average oil price realization increased 9.1% to $45.29 per barrel. Overall, the company fetched $35.29 per barrel as against $30.61 a year back.The company expects production growth above the high end of its annual guidance range of 24-26%, with oil output growth expected to exceed 27%. The company has provided fourth quarter net production guidance of 200-204 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Capital expenditures for 2017 are estimated to be between $1,600 million and $1,800 million. (Read more Concho Resources Tops Q3 Earnings & Sales Estimates)4.    U.S. energy firm Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter earnings per share – excluding one-time items – of 4 cents, versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss of 5 cents. The bottom line also turned around from the year-ago adjusted loss of 3 cents. The outperformance stems from higher oil and gas realizations, and lower cost.The average realized crude oil price during the third quarter was $49.34 per barrel, representing an increase of 11.3% from the year-ago realization of $44.35. Moreover, the average realized natural gas price during the September quarter of 2017 was $2.75 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 6.2% from the year-ago period.Apache’s third quarter lease operating expenses totaled $358 million, down 6.3% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, total costs and expenses fell 36.7% from the third quarter of 2016 to $1,482 million.During the oil rout, Apache aligned its spending plans with the low-price environment. But Apache is now looking to increase its capital investment after achieving cost rationalization. Keeping with the company’s planned shift in strategic objective, Apache’s oil and gas capital investments totaled $843 million during the July-September period, 95.1% higher than the $432 million incurred a year ago. (Read more Apache Posts Q3 Earnings on Oil Rebound, Cost Cuts)5.    Chinese oil and gas giant PetroChina Company Limited (PTR  -  Free Report) announced third-quarter 2017 earnings of RMB 4,690 million or RMB 0.03 per diluted share, compared with RMB 1,200 million or RMB 0.01 per diluted share a year earlier. The positive comparisons can be primarily attributable to higher oil prices and strict cost control, which helped its biggest unit — exploration and production — to swing to profitability.Average realized crude oil price during the first nine months of 2017 was $48.76 per barrel, representing a 36.2% jump from the year-ago period. Further, natural gas price rose 8.6% year-over-year to $5.07 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). This helped PetroChina’s upstream (or exploration & production) achieve an operating income of RMB 10,983 million — turning around from the year-ago operating loss of RMB 3,949 million. A tight leash on oil and gas lifting costs that decreased 1.9% from the same period last year, also helped results.As of Sep 30, 2017, PetroChina’s cash balance was RMB 169,469 million, while net cash flow from operating activities was RMB 244,295 million for the first three quarters of this year. Capital expenditure for the period was RMB 124,552 million, 9.1% higher than the year-ago level.

57,APA,"Will crude oil cross the $100 a barrel mark again? Even though this seems quite unattainable--after mid-2014, the commodity hasn’t even treaded close to this benchmark thanks to the supply glut--the crude pricing scenario is looking up.Oil has been steadily recovering from its historic lows, currently trading above $50 a barrel. The recovery has been largely backed by OPEC’s compliance with its landmark production cut deal.Is the agreement leading OPEC to lose crude export market share in the race with U.S. shale players?Record-High Volume of Oil Export in US HistoryThe United States has never exported more than 2 million barrels of crude oil per day. During the week through Oct 27, the nation exported 2.13 million barrels a day of light oil, way higher than 400,000 barrels shipped after the lifting of the four-decade long ban on oil exports at the end of 2015, per CNBC. The all-time high export volumes were primarily supported by record weekly U.S. production. As per the Energy Information Administration (EIA), American crude output for the week ended Oct 27 was 9.55 million barrels a day, close to 9.61 million barrels — the highest in the week through Jun 5, 2015.The U.S. shale boom has been the primary reason for the record-high levels of export and production. The combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has made many oil projects economically viable, encouraging shale players to relentlessly pump out oil.Strong European Crude DemandAccording to Kpler, the lion’s share of export volumes was shipped to Europe. For the week ended Oct 27, the United States shipped 914,000 barrels of crude a day to the continent, significantly higher than the preceding week, reported Kpler. This clearly reflects the substantial demand for light oil in Europe.Though Asia has significant demand for U.S. crude, shipments to the continent surprisingly declined 54% from mid-September through October, per Kpler. However, the proportion of U.S. crude export to China — the largest importer of oil in the world, per EIA — jumped to 20%, as of July 2017, from 3.7% in 2016, per a media report.Also, on Oct 2, the United States exported a massive 1.6 million barrels of oil to India — the third largest crude importer in the world — for the first time, per CNBC.Investors should know that the significant discount of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) relative to Brent has made U.S. light oil popular among overseas crude buyers. As long as Brent is more expensive than WTI, demand for U.S. oil will remain high.OPEC Loses Market ShareOn Nov 30, 2016, OPEC signed a landmark deal to curb oil output by 1.2 million barrels a day. Following in the footsteps of the cartel, non-OPEC players headed by Russia decided to lower oil output by 558,000 barrels per day las December. Collectively, they decided to cut crude production by 1.8 million barrels each day.On May 25, the cut in oil production was extended until the first quarter of 2018. Now, speculations are rife that OPEC could extend the agreement through the end of 2018.To comply with the accord, OPEC is lowering supplies to major crude buyers, which has helped the United Sates gain an edge over OPEC.    US Shale Players to GainAs per rig count data provided by Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), total U.S. drilling rigs increased dramatically from 664 – as of Jan 8, 2016 – to 909 as of Oct 2, 2017. This shows that more shale players have gathered in the U.S. lately, supporting record US production that has resulted in soaring export.Growing U.S. crude export will definitely prove favorable for the shale players. Major shale-focused companies are EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report), Whiting Petroleum Corporation (WLL  -  Free Report), Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report), Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report), and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report).EOG Resources and Whiting Petroleum carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Apache and Pioneer carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Exxon Mobil – the largest publicly trading oil company – sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

62,APA,"Domestic energy explorer Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Thursday, Nov 2, before market opens.In the preceding three-month period, the company reported adjusted loss per of 21 cents against the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a profit of a penny. The underperformance stems from a dip in output due to a conservative capital budget over the past two years. However, the bottom line improved from the year-ago loss of 26 cents amid higher realizations.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the Houston, TX-based upstream operator is on a bit of a slippery surface, having gone past the Zacks Consensus Estimate just once in the last four reports. This is depicted in the graph below:Apache Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Apache Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Apache Corporation Quote Therefore, investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Apache surpasses earnings estimate this time. Let’s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results.Factors to Consider This QuarterWe believe that the improving commodity price environment and Apache’s strong production growth bode well.We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate of daily production (excluding divested assets and non-controlling interests) for the company is currently pegged at 453 thousand oil-equivalent barrels (MBOE), up from 388 MBOE reported in the second quarter. In particular, we expect daily output from the Permian Basin – where Apache’s operations are focused – to average 166 MBOE during the third quarter, compared with 159 MBOE reported a year ago and 146 MBOE in the previous quarter.Analysts polled by Zacks also envision realized prices to increase Apache, which may further buoy the company’s top-line. The average oil price in the Permian is expected to improve 4.6% from the year-ago quarter to $43.79 per barrel.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too shows that Apache is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for this company stands at +13.07%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Apache carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of earnings beat.Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. On the other hand, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Which Other Energy Companies Have Positive Surprise in Store?Apache is not the only energy firm looking up this earnings season. Here are some companies from the space which, according to our model, also have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:Northern Oil and Gas Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1. The company is expected to release earnings results on Nov 14.

63,APA,"Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) will release third-quarter 2017 financial results after the market closes on Oct 31. In the prior quarter, the oil and gas company reported a negative earnings surprise of 126.47%. Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcementFactors to ConsiderAnadarko Petroleum reaffirmed production guidance range for the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM), DJ and Delaware basin assets. In GOM and Delaware and DJ basins, the company expects average production rates to be 130,000 barrels of oil per day (BOPD) and 150,000 BOPD respectively for full-year 2017.During the second quarter, the U.S. operations have been the major contributor in both Oil and Natural gas production. We can expect the same in the current quarter as well. The company's high quality assets and infrastructure will help it to come out with strong performance, despite challenges caused by Hurricane Harvey.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales volume stands at 59 million barrels of oilequivalent (MMBOE) for third quarter that is within the company’s guidance range of 58-60 MMBOE.Similarly the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total average daily volumes is currently pegged at 643,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day(BOE/d)and has exceeded the announced guidance range of 630,000-652,000 BOE/d.Additionally, the Zacks Consensus estimate for total average daily volumes in the United Statesfor natural gas for the current quarter is pegged at 1,122 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d),marginally exceeding the company’s guidance range of 1,085-1,120 MMcf/d.The company has no control over the fluctuating commodity prices that have dropped from the highs reached in the first half of 2017. The third quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is $2,316 million, which reflects a sequential decline of 14.7% accommodates a likely drop in commodity prices. We expect the drop in commodity prices could impact performance of the company.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Anadarko Petroleum is going to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Anadarko Petroleum has an Earnings ESP of -2.07%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 57 cents, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 56 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Though Anadarko Petroleum’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of the ESP, however its negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to Consider                    Anadarko Petroleum does not have the right parameters to come out with earning surprise this season. However, we have a few players in the industry, which have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Noble Midstream Partners LP (NBLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.96% and a Zacks Rank #1.

64,APA,"Investors possessing the skill to distinguish between overpriced toxic stocks and the fairly priced ones emerge winners at the end. However, identifying these two categories of stocks is not easy as these are intertwined in the market place in a complicated way. Investors who can precisely identify toxic stocks and discard them at the right time are most likely to benefit.Usually, the overhyped toxic stocks are vulnerable to external shocks and are burdened with huge amount of debts. Moreover, the price of the toxic stocks is unreasonably inflated. The unrealistically high price of toxic stocks is only transitory in nature as the intrinsic value of the toxic stocks is lower than the current bloated price.The overblown price of toxic stocks can be ascribed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some fundamental problems associated with the stock. Owning such stocks for a long stretch of time is detrimental for investors and may result in huge loss of wealth.On the other side, investors may gain from the precise identification of toxic stocks with the aid of an investing strategy known as short selling. This strategy allows them to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls.While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, identifying toxic stocks and abandoning them at the right time is the key to guard your portfolio from big losses. Profits can be made by short selling them.Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.P/E using 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than -5: Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Zacks Rank more than or equal to #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy-rated stocks that generally outperform the market.Here are five of the 21 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:Wilmington, DE-based Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) is a drug discovery company. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings rose 66.7% to 3 cents per share. Incyte carries a Zacks Rank #3.

65,APA,"CONSOL Energy (CNX  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 financial results before the market opens on Oct 31. The diversified fuel company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 70% in the last quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.Factors to ConsiderCONSOL Energy expects its Exploration & Production (E&P) division production to be 100 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) in the third quarter reflecting a marginal sequential drop. The company also lowered its 2017 E&P production guidance to 405-415 Bcfe from 420-440 Bcfe, taking into account operational issues, tightening of availability of field services and increasing cycle time for larger ceramic completion design.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, sales price per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas in the third quarter is expected to be $2.18 per Mcf, which reflects a year-over-year decline of 7.6% and a sequential drop of 0.9%. The fall in expected production and realized price will adversely impact total revenues of CONSOL Energy. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues in the quarter is $617 million, reflecting a sequential drop of 28.8%.A marginal decrease in coal production from its coal mines due to permission delays and drop in the realized prices of coal per ton due to cooler-than-normal summer and modest delivery issues due to railroads will adversely impact third-quarter results.CONSOL Energy Inc.

66,APA,"We issued an updated research report on upstream energy player Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) on Oct 11. We appreciate the company’s large geographically diversified reserve base and multi-year trends in reserve replacement. However, crude weakness remains as overhang.The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that the stock will perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Apache’s high-quality drilling inventory with greater resource potential should help deliver crude production growth. We see Apache's Alpine High discovery in West Texas as a game-changer. Estimated to hold massive oil and natural gas reserves, the wells are expected to have strong economics and top-tier returns.Management is quite proactive about divesting assets, particularly those that do not fit into the company’s long-term growth plan. As part of this initiative, Apache recently entered into an agreement to divest its high-cost Canadian assets, thereby freeing up capital to focus on high-grade prospects, especially in the Permian basin. The company has been focused on streamlining its portfolio and strategically redeploying capital toward better opportunities.Moreover, by leveraging on its operational expertise, Apache has been able to keep its average well costs at or below budgeted levels — a major achievement in the current low commodity price scenario. It has been five quarters in a row that Apache's cash flow has exceeded capital expenditure, contributing positively to balance sheet. However, oil price has been trading significantly below the mid-2014 level which will affect Apache's earnings and cash flow. The effect of the commodity price slump has been more profound on Apache’s top line as the energy explorer did not hedge production.Over the past year, Apache's stock has lost 33.1%, underperforming the industry’s decline of 23.3%. The company has also reported average negative earnings surprise of 59.09% in the trailing four quarters.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked players in the energy sector are Par Pacific Holdings Inc. (PARR  -  Free Report), Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. (EEP  -  Free Report) and Jones Energy, Inc. (JONE  -  Free Report). All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

67,APA,"Investors who can precisely differentiate between overpriced stocks and fairly priced stocks emerge winners. However, in this complicated market place, these two types of stocks are intertwined in such a way that it is very tough to identify them. Investors who can pick the toxic stocks appropriately and abandon them at the right time are likely to benefit.Generally, the overblown toxic stocks are susceptible to outside shocks and are loaded with high levels of debts. Also, the price of the toxic stocks is unrealistically high. The irrationally inflated price of the toxic stocks is only short-lived in nature as their intrinsic value falls short of the current hyped price.The overhyped price of toxic stocks can be attributed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some fundamental drawbacks associated with the stock. Owning such stocks for a long period of time is detrimental and may lead to huge erosion of wealth.On the other side, investors may gain from the accurate identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy called short selling. This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls.While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, figuring out toxic stocks and discarding them at the right time is the key to protect your portfolio from big losses. Profits can be made by short selling them.Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.P/E using 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than -5: Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Zacks Rank more than or equal to #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy-rated stocks that generally outperform the market.Here are five of the 20 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:PTC Inc. (PTC  -  Free Report) is a Needham, MA-based software company engaged in developing, marketing and supporting software solutions.

68,APA,"Activist investors are calling for a paradigm shift in compensation methods to leaders in the energy sector. The current model awards shale drillers as per growth in production. This has increased production vastly and hence CEOs' pay has also been excessive.However, the boost in production didn’t help in improving financials. Therefore, investors didn’t gain anything. This fired up investors to demand a change in the pattern of compensating executives. Investors want CEO pays to be linked to returns.Previous Methods V/S New Practice of CompensationPer the earlier norm, the executives received large compensation when they made large investments in new wells. This sparked a new age of shale gas that made the United States a global energy powerhouse and encouraged higher oil and gas drilling. In fact, the current crude output in the country amounts to a robust 9.6 million barrels a day — the highest since July 2015.Per this practice, the 10 biggest U.S. shale producers paid their chief executives $2.2 billion over the past decade despite shareholder returns of 1.7%. These companies include Apache Corp (APA  -  Free Report) and Devon Energy Corp (DVN  -  Free Report). Both these companies hold a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.On the other hand, the integrated companies like ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and others paid their executives cumulatively a total of $600 million during the same period and achieved a stronger 3.5% return.The performance of the broader oil industry can also be gauged by the returns it has delivered in comparison to the S&P 500 index. The industry’s performance did not reach any closer to the index’s return of 7.4% in the last 10 years. The difference became more prominent this year, with shares of shale producers down over 20% and the index gained about 14%.Companies like Cabot Oil & Gas Corp (COG  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) are an exception. These companies have more investor-friendly policies. Even executive compensation is calculated in a manner keeping in mind long-term benefits. Shares for executives are to be vested after three years rather than immediately. These companies also benefited due to their practices as their shares have outperformed peers. Since 2012, EOG Resources’ share price increased 96%.Gradually, other companies have started or are planning to follow suit. One such company having transformed its practice is Range Resources plc (RRC  -  Free Report). The company decided to switch policies after its shares dropped about 70% since 2012, per Reuters analysis.This comparison of prices between companies following different policies is evidence enough to establish the rationality of the more relevant strategy.On the other hand, companies not agreeing to follow suit are facing the heat. EQT Corp (EQT  -  Free Report) is one such company, which is being asked to explain the logic behind the payment of $130 million to its executive. In September, the company has agreed to eliminate that bonus and focus on efficiency and cost, not production.Even as investors get more aware, they are allocating their money to companies that compensate leaders for returns.Change is Not EasyDespite low returns, the companies will continue to increase production as they would need cash flow to pay debt and other expenses. Executives will continue with their old habits till they are paid per the production increase. Shale executives receive higher pay. For example, Noble Energy Inc’s (NBL) executive was paid $10.1 million in 2016, up 40% from 2015. SandRidge Energy Inc CEO was also awarded $18.8 million in the year the company exited bankruptcy protection.Winners & LosersIf the change is implicated, it would put an end to spending on new wells, disturbing a shale boom that has placed U.S. motorists and consumers advantageously. However, it will benefit the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers who are aggressively trying to control global crude surplus. Flourishing U.S. shale production has mainly upset OPEC output cuts expected at lifting prices. Consecutively, low oil prices have damaged shareholder returns.ConclusionIf more companies changed policies, production will decline,leading to increase in shareholder returns. These will have widespread impacts on the shale sector as well as international oil markets.If there is a change in the payment structure, shareholders will benefit from higher cash flows and less funds would be directed to drilling. The surplus funds would be distributed in the form of dividends rather than financing new shale wells. This is likely to result in higher share prices and better return on capital. But that would also mean more reserved oil production.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

69,APA,"Investors in Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 20, 2017 $70.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Apache shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Apache is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry that ranks in the Top 39% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30days, one analyst has increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while three have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 2 cents per share to break-even level in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Apache right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

71,APA,"World's largest publicly traded oil company, ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) recently declared that since May 2017, it has increased its Permian Basin presence by 22,000 acres. The company achieved this through multiple acquisitions and acreage trades. This has added value to its existing 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent resource base located in the Permian Basin.The oil major is one of the biggest operators in the Permian Basin, the most popular unconventional basin at the moment. At present, ExxonMobil operates 19 drilling rigs in the area that include 14 horizontal well drilling rigs in the core Midland Basin. Since mid-2014, the company has drilled 200 wells in the Midland Basin area, where it has 130,000 acres. ExxonMobil has 250,000 acres in the Delaware Basin where it operates four drilling rigs.With more acreage, the company will be able to boost returns in the basin by supporting longer laterals. The complexity of development will be reduced with more acreage and potential drilling locations.Presently, 566 companies operate in the basin. ExxonMobil is rapidly increasing its presence in the region as are other leading oil companies.These include ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Energen Corporation (EGN  -  Free Report), Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) and others. Exploration and production company, ConocoPhillips has around 1 million acres in the basin. In the last six years, the company has received 734 drilling permits. Although Birmingham, AL-based Energen owns around 150,000 acres in the basin, the number of permits gained is more than double of ExxonMobil. Texas-based Apache holds more than 2.5 million acres in the Permian Basin along with 3,300 permits received since 2012.About the CompanyIrving, TX-based ExxonMobil is engaged in oil and natural gas exploration and production, petroleum products refining and marketing, chemicals manufacture, and other energy-related businesses. Approximately 83% of ExxonMobil’s earnings come from operations outside the United States. The company divides its operations mainly into three segments: Upstream, Downstream and Chemicals.ExxonMobil is the world’s best run integrated oil company, given its track record of high return on capital. It has collaborated with Russia for exploring potential commercial reserves in the country. However, tensions between the United States and Russia might affect its efforts to generate shareholder value by exploiting Russian oil and gas reserves.Price PerformanceExxonMobil has lost 9.4% of its value year to date against the 0.6% rise witnessed by the industry it belongs to. Zacks Rank ExxonMobil carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

72,APA,"British oil giant BP Plc (BP  -  Free Report) announced the commencement of natural gas production at the Khazzan field in Oman. The company will be using fracking technology, which is rarely used in the Middle East.In the field, BP holds a 60% stake, while the remaining is owned by Oman Oil Company Exploration & Production.The Khazzan gas project, expected to have an inventory of 300 drilling wells, is the largest start-up for BP in 2017. Also, it is the sixth project start-up among the seven new key developments of the company this year. All the projects are likely to take the energy giant closer to its target of adding 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent every day by 2020.   BP has two planned phases for the Khazzan project. The company expects the field to generate 1.5 billion cubic feet of gas every day after the completion of the phases. Further, the company estimates recoverable reserves from the natural gas field of around 10.5 trillion cubic feet.Headquartered in London, BP is one of the largest integrated energy firms in the world with a strong and diversified portfolio of development projects. The company’s upstream projects are expected to fetch significant cash flow in 2020 and beyond.The near-term prospects for BP’s upstream businesses have been looking up as crude has recovered significantly from the historical lows of February 2016. Other oil and gas exploration and production players like Apache (APA  -  Free Report), Abraxas Petroleum (AXAS  -  Free Report) and W&T Offshore, Inc.

73,APA,"One thing the oil market downturn has taught investors: nobody has much visibility into the future. So, when you think of something as a clear line of sight one quarter, it can soon be overshadowed by an unforeseen event.To sum up, even as crude prices continue to make their way up, world oil supply remains in a glut and is likely to remain so through 2017. This might make any oil price strength short-lived.Regardless of the commodity’s price movement though, one oil-producing region that continues to attract investors is the low-cost Permian Basin spread over west Texas and New Mexico. According to some estimates, the region – that has been churning out crude continuously for nearly 100 years – has produced in excess of 30 billion barrels of oil since output began in 1921. Incredibly, despite that impressive output history, analysts maintain that its best days are yet to come. In fact, Permian Basin is key to the studies that say the United States has now overtaken industry giants Saudi Arabia and Russia in recoverable oil reserves.Permian Basin: A Hot Area for Producers   A sedimentary basin lying underneath the western part of Texas and the south-eastern part of New Mexico, the Permian Basin Shale covers roughly 75,000 square miles, almost half the size of California.Experts say that it’s cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in the Permian Basin, as compared to most other major fields. Moreover, there are certain parts of the shale play whose well-returns are the best in the U.S. With crude prices still down significantly from their 2014 levels, well returns have become a very important metric to gauge profitability.Permian’s attractive economics means that producers can still make money there at the current, $50-a-barrel price. This is mainly because of the region's extensive pipeline infrastructure, plentiful labor and supplies, and relatively warm winters that makes year-round work possible. Most other domestic share regions need prices above $60 to support new developments and expansions.As a result, the Permian currently constitutes the lion’s share of the industry's recovery. In 2016, more than a third of the total amount spent on all U.S. deals was spent on Permian land purchases and leases. No other major oil region in the country came close to this activity.Permian Deals GaloreIn January, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) announced its intention to more than double its Permian Basin resource of 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The company aims to achieve this through the buyout of companies owned by the Bass family of Fort Worth, TX. Alongside an upfront payment of $5.6 billion, ExxonMobil will make a series of additional contingent cash payments of up to $1 billion. (Read: Exxon Mobil to Buy Bass Family Assets, Double Permian Yield.)Also, Noble Energy Inc. entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Clayton Williams Energy Inc. in a bid to expand its footprint in the Permian Basin. The transaction is worth $3.2 billion, post Noble Energy’s assumption of Clayton Williams’ net debt of $500 million. (Read: Noble Energy to Acquire Clayton Williams for $3.2B.)In February, Parsley Energy Inc. entered into an agreement with Double Eagle Energy Permian, LLC to acquire certain assets in the oil-rich Permian basin for $2.8 billion. (Read: Parsley Inks Permian Acquisition Deal, Updates Guidance)Toward the end March, Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) bought additional Permian Basin acreage for $700 million in cash. The followed the company’s decision to acquire 70,000 net acres in the lucrative region for $1.1 billion just weeks before. (Read: Marathon Inks Deal to Expand in the Permian Basin)According to analysts, deals of this nature could push up the value of the group as a whole. With its relatively low break-even cost, the Permian Basin is likely to attract more transactions of this nature in the near future. Also, with their new-found confidence, companies could soon be venturing into other oil rich areas. The new administration has already indicated that it would likely review regulations limiting drilling activities in Alaska and in other parts of the United States.Meanwhile, late last year, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) announced that it has discovered the biggest deposit of untapped oil in the U.S., located in the Wolfcamp shale formation in the Midland Basin portion of Permian Basin. (Read: USGS Just Discovered the Biggest Shale Oil Field in America.)Permian Basin Oil Stocks in FocusWith the hectic pace of land grab set to continue in the Permian basin and investor’s strong appetite for stocks focused in that region, we present five companies that investors should watch out for.Founded in 1954, Houston, TX-based Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) is one of the world's leading independent energy companies engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. In particular, Apache’s recent Alpine High discovery in Delaware sub-basin, a section of the Permian, is expected to be a gamechanger for the company. Estimated to hold massive oil and natural gas reserves, the wells are said to have strong economics and top-tier returns.Second on the list is Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD  -  Free Report). An independent oil and gas exploration and production company based in Irving, TX, Pioneer’s growth continues to be focused on the Permian operations. Its world-class assets in the region is likely to see year-over-year production growth of 30% in 2017.Denver, CO-based Resolute Energy Corp. (REN  -  Free Report) is another independent oil and gas finder in the U.S. with primary focus on its Permian Basin properties. Divided into the Appaloosa and Mustang project areas in Reeves County in the Delaware Basin, Resolute Energy’s Permian Basin drilling program continue to deliver compelling results.

74,APA,"Investors who can accurately distinguish between overpriced and rightly priced stocks emerge as winners at the end. However, in this tricky market place, these two types of stocks are inter-mixed in such a way that it is very tough to differentiate them. Investors who can appropriately spot toxic stocks and discard them at the right time are likely to gain.Generally, the overhyped toxic stocks are exposed to external shocks and are burdened with high amount of debts. Also, the price of the toxic stocks is unreasonably high. The irrationally high price of the toxic stocks is only transitory in nature as their intrinsic value is lower than the current bloated price.The overblown price of toxic stocks can be attributed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some deep-rooted drawbacks in the stock. Owning such stocks for a long stretch of time may result into huge erosion of wealth.On the other hand, investors may gain from the accurate identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy called short selling. This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls.While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, pointing out toxic stocks and removing them at the right time is the key to safeguard your portfolio from big losses. Profits can be made by short selling them.Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.P/E using 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than -5: Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Zacks Rank more than or equal to #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy-rated stocks that generally outperform the market.Here are five of the 17 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:PTC Inc.

75,APA,"Reflecting the resumption of activities post hurricane Harvey, the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded another large build, while product inventories (gasoline and distillate) fell sharply. In fact, market players welcomed the faster-than-normal return to normalized operations in South Texas region following the storm’s landfall nearly a month ago.The commodity was also supported by tensions in the Middle East over President Donald Trump's comments on Iran's nuclear deal and talks of an extension to the output cut agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC producers beyond March next year.Eventually, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1.9% (or 93 cents) to settle at $50.41 per barrel Thursday – the highest level since May 24.Energy Stocks GainThe bullish data sets encouraged buying in energy stocks, which lifted the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – almost 0.7% Wednesday. Some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 yesterday were oil and oil-related companies like Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report), Devon Energy Corp. (DVN  -  Free Report), Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) and Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories jumped by 4.6 million barrels for the week ending Sep 15, following an increase of 5.9 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 2.4 million barrels.Volume ramp-up from the import and production facilities shuttered in the wake of hurricane Harvey led to the big stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer.Despite the substantial climb in oil storage for a third straight week, current supplies – at 472.8 million barrels – are still marginally below the year-ago period. However, stocks are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 703,000 barrels to 59.8 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 29.4 days in the previous week to 30.8 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.2 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were down for the third week running as Gulf Coast refineries sidelined by Harvey continue to ramp up throughput. The 2.1 million barrels draw – above the polled number of 800,000 barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 216.2 million barrels. Following last week’s slide, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 4% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 5.7 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for one million barrels decrease in supply level. The largest weekly fall since 2011 could be again be attributed to recovering refinery post storm-induced outages. At 138.9 million barrels, current supplies are 15.8% below the year-ago level but are in the bottom half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 5.5% from the prior week to 83.2%. While refinery runs rebounded from the previous week’s nine-year lows, it’s still a far cry from the pre-Harvey rates of 96.6% - the highest since 2005. With more units returning to activity over the coming weeks, we expect utilization and throughput to continue to rise.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Lonestar Resources US Inc. (LONE  -  Free Report) may be a good selection. This company has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

77,APA,"In a low oil price environment, oil companies looking for options to reduce the cost of production and cope up with oil price volatility. For this reason, many of the U.S. oil companies have left the Canadian oil sands and moved to the Permian Basin where production cost is lower.Apart from the Permian Basin, there are five other major oil producing regions in the United States, which are covered by EIA in its monthly Drilling Productivity Report. These include Appalachia, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Niobrara.However there is growing interest in another shale play located to the north of Permian Basin. It has witnessed a brisk increase in investment and drilling activity recently, which has prompted the EIA to include the region in its monthly Drilling Productivity Report. The growing presence of shale players in the Anadarko region may have led to its inclusion. The region incorporates 24 Oklahoma and five Texas counties.Production Related DetailsIn terms of production, the Anadarko region generated 447,000 barrels of oil and 5,979 million cubic feet of gas per day in August 2017. Moreover, the region is becoming popular due to surging natural gas production and the trend is expected to continue in the coming month.The month over month data shows that the region is likely to register an increase in oil and gas production, for September 2017, by 12,000 barrels and 78 million cubic feet per day, respectively.Why the Shift?The interest in Anadarko region – incorporates one of the most prolific natural gas reserves in North America – can be attributed to the rising opportunity of using upgraded drilling and completion technology.Another factor that is increasing the focus on Anadarko is rising lease operating expenses in the Permian Basin. There is also a shortage of oilfield services and occasional production hiccups from time to time in the Permian Basin. Investors should know that 129 rigs, as of July, were actively engaged in drilling activities in Anadarko basin, which were less than 373 active rigs in the crowded Permian Basin.The Anadarko region includes the STACK (Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties) and the SCOOP (South Central Oklahoma Oil Province) plays. These two areas have witnessed an increase in investment from exploration and production companies in the recent years.Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report), SandRidge Energy, Inc. , Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report), Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report), Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report), and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) are among the oil companies operating in the basin. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, the fairly priced stocks and the overhyped toxic stocks are mingled in the marketplace in such a way that it becomes very difficult to distinguish them.

Also, price of the toxic stocks is unjustifiably high.

79,APA,"It was a week where both oil and natural gas prices suffered losses.On the news front, upstream biggies Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD  -  Free Report) and Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) came up with contrasting second quarter results, while pipeline firm Genesis Energy L.P. (GEL  -  Free Report) is set to enter the chemical industry with the acquisition of the alkali business of Tronox Ltd.Overall, it was a dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged down 0.3% to close at $49.58 per barrel, while natural gas prices declined 5.7% to $2.7740 per million Btu (MMBtu).Following the year’s best week, oil prices logged a slight drop this time around. The commodity was affected by lingering concerns over OPEC and its allies' success in rebalancing the market after a survey showed that the cartel's output climbed to the highest level of the year in July and its exports were at record levels. Meanwhile, domestic production rose to a 2-year high.However, most of the negativity was offset by the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release that showed a sharp increase in refinery demand. Investors also cheered a lower rig count as it pointed to the softening of shale drilling activities.  Natural gas also turned lower amid worries over the fuel’s tepid demand on the back of bearish weather predictions and a steady increase in production.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Leading upstream energy company Pioneer Natural Resourcesreported second-quarter 2017 earnings, excluding one-time items, of 21 cents per share. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents per share. Notably, the company had incurred adjusted loss of 22 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. Significantly high commodity price realizations along with the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program resulted in the strong quarterly performance.Total production in the reported quarter averaged 259.1 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), up 12% year over year. The Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program of the company led to the outperformance. On an oil equivalent basis, average realized price was $32.56 per barrel in the reported quarter as compared with $28.95 a year ago.For 2017, Pioneer intends to spend $2.7 billion, lower than the prior projection of $2.8 billion. Of this, it has planned drilling and completion capex of $2.4 billion and spending budget for water infrastructure, vertical integration and field facilities of $275 million. Pioneer expects production in the range of 274 MBOE/d to 279 MBOE/d for the third quarter of 2017.(Read more: Pioneer Natural Q2 Earnings Top on Increased Drilling.)2.    U.S. energy firm Apache Corp. reported second-quarter loss per share – excluding one-time items – of 21 cents against the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a profit of a penny. The underperformance stems from a dip in output due to a conservative capital budget over the past two years. However, the bottom line improved from the year-ago loss of 26 cents amid higher realizations.The production of oil and natural gas (excluding divested assets and non-controlling interests) averaged 387,562 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d) (65% liquids), down 16% from last year.The average realized crude oil price during the second quarter was $46.89 per barrel, representing an increase of 9% from the year-ago realization of $43.14. Moreover, the average realized natural gas price during the Jun quarter of 2017 was $2.60 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 27% from the year-ago period.After aligning its spending plans with the low-price environment during the oil rout, Apache is now looking to increase its capital investment after achieving cost rationalization. With returns-focused growth in mind, Apache announced a 2017 capital budget of $3.1 billion, representing a 60% increase over its 2016 spend.Keeping with the company’s planned shift in strategic objective, Apache’s oil and gas capital investments totaled $738 million during the Apr-Jun period, 85% higher than the $400 million incurred a year ago. (Read more Apache Reports Q2 Loss on Reduced Production.)3.    Oil and gas transportation and refining partnership, Genesis Energy, L.P. recently announced that it will enter the chemical industry with the acquisition of the alkali business of Stamford, CT-based Tronox Ltd. Per the deal, Genesis Energy will be shelling out $1.325 billion in cash to the chemicals and minerals maker for the assets.Investors should know that Tronox's alkali business, located at its Green River, WY. facilities, which is one of the biggest in the world, includes the trona and trona-based marketing, mining, exploring, processing, producing, and selling operations. It produces approximately 28% - 4 million tons - of the world's natural soda ash (sodium bicarbonate) output every year. It is used for various purposes like glass making, baking of goods, detergents, industrial chemical production, etc.Genesis Energy – carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) – believes the alkali business has a reserve life of more than 100 years. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The buyout will help Genesis Energy in terms of its current asset base and aid the partnership to serve the refineries and petrochemical facilities connected with its pipelines better. It is in line with Genesis Energy’s strategy to diversify its business.Per the partnership, the soda ash assets generate stable cash flow, which might help with its $3.02 billion debt, as reported in second-quarter 2017. The estimated EBITDA from the business for the last 12-month period, which ended on Jun 30, 2017, was $166 million. (Read more: Genesis Energy Eyes Chemical Industry with Alkali Unit Buyout.)4.    Houston, TX-based leading upstream energy firm Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) posted second-quarter adjusted loss of 24 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents. Lower-than-expected production from the U.S. land markets impacted results.Marathon Oil reported North American production available for sale of 222,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d), down from 224,000 BOE/d in the second quarter of 2016. The deterioration was mainly due to reduced drilling and completion activities mainly in the Eagle Ford and Bakken Basins.Marathon Oil’s total quarterly cost and expenses declined by 10.1% to $1,085 million in the reported quarter compared with the prior-year figure of $1,207 million. The decrease is attributed to the lower exploration, production, marketing and general/administrative costs. However, the decrease was partially offset by higher depreciation expenses and other operating costs.Marathon Oil has raised its production guidance for the full-year 2017 and expects the production available for sale from the combined North America and International E&P segments, excluding Libya, to average 345,000–360,000 BOE/d, about 7% higher than 2016. (Read more: Marathon Oil Q2 Loss Wider than Expected, Revenues Beat.)5.    U.S. refiner HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC  -  Free Report) reported strong second-quarter results, helped by improving refining margins, higher production and contribution from the newly acquired PCLI unit.Net income from the Refining segment – which is the main contributor to HollyFrontier earnings – was $86.6 million, turning around from the loss of $436.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The improvement reflects wider gross margins, which jumped 29% to $11.47 per barrel.Total refined product sales volumes averaged 483,210 barrels per day (bpd), up 9% from the 442,660 bpd in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, throughput increased from 428,590 bpd in the year-ago quarter to 467,090 bpd. Capacity utilization, at 102.13%, was up from 101.7% in the second quarter of 2016.Income from the newly acquired Petro-Canada Lubricants Inc.

(CXO  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter adjusted net earnings per share of 52 cents, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents and double the prior-year quarter adjusted income of 26 cents.The outperformance came on the back of higher commodity prices and strong production growth.Concho Resources’ total operating revenues for the second quarter amounted to $567 million, which increased substantially from $396 million a year ago but was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $649 million.Concho Resources Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Concho Resources Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Concho Resources Inc. QuoteThe Permian Basin AdvantageExperts say that it’s cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in the Permian Basin than most other major fields. Moreover, there are certain parts of the shale play whose well-returns are the best in the U.S. With crude prices still down significantly from their 2014 levels, well returns have become a very important metric to gauge profitability.Permian’s attractive economics means that producers can still make money there at the current, just over-$50-a-barrel price. This is mainly because of the region's extensive pipeline infrastructure, plentiful labor and supplies, and relatively warm winters that makes year-round work possible. Most other domestic shale regions need prices above $60 to support new developments and expansions.Apart from Concho Resources, other key players in the Permian Basin are Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report), as well as biggies like ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report).Volume AnalysisConcho Resources' average quarterly volume increased 27% year over year to 184.7 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 61% was liquids. Daily oil output was up 27% to 113.2 thousand barrels, while natural gas production came in at 428.8 million cubic feet (up 28%).Realized PricesThe average realized natural gas price jumped 44% from the year-ago quarter to $2.71 per thousand cubic feet, while average oil price realization increased 7% to $44.75 per barrel. Overall, the company fetched $33.73 per barrel as against $30.00 a year back.Balance Sheet & Capital ExpenditureAs of Jun 30, 2017, Concho Resources had approximately $662 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company had long-term debt of $2,741 million, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 23.9%.GuidanceFollowing second-quarter’s impressive production growth, Concho Resources – a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock – raised its full-year production growth guidance range to 24%–26%, from the prior 21%–25%.

95,APA,"Domestic energy explorer Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Aug 3.Founded in 1954, Houston, TX-based Apache – which counts Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report), Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) as its peers – is one of the world's leading independent energy companies engaged in the exploration, development, and production of natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids.In the preceding three-month period, the company reported adjusted loss of 8 cents per share, which compared unfavorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 16 cents. The underperformance stems from a dip in output due to a conservative capital budget over the last two years.  Apache’s earnings surprise history is disappointing. The company missed estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average negative surprise of 46.40%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Apache Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Apache Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Apache Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayAs compared to the year-ago quarter, the pricing scenario for both crude and natural gas has improved considerably. This bodes well for Apache as it has been able to sell its output at favorable prices.  However, for second-quarter 2017, Apache expects production in the range of 376–386 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d), lower than 460.8 Mboe/d in the year-ago quarter. Hence, lower projected output due to planned maintenance and reduced spending may negatively impact Apache’s earnings. The company’s high leverage is also a concern. As it is, shares of Apache witnessed a decline of around 7% during the quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Apache will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +66.67%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 5 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Apache has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong sell). Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

96,APA,"Oil exploration and production company, QEP Resources, Inc. (QEP  -  Free Report) recently agreed to sell its natural gas assets in southwest Wyoming through its wholly owned subsidiary QEP Energy Co. The transaction worth $777.5 million comprises two deals.Details of the DealsThe first deal involves the sale of QEP Resources’ Pinedale Anticline field assets in Sublette County, WY to Oklahoma-based oil and gas company, Oak Ridge Natural Resources’ affiliate, Pinedale Energy Partners, LLC, for $740 million.Per the accord, QEP Resources will compensate its buyer, if any deficiency costs are incurred in gas processing, NGL transportation and fractionation contracts till Dec 31, 2019. The total amount of compensation will be within $45 million. The transaction is expected to be closed by Sep 30, 2017.We would like to remind investors that the assets in Pinedale incorporate 964 billion cubic feet equivalents (BCFE) of proved reserves. QEP Resources' net production in the first quarter of 2017, from the Pinedale assets, was 234 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day (MMcfe/d). Around 12% of it was liquids.On the other hand, the closing of the second deal on Jun 30, 2017, helped QEP Resources to sell some of its non-core natural gas assets, located in southern Wyoming, to an unrevealed client for $37.5 million. The assets cover 15.2 BCFE of proved reserves. In the first quarter of 2017, net production from the assets was 4 MMcfe/d that included about 2% liquids.Deal RationaleThe deals are in line with QEP Resources’ strategy of simplifying its asset portfolio. The company expects to use the proceeds from the transactions to improve its balance sheet. As of Mar 31, 2017, QEP Resources’ long-term debt was $2,022.4 million. The proceeds can also be used to provide capital for future development projects and fund acquisition opportunities.QEP Resources is following other energy majors who are shifting focus to the Permian Basin. The company expects to operate five of its seven active rigs in Permian Basin on an average in 2017. Other companies focusing on the Permian Basin for its relatively low cost and promising future are American Midstream , Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report), Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) and others.About the CompanyDenver, CO-based QEP Resources is a leading independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids.QEP Resources has been implementing aggressive cost cut initiatives, which have enabled the company to maintain its margins amid low oil prices. During the first quarter of 2017, total operating expenses of the company declined 74% from the prior -year quarter, leading to better results in the quarter. However, the company, which derives its reserves and production from oil and natural gas, is exposed to volatile commodity prices.QEP Resources presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price PerformanceQEP Resources has lost 20.9% of its value in the last three months compared with the 10.3% decline recorded by the industry.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>
