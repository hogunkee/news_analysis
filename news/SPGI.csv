13,SPGI,"AB Large Cap Growth (APGAX) is in an elite group of top mutual funds. It is a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. Each of those top mutual funds beat its benchmark in 2017 and over the past three, five and 10 years as of Dec. 31. That takes extraordinary consistency. For $6.3 billion Large Cap Growth and other U.S. stock mutual funds, the bogey they've beaten is the S&P 500. Across all categories, only 22% of eligible funds managed the four-time feat.More impressively, AB Large Cap Growth outperformed in all four time periods in three categories: U.S. diversified equity funds, growth funds and large-cap funds. How hard is it to gain entry to the winners' circle? Only 10.4% of eligible U.S. diversified stock funds made the Best Mutual Funds Award list.To become a top mutual fund like this, lead manager Frank Caruso, co-manager John Fogarty and senior research analyst Vinay Thapar have assembled a diversified portfolio that includes leading stocks in auto parts, health care, financials and technology such as Copart (CPRT), Edwards Lifesciences (EW), Zoetis (ZTS), S&P Global (SPGI) and Nvidia (NVDA).Holding periods vary, but the stocks in the past 12 months have risen from 48% for Edwards to 49% for S&P Global, 55% for Zoetis, 63% for Copart and 116% for Nvidia.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, Caruso and his team have been trimming one of those leading stocks because of a growing competitive threat. Below, Caruso describes which of those stocks he has reservations about and why.Meanwhile, overall finding stocks that persistently outperform the market depends, Caruso says, on finding ""idiosyncratic opportunities to invest.""Sixty-one-year-old Caruso and his colleagues — Fogarty, 48, and Thapar, 39 — discussed that and other aspects of the team's investment approach with IBD from their offices in Manhattan.IBD: This portfolio is a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. What does it take to outperform so consistently over periods as short as 12 months to 10 years?Frank Caruso: We focus on looking at businesses, not stocks. We are attracted to businesses with differentiated competitive positions, companies that produce higher than average levels of profitability, profitability that exceeds the fair cost of capital.Here's our secret sauce: we start by looking for good businesses, then we obsess over each company's idiosyncratic opportunities to invest and to earn high returns on capital.IBD: What exactly do you mean by 'idiosyncratic opportunities to invest'?Caruso: It is an investment opportunity that is company specific. It occurs when a company takes action that can put upward pressure on profitability. Take Nike (NKE). They've been chasing low-cost labor since the 1960s. We noticed patent filings that looked like new manufacturing technology. If they could build shoes with robotized machines, they could build plants closer to consumers, saving on tariffs, duties and shipping.IBD: The fund is fairly concentrated, with just 47 stocks as of Jan. 31. Why do you prefer a concentrated approach?Caruso: First, we think we're good at researching companies. And we want to get paid for research.Second, having around 50 names allows us to get exposure to some larger-cap companies and also seed the portfolio with sometimes younger and more exciting companies.Forty-seven is near the small end of our portfolio size range. We may have been in the low to mid sixties when we first took over this portfolio in 2012. We were still shaping the portfolio to our vision.IBD: Auto auctioneer Copart is one of your smaller names with a market cap under $12 billion. It has posted three straight quarters of earnings per share growth acceleration. What's the driver?Caruso: They're probably not the type of business in a lot of growth portfolios. They have high profitability, and they are high versus their cost of capital. Yet it's surprisingly stable. One secular trend that gives us confidence in the sustainability of their performance is that as autos become more complex, it leads to more attractive salvage rates. With more and more cars, it's too expensive to repair ones that get damaged. So Copart's supply of inventory gets bigger.IBD: You began your current stake in August. Why then?Caruso: Over a multiyear period, Copart's infrastructure did not perform efficiently to exploit new inventory when it arose due to (hurricanes). So the company invested money to upgrade its capabilities. In the August hurricane season, investors questioned whether Copart had done enough, lowering Copart's share price. We bought on that uncertainty.IBD: For the most part, you've been building your stake in Edwards Lifesciences. Why?Vinay Thapar: They pioneered development of transcatheter aortic valves. Before that, patients had to do through open-heart surgery and go on a bypass machine to have their valves repaired. Edwards got around that by engineering a product that could be inserted by snaking a catheter through an artery in the leg.It is far more minimally invasive and results in faster discharge from the hospital. The average patient cost is 10% to 15% less than the open-heart procedure. Yet the product has higher than average gross margins and operating margins. We expected an uplift in return on the company's invested capital (ROIC), and that has occurred. There's about an 18% ROIC, which is close to the upper echelon in other companies.The company forecasts the market to be about $5 billion-plus by 2021, and it's only $2.5 billion to $3 billion now. Beyond that, they're looking at using the same procedure for a different valve, the mitral valve, which would be a new market.IBD: Zoetis is another name in which you've been building your stake. What's fueling your interest?Thapar: They're the leader in pharmaceuticals for animal health. Our thesis is that after their spinout from Pfizer, they had an opportunity to improve their operating performance. They right-sized their number of SKUs (items for sale), they closed manufacturing facilities. Those improved their gross margin. And they committed to investing in higher returning R&D projects.Their single-digit top-line growth above the market growth rate, along with cost improvements, had led to higher returns. Going forward, their pipeline of products is yet to be reflected in their stock price. And they've committed to reduce their inventory balance, which will improve their return on invested capital.IBD: S&P Global is another holding whose EPS growth has accelerated. Why has that happened?Caruso: We're modeling annual revenue growth in the 6% area for the next four or five years, along with low single digit earnings growth.Their index business has been a big part of their success. And their ratings business is a best-in-class franchise. In a low-rate environment with a good level of volatility, the expectation is that if there's an increase around the world, their ratings business should benefit and maybe some parts of their index business.IBD: You've been in Nvidia a long time. Does this story have much runway left in front of it?Caruso: It's been in this portfolio since 2014. Their graphical chips have found new applications. Think AI (artificial intelligence), think hyperscale data centers, think VR (virtual reality), think auto vision.But Nvidia's GPUs are general purpose chips. And we think there are application-specific chips from early-stage companies that will become competitive for market share in the next 15 to 18 months. So we've been trimming our position.IBD: Booking Holdings (BKNG) is Priceline's new name. Why do you like that particular online travel agency?John Fogarty: They changed their name to reflect their primary assets in the online travel portfolio. Their appeal is their dominant position in Europe, where the hotel market is far more fragmented than in the U.S., where the industry is dominated by chains. Booking can take advantage of Europe's fragmentation, so they enjoy a higher commission rate as a result.IBD: PayPal (PYPL) is a relative newcomer to the portfolio. Why did you introduce it?Fogarty: We began to buy it in the fourth quarter of 2017. The growth of PayPal is essentially riding the increased adoption of online payments and, in particular, mobile payments. We're attracted to their rising return on assets trajectory — not just their growth, but their increased profitability.IBD: Anyone want to add any comments?Caruso: John summarized our thoughts about PayPal. It's taking market share, we expect it to grow in the high teens over the next three years and it complements our Visa (V) exposure.IBD'S TAKE: PayPal is a former stock on IBD's SwingTrader, an exclusive IBD feature that helps you take advantage of short-term trends by applying the rules of IBD's CAN SLIM Investing System in a swing trading environment.

27,SPGI,"The end-of-summer blahs and elevated geopolitical uncertainty took their toll on the stock market and stock mutual funds in August, which notched their first losses of the year.XAfter having fallen nearly 2% around mid-August, the broad stock market in the form of the S&P 500 rallied to close the month with a 0.31% gain. It was lifted by such leading stocks and Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Visa (V) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) as well as technology leader Grubhub (GRUB).Lagging, U.S. diversified stock mutual funds lost 0.35% on average. Large-cap growth funds did best, tacking on 1.47%, while small-cap value funds did worst, losing 2.44%. ""Overall, investors generally treaded water in August,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist for Ameriprise Financial (AMP). ""The good news pretty much offset the bad news. The market did not turn decisively either way.""The broad benchmark's modest gain extended the market's winning streak to 10 months. The S&P 500 edged up to an 11.93% gain year to date. U.S. diversified stock funds were left with a 9.05% year-to-date return.Mutual fund managers who spoke with IBD expect many of their opportunities for new gains to come from technology innovators and from ""quality"" companies — firms capable of churning out earnings growth even in a slow economic growth environment.Factors that heartened investors last month included a weak dollar, which boosted U.S. exports, said manager Daniel Strickberger, whose $211 million Touchstone Large Company Growth Fund (TSAGX) topped 95% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Direct in August. In addition, manufacturing showed strength, based on the monthly Institute of Supply Management report. Overall U.S. employment posted gains, though less than in July.""Retail sales and consumer sentiment were pretty good,"" Joy said.But negative factors included soft inflation numbers, which is a sign of tepid overall economic growth. The defeat of health care reform signaled that tax reform and infrastructure spending are uncertain, Joy said.And geopolitical tension involving North Korea contributed to investors' skittishness, Strickberger said.In addition, low inflation could help persuade the Federal Reserve to slow its interest-rate hikes. ""Interest rates are heading to where they were six to nine months ago,"" said Stephen DuFour, manager of $1.7 billion Fidelity Focused Stock Fund (FTQGX), which topped 97% of its large-cap growth rivals last month. ""Over the long run, falling rates usually help utilities and hurt financials.""In contrast to U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, world stock mutual funds eked out a 0.84% gain in August. Latin American funds led that charge, rising 4.35%.Many investors sought safe havens last month. Taxable bond funds in general advanced an average of 0.51%. They were led by U.S. Treasury bond mutual funds, which gained 1.93%. Muni funds also advanced on average. And precious metals stock mutual funds topped sector fund categories, racking up a 6.10% advance.Despite August's market blahs, Ameriprise's Joy is guardedly optimistic going forward. U.S. economic growth remains muted but positive, he said. Global growth, at least in developed markets, is at its strongest since the recession. Many foreign central banks are continuing monetary policies that support stocks. And he expects large U.S. businesses to continue to benefit from a weak dollar through at least year-end.Model portfolios that Ameriprise recommends to its financial advisors' clients remain overweight in the technology sector, which in general still has room to run, Joy said. Those model portfolios' weightings in emerging markets stocks have also been boosted but are still underweight.China remains strong. Latin American economies are healing, he said.Fidelity's DuFour also sees attractive trends in the tech sector. Digital advertising, electronic payments and the growth of exchange traded funds (ETFs) ""are areas to get excited about,"" he said. He cited holdings as of July 31.A digital advertising name in which he had a stake was Adobe Systems (ADBE). Its business model has morphed. It used to sell its programs via computer disks through brick-and-mortar retailers. Customers would have to upgrade by buying new disks every few years.""They've evolved into software-as-a-service, where you pay on a monthly basis, and you've always got access to the latest version of a program,"" DuFour said.Once you create your digital product, Adobe also can monitor the online traffic it attracts and help clients manage online advertising campaigns. In addition, they have a commercial image library. That multiservice approach positions Adobe to benefit from the growth of digital media and online advertising, DuFour said.""PayPal (PYPL) is growing with the growth of electronic payments around the world,"" DuFour said. ""They have done a good job of increasing the number of places that accept PayPal, and they have a higher percentage of online transactions than physical store ones. As online commerce grows at the expense of physical stores, they are net gainers.""PayPal also owns Venmo, which is a payments service that lets users divvy up payments for shared goods or services. It is popular among millennials.S&P Global (SPGI) is poised to benefit from the growth of ETFs. The company has exited education books and ownership of Businessweek to focus on three areas in which the company provides data to clients. One of those areas consists of the indexes that customers like State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) license for the ETFs that they build and operate. ""S&P Global's business is very exciting and has very substantial margins,"" DuFour said.In other sectors, Touchstone's Strickberg cites Zoetis (ZTS) as ""the sort of quality, predictable growth company we like. We want companies that will prosper whether U.S. GDP growth is 0% or 3%,"" he said.Roughly half of sales by the developer of animal medicines and vaccines are for livestock rather than pets. Commercial agricultural sales don't fluctuate much in economic ups and downs. That steadiness makes it ""the kind of business we look for,"" Strickberger said.The $9.8 billion Vanguard Primecap Core (VPCCX), a large-cap growth fund and an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner, edged up 0.36% last month. It owns ASML Holding (ASML), a Dutch maker of lithography systems used to create computer chips. Shares have climbed 39% this year.The stock has a very strong 98 Composite Rating from IBD and an A SMR Rating. Scored on a scale of 1 to 99, stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.IBD'S TAKE: ASML's A SMR Rating means the semiconductor equipment maker is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula. Buying stocks with high SMR ratings at proper buy points increases your chances of investment success.  RELATED:Here's An Easy Routine To Get You Started In Stock InvestingWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?Some Investors Turns More Defensive Even As Market Rises Again

32,SPGI,"To beat the stock market and mutual fund peers, having the right stocks isn't enough. It's having them at the right time that counts. And Alger Spectra Fund (SPECX) has done that in spades in the past 10 years and is doing so again this year.The fund, managed by Patrick Kelly since 2004 and Ankur Crawford since 2015, has cranked out an average annual gain of 10.55% in the 10 years since April 1, 2007, vs. 7.71% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 7.51% for the S&P 500. This year the $5.3 billion fund has raced ahead 11.04% vs. peers' 8.62% and the broad stock market's 6.07% gains.It's doing that thanks in large part to the double-digit gains notched by nearly 40% of its publicly traded stocks so far in 2017.Blue chip stocks, including a bevy of tech beauties, are a big part of Spectra's story right now. Top-10 holdings Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Visa (V) and Broadcom (AVGO) were all double-digit climbers, with returns ranging from Visa's 14% to Apple's nearly 25%.Other big gainers for the fund included Adobe Systems (ADBE), up 26%; Alibaba Group (BABA), whose ADRs were up 24%; and S&P Global (SPGI), up 21%.Through Monday afternoon, Amazon, Facebook, Broadcom and Alibaba were advancing yet again. The $4.78-billion market cap Cavium (CAVM), punching way above its weight class, was also rising — again. So was United Rentals (URI). Each was pushing back up near all-time high levels.Most of those stock market winners can also be found in Spectra's peers and the major stock indexes like the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500. But it's the managers' handling of the fund's investment process that has made the performance difference.IBD'S TAKE: Alibaba is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Retail-Internet industry group. It has a solid 95 Composite Rating and four years in a row of earnings per share growth. See how its additional easy-to-understanding fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' — including No. 4-rated Amazon.com — at IBD's Stock Checkup.Lead manager Kelly and Crawford, who advanced to her manager role after joining Alger as a research assistant in 2004, have notched their gains mainly by sticking to their investment approach, even when that means sidestepping sectors that have benefited from the ""Trump bump"" stock market rally.The crux of their approach is to seek growth stocks that are undergoing what they call ""positive dynamic change"" — high-unit-volume growth and positive life-cycle change.Kelly, 42 years old, and 41-year-old Crawford talked about their strategy and holdings with IBD from their offices in New York City.IBD: What does the positive-life-cycle-change part of your strategy mean?Kelly: In a positive life-cycle change, we're looking for earnings acceleration and multiple expansion driven by the positive change.IBD: How much of your portfolio consists of life-cycle change, how much consists of high-unit-volume growth?Crawford: About 10% of the portfolio is both, and the remainder is split half and half.IBD: Since the election, a lot of money managers have focused on playing sectors that they believe will benefit from Trump initiatives and a Republican Congress. However, with the failure to repeal or reform ObamaCare, many investors are concerned about the outlook for those policy moves. How are you playing this?Kelly: You highlighted one of the big market risks. Can the administration deliver on its promises? We're still optimistic that administration policies will be more supportive of U.S. business and GDP growth. With a lot of companies we've invested in, we're staying the course.IBD: Across the board?Crawford: The procyclical bias favoring materials is outside how we invest. With materials, we don't see a positive life-cycle change per se vs. a cycle to be played. In banks, however, there is much change. We expect they will benefit from lower regulation.We didn't take our industrials positions up dramatically because we worried about the very thing you're talking about, and industrials have given up some gains on those fears. However, in technology there are secular growth drivers that, regardless of policy, we expect will play out.IBD: The tech sector is your largest weighting. Why?Kelly: We continue to be big on trends in the internet, software and semiconductors. We believe tech will be a big beneficiary of trends in the mobile internet, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and Big Data.IBD: What are some examples?Kelly: Amazon's Alexa (a voice-capable interactive personal assistant) is an AI device. It will prove disruptive to the retail sector.Apple is a life-cycle change company with a growing services business and an upcoming product-cycle services that should be an anchor that mutes the cyclicality of any product cycle.IBD: Is there also a potential Trump Trade boost for, say, Apple?Kelly: If tax repatriation takes place, Apple has $100 billion sitting (outside the U.S.) that would make them a beneficiary. It would either allow them to do a pretty significant buyback or, for companies that are legacy companies, it would give them the ability to positively life-cycle change. They can buy assets that let them turn their big ship around.IBD: Let me ask about some individual companies as of your latest disclosure. Do you like Alibaba because of any one part or do you like it because of its many parts together?Kelly: Our thesis is that Alibaba is one of the most dominant companies in the world. It's the dominant e-commerce platform in China. They also have leading positions in video, payments, logistics and cloud computing in China. We continue to believe platforms such as Alibaba and Amazon are extremely disruptive and underappreciated by the market.IBD: What has enabled earnings per share for Cavium (CAVM) to grow again after four quarters of declines?Crawford: For us, this is a classic unit-volume-growth story. They're a semiconductor company that will benefit from the upcoming 5G infrastructure upgrade. There will be a need to build faster data centers and to move to ARM-based servers (which are a category of reduced instruction set computing, or RISC, architectures for computer chips, which cut costs, heat and power use). Cavium has a complete portfolio of infrastructure IT to address the next generation of networks. These product cycles will drive content growth and market-share gains, which we expect will drive significant revenue and earnings accretion over the next three years.IBD: Any concern about Facebook's EPS growth slowing for two quarters in a row?Kelly: Internet advertising will experience rapid growth. And we expect Facebook to continue to take market share. It's also in the early stages of monetizing Instagram and its rapidly growing 600-million user base. Facebook has other medium- to long-term monetization levers, including Messenger, WhatsApp and their Oculus Rift platform.IBD: Netflix's (NFLX) quarterly EPS growth has accelerated. Any clouds on the horizon?Crawford: It's a transformative company that single-handedly changes the way we consume content. We are concerned that their free-cash-flow and earnings potential resides in the out years (in the future). They're able to get leverage only as they've seeded the global market.We see additional international penetration; the ability to increase pricing from the current offering of $10 a month in the U.S., which we believe is greatly underpriced for the value; and their ability to monetize their user base using creative advertising methods. We believe they can double their user base and revenues in the next five years.IBD: Broadcom has accelerated EPS growth for four quarters in a row. Are you comfortable they can keep this up?Crawford: They're one of the best examples of life-cycle change. They have a visionary CEO (Hock Tan), who via acquisitions and organic growth has driven earnings up ninefold over the last seven years. And we believe he's not done.Broadcom should continue to see further earnings accretion and now capital return to shareholders because it's generating $6.5 billion to $7 billion in free cash flow, which is about 30% of its revenue in free cash flow.IBD: Morgan Stanley has pulled back from its March high on investors' fears that corporate tax reform and lowering banks' regulatory burden is not the slam dunk many thought they would be. What's your thesis?Kelly: They've undergone significant change. Wealth management was only 5% of their business in 2006. Now it's roughly 50%. We believe that shift to a higher margin, less-capital-intensive business can drive return-on-equity expansion and multiple expansion. And financials in general should still benefit from regulatory relief and higher interest rates.IBD: Which of your strategic drivers does Adobe represent?Crawford: It's both a lifecycle-change and a high-unit-volume-growth company. And it is dominant in its market, and should have sustainable midteens revenue growth for the next three to five years, with over 20% earnings growth in that period.Digital advertising is the high-unit-volume-growth part of their business. They provide a platform that enables customers to deploy digital advertising.The life-cycle change is in the creative products part of the company, which has undergone a fast transition and is continuing to grow their total available market, as their products are adopted more broadly.And Adobe is adding more solutions, such as Fotolio, which is competitive with Shutterstock. It's a site where photographers can display their images and content-creator customers can use their images. It's a subscription type business, which allows for increased average selling price per customer.IBD: United Rentals (URI) has traded sideways near its all-time high since its January earnings report. Do you still like it?Kelly: It's one of the leading equipment rental companies in the U.S. Postelection, investors expected it to benefit from construction, from corporate tax reform and improving GDP growth. It (stalled) because there is uncertainty about the prospects for an infrastructure bill. If one passes, United would be a big beneficiary. Trump is also pro-energy, so a buildout of pipelines should benefit United.IBD: S&P Global (SPGI) has mostly gone sideways since Congress failed to repeal or reform ObamaCare. Is that a problem for S&P?Crawford: It's not a problem yet. S&P is another market dominant company. It is one of effectively two players in the ratings business, where they enjoy secular growth in debt issuance due to global economic growth and regulator constraints on banks. Combined with their information services business and their index business, 70% of their business is recurring.Adding to that, they are pruning their portfolio and using the proceeds to buy back shares.IBD: The fund's outperformance in the past 10 years got a boost from the fund's 56.52% gain in 2009. What worked so well for the fund that year?Kelly: We follow our philosophy and process in all markets to deliver strong long-term results for our clients. Looking at one year is not the lens we use to view the performance of the fund... (On the other hand, we) have had consistently strong performance over any three-year rolling period over the past 10 years. I think that is the better metric to focus on than any one year.IBD: What's your process for building positions in a stock?Kelly: Building positions depends on the stock and a variety of other factors. We continually assess risk-reward and look to rotate money into the names that we think have the most favorable risk-reward.IBD: You are active managers. Some people say active management at least in mutual funds is doomed. What do you think?Kelly: We're in a highly competitive market. You need to be able to drive good performance over a multiple-year period. We've been able to do that. That will continue to be our challenge going forward.

34,SPGI,"While exchange traded funds are ideal for producing short- and long-term investment gains, many ETFs can be deployed to generate steady income from stock dividends and bond interest.ETF investment strategies for generating income fall into five main categories:The highest yielding U.S. bond ETF tracked by Morningstar Inc. right now is SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond (JNK). Its 12- month yield sits near 6%. It's followed by First Trust Tactical High Yield (HYLS) yielding 5.6% and SPDR Short-Term High Yield Bond ETF (SJNK) yielding 5.5%.But seeing a fat yield on an ETF can be misleading. A big payout doesn't mean as much if the fund's total return is slipping. JNK has returned 11.31% year to date and an average annual 2.53% the past three years. That compares with 7.16% and 4.13% for HYLS and 10.8% and 1.64% for SJNK.Ranked by three-year returns, the top performer is Pimco 25+ Year Zero Coupon U.S. Treasury (ZROZ), up an average annual 18.39% the past three years and 20.44% year to date, and yielding just over 2%. It is followed by Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury (EDV), up 17.1% and 18.6% over the respective periods, and yielding 2.4%. Next is iShares 20 Year Treasury Bond, at 11.8% and 13.1%, and yielding 2.2%.Junk bonds and long-duration Treasury bonds are subject to bouts of heightened volatility, which investors looking for income often seek to avoid. So they're better off using ETFs that track these kinds of bonds as part of a diversified portfolio that contains steadier bonds.The benchmark for diversified bond portfolios is the Barclays Aggregate Bond index, which is made up of a broad array of investment-grade bonds. The index is tracked by iShares Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG), which has $190 billion in assets. It's up 5% year to date and an average annual 3.96% the past three years. It yields 2.3%.Those who prefer bonds need to be aware that anticipated interest-rate hikes could affect potential returns.In general, bond ETFs with higher durations will be more negatively impacted than those with shorter durations as expectations increase for higher rates. Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of bond price to changes in interest rates. Duration is tied to a bond's maturity, or the date at which the bond's principal is repaid to lenders. Investors can check an ETF's website for the average duration.For example, if rates rise, a long-term ETF such as iShares 20 Year Treasury (TLT) incurs more interest rate risk than iShares 3-7 Year Treasury (IEI), notes Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF Research at S&P Global Market Intelligence.""In short, if rates trend higher over time, returns for bond ETFs will be negatively impacted, but not equally,"" he said. ""However, one rate hike by the Fed should not be that impactful.""The highest yielding ETFs can bring big payouts, but if the quality of their holdings declines, the total return could be sapped by declining prices in unfavorable markets. The top yielding dividend stock ETF is Global X SuperDividend Alternatives (ALTY), paying out 8.2% of its stock price annually. It's a small, young ETF with just $3 million in assets and without a three-year record. It's up almost 19% this year.Its older and bigger sibling, $807.4 million Global X SuperDividend (SDIV), yields 6.7% and has gained 12% this year and an average annual 11.27% the past three years.High-yield stock investors tend to prefer stocks whose declines are about over. In that way investors can reap big payouts for each dollar invested with the hopes of capital appreciation as the business turns around. Not all ETFs screens for stocks in this way. One that does is Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF (DIV). Its index methodology screens for stocks that have exhibited low betas relative to the S&P 500 in an effort to produce low-volatility of returns. It's up 9% this year and has risen an average annual 6.8% the past three years. Top holdings include Cone Midstream Partners (CNNX) and Invesco Mortgage Capital (IVR).At the other end of the spectrum, lower yielding ETFs invest in companies that have a long history of increasing dividends. Only top quality companies can increase payouts year after year, and they tend to be in big demand by investors looking for steady capital appreciation. Their stock prices rarely get whacked to the point where they have big yields.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers Select Index. It holds 185 stocks, each of which has grown dividends annually for 10 years or more. It yields 2.1% vs. SPDR S&P 500's (SPY) 2%. Top holdings include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Microsoft (MSFT) and Pepsi (PEP)ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) holds 50 stocks, a smaller list that reflects a higher barrier to entry -- each holding has raised dividends every year for 25 years or more. It yields 1.8%. Top holdings include Cintas (CTAS), W.W. Grainger (GWW) and S&P Global (SPGI).SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), which invests in dividend aristocrats from the S&P Composite 1500, has jumped 15% year to date. It yields 2.4%. Top holdings include property REIT HCP (HCP), People's United Financial (PBCT) and Caterpillar (CAT).Safe to say, MLPs are best left to the pros who know when to get in or out, or how to use them as portfolio diversifiers.Morningstar tracks 20 REIT ETFs. The top-performing one year to date is Global X SuperDividend REIT (SRET). It's up 27.4% this year and yields about 8%, the third-highest. The index it tracks, the Solactive Global SuperDividend REIT index, invests in 30 of the highest dividend-yielding REITs in the world with the least amount of volatility.Nearly all of the $33 million ETF's assets are invested in North America. Top holdings include mortgage REITs Annaly Capital Management (NLY), which yields 10.1%, and Chimera Investment (CIM), yielding nearly 12%, as well as property REIT Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH) yielding 6.6%. The REIT was launched in March 2015.The biggest REIT ETF is $35.59 billion Vanguard REIT (VNQ). It's up 14% year to date and yields 3.3%. Its top holdings along with their year-to-date price performance include Simon Property (SPG), up 12%, Public Storage[ticker symb=PSA] down 7%, and Prologis (PLD) up 30%. They all yield about 3%.Convertible bonds are bonds that can be exchanged for a set number of the issuing company's common stock. They tend to carry lower interest than normal corporate bonds but have the potential for greater price appreciation.The top performing ETF in this area year to date is $471 million VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials (PFXF). It's up 12% and yields 5.6%. The largest is $17.86 billion iShares U.S. Preferred Stock (PFF). It's up 3.8% this year and yields 5.74%.RELATED:The Latest ETF News

37,SPGI,"The Nasdaq took a stab Tuesday at its best gain in more than two months as the stock market approached the day's last hour of trade.Blue chips lagged with a 1.2% gain for the Dow industrials, while the S&P 500 stepped up 1.3%. The Nasdaq and the small cap Russell 2000 led with pops of 1.9% and 2%, respectively. Volume was higher on the NYSE and slightly lower on the Nasdaq, compared to the previous session.Technicals are improving in the stock market. The Nasdaq retook its 50-day and 200-day lines Tuesday. The S&P 500 also reclaimed its 50-day line (after climbing above the 200-day line in March). Recently, the Nasdaq's 50-day line crossed back above its 200-day line, which is a positive development.The Dow industrials were up almost without exception Tuesday afternoon, with 29 of the 30 stocks rising, including Visa (V), which added 2.8%, its biggest percentage gain since early March. Visa's volume, though, was below average Tuesday. Boeing (BA) was the Dow's only loser, down 0.6% in strong volume.Is Visa's stock overdrawn with selling, or is the stock ready to charge higher? See IBD Stock Checkup.Top-rated stocks featured many breakouts and new highs. Stocks breaking out included TurboTax provider Intuit (INTU), chip designer Ceva (CEVA), joint replacement maker Zimmer Biomet (ZBH), telecom software developer BroadSoft (BSFT), water heater maker A.O. Smith (AOS) and financial data and analytics provider S&P Global (SPGI). S&P Global was formerly known as McGraw Hill Financial.New highs included designer of organic LED devices Universal Display (OLED), chip designer Nvidia (NVDA), software developer Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR) and chip designer MaxLinear (MXL).Economic reports released Tuesday offered grist for the bears and bulls alike.For the bears: The Richmond Federal Reserve's manufacturing index for May was weaker than expected. Wall Street had projected a reading of 8, but the figure came in at -1, a sign of contraction. In April, the reading was 14. Manufacturing weakness has been a concern in recent months. U.S. manufacturing accounts for about 12% of GDP.For the bulls: New-home sales in April trounced expectations. The Street's consensus estimate was 523,000, but the economy posted 619,000 -- a stunning 18% beat and the highest level in more than eight years. The figure easily topped the entire range of estimates, which ran from a low of 510,000 to a high of 530,000.Homebuilder stocks rose in response, with gains mostly in the 3% to 5% range, but many of the stocks remain far off their highs. Toll Brothers (TOL) jumped more than 8% Tuesday on a strong quarterly report, but the stock was still about 30% below its August peak.Two homebuilder stocks have better-looking charts than most in their group. D.R. Horton (DHI) is 8% off its high, and NVR (NVR) is only 5% off its high.

39,SPGI,"S&P Global Inc. (SPGI  -  Free Report) yesterday announced that it has reached a deal to acquire RateWatch business from New York-based financial news and information company, TheStreet, Inc.The deal, subject to working capital and certain other customary adjustments involves purchase of all the assets of the RateWatch business for $33.5 million in cash. TheStreet expects to receive nearly $32 million of proceeds (assuming full payout of customary escrows and net of taxes and transaction-related expenses and fees).The buyout is unlikely to have any material impact on S&P Global’s 2018 adjusted earnings per share (EPS), which is expected to be in the range of $8.45-$8.60. The return on invested capital (ROIC) is likely to surpass S&P Global’s required rate of return after three years.Mike Chinn, president of S&P Global Market Intelligence and executive vice president, Data and Technology Innovation for S&P Global, stated, ""RateWatch's robust datasets complement and strengthen our core capabilities of providing differentiated data and analytics solutions for the banking sector.""A glimpse at S&P Global’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse on a year-to-date basis. Shares have returned 22.5%, significantly outperforming the industry’s rally of 15.3% year to date. Boosts Market Intelligence SegmentRateWatch will be integrated into S&P Global’s newly formed reportable business segment - S&P Global Market Intelligence (""Market Intelligence""). This is expected to boost S&P Global Market Intelligence's community bank analytics and data offerings. With a contribution of almost 28% to total revenues, the segment is currently the second biggest contributor to the company’s total revenues.Revenues from this segment were $437 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 9% year over year. The improvement came on the back of growth across Desktop (7% growth), Data Management Solutions (13%), and Risk Services (8%). Adjusted operating profit increased 4% to $129 million. Adjusted operating profit margin declined 150 basis points to 30% due to heavy investments in commercial and technology.The company expects Market Intelligence margins to improve in the second quarter of 2018 as well as in the full year. Additionally, the segment is likely to positively impact the company’s overall margin for 2018.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, S&P Global is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (DNB  -  Free Report), TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) and FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.

40,SPGI,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for S&P Global Inc. (SPGI  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 5% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is SPGI due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.First Quarter ResultsS&P Global reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2018 results.Adjusted earnings of $2.00 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents and increased 24% on year-over-year basis. The improvement can be attributed to revenue growth, operating leverage and U.S. tax reform that decreased the company’s adjusted effective tax rate to 21.7% from 30.3% in the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $1.57 billion outpaced the consensus mark by $27 million and increased 8% year over year. The top-line improvement was driven by growth in all business segments.Segmental RevenuesRatings’ revenues increased 5% year over year to $748 million driven by an increase in non-transaction revenues, which increased 11% to $380 million. Non-transaction revenues were driven by substantial increase in new entity ratings and Rating Evaluation Service fees as well as fees associated with surveillance. Transaction revenues inched down 1% to $368 million due to decline in corporate bonds and public finance, which was partially offset by gains in structured products.Market Intelligence revenues were up 9% year over year to $437 million primarily driven by growth across Desktop, Data Management Solutions, and Risk Services. Platts revenues improved 3% to $196 million owing to growth in the core subscription business, partially offset by a decline in Global Trading Services. S&P Dow Jones Indices revenues surged 25% to $214 million mainly driven by a 59% rise in revenues related to exchange-traded derivatives activity. Also, revenues from asset-linked fees improved 21%.Operating ResultsThe company’s adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter expanded 10 basis points (bps) to 47%. Going by segments, Ratings and S&P Dow Jones Indices adjusted operating profit margins improved 190 and 160 bps, respectively. The same from Market Intelligence and Platts declined 150 and 310 basis points, respectively.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAt the end of the quarter, S&P Global had cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion compared with $2.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. Long-term debt was $3.1 billion, in line with the previous quarter. The company generated cash from operating activities to the tune of $360 million compared with $353 million in the previous quarter. Free cash flow was $277 million, down from $306 million in the the fourth quarter of 2017. In the first quarter, the company returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through a combination of $127 million in dividends, $1 billion in the form of an accelerated share repurchase agreement and $100 million in open market share purchases.2018 GuidanceAdjusted EPS are expected to be in the range of $8.45-$8.60 per share. Midpoint of this guided range is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.50. GAAP EPS is anticipated to be in the $7.95-$8.10 band.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to three lower. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more upward momentum. There has been only one move down in the last two months.S&P Global Inc. Price and Consensus  S&P Global Inc. Price and Consensus | S&P Global Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, SPGI has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for growth and momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, SPGI has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

(SPGI  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the bell.We expect S&P Global's results to be driven by strength across all segments, margin improvement and positive impacts of U.S. tax reforms.We observe that shares of S&P Global have gained 43.4% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 16.1% rally.Here are the expectations in detail.Top Line to be Driven by Strength Across all SegmentsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.54 billion, reflecting an increase of 6% when compared with the year-ago quarter’s actual figure. The improvement is expected to be driven by strength across all the segments — S&P Global Ratings, S&P Global Market and Commodities and S&P Dow Jones Indices.S&P Global Ratings’ revenues are expected to be driven by an increase in both transaction and non-transaction revenues. Revenues at the S&P Global Market and Commodities Intelligence are likely to improve backed by increase in organic revenues. Surge in exchange-traded products and increased derivatives trading should drive S&P Dow Jones Indices revenues.In the fourth quarter, S&P Global’s total revenues of $1.59 billion were up 13.6% year over year.S&P Global Inc. Revenue (TTM) S&P Global Inc. Revenue (TTM) | S&P Global Inc. QuoteBottom Line to be Driven by Revenue Growth & Tax Cuts The consensus estimate for adjusted EPS is pegged at $1.98, mirroring year-over-year growth of 22.2%. This significant increase in the metric is likely to be driven by robust revenue growth and margin improvement backed by productivity initiatives, divestitures and synergies realization.Also, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that reduced corporate tax rates significantly from 35% to 21%, is expected to benefit S&P Global’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.In the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS was $1.85, which improved 44.5% year over year.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

45,SPGI,"TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2018 results.Adjusted earnings of 57 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents and improved 36% year over year. Lower tax rate, resulting from Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, significantly benefited the company’s earnings in the reported quarter.Total revenues of $537 surpassed the consensus mark by 6.1% and were up 18% (17% on a constant-currency basis). The improvement was driven by strong double-digit growth in each of the operating segments — U.S. Information Services (USIS), International and Consumer Interactive — positive contribution from acquisitions of DataLink services, FactorTrust and eBureau  as well as contribution from incremental credit monitoring business from a competitor.Shares barely moved in the afterhours trading, following the earnings release. Over the past year, the stock has rallied a massive 67.6%, significantly outperforming the industry’s 15.9% gain.Concurrent with the earnings announcement, TransUnion announced its agreement to buy Callcredit Information Group — the second largest and fast-growing consumer credit bureau in the U.K. This buyout should help the company boost its international expansion strategy and contribute significantly to its long-term top- and bottom-line growth.We expect TransUnion to continue benefiting from a strong business model, diversified revenue streams, significant operating leverage, low capital requirements, and strong and stable cash flows.Let’s delve deeper in to the numbers:Revenues by Operating SegmentsThe U.S. Information Services revenues of $342 million were up 21% year over year driven by strong performance in all the three platforms within the segment.

Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA margin remained flat at 37.7% mainly because of two reasons. First, roughly two-thirds of the incremental monitoring revenues from a competitor were used in advertising, marketing and litigation in the company’s international segment. Second, the company incurred significant cost related to three acquisitions namely DataLink services, FactorTrust and eBureau.Total adjusted operating income was $173 million, up 17% from the year-ago quarter, primarily owing to top-line growth. Total adjusted operating margin contracted 30 basis points to 32.1% in the quarter.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowTransUnion had $154.3 million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter compared with $115.8 million in the prior quarter.

47,SPGI,"Investors on the lookout for stocks with the potential for maximum growth and value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.This popular strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive growth prospects that are trading at a discount. GARP investing employs popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio – to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps to identify stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only nine.Here are six of the nine stocks that made it through the screen:Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) is engaged in designing, manufacturing and marketing mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players.

48,SPGI,"On a whole, 2017 proved to be great year with the markets displaying a solid bull run. The benchmark S&P 500 index has gained 20% year to date and is on the course to record its best performance in four years while Nasdaq has surged 29.1%. Buoyed by a healthy economic growth and tax overhaul euphoria, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up an impressive 25.7% year to date and is close to hitting the historic figure of 25,000.The U.S. economy has taken some positive strides throughout the year buoyed by rise in consumer spending, improvement in labor market, higher customer confidence and rise in wages. Additionally, three interest rate hikes this year by the Fed, indicating inherent economic stability, have boosted investors’ confidence. As the curtains roll down on an eventful year, let us do a quick recap of the top performing Business Services stocks of 2017.Sector TailwindsThe Business Services sector accounts for the lion’s share of the U.S. GDP and recorded a solid year-to-date average rally of 19.9% — on par with the S&P 500. The primary growth drivers in this highly fragmented industry hinge on a healthy economy owing to a positive correlation along with decent prospects of job growth, higher disposable income and new business initiatives. Enjoying the fruits of a resurgent job market, low inflationary pressures and cheaper oil bills — consumer confidence has also held its fort, further propelling the sector’s growth.  The sector covers an array of services including marketing, consulting, staffing, security, telecommunications, Internet services, logistics and waste handling. An ideal mix of services, effective marketing strategies and ability to retain and attract new customers make the perfect recipe for profitability for most of the companies within the sector.Key PicksAmid a diverse range of companies in this arena, we have selected four stocks that have fared better than the index with the help of the Zacks Stock Screener.

49,SPGI,"U.S. equity market has had a stellar return so far this year. In fact, since the financial crisis in 2009, investors have pocketed stupendous returns. In those nine years, a $9,000 investment in the S&P 500 has turned into $49,200.However, recently, a number of market pundits are concerned that the bull runs that have sent the bourses to record highs might soon come crashing down. And why not? Rise in interest rates, likelihood of a new tech bubble and a pricey stock market are potential bottlenecks to investors’ hard-earned money. Valuation measures such as price-earnings ratios are increasing caution.Amid such uncertainty, investing in dividend aristocrats seems prudent, as they provide higher total returns with lower volatility, which are undoubtedly the ‘holy grail’ of investing. Such companies are also likely to make the most of the tax reform legislation and a steadily growing economy.Will You Have Money in Your Pocket as Fed Raises Rates?As widely expected, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the third time this year. The benchmark lending rate was hiked by a quarter percentage point to the range of 1.25-1.5%. In fact, Fed officials expect to raise rates at a steady pace in the coming years. The median expectation for rate hikes next year is pegged at three, at least two in 2019 and two more in 2020 (read more: Fed Hikes Rates: Top 5 Winners for 2018).Looming interest rate hikes mostly spell bad news for stock markets. Given that a rate hike will force consumers and business houses to pay more to borrow money it will eventually leave them with less money to spend.Tech Bubble, Overvaluation ConcernsThat said, a possibly bigger threat to the stock market is the bubble developing in the tech space. Silicon Valley’s major players including Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) are currently the three largest companies in the world in terms of market capitalization.Even though stellar growth of Apple, Microsoft and Amazon have given a boost to the stock market, their sheer size is a threat to the market if they start faltering. Moreover, experts believe that chances of these declining in the near future are a lot higher, as most technology stocks including these are priced too high compared to what they earn. This replicates the late Nineties, when the stock market was plagued by the so-called ‘dotcom’ bubble burst.In fact, two-third of the money managers finds the U.S. stock market’s recent record run unsettling. The gains in the current nine-year-old bull market are nearly 300%. This is now the second-strongest bull run since World War II, trailing only to a massive gain of 417% during October 1990 and March 2000, per data compiled by LPL Financial and FactSet Research Systems Inc. This year, the 30-stock Dow Jones has set record highs 70 times, the broader S&P 500 hit highs 53 times and the tech-heavy Nasdaq continues to hover near the coveted 7,000 mark.Time to Buy Dividend Aristocrats for 2018Given such an uncertain scenario, if you have money, where should you invest? Buy dividend aristocrats as they have tremendous financial strength and are immune to market vagaries. They reflect solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals.

These agreements align perfectly with the company's innovative recycling pricing model and are likely to generate incremental revenues.Moving ForwardThe transaction further reinforces Republic Services’ commitment to its Blue Planet sustainability initiative that aims at increasing its recycling capacity by an additional 150,000 tons or more per year by 2018.

Waste Management's successful cost-reduction initiatives have further helped it achieve remarkable gross margin expansion and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) growth over the quarters.In addition, Waste Management plans to return significant cash to shareholders through healthy dividends and share repurchases in the future. A steady dividend payment policy is part of Waste Management’s long-term strategy of providing attractive risk-adjusted returns to its stockholders. The company’s investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to execute its growth strategy. Furthermore, decent dividend increases at periodic intervals have been one of the company’s most attractive features.With strong yield, volume, and cost performance in the third quarter, the company has raised its guidance for 2017. It expects 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of $3.19 to $3.21 per share compared with earlier expectations of $3.14 to $3.18. Free cash flow is expected between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, up from previous expectations of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. Such a bullish outlook raises investor confidence in the stock.With diligent execution of operational plans, the stock has outperformed the industry year to date with an average return of 15.4% compared with 12.1% gain for the latter.However, stringent government regulations are likely to contract margins as compliance with such regulations increases operating costs for the company. In order to develop or operate a landfill or any waste management unit, facility permits and other governmental approvals are necessary. These permits and approvals are often difficult to obtain, are time consuming and costly and could restrict its operations. All these are likely to impact the company’s profitability in the long term.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the solid growth prospects of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

59,SPGI,"The frenzy for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Men's Division I Basketball Tournament is not limited to the sports space but spreads to the investment world as it fuels growth in various corners. As such, millions of Americans are seeking to capitalize this opportunity by enthusiastically filling in the brackets that could lead to handsome returns from the stocks to be wagered on.Popularly hailed as “March Madness,” the NCAA is underway with the champion slated to be crowned on April 2, at Alamodome in San Antonio, TX. Since the basketball tournament has advanced to the Sweet Sixteen level (to be played on Mar 22), let’s fill in 16 stock brackets first and then compare those like we do for March Madness to get to the real winner.How to Pick Sweet 16 StocksAkin to the basketball championship, we have chosen four sectors – retail and wholesale, computer and technology, business services and basic materials – out of 16 Zacks sectors that have outperformed over the past one year.

Let us once again dig into the Zacks Industry Rank of the four stocks to decide the contenders.Conn's Inc. (CONN  -  Free Report) – Zacks Industry Rank in the top 27%Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) – Zacks Industry Rank in the top 0%Copart Inc. (CPRT) – Zacks Industry Rank in the top 5%VALE S.A.

(VALE  -  Free Report): Here, earnings at Copart are expected to grow 34.88% while VALE earnings will see growth of 1.35%. As a result, CPRT wins and will again matchup with Conn's Inc. for the championship.The Championship (April 2)Let’s look at our VGM Score (V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum), which is simply a weighted combination of the three. The VGM score when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential with a frenzy of cheap price, robust growth and strong momentum.Conn's Inc. finally wins over Copart Inc. with a VGM Score of A against D for the latter.ResultBased on our internal research and metrics, Conn's, having a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM Score of A, has emerged as the winner of the 2018 March Madness contest and could be a top bet for this year. While it was exciting and fun to dribble toward the winning stock, we expect the twists and turns in the NCAA tournament to lead to some dramatic moves in the investment world.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

63,SPGI,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for S&P Global Inc. SPGI). Shares have added about 3.8% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is SPGI due for a pullback?

The significant year-over-year decrease in earnings was primarily due to gains culminated in the prior-year quarter from business divestitures. Moreover, tax expenses incurred due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in fourth-quarter 2017 further reduced earnings. GAAP earnings for full-year 2017 were $1,496 million or $5.78 per share compared with $2,106 million or $7.94 per share in 2016.Revenues for the quarter were $1,589 million compared with $1,399 million in the year-ago quarter.

The growth came on the back of substantial increase in high-yield bond, structured products and bank loan ratings. Moreover, non-transaction revenues increased 12% to $388 million driven by growth in fees associated with surveillance, entity ratings and short-term debt. Adjusted operating profit increased 40% year over year to $439 million for adjusted operating margin of 56% (up 810 bps year over year).S&P Global Market and Commodities Intelligence revenues increased 7% year over year to $637 million primarily driven by growth in organic revenues. However, the segment’s adjusted operating profit increased 13% to $233 million while adjusted operating profit margin increased 200 bps to 37% led by strong revenue growth, divestments of lower margin businesses and SNL integration synergies.S&P Dow Jones Indices revenues rose 12% to $191 million in the reported quarter due to a surge in exchange-traded products and increased derivatives trading. Adjusted operating profit increased 16% to $122 million.Financial AspectsAs of Dec 31 2017, S&P Global had cash and cash equivalents of $2,779 million compared with $2,392 million reported at the end of the previous year.

64,SPGI,"S&P Global Inc. (SPGI  -  Free Report) recently inked an agreement to acquire Kensho Technologies Inc. for approximately $550 million in a combination of cash and stock, to boost its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and thwart competition. The transaction is likely to be completed by early second-quarter 2018, subject to the fulfillment of mandatory closing conditions and other regulatory approvals.Based in Cambridge, MA, Kensho is a premier provider of next-generation AI, analytics, machine learning and data visualization systems to leading investment firms and banks in the Wall Street as well as the National Security community. This Harvard Square start-up firm has created a niche market for itself since its inception in 2013 by developing and deploying scalable AI systems to solve some of the hardest analytical problems across the globe.The buyout will facilitate S&P Global to improve its core operations by applying actionable insights through the use of AI solutions and sophisticated algorithms, thereby augmenting its efficacy. On the other hand, the transaction will enable Kensho to leverage S&P Global’s deep data sets, global-scale analytics platforms, essential benchmarks and strong leadership team to better serve clients while retaining the independent brand identity.The acquisition is the second of its kind. The first was S&P Global’s buyout of a New York-based data analytics private company, Panjiva Inc. in February. Panjiva — a leader in machine learning and data analytics — provides deep, differentiated, sector-relevant insights on global supply chains, leveraging data science and technology to make sense of large, unstructured datasets. It offers customers macro data covering 95% of global trade flows and transactional data covering 35% of the same. S&P Global expects Panjiva to enhance its Global Market Intelligence's data and analytical offerings for diverse customers throughout the world, generating higher top-line growth. With such opportune acquisitions, S&P Global has outperformed the industry in the last six months with an average return of 24.2% compared with a gain of 13% for the latter.S&P Global expects the Kensho acquisition to be dilutive to its GAAP earnings for 2018 and has accordingly revised its earlier guidance. It currently expects GAAP earnings in the range of $7.95-$8.10 per share, down from earlier expectations of $8.15-$8.30. However, adjusted earnings’ guidance is reiterated at $8.45-$8.60 per share.S&P Global carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Barring minor hiccups, the company’s share price has steadily been on an uptrend since mid-September. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has the potential for further price appreciation with long-term earnings growth expectations of 10%.Growth DriversTransUnion has an attractive business model with highly recurring and diversified revenue streams, significant operating leverage, low capital requirements and strong and stable cash flow. The inherent nature and significance of its solutions in customers’ decision-making endow it with high customer retention and revenue visibility. Impressively, it deals with the 10 largest U.S. banks, top five credit card issuers, the biggest 25 auto lenders and thousands of healthcare providers and federal, state and local government agencies. Also, the company makes significant investments to modernize its infrastructure and facilitate the seamless transition to the latest Big Data and analytics technologies. This enables TransUnion to expand its business and improve cost structure.The company’s gigantic treasure trove of data is its most distinguishing asset and is perhaps the biggest barrier to entry for competitors. TransUnion has more than 30 petabytes of data, growing at an average of above 25% annually since 2010. Acquiring or building such data involves huge costs, making it extremely difficult for a new company to build the contacts and data that TransUnion already has. This fortifies its ability to sustain its competitive advantage and protect its market share.TransUnion Price and Consensus  TransUnion Price and Consensus | TransUnion QuoteAs emerging market economies continue to develop and mature, the company is well-positioned to gain from the associated favorable socio-economic trends. Additionally, increased risk of identity theft due to data breaches and higher consumer awareness about the importance and usage of their credit information are propelling the demand for TransUnion’s consumer solutions.TransUnion’s addressable market includes the burgeoning Big Data and analytics, which is expanding rapidly as companies comprehend the advantages of building an analytical enterprise where decisions are derived from data and insights. Numerous underlying trends are supporting this market growth, including the creation of massive amounts of data, advances in technology and analytics that allow data to be processed more swiftly and efficiently for key insights across industries and geographies.With favorable growth dynamics, TransUnion raised its full-year 2017 guidance.  Consolidated revenues are currently expected to be in the range of $1.91 billion to $1.92 billion (a year-over-year increase of 11% to 12% on constant currency basis), up from $1.87 billion to $1.88 billion expected earlier. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be between $1.85 and $1.86 compared with earlier projections of $1.79-$1.82.Such a bullish outlook with continued growth impetus and core focus perhaps boosted investors’ confidence and catapulted its share price to a new 52-week high.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks in the industry worth considering are S&P Global, Inc.

68,SPGI,"Waste management firm Republic Services, Inc. (RSG  -  Free Report) recently inked a definitive agreement to acquire ReCommunity Holdings II, Inc., the largest independent recycling-processing firm in the United States, for an undisclosed amount. The strategic acquisition is likely to complement Republic’s existing recycling business and enable it to better serve its customers across multiple markets.With 26 recycling centers in 14 states, ReCommunity operates single-stream recycling and multi-material processing facilities that transform waste materials into reusable items.

According to the terms of the agreement, S&P Global Market Intelligence (a division of S&P Global) will provide transcript coverage of public as well as private companies to Thomson Reuters’ users for enhanced data analysis. This includes complete coverage of firms in the S&P 500 and other leading stock market indices.The company completed the acquisition of SNL Financial for $2.2 billion. SNL Financial is a strategic fit for S&P Global and is likely to complement the S&P Capital IQ and Platts businesses, which will help the latter avail cost cuts and revenue synergies. Moreover, it will enable global expansion on a greater scale especially within the banking and insurance sectors while media and real estate areas emerge as new opportunities. SNL Financial has been delivering consistent mid-teens revenue growth for the last 10 years. Also, its subscription-based revenue model with high renewal rates and strong future revenue visibility bodes well for S&P Global. The acquisition is expected to generate synergies of $70 million of EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) by 2019 and a tax benefit (net present value) of $550 million. We expect these collaborations and acquisitions to bode well to the company’s profits in the years to come.Other Stocks to ConsiderA couple stocks other worth considering in the industry are ManpowerGroup Inc. (MAN  -  Free Report) and TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report). Both stocks carry the same Zacks Rank as S&P Global.

74,SPGI,"FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FDS  -  Free Report) has made a remarkable run in the last six months. The stock has returned 32.3% during the said time frame, significantly outperforming the industry's gain of 14.2%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 11% and a market cap of $8.2 billion seems to be a stock that investors need to hold on to if they are looking to reap long-term gains.Let’s delve deeper to look at the factors influencing the company’s performance.FactSet, a provider of global online integrated data-related products and services for the investment community regularly enhances product portfolio to address the requirements of the industry it caters to.Additionally, its strategy of expanding through acquisitions is praiseworthy. The company’s most noticeable acquisitions include the buyout of BISAM, IDMS, Portware LLC, Code Red, Revere Data LLC, StreetAccount, to name some.We believe, the enrichment of the offerings via innovations and acquisitions has assisted the company in expanding clientele as well as global footprint. The addition of 65 clients in first-quarter fiscal 2018 which took the tally to 4809 is a testament to the fact. The company’s Annual Subscription Value (“ASV”) increased to $1.32 billion as of Nov 30, 2017, up 12.8% from the year-ago quarter figure of $1.17 billion. However, a declining client retention ratio is a major concern. The company’s client retention ratio in the first quarter was 90%, tanking 300 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter and 100 bps from the previous quarter. This remain a concern over the company’s top-line growth in near-term.Additionally, the industry being a highly competitive one with the likes of players such as Bloomberg L.P., Thomson Reuters Inc. and S&P Global Inc. (SPGI  -  Free Report), FactSet continues to face strong headwinds.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderFactSet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some of the better-ranked stocks in the same industry space are IHS Markit Ltd. (INFO  -  Free Report) and Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (DNB  -  Free Report) both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

75,SPGI,"If you’re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects.However, one should not confuse GARP investing with the blend strategy. While the blend strategy promotes investment in both value and growth stocks, GARP investing requires both value and growth features in a single stock.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to make the strategy foolproof.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2 (Only Strong Buy and Buy-rated stocks can get through.) Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than X-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 16.Here are seven of the 16 stocks that made it through the screen:Teradyne, Inc. (TER  -  Free Report) is a leading supplier of automation equipment for test and industrial applications.

76,SPGI,"S&P Global Inc. (SPGI  -  Free Report) has inked a deal to acquire the New York-based data analytics private company, Panjiva Inc. The terms and conditions of the buyout remain undisclosed. S&P Global’s management expects the deal to help enhance its Global Market Intelligence's data and analytical offerings for diverse customers throughout the world, generating higher top-line growth.Panjiva — a leader in machine learning and data analytics — provides deep, differentiated, sector-relevant insights on global supply chains, leveraging data science and technology to make sense of large, unstructured datasets. It offers customers macro data covering 95% of global trade flows and transactional data covering 35% of the same. The transaction, therefore, is likely to be profitable for S&P Global’s future earnings expectations.However, S&P Global does not expect the deal to have any material impact on its adjusted earnings per share in 2018 and is likely to be accretive in 2019 once the return on capital invested exceeds the company's hurdle rate post integration. By and large, market prospects too seem to be favorable for the acquirer on the back of Panjiva’s core strength in leveraging machine intelligence in combining 1 billion transaction records into a proprietary supply-chain graph that will be attributable to S&P Global’s market intelligence segment. It provides risk evaluation, investment research and data to potential investors, corporations, governments, financial institutions, investment managers and financial advisors globally.  S&P Global has outperformed the industry in the last three months, with an average return of 15.1% compared with growth of 6.3% for the latter.   S&P Global has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

78,SPGI,"The U.S. GDP increased 2.6% in the fourth quarter, down from 3.2% in the prior quarter, largely due to higher imports as consumer spending recorded the highest rise in three years. The paradoxical GDP tally masks the bullish overall economic sentiment buoyed by some sweeping policy changes by President Donald Trump.The historic overhaul of the tax structure to reduce tax liabilities from 35% to 21% has boosted corporate earnings, stoked investments and trickled down to employees in some instances. In addition, Trump’s pledge to spend $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years and regulatory rollbacks remained tailwinds. Improvements in the labor market and rise in wages have led to higher consumer spending. Additionally, three interest rate hikes in 2017 by the Fed, indicating inherent economic stability, have boosted investors’ confidence.Economic Growth MomentumThe U.S. manufacturing activity continued its robust performance in December as the manufacturing index measured by the Institute for Supply Management recorded 59.7%, bringing the average tally for 2017 to 57.6% — the highest since 2004. Fueled by domestic business investments, improving global economies and steady spending by American households, the manufacturing activity is likely to move north in the near future.  There were 148,000 job additions in December and the economy added about 2 million jobs in 2017. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1% - the lowest in 17 years, due to higher participation rate of 62.7% as more people looked for work, a clear indication that the economy is improving. Wages improved 2.5% from the year-ago period.Enjoying the fruits of a resurgent job market, low inflationary pressures and cheaper oil bills, consumer confidence strongly held its fort. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence index increased to 125.4 in January from 123.1 in December, signifying optimism about the U.S. economy.As the companies take stock of the situation and deliberate on their future course of action, let’s take a look at how the fourth-quarter earnings are shaping up so far for the business services sector.Business Services Sector PerformanceAbout 15.4% of the total S&P 500 companies in the Business Services sector reported their earnings through Jan 24, 2018. With a ‘beat ratio’ of 75%, total earnings for these companies are up 10.7% year over year. Revenues increased 7.7% from the year-ago period, with a ‘beat ratio’ of 75%.The entire sector is expected to perform lower than the overall index. The earnings growth expectation for the sector is 6.8% versus 11.6% for the S&P 500. (Read: Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon's Q4 Earnings)The primary growth drivers in this highly fragmented industry hinge on a healthy economy with decent prospects of job growth, higher disposable income and new business initiatives. An ideal mix of services, effective marketing strategies and ability to retain and attract new customers make the perfect recipe for profitability for most of these companies.Given the forecast, it might be a good idea to zero in on a handful of Business Services stocks that are poised to beat earnings estimates this quarter. An earnings surprise is likely to help these stocks outperform in the near term.How to Pick?The Business Services sector covers an array of services including marketing, consulting, staffing, security, telecommunications, Internet services, logistics and waste handling.

80,SPGI,"Robert Half International Inc. (RHI  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 30, 2018, after the closing bell. Notably, the top- and bottom-line results of this leading staffing solutions provider have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters.Considering this, let’s delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the fourth quarter and 2017 has been stable over the past 30 days at 63 cents and $2.58, respectively. Projected earnings for the fourth quarter depict year-over-year growth of 3.2%, while the same for the year shows a decline of 3.4%, respectively.However, management expects fourth-quarter earnings in the range of 29-39 cents per share after considering the impacts of the latest tax reforms. This includes one-time charges of approximately $34-38 million (amounting to nearly 27-31 cents per share) to its provision for income taxes.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $1,312 million for the fourth quarter, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.Robert Half International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Robert Half International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Robert Half International Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayInternational Revenues Expected to RiseRobert Half’s international revenues have been surging, courtesy of rising demand for professional staffing services. This has been a persistent trend since the first quarter of 2014. Further, the company’s temporary staffing services have been on the rise globally, as employers are building flexible staffing options in human resources plans. The company has been investing heavily in tapping the evolving prospects in the technology staffing area, over the past few years.Driven by such efforts, international revenue growth, mainly from the European regions provided some cushion to Robert Half’s otherwise soft figures in third-quarter 2017. During the quarter, currency-neutral staffing revenues from international regions jumped 11% from the prior-year quarter. Also, international revenues grew 12% year on year in the Protiviti segment.Such trends are likely to continue favoring the company’s international revenues during the fourth quarter as well.Trends in the United States Bode WellMoving on, while Robert Half’s U.S. revenues were soft in the third quarter, management stated that trends improved in September 2017 and continued till October 2017. Evidently, temporary and consulting staffing revenues improved 2.1% in September and 2% in the first two weeks of October. Also, permanent placement revenues advanced 7.2% in September, while it surged 21% in the first three weeks of October.Moreover, the latest tax reforms in the United States are expected to increase hiring activities. The benefits from lower tax rates may propel companies to allocate more capital for increasing headcount to support business growth. This can significantly bolster Robert Half’s business in the forthcoming periods.  These factors along with an overall improved economic scenario in the United States, encourages management about growth in the forthcoming periods. Moreover, the company’s investments in digital technology are expected to enhance service offerings to clients and candidates both in the United States and internationally.  Headwinds Likely to Weigh on PerformanceRobert Half’s Protiviti segment has been witnessing declining operating margins since the beginning of the year 2016. This is due to lower gross margins and a lesser number of higher margin clients. Third-quarter gross margin for Protiviti declined 130 basis points to 29.6%, which dented the company's profits. Also, this segment witnessed revenue drop of about 4% to $209 million in the quarter.All said, let’s wait and see if the aforementioned growth drivers can help Robert Half offset these headwinds in the quarter to be reported.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Robert Half is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although Robert Half carries a Zacks Rank #2, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

Management is focusing on internal drivers like disciplined pricing and tough control on productivity to ensure uninterrupted profitability. Through the sound restructuring initiatives and cost recalibration, the company hopes to increase its margins further.ManpowerGroup currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

82,SPGI,"Marketing services provider Harte Hanks, Inc. (HHS  -  Free Report) recently amended its credit facility to augment its liquidity and improve financial flexibility. The modified credit agreement is likely to provide the means to undertake strategic investments to spur long-term growth of the company.The amended credit facility increases Harte Hanks’ borrowing capacity from $20 million to $22 million. The modified credit agreement with Texas Capital Bank also extended the debt maturity by a year to April 2020. Harte Hanks intends to utilize the modified debt facility to meet its working capital requirements and for general corporate measures.The credit facility is secured by substantially all assets of the company and its material domestic subsidiaries. It is guaranteed by HHS Guaranty, LLC, an entity formed to provide credit support for Harte Hanks by certain members of the Shelton family (descendants of one of its founders).The improvement in credit facility is part of the measures undertaken by the company to boost its operating metrics and raise share price in accordance with the continued listing standards of the NYSE. In December last year, Harte Hanks received a notice from the benchmark index for failure to maintain an average closing price in excess of $1.00 for a 30-day period. Consequently the company was awarded a six-month cure period to conform to the NYSE listing standards and avoid delisting.In order to avoid such a scenario, Harte Hanks has decided to adopt a 10 for one reverse split of its shares, likely to be effective on Jan 31, 2018. As a result, 10 corporate shares would be effectively merged as a single share of higher face value, thus offering it an opportunity to comply with the listing rules.Harte Hanks has underperformed the industry in the last three months with an average loss of 9.5% compared with 2.2% decline for the latter. Whether the improved liquidity measures would help the company to have a significant turnaround in its operations remains to be seen.Harte Hanks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

91,SPGI,"The earnings season is in full swing with about 183 S&P 500 companies reporting this week. About 97 S&P 500 companies have already released their results till Jul 21, reconfirming broad-based expectations of better-than expected earnings. Total earnings for these 97 companies (accounting for 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization) are up 8.4% year over year on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% beating earnings estimates and 72.2% surpassing top-line expectations. Based on the hitherto observed pattern, the Apr–Jun 2017 quarter is anticipated to register high single-digit percentage earnings growth on a year-over-year basis.  Per the Earnings Preview, overall earnings for all the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up 8.6% on 4.7% growth in revenues. Although it represents a slightly tempered growth projection compared with the double-digit growth rate of the previous quarter, the dollar amount of the total earnings is likely to be on par or even better than the all-time high achieved in fourth-quarter 2016. The relative improvement in the quarterly performance is largely due to a turnaround in the economy, better job market scenario and rising oil prices. Experts widely believe that earnings growth is likely to be in double digits in 2018 and beyond.For the April–June quarter as a whole, about five of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to witness an earnings decline, with Autos, Conglomerates and Utilities being the biggest drag.The Business Services sector appears reasonably healthy. For the sector, earnings are expected to improve 9.4% year over year while sales are touted to rise 4.4% due to higher disposable income and new business initiatives.Let’s take a sneak peek at five major Business Services stocks scheduled to report earnings tomorrow to see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Republic Services, Inc.

94,SPGI,"The U.S. GDP is likely to grow around 1.5% in the third quarter, a fall from 2.1% in the prior quarter, mainly due to the devastating hurricanes — Harvey and Irma. Despite the setbacks, the overall economic sentiment remained fairly bullish buoyed by some sweeping policy changes proposed by President Donald Trump, which are likely to take effect in the ensuing quarters.The investor-friendly policies including a pledge to spend $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years, overhaul of the tax structure to reduce tax burden and regulatory rollbacks, are likely to spur higher consumer spending. They are also expected to create about 25 million new jobs over a decade. The GDP is expected to pick up pace in the fourth quarter and grow at an annualized rate of 2.6% as Trump’s policies gradually take center stage, tempered slightly by the geopolitical situations across the globe.Economic Growth MomentumU.S. manufacturing activity continued its robust performance and reached a 13-year high in September as the manufacturing index measured by the Institute for Supply Management recorded 60.8% — the highest since May 2004. This also serves as a precursor to the solid economic growth expected in the near future.On an average, there were 172,000 job additions per month till September, when the economy lost 33,000 net jobs due to natural calamities. However, the unemployment rate fell to a 16-month low to 4.2% in September due to higher participation rate of 63.1% as more people looked for work, a clear indication that the economy is improving.Enjoying the fruits of a resurgent job market, low inflationary pressures and cheaper oil bills, consumer confidence strongly held its fort. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index decreased slightly to 119.8 in September from 120.4 in August due to the storms, signifying optimism about the U.S. economy.As the companies take stock of the situation and deliberate on their future course of action, let’s take a look at how the third-quarter earnings are shaping up so far for the business services sector.Business Services Sector PerformanceAbout 16.7% of the total S&P 500 companies in the Business Services sector reported their earnings results through Oct 18, 2017. With a ‘beat ratio’ of 100%, total earnings for these companies are up 11.6% year over year. Revenues increased 5.8% from the year-ago period, with a ‘beat ratio’ of 100%.The entire Business Services sector is expected to perform slightly lower than the overall index. The earnings growth expectation for the sector is 0.8% versus 3% for the S&P 500. (Read: Positive Start to the Q3 Earnings Season).The primary growth drivers in this highly fragmented industry hinge on a healthy economy with decent prospects of job growth, higher disposable income and new business initiatives. An ideal mix of services, effective marketing strategies and ability to retain and attract new customers make the perfect recipe for profitability for most of these companies.Given the forecast, it might be a good idea to zero in on a handful of Business Services stocks that are poised to beat earnings estimates this quarter. An earnings surprise should help these stocks outperform in the near term.How to Pick?The Business Services sector covers an array of services including marketing, consulting, staffing, security, telecommunications, Internet services, logistics and waste handling.

95,SPGI,"With improving economic and labor market conditions, hiring services in the United States have gradually picked up pace. However, Robert Half International Inc (RHI  -  Free Report) is yet to reap significant gains from such conditions. This is because the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the both the top and bottom line depicts a probable year-over-year decline.The Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2017, which has been stable in the last 30 days, is currently pegged at 69 cents, and is within management’s guidance of 66-72 cents per share. The consensus mark is down couple of cents from the year-ago quarter.Robert Half, which is slated to report on Oct 24, is expected to witness a decline in net revenues owing to sluggishness in its Protiviti segment and Global Staffing Division. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of net revenues for the third quarter is expected to decline 0.6% to reach $1,331 million from the year-ago period. The estimated figure, however, falls within the guided range of $1,305-1,365 million for the said quarter.  We note that the company’s revenues have lagged estimates in three out of the past four quarters. On a year-over year basis, revenues have declined in the trailing three quarters.Segment DetailsRevenues in the Protiviti Division are expected to decline 9.2% in the quarter under review. This segment has been lacking high-margin clients, leading to lower revenue opportunities. Although Robert Half has been trying to achieve a turnaround in this segment through acquisitions and business agreements, they are yet bear any considerable impact upon the company’s performance.The company’s Global Staffing Division has been struggling lately, owing to weakness in its domestic operations.However, net services revenues from the temporary and consulting staffing arena are expected to increase approximately 1%, per analysts polled by Zacks. Of late, there is an increase in demand for temporary and consulting professionals. Additionally, higher demand for temporary workers for the upcoming holiday season is expected to benefit revenues from this division. However, the upside may not be sufficient to offset the overall declines expected at Global Staffing and Protiviti segments.Robert Half International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Robert Half International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Robert Half International Inc. QuoteTailwinds In an effort to counter ongoing challenges and gain opportunities for growth, Robert Half has been heavily investing in technology.

The acquisition of RevenueMed will further strengthen its position as the leading provider of end-to-end revenue cycle management services and expand its platform to include global offshore capabilities 24 hours a day.HeadwindsNavigant has underperformed the industry with an average year-to-date decline of 35.3% as against a gain of 15.4% for the latter. The company operates in a highly labor-intensive sector. Ideally, the sector should employ a skilled workforce to keep up with the evolving business environment. However, as skilled workers are always in high demand, there remains a possibility of high attrition rate within the sector.On the other hand, training of unskilled workers increases operational costs, thereby affecting margins. The business service sector is highly fragmented with no single service provider possessing dominant market share to rule the industry. Hence, Navigant faces stiff competition from a number of peers while acquiring and maintaining clients for its different business segments, which could further reduce its profitability.Zacks Rank & Key PicksNevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

104,SPGI,"Shares of waste management firm Republic Services, Inc. (RSG  -  Free Report) scaled a new 52-week high of $69.12 during yesterday’s trading session, before closing a tad lower at $68.44 for a healthy return of 19.6% in the past year. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has the potential for further price appreciation with long-term earnings growth expectation of 8.5%.Growth DriversRepublic Services is currently focusing on a series of quality acquisition opportunities, primarily of recycling assets, which are likely to act as a catalyst for a healthy long-term growth within its top 25 markets. The company is also transitioning to a fee-based recycling processing model to cover processing costs and generate a healthy return on investment.During third-quarter 2017, Republic Services acquired ReCommunity Holdings II, Inc. — the largest independent recycling-processing firm in the United States — for an undisclosed amount. The strategic acquisition is likely to offer an unrivalled competitive advantage in the recycling business that continues to be one of the fastest growing segments of the waste stream. In addition, the deal will also facilitate Republic Services to gain control of multiple long-term municipal agreements of ReCommunity with processing fee-based structures. These agreements align perfectly with the company’s innovative recycling pricing model and are likely to generate incremental revenues.  Moreover, Republic Services has pledged its commitment to the Blue Planet sustainability initiative that aims at increasing its recycling capacity by an additional 150,000 tons or more per year by 2018. As part of this initiative, the company is steadily building durable practices and programs to further improve its environmental and social impacts through decreased vehicle emissions, innovative landfill technologies, more use of renewable energy and community engagements.In addition, Republic Services continues to generate significant free cash flow, which is utilized for increased dividend payment, repurchasing shares and strategic acquisitions. Over the years, the company has returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends or share repurchases. It has always boasted a conservative balance sheet with a healthy liquidity position. The stock has performed almost in line with the industry in the last three months with an average return of 7.4% compared with 7.5% gain for the latter.Moving forward, it aims to focus on prudent investment decisions for a disciplined capital allocation, strong and flexible balance sheet position and cash flow enhancement to support dividend growth. Such moves, along with a robust operating platform and an efficient management team will likely help in the execution of its strategic priorities and drive net asset value in the future.All these factors probably raised investor confidence and drove the company’s shares to a fresh 52-week high.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the industry include Black Knight, Inc.

105,SPGI,"Growth at a reasonable price or GARP is an excellent way for investors to make some quick gains. This strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount.The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth and solid prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only four.Here are four stocks that made it through the screen:The Toro Company (TTC  -  Free Report) is a leading worldwide provider of innovative solutions for the outdoor environment, including turf, snow and ground engaging equipment and irrigation and outdoor lighting solutions.

(SPGI  -  Free Report) reported solid fourth-quarter 2017 results with adjusted net income of $474 million or $1.85 per share compared with $334 million or $1.28 per share in the year-earlier quarter. Earnings comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.63 per share.

The significant year-over-year decrease in earnings was primarily due to gains culminated in the prior-year quarter from business divestitures. Moreover, tax expenses incurred due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in fourth-quarter 2017 further reduced earnings. GAAP earnings for full-year 2017 were $1,496 million or $5.78 per share compared with $2,106 million or $7.94 per share in 2016.Revenues for the quarter were $1,589 million compared with $1,399 million in the year-ago quarter.

108,SPGI,"S&P Global, Inc. (SPGI  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens. In the previous quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.7%. Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters with an average beat of 9.2%. Nonetheless, it remains to be seen if the company will be able to keep its earnings streak alive.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Likely Earnings Beat in the CardsOur proven model shows that S&P Global is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The Most Accurate estimate for the company stands at $1.58 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $1.56. So the difference – the Earnings ESP – is +1.28%. A positive ESP combined with the company’s Zacks Rank #2, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.S&P Global Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  S&P Global Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | S&P Global Inc. QuoteWhat’s Driving the Better-than-Expected Results?S&P Global’s focus on its core business is helping it emerge as a leader among rating providers, benchmark providers and analytics in the global capital as well as commodity markets. It completed several business divestitures in third-quarter 2016 including the sale of J.D. Power, its two pricing businesses SPSE and CMA, and the equity research business. The impact of these divestitures is likely to be seen in its second-quarter results as well.The company also completed the acquisition of SNL Financial for $2.2 billion. It is a strategic fit for S&P Global as its business is in sync with the S&P Capital IQ and Platts businesses, which will help the company avail cost cuts and revenue synergies. Moreover, it will enable global expansion on a greater scale especially within the banking and insurance sectors while media and real estate areas emerge as new opportunities. The acquisition will generate synergies of $70 million of EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) by 2019 and a tax benefit (net present value) of $550 million. It will also be accretive to adjusted earnings per share in 2017 and earnings on a GAAP basis in 2018.During the quarter, the company inked a strategic data agreement with business news provider, Thomson Reuters Corporation (TRI  -  Free Report) to expand its product portfolio. The collaboration is likely to benefit customers of both the companies. According to the terms of the agreement, S&P Global Market Intelligence (a division of S&P Global) will provide transcript coverage of public as well as private companies to Thomson Reuters’ users for enhanced data analysis. This includes complete coverage of firms in the S&P 500 and other leading stock market indices.We believe that the company’s strategic portfolio restructuring and focus on core business will continue to drive growth, going forward. This apart, strategic acquisitions and positive industry trends will benefit the company in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +2.89% and a Zacks Rank #1.

109,SPGI,"Robert Half International, Inc. (RHI  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Jul 25. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this global staffing firm will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. The company posted an average earnings surprise of 0.23% in the trailing four quarters.A glimpse of Robert Half’s stock performance shows that its shares have been underperforming the Zacks categorized Staffing Firms industry and the broader Business Services sector for the last six months. The stock dipped 0.4% against the above mentioned industry’s growth of 10.8% and sector’s improvement of 8.7%. Notably, the industry is part of the top 18% of the Zacks Classified industries (49 out of the 256), while the broader sector is placed at bottom 25% of the Zacks Classified sectors (12 out of 16).Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter and 2017 has been stable over the last 30 days. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents per share for the second quarter and $2.66 per share for 2017 reflects a year-over-year decrease of 7.9% and 0.2%, respectively. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.31 billion for the said quarter, down 2.4% from the year-ago period. For 2017, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5.22 billion, down 0.6% year over year.Robert Half International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Robert Half International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Robert Half International Inc. QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Robert Halfis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESPfor this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Robert Half has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 65 cents. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise.Factors Influencing the QuarterRobert Half is the world's largest specialized provider of temporary and permanent personnel in the fields of accounting and finance. Robert Half's total revenue has been improving on the back of higher demand for its professional staffing and consulting services. The company’s international operations also improved due to higher demand for staffing and consulting services.Moreover, Protiviti is also adding to the year-over-year revenue gains, which seem to be quite encouraging. Further, Protiviti has an impressive growth outlook due to a robust regulatory environment as well as increased need for stronger internal controls and data security measures.However, lower margins, currency fluctuations and rising health care costs remain the major concerns for Robert Half. In fact, lower margins, especially at Protiviti, are expected to take a toll on Robert Half’s profits.We note that the company’s sales have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in seven of the last nine quarters due to a decline in the U.S. staffing revenues. Currency headwinds are also denting sales.Nevertheless, Robert Half remains confident of performing well given the solid labor market and stable economic landscape. Also, it expects reduction in the hiring cycle and in turn boosting the company’s profitability. Further, Protiviti is enhancing its practice areas owing to digital expansion and data security measures.Robert Half issued its earnings and sales guidance for second-quarter 2017. The company expects revenues in the range of $1.275–$1.335 billion for the said quarter. In addition, it expects earnings in the range of 61–67 cents per share.Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesStocks in the business services sector that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank, and are therefore worth considering include:S&P Global Inc. (SPGI  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +2.58% and a Zacks Rank #2.

110,SPGI,"After a relatively lackluster performance in first-quarter 2017 with the GDP rising a mere 1.4%, the U.S. economy gradually picked up steam in the second quarter and reportedly grew nearly 2%. The overall economic sentiment remained fairly bullish buoyed by some sweeping policy changes proposed by President Donald Trump, which are likely to take effect in the ensuing quarters.The investor-friendly policies that include a pledge to spend $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years, overhaul the tax structure to reduce tax burden and regulatory rollbacks are likely to spur higher consumer spending and create about 25 million new jobs over a decade. The International Monetary Fund further anticipates the GDP to grow at an annualized rate of 2.1% in both 2017 and 2018 as Trump’s policies take center stage, tempered slightly by the geopolitical situations across the globe.Economic Growth MomentumThe U.S. manufacturing activity continued its robust performance in June as the manufacturing index measured by the Institute for Supply Management recorded 57.8% – the highest since Aug 2014. This also serves as a precursor to the solid economic growth expected in the near future.On an average, there were 194,000 job additions per month in the second quarter. The unemployment rate rose marginally to 4.4% in June due to higher participation rate of 62.8% as more people looked for work, a clear indication that the economy is improving.Enjoying the fruits of a resurgent job market, low inflationary pressures and cheaper oil bills, consumer confidence strongly held its fort. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index improved to 118.9 in June from 117.6 in May, signifying optimism about the U.S. economy.As the companies take stock of the situation and deliberate on their future course of action, let’s take a look at how the second-quarter earnings is shaping up so far for the business services sector.Business Services Sector PerformanceAbout 12.5% of the total S&P 500 companies in the Business Services sector reported their earnings results through Jul 12, 2017. With a ‘beat ratio’ of 66.7%, total earnings for these companies are up 20.4% year over year. Revenues increased 15.1% from the year-ago period, with a ‘beat ratio’ of 100.0%.The entire Business Services sector is expected to perform slightly lower than the overall index. The earnings growth expectation for the sector is 4.5% versus 5.6% for the S&P 500 index. (Read: Bank Earnings in the Spotlight).The primary growth drivers in this highly fragmented industry hinge on a healthy economy with decent prospects of job growth, higher disposable income and new business initiatives. An ideal mix of services, effective marketing strategies and ability to retain and attract new customers make the perfect recipe for profitability for most of these companies.Given the forecast, it might be a good idea to zero in on a handful of Business Services stocks that are poised to beat earnings estimates this quarter. An earnings surprise should help these stocks outperform in the near term.How to Pick?The Business Services sector covers an array of services that include marketing, consulting, staffing, security, telecommunications, Internet services, logistics and waste handling. Amid a diverse range of companies in this arena, picking the right stock for your portfolio could appear to be a colossal task. An easy way to narrow the list is by choosing stocks that have a favorable Zacks Rank and a positive Earnings ESP with the help of the Zacks Stock Screener.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining which stocks have the best chances to surprise with their next earnings announcement. The Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP is usually a harbinger of a likely earnings beat.We have mentioned three Business Services stocks below which match these criteria, and thus may be potential winners in second-quarter earnings.MDC Partners Inc.

111,SPGI,"On Dec 11, we updated the research report on waste management firm, Republic Services, Inc. (RSG  -  Free Report).Republic Services is currently focusing on a series of quality acquisition opportunities, primarily of recycling assets, which are likely to act as a catalyst for a healthy long-term growth within its top 25 markets. The company is also transitioning to a fee-based recycling processing model to cover processing costs and generate a healthy return on investment.Healthy Growth DynamicsDuring third-quarter 2017, Republic Services acquired ReCommunity Holdings II, Inc., the largest independent recycling-processing firm in the United States, for an undisclosed amount. The strategic acquisition is likely to offer an unrivalled competitive advantage in the recycling business that continues to be one of the fastest growing segments of the waste stream. In addition, the deal will also facilitate Republic Services to gain control of multiple long-term municipal agreements of ReCommunity with processing fee-based structures. These agreements align perfectly with Republic Services' innovative recycling pricing model and are likely to generate incremental revenues.With 26 recycling centers in 14 states, ReCommunity operates single-stream recycling and multi-material processing facilities that transform waste materials into reusable items. These include the recycling of discarded paper into eco-friendly home insulation, aluminum cans and containers to harvest bauxite ore — a raw material for virgin aluminum and PET bottles — into fresh new bottles or carpeting and clothing.In addition, Republic Services continues to generate significant free cash flow, which is utilized for increased dividend payment, repurchasing shares and strategic acquisitions. Over the years, the company has returned significant cash to its shareholders as dividends or share repurchases. The company has also historically promulgated a conservative balance sheet with a healthy liquidity position. The stock has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 14.2% compared with 13.8% gain for the latter.Moving ForwardRepublic Services has pledged its commitment to the Blue Planet sustainability initiative that aims at increasing its recycling capacity by an additional 150,000 tons or more per year by 2018. As part of this initiative, Republic Services is steadily building durable practices and programs to further improve its environmental and social impacts through decreased vehicle emissions, innovative landfill technologies, more use of renewable energy and community engagements. We remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Better-ranked stocks in the industry include S&P Global, Inc. (SPGI  -  Free Report), TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) and Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  S&P Global has a solid long-term earnings growth expectation of 12.5%. It topped estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.1%.TransUnion has a healthy long-term earnings growth expectation of 10%.Accenture has a solid long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.3%. It topped estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.6%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.
