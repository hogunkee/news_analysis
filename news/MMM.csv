9,MMM,"General Electric (GE) needs to boost its target for raising capital, even after its new transportation deal, to hit deleveraging targets, and may also have to consider another dividend cut, according to JPMorgan.GE still must come up with billions of dollars in additional capital to fix its balance sheet, analyst Steve Tusa wrote Tuesday, while reaffirming an underweight rating on GE shares and a year-end price target of 11.""With little available cash flow to naturally de-lever, we don't see how, from a risk mitigation perspective, a company of this size and complexity cannot be seriously considering at least a dividend cut and/or a more aggressive approach to reinforcing its capital base,"" he said.On Wednesday, CEO John Flannery warned there will be no profit growth at its core power business this year, adding that the company will see how its turnaround plans play out to determine the dividend.That may have been interpreted as leaving the door open to another cut, but sources told CNBC Thursday that GE doesn't have plans to cut its payout in 2019.Shares rallied 3% to 14.60 on the stock market today after diving 7% Wednesday on Flannery's bearish profit comments.JPMorgan's analysis followed news that GE's transportation unit will combine with Wabtec (WAB) in an $11.1 billion deal, providing GE with $2.9 billion in cash at the merger's close.But in Tusa's view, GE needs roughly $32 billion in capital, far more than its target of $20 billion in asset sales, to lower its debt-to-adjusted earnings ratio to 2.5.He identified possible sources of capital, saying its stake in Baker Hughes (BHGE) could be monetized for roughly $20 billion, while its stake in the merged Wabtec company could yield about $2 billion with other divestitures raking in $4.5 billion or so. But that would still leave a shortfall of $6 billion, Tusa said.Meanwhile, Reuters reported Tuesday that GE is looking for ways to sell off its insurance business, which forced the company to book a steep charge earlier this year.GE had promised in November to shed $20 billion in assets to soothe ratings agencies and find ""their way to get to 2.5x leverage,"" Tusa noted.But he found its leverage ratio is actually worse than generally accepted, estimating it at 4.4x vs. the 3.9x figure that Moody's (MCO) has estimated in its credit ratings.Moody's assumptions on GE's leverage recently ticked up from 3.2x in the fall of 2017, Tusa noted, after the firm included the impact of higher restructuring costs on earnings. Meanwhile, GE's pension obligations remain significant.Against that backdrop, the ""current dividend payout ratio remains too high for the company to deleverage over time simply from running its business,"" Tusa said.The stock bears a 48-cent annual dividend, yielding 3.1%, after the company sliced its dividend payout in half in November.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?Boeing Pounces On Lion Air Deal; Stock Soars On China's XiGE Will Offload One Of Its Oldest Businesses In New CEO's Biggest Deal

12,MMM,"A longtime Wall Street analyst who has watched his bull case for General Electric (GE) unravel fessed up to being wrong on GE stock in a note to clients Monday.""The bears won. The game is over,"" wrote Melius Research's Scott Davis, who has researched industrial equities for 25 years, including prior stints at Barclays and Morgan Stanley.Davis expressed embarrassment at ""being associated as a bull in the worst-performing stock of the year.""Nonetheless, he reaffirmed a buy rating on GE stock and a price target of 27, arguing that a breakup of the iconic company would boost valuations.Shares rose 1.4% to 14.27 on the stock market today, They have been straddling the 50-day moving average since the industrial giant's earnings and revenue beat in April. Among GE's Dow Jones peers, United Technologies (UTX) and 3M (MMM), advanced 0.7%.. Honeywell (HON) rose 7 cents to 144.23. Siemens (SIEGY) climbed 0.4%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHere are the lessons Davis learned from the mistake that he now owns up to:While GE management ""explained away"" degrading contract terms with customers, cash flow was a red flag, Davis said. Margins on industrial free cash flow went from 7.1% in 2015 to 4.8% in 2017.""When down payments decrease, final payments don't match up with product delivery, and receivables grow faster than revenue, there is usually a problem,"" Davis added.Although he sees early signs of improvement in GE's cash flows, a fix for the ""deep"" hole the industrial giant is in will take time.Warning signals included a disproportionate rise in risk tolerance and M&A deals outside GE's historical scope to questionable compensation packages and a dismissive attitude toward those who questioned the company, Davis said.He believes the creation at GE of ""smaller, more focused entities that can build their own cultures"" may repair the problem.The conglomerate's 18-member board under former CEO Jeff Immelt lacked experience in many of the areas where the conglomerate was making a big push — such as software and emerging markets, Davis said. Many also lacked expertise in core GE segments such as power generation, aviation and health care, he added.Now Davis is of the view that ""an unusually large number of board members"" is among the key signs of weak governance, along with lack of diversity and lack of talent in technology, especially software.The $143 million in fees for auditor KPMG can lead to potential conflict of interest and bad behavior, Davis said. It's now clear to him that ""the audit cost alone indicates a company that is way too complex"" — and the company's recent, delayed financial restatement has not allayed that fear. The late filing is another sign of complexity, he added.Davis had a turnaround thesis on GE last year, but later concluded that new CEO John Flannery had ""failed to see the depths of the company's problems and he had too much to fix for any one person to handle.""Davis noted that Flannery has been in charge almost a year now and ""we haven't seen much."" But he also noted that turnarounds that initially looked like they would take two years ended up taking three to five years at other companies.Davis admits his earnings model badly missed the ""the fast degradation in power markets and lack of recovery in oil/gas.""And he had recommended the stock ""while not fully understanding the risk in the insurance business"" and underestimating its complexity.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:GE Dividend Looks Safer On This Good News; Stock Tops Key LevelIf General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?From Boeing To GE, Companies Eye Trump's Decision On Iran Nuclear Deal

14,MMM,"General Electric (GE) got a price target hike based on the outlook for next year's earnings and free cash flow, but the troubled industrial conglomerate's shares could still go lower in the shorter term.Stifel analyst Robert McCarthy raised his price target to 15 from 13 in a note to clients Thursday, citing his estimate for 2019 EPS of $1.05 and industrial free cash flow (FCF) of 93 cents per share. He also raised his 2019 revenue view to $126.49 billion from $125.4 billion.But he maintained a hold rating on GE stock, saying he remains on the sidelines ""absent a more material, dynamic breakup.""Prospects for 2018, however, are a different story. McCarthy warned GE management is likely to lower core 2018 EPS and industrial free cash flow guidance after it announces further reductions in its sprawling portfolio, likely in Q2, adding downside risk to GE shares.While GE management has kept its 2018 EPS guidance at $1-$1.07, McCarthy cut his EPS outlook this year to 90 cents from 95 cents and trimmed his revenue view to $122.49 billion from $124.42 billion.GE is restructuring its businesses, and has signaled even its flagship power, health and aviation units could become separately traded companies.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

16,MMM,"General Electric (GE) will report first-quarter results Friday as it continues to slog through a restructuring of its vast portfolio of businesses that spans everything from jet engines to medical scanners.XAnalysts on average expect a 48% decline in Q1 EPS to 11 cents despite a 1% revenue increase to $27.88 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.The world's largest industrial conglomerate faces one of the worst slumps in its 126-year history while the global economy booms.After it posted years of weak earnings, new CEO John Flannery took the helm in August, vowing he will make ""2018 a reset year"" built on massive cost cuts, billions in asset sales, and a new strategic vision. Despite some progress on those fronts, problems have continued to mount.Notably, GE lowered its 2018 profit outlook and disclosed an SEC probe of its accounting practices. Investors responded by dumping its stock afresh, which now sits at its worst level since 2009.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseShares closed up 2.4% at 13.99 on the stock market today. Fellow Dow Jones industrial average industrial conglomerates United Technologies (UTX) and 3M (MMM), finished 0.8% and 0.3% lower, respectively.Here are five key areas to watch:Aviation is in the spotlight, after a jet engine made by GE's joint venture with Snecma blew apart in midair Tuesday, forcing a Southwest Airlines (LUV) flight to make an emergency landing and killing one passenger.Last week's accounting restatement also raised some flags. The aviation unit is the ""crown jewel"" of GE's vast business portfolio, according to investment research firm Morningstar.However, restated profits in aviation were flat in 2017 vs. 2016, JPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa said earlier this week. Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna chimed in that ""aviation profits were flattish"" despite a much more favorable backdrop in 2017 than it can expect in 2018.Higher oil prices will weigh on the unit, he said. Plus, deliveries of the advanced but loss-making LEAP jet engines are expected to ramp up.GE Power will also be in focus after Flannery's promise to ""reset, refocus, and renew"" the deeply troubled flagship unit. Power's earnings crumbled 45% in 2017. GE has warned that the gas-turbine market was ""far more challenging"" than it foresaw in 2017 and that the pain could persist into 2019.Management's 2018 outlook is unrealistic and will likely have to be lowered, analysts caution.Goldman Sachs' Joe Ritchie warned Monday that a cut to GE's $1.00-$1.07 EPS guidance for 2018 is ""almost a certainty"" after the restatements. He thinks it could happen during the Q1 earnings report.Cowen's Khanna is less certain that the compnay will cut its guidance this quarter, but warns it will ""capitulate"" sometime this year.Analysts on average expect full-year 2018 EPS of 96 cents, following a lowering of estimates in the past four weeks, according to Zacks Investment Research.The continued deterioration in GE Power is a big reason why analysts think the company will have to walk back its numbers.Cash is top of mind for Flannery — and investors in General Electric.For 2018, GE is targeting $6 billion to $7 billion in free cash flow. It needs $4.2 billion just to support its newly reduced dividend. Any cut to cash flow guidance will be another blow to investors who had long prized it as one of the best income stocks.Amid cash flow challenges, the company halved its annual dividend in November to 48 cents.""The dividend may be trimmed again,"" Khanna cautioned Thursday, reiterating a view shared earlier by both Cowen and JPMorgan. A slumping GE stock has raised the dividend yield to 3.5%.Contract assets grew $3.7 billion in 2017 to $28.86 billion. It's an area of concern, not only because those assets have swelled in recent years but also because its contract accounting is now drawing regulatory scrutiny.Contract assets reflect revenues that the company books on long-term equipment and service contracts before it gets the cash in hand.GE may address plans to convert its contract assets to cash in its call with analysts Friday, following the earnings release. In 2017, cash flows from contract assets were below GE's own expectations.Besides contract assets, management will also likely be pressed on plans to dispose of $20 billion in assets.So far, its deals have been relatively small fry, including a sale of its industrial solutions business for $2.6 billion and the sale of a health care technology unit for $1 billion. Proceeds from asset sales will help support the dividend.As GE mulls smaller asset sales, it has kept the option of a bigger breakup in play, with the core aviation, power and health units becoming separately traded assets.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?GE's Factory-In-A-Box Will Help It Expand This Key Business As Power WiltsGE Engine In Spotlight As Southwest, NTSB Probe Fatal FlightIs There A Way To Make A Million Dollars By Trading ETFs?

19,MMM,"General Electric (GE) plans to expand in gene therapy with prefabricated viral drug factories that can quickly scale up manufacturing to reach more patients and lower costs.XGE's health care unit announced that the new KUBio ""ready-to-run factory-in-a-box"" can pump out viral vector-based vaccines, oncolytic viruses to treat cancer, and gene and cell therapies faster than a traditional, stick-built facility.

Several treatments — such as GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Strimvelis, Novartis's (NVS) Kymriah and Kite Pharma-Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Yescarta — already have received regulatory approvals.""The market is moving towards more targeted therapies designed for smaller patient populations,"" Olivier Loeillot, a GE general manager, said in Tuesday's statement. But existing large-scale factories are not ideal for drug manufacturers looking to produce small batches of therapies, he added.Additionally, the KUBio factories can help drug makers to lower costs.Many advanced drug candidates for treating Ebola — the deadly West African outbreak —also use viral vector technology. The factory-in-a-box solution can address challenges tied to producing vaccines, which are critical to people around the world but generate low revenue for their manufacturers, the company says.GE looks to grow in the gene therapy business as it battles a severe downturn in its gas-turbine and power-plant business.  The power unit is likely to show a hit when first-quarter results come out Friday.Gene therapy is a risky but promising technique that may one day  allow doctors to treat disorders without conventional drugs or surgery, according to the National Institutes of Health.

20,MMM,"General Electric (GE) is exploring ""hybrid deals"" with public companies to combine assets that could include spinning off its transportation business, the Wall Street Journal reported.The so-called hybrid deals would give shareholders stakes in multiple public companies. They could be structured in a way that avoids a big tax bill from an outright sale, the report said.After examining several options for its struggling transportation business since the fall, GE may do an IPO after reportedly failing to find a buyer.An initial public offering or spinoff of the rail division appears near, the Journal said. It had reported earlier that the business is one of GE's oldest but is valued low, making a big tax bill likely if it is sold.Management doesn't have to look far afield or far back for inspiration as it considers hybrid deals. The 2017 deals that created Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE) and DowDuPont (DWDP) could serve as templates. The moves under consideration are part of CEO John Flannery's ongoing portfolio review as he looks to turn the embattled 126-year-old company around.But GE Capital could be up for sale although its ""liabilities and uncertainties might require GE to write a check to complete such a deal,"" the Journal said.

21,MMM,"General Electric (GE) stock should be avoided ahead of two key upcoming events and a further cut may come for the already halved GE dividend, according to Cowen.When GE reports first-quarter results April 20, an earnings miss ""appears probable,"" Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. He expects the conglomerate's largest Q1 profit declines will come from the power and transportation businesses. He also sees GE's planned accounting restatement adding pressure to ""this 'show me' stock.""GE's $1.00-1.07 adjusted EPS guidance for 2018 excludes $3.2 billion of pension and $2.5 billion of restructuring expenses, a 55-cent ""hit"" to GAAP EPS, Khanna said.

24,MMM,"General Electric (GE) surged Tuesday amid rising hopes that Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) Warren Buffett may buy a stake in the troubled industrial conglomerate.GE's sudden rally follows speculation that the billionaire investor will take a position, Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at William Blair, told Bloomberg.In January, Buffett said in a CNBC interview that he would consider investing in GE business at the ""right number.""He previously took a GE stake during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, investing $3 billion and gaining warrants that were eventually exchanged for GE common stock. Buffett bailed on GE stock in 2017 and rued the company's financial lapses earlier this year.Talk of Buffett taking a new GE stake comes amid massive changes at the industrial icon. In November, new CEO John Flannery outlined plans to slash GE's vast portfolio of businesses and its dividend to put the industrial giant back on the path to growth.Months later, he acknowledged GE is open to breaking up the company into separate public entities, among other options.In February, GE adopted a new accounting standard and promised more transparency to shareholders.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

25,MMM,"Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) supposed interest in taking a stake in General Electric (GE) would fit well with Warren Buffett's investment track record, an RBC analyst said.The remarks came after Bloomberg reported on speculation that Buffett might be interested in buying a stake in the beleaguered industrial conglomerate. The billionaire investor dumped his stake in GE in August.""In many ways, GE's current situation fits the profile of an ideal Warren Buffett investment,"" RBC's Deane Dray wrote in a research note late Tuesday.""One of his guiding principles is to 'be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.' GE is a 125-year-old iconic industrial brand with strong assets, market leadership in many industries, and a business model that Mr. Buffett understands, but is operating at a steep valuation discount today.""He also noted that Buffett told CNBC in January that he would consider buying stock in GE ""at the right price."" Buffett has also swooped in to rescue other legacy businesses whose struggles tanked their stock prices — namely Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and General Electric during the financial crisis, Dray said.Buffett could reportedly take a $14 billion stake in General Electric, Dray said, indicating he could be jockeying for more than 11% of the company. That would make Berkshire GE's largest shareholder.Shares of General Electric rose 1.8% to 13.68 in the stock market today, after popping 4.3% Tuesday following reports on the speculation about Buffett.

The company has also slashed its dividend in half.Dray said that if Buffett took a big stake in GE, the investor could become another voice — along with activist Trian Fund Management — from which Flannery could draw.He also said the favorable reaction from Wall Street was the ""predictable 'if Buffet is investing, then the stock could be bottoming' response."" But the analyst said any move from Buffett would mean less for shareholders.""However, we caution that any investment by Mr. Buffett would potentially be 'expensive capital,' as he is likely to extract favorable terms from GE,"" Dray said.

28,MMM,"General Electric (GE) shares wallowed near multiyear lows Tuesday as two Wall Street analysts soured on the industrial giant's worsening fundamentals, including its credit and earnings outlooks.XJPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa wondered how long credit-rating agencies can ""remain on the sidelines with their commentary, seemingly giving GE precious time to work their way out,"" given a host of problems.Problems dogging the 126-year-old industrial giant include ""material changes in fundamentals,"" little progress on asset sales, delays in revenue recognition restatements, a lack of ""clean numbers"" and an SEC investigation, according to Tusa. The analyst also pointed out that during the Great Recession, GE was AAA-rated and needed a bailout.""So we scratch our heads as to the repeated inertia"" from ratings watchdogs, which should start to get more attention, Tusa wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.He remains cautious on the stock, finding GE's fundamentals are ""worse than expected"" and calling out its ""currently unjustified rating."" The recent appointment of a Moody's board member to its own board should raise investors' eyebrows, in Tusa's view.Moody's cut GE's long-term debt rating in November, citing ""extreme deterioration"" in its energy business. The cut from A1 to A2 still kept the company's bonds in the investment grade category. Also in November, Fitch cut its rating to A+ from AA-, still in investment grade.Tusa, however, has an underweight rating on the stock with an 11 price target, down from 14 a month ago.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

30,MMM,"Just how bad will the U.S.' slap-fight over trade, which escalated with China on Friday, be for S&P 500 earnings and stocks? Just how much can the U.S. economy, which delivered solid June jobs growth on Friday, still grow after a nine-year expansion?Analysts expect another blowout quarter in Q2 — 20.7% earnings-per-share growth for S&P 500 index components and an 8.1% jump in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. Wall Street is betting on continued scorching results for the rest of the year. But they may not be as scorching if President Donald Trump's trade wars with China, Canada, Mexico, Europe and others become more heated. The quiet earnings growth next year might be even more muted.Analysts say the effects of a trade war have yet to be priced into financial forecasts.""I think the first tangible impact should start showing up in estimate revisions as these earnings results come out,"" said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks.In other words, the second-quarter earnings season could offer some higher drama than CEOs' usual blanched remarks about ""headwinds"" and ""tailwinds."" Investors, even more than usual, will focus on earnings guidance and post-earnings call commentary to get some answers as to how the tariffs will affect profit, sales, prices, corporate strategy and shareholder returns.Higher costs for parts and supplies that U.S. companies bring in from overseas could mean higher costs for customers. Businesses could rethink or even uproot complex global supply chains. Higher prices on U.S.-made goods sold overseas could crimp international demand. Companies could cut or delay major investments.S&P 500 index companies, filled with hundreds of U.S. multinationals and exporters, are more exposed to tariffs and global demand than the U.S. economy itself.As for the second-quarter itself, the gains from S&P 500 companies come courtesy of President Trump's tax cuts and an enduring U.S. economy.Rebounding oil prices will lift the energy sector's Q2 earnings by around 141.5%, with sales up some 20%, according to Thomson. S&P 500 energy stocks, which include Dow Jones giants Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as ConocoPhillips (COP), Valero (VLO), Marathon Oil (MRO), Schlumberger (SLB) and many others, have generally been strong performers.Analysts expect the S&P 500 financials to clock a 22% gain in earnings on a 4.5% bump in revenue, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other banks enjoy lower taxes and deregulation. Thomson forecasts semiconductors and internet software and services to lead the S&P 500 tech components toward 25.5% earnings growth. Tech revenue is seen jumping 12%. Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) are all slated to deliver solid-to-stellar growth.As estimates stand now, Thomson Reuters is forecasting the 20%-plus earnings growth to reach into the third and fourth quarters.""The last time we had earnings growth in Q3 and Q4 like this was in 2010,"" Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters, said in an email.However, looking past 2018, analysts appear to have a harder time justifying bullish expectations for S&P 500 companies.""You look at the numbers going forward, you really don't start to see a significant drop in growth until you get into 2019, when again, you'll be back to apples-to-apples on the tax rates,"" said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.But tougher comparisons aren't a massive concern right now, analysts say. And next year's growth still looks solid. Dhillon said that for 2019 investors can expect a 9.7% earnings growth rate, ""which is still higher than the 20-year average of 7.3%.""Wall Street also worries that the U.S. economy has fewer tools at its disposal to keep its marathon run going. The dollar is stronger. The yield curve is flatter due partly to the Federal Reserve's decisions to lift short-term interest rates.The narrowing yield curve, the gap between rates on short-term and long-term government debt, looms large for banks in particular. The flatter curve, also seen as a precursor to an economic downturn, has dragged bank stocks lower in recent months.Banks also lend money to borrowers based on long-term rates, but borrow from depositors according to short-term rates. The narrower the difference between the two, the narrower the banks' net interest margins. JPMorgan, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report second-quarter earnings on Friday.The three banking giants, which all announced hefty shareholder-return packages last month, are expected to deliver solid EPS growth. But JPMorgan stock, along with that of Citigroup, Wells Fargo and others, is near 2018 lows.When the Fed raises rates that affects the money flowing into global, emerging markets as well.""If U.S. interest rates are going up,"" Mian said, ""and an investor or a class of investors is scouring world markets for yield and returns, and if the yield and return is going up in a developed market like the U.S., then there's no reason to take the extra risk of going to Argentina or Turkey when you can get it in the U.S.""The U.S. on Friday lobbed tariffs at $34 billion worth of Chinese products — more than 800 types of products total. That's the first part of a $50 billion response for what Trump says are China's trade abuses against the U.S.The U.S. tariffs target aircraft parts, industrial parts and equipment, some vehicles and other machinery. The duties from the U.S. targeted products related to China's tech-focused ""Made in China 2025"" plan. Trump has said that initiative would ""hurt economic growth for the United States and many other countries.""""The United States can no longer tolerate losing our technology and intellectual property through unfair economic practices,"" Trump said in a statement last month.China on Friday responded with penalties of its own on U.S. products, including automakers and agriculture. China aimed those tariffs squarely at Trump's base.Trump has threatened to levy another $200 billion in tariffs on China, and even more. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to impose a global import tariff on autos. That follows duties on steel and aluminum that have spurred Europe, Canada and Mexico to retaliate.Further trade discord could force companies to rethink their supply chains. Those adjustments could undo corporate America's efforts over the past two decades to more efficiently manage their inventories. Such practices over that time firmed up businesses' balance sheets.The brinkmanship has swept up some of the most iconic American businesses along the way. General Motors (GM) said as much last week, warning that more tariffs would lead to ""reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company.""Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would offer more detail, on its earnings call this month, about its plans to move some production out of the U.S. to skirt tariffs from the EU. Brown-Forman (BFB) is raising the price of Jack Daniel's in parts of Europe because of the tariffs imposed by the EU.No one knows how the Trump trade wars, and their impact on S&P 500 companies, will play out.""We expect company-specific risks from tariffs and China-trade exposures to be a central discussion topic during 2Q18 earnings calls,"" RBC analyst Deane Dray, who covers industrials vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, wrote in a note last month. ""But no one has a crystal ball on how the tariff situation will ultimately play out, especially the potential knock-on effects.""He said companies like 3M (MMM) and Danaher (DHR) looked best equipped among industrials to handle the trade disputes.The trade war also threatens chipmakers like Micron (MU). A Chinese court blocked sales of some of its chips in the country, a move seen as pushback from the nation against Trump's trade salvos. China has held up approving the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Boeing (BA) isn't subject to China tariffs, but Beijing could favor Airbus (EADSY) jets in a protracted U.S.-China trade war. The aerospace company in April downplayed worries over a trade war.Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford covers transportation and logistics companies like UPS (UPS), FedEx (FDX) and Expeditors International (EXPD). Hartford wrote in a research note last month that he'd seen no ""material evidence (yet) of freight volume weakness amid rising global trade tensions.""Some analysts, like Tigress' Ivan Feinseth, expressed optimism that strength in corporate earnings would offset any trade damage. Others wonder how much a trade war will hurt corporate travel for the likes of global carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and cargo demand broadly. Delta Air earnings are due Thursday.""We still expect demand to grow, but those expectations are dampened with each new tariff introduced,"" Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said of air cargo demand in a statement this week.

31,MMM,"THE TAKE-AWAY: What is the Dow Jones industrial average? It gauges the stock performance of 30 really big, household-name U.S. companies deemed to be representative of the U.S. economy.If you watch the news, perhaps you know that the Dow Jones industrial average, or the Dow, is a thing that rises, falls, swoons, surges, plunges, rallies or tanks. When it tanks, it's very bad and very important. It drives men in decorated sport coats, the vibe of which is somewhere between executive and airline captain, to bury their heads in their hands and leave paper all over the floor.You'd be forgiven for not knowing the finer points of what the Dow Jones industrial average actually is. The Dow Jones industrial average is an index that gauges the stock performance of 30 large, well-known companies. A stock index is a compilation of any number of stocks — with different prices, moving in different directions — represented by a single number.You already know many of the stocks that are part of the Dow. Apple (AAPL), Nike (NKE) and McDonald's (MCD) are part of the Dow. General Electric (GE), the last original member, will be replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) on June 26, 2018.Created in 1896 to bring more transparency to the stock market, the Dow intends to offer a big-picture view of how the economic, business and political climate might affect big companies seen as bellwethers for the U.S. economy.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Dow is not a physical place, like a trading floor, where people go to buy or sell stocks. When you see pictures of traders pointing, yelling or despairing, they're probably on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.The ""Dow"" in ""Dow Jones"" is also completely different Dow from the Dow in the chemical giant DowDuPont. However, DowDuPont (DOW) is a Dow Jones Industrial Average stock.A committee made up of three representatives from S&P Dow Jones Indices and two from the Wall Street Journal meets twice a year to consider if any changes are needed to the Dow index.There are no explicit numerical requirements that companies must meet for their stocks to become part of the index. But there are broader, qualitative benchmarks for Dow companies, according to Jamie Farmer, managing director at S&P Dow Jones Indices.A company needs to have a strong reputation, have a history of weathering economic storms, and its shares need to be widely owned by investors, he said. Companies on the Dow also need to get a lot of their sales from the U.S. — at least a plurality, Farmer said. The companies also generally have to trade on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.""Dow"" is for Charles Dow. ""Jones"" is for Edward Jones. The two were journalists who founded Dow Jones & Co. in 1882, along with another reporter, Charles Bergstresser. In 1889, they created the Wall Street Journal. On May 26, 1896, the Dow Jones industrial average began measuring stocks — at first, only 12.""Its initial purpose was really just kind of an editorial function,"" Farmer said. ""They wanted a way to describe what was going on in the stock market on a daily basis.""That wasn't always easy in the U.S. stock market's early days.As Charles Geisst's book ""Wall Street: A History"" describes, prices for transactions on the New York Stock and Exchange Board, founded in 1817, weren't always public, let alone available to the area's newspapers.Regulations were also flimsy. Markets were easily manipulated. The 1800s were marked by cycles of wild speculation, panic and bank implosions that swallowed the economy — a process that played out multiple times over the century. Predatory tactics abounded.The daily publication of the Dow Jones industrial average numbers helped investors follow stock market movements more clearly, easing some investor fears, Geisst writes.And just what is the Dow Jones industrial average's justification for being ""industrial"" and an ""average""? That's a little more complicated.When the Dow Jones industrial average first launched, the 12 companies that it tracked were companies in the industrial sector: American Tobacco, Tennessee Coal & Iron, U.S. Leather, U.S. Rubber. General Electric was on there too, initially, before it was removed from the index and later restored in 1907, before ultimately getting removed again in 2018.Many of those companies were broken up, absorbed by others, or morphed into different businesses over time.In the beginning, the Dow was a pure ""average"" of the stocks in it. The prices of those 12 stocks were added up, divided by 12, and then you got the singular price for the whole thing.Today, that's not the case. The Dow uses a mechanism called a ""divisor"" to help calculate that singular, representative price of the index's stocks. The divisor is there to smooth out the bumps in price that come from things like stock splits or the addition or removal of stocks from the index. The Dow is also price weighted, meaning higher-priced stocks have a bigger influence on the index than lower-priced ones.Over the decades, the Dow has become less ""industrial,"" per se, though it includes big names like GE, 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX). But the index has evolved to include large tech and financial-services players, which are more representative of the economy today.In the prior tweak, DowDuPont replaced DuPont in Sept. 1, 2017, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, after it merged with Dow Chemical.Before that, Apple replaced AT&T (T) on March 19, 2015. And on Sept. 23, 2013, Goldman Sachs (GS) replaced Bank of America (BAC); Visa (V) replaced Hewlett-Packard, which split up; and Nike (NKE) replaced Alcoa, which also split up.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:What Is The Stock Market And How Does It Work?

The Hang Seng has let an 11.9% year-to-date gain shrivel to less than 0.5%.Despite the decline in Chinese mainland equities, Autohome, a member of IBD Leaderboard since Jan. 2 this year, scored a new breakout from a rare pattern called the ascending base. In such a pattern, the stock has already broken out but then posts three quick corrections of around 10% to 20% over a nine- to 16-week period. The stock must make a new high before each correction; hence, it's an ""ascending base.""Autohome focuses on advertising and marketing of automobiles through its website. The company's earnings have grown 28%, 15%, 39%, 58%, 82% and 53% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. Analysts see Q2 earnings rising 23% to 87 cents a share.On Jan. 2, Autohome had initially cleared a 17-week base that shows elements of a double bottom. This base gave a 67.79 standard buy point.A narrow five-day handle formed on the tail end of the base. That provided a slightly lower buy point of 65.67, a dime above the handle's high. That handle began forming on Dec. 22 last year and the resulting lower entry is very close to the 66.55 ""alternative entry point"" created by the middle interim peak wedged in between the two sell-offs within the base.Check out this recent Investor's Corner column on how a chart pattern can lead to more than one correct interpretation of the stock's current balance of supply (AKA sellers) vs. demand (buyers) and the proper time to buy.On the Leaderboard daily and weekly charts, users can see chart annotations placed in real time on specific buy points, including bases and follow-on entry points.Elsewhere, software sector leader Salesforce.com (CRM) rallied as much as 4.4% and struck a new high of 132.55 before pulling back and giving up nearly half of that impressive gain. The cloud-based business software giant remains in buy range after clearing a 128.97 breakout point in a seven-week cup without handle, a variation on the cup-with-handle base, a bullish chart pattern.IBD's Medical-Products group recently bumped the enterprise software industry group off the No. 1 rung among 197 industry groups ranked each day by Investor's Business Daily.

HDFC's 50-day average turnover is a healthy 826,000 shares per day. That big advance instantly gave the Indian lender much needed progress in creating the right side of what currently looks like a cup base.Notice on a daily chart how much of the current base in HDFC has formed beneath the 50-day moving average. A no-no.Consumer spending-linked names continued to fare well. Shake Shack (SHAK), a new idea on IBD SwingTrader, surged more than 5% and at one point reached as high as 62.54 in volume that is running nearly triple its normal pace.The burger and shake chain broke out of a well-formed first-stage cup with handle at 44.50 on April 26. Volume came in just 13% above the 50-day average on that session.However, Shake Shack saw a 69% boost in volume vs. normal levels the very next session as shares rose another 4.1% to 47.26, quickly exiting the permissible 5% buy zone.On May 4, the New York-based chain roared more than 18% higher after reporting a first-quarter adjusted profit of 15 cents a share, up 50% as sales jumped 29% to $99.1 million, a quarterly record.Net margin improved 90 basis points to 5.7%.Shake Shack now gets a top-flight 93 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. That ranks it No. 1 within the Retail-Restaurants industry group. The SMR Rating, which analyzes a company's sales growth, profit margins, and return on equity, has improved to an A on a scale of A (excellent) to E (rotten).Going back to Apple, new reports have noted that some analysts express concern over whether the company's services segment will keep both the top and bottom lines increasing at a fast rate.Apple, however, still shows strong growth prospects.The Street sees earnings in the June-ending fiscal third quarter rising 31% to $2.18 a share on a 15% pickup in revenue to $52.26 billion. That would mark the fourth quarter in a row of low double-digit top-line gains. Sales jumped 5%, 7%, 12%, 13% and 16% in the prior five quarters.Apple has climbed 61% since it initially broke out of a first stage base on Jan. 6, 2017. The move past a 118.12 buy point in a cup with handle marked an emerging change in the stock's character.In other financial markets, the U.S. Treasury bonds saw a rebound in yields as investors sold. Reuters reported that two key political parties in Italy will work on forming a new government and avoid a new national election.Stocks across the world sold off on concerns that a major change in political leadership in the No. 3 eurozone economy could put Europe's main single currency system at risk.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose to 2.85% after swooning to as low as 2.75% on Tuesday.According to the CME Group, fed funds futures now see only a 25% chance that the Federal Reserve will raise the short-term cost of money four times this year. In March, the U.S. central bank hiked the Fed funds rate by a quarter point to a range of 1.5%-1.75%.Bond traders expect the Fed to bump the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points again in June and in September.

Boeing cleared a 56-day cup with handle base with a 348.67 buy point on Friday, MarketSmith analysis shows. But Boeing's breakout volume was light and the handle didn't appear on a weekly chart. Monday's gain is encouraging, but investors could choose to wait for a 371.70 cup-base entry.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBack in April, Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani said the Boeing threat was ""dissipating"" due to Chinese and American policymakers seeking to avoid a trade war, with a mutually beneficial outcome. He noted that China's proposed 25% tariffs on aerospace products would only impact imports of Boeing's 737-700 and MAX 7. They account for less than 1% of Boeing's backlog orders.NXP Semiconductors stock rose 3.3%, to finish at 114.65, as a trade deal increases the chances its takeover by Qualcomm will go through. The stock gapped above its 50-day moving average and hit its 200-day line before retreating.The Dutch company already had climbed on reports that Chinese regulators are looking more favorably upon Qualcomm's attempt to acquire the chipmaker. That came after President Trump signaled he would ease stiff sanctions vs. Chinese telecom gear giant ZTE.Analysts have said completing the $44 billion NXP transaction is Qualcomm's most pressing near-term issue. The deal was first announced in October 2016.San Diego-based Qualcomm also risked fallout from its status as a major supplier in China.Qualcomm shares initially rallied but pulled back fractionally as the chip giant likely will go ahead with its hefty NXP takeover.Other semiconductor firms with a big China presence include Intel (INTC), Texas Instruments (TXN), Nvidia (NVDA) and Micron (MU).Caterpillar has been investing heavily in China as it competes in the world's largest construction- and mining-equipment market.Last year the firm announced a five-year pact with China Energy Investment tied to mining-equipment sales and rentals in the future. It is also hoping to cash in on the country's ""Belt and Road"" initiative. The $1 trillion infrastructure spree builds on old Silk Road trading routes and spans Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Caterpillar stock rose 2.1% to 158.92, hitting its best levels intraday since late February. The Dow Jones stock is working on a consolidation with a buy point of 173.34.The Dow Jones industrial average firm, which makes thin coatings and many other industrial products in addition to Post-its and Scotch tape, made 10% of its sales from China last year.3M stock rose 1.4% to 201.76, but has plunged in recent months, hit by a weak earnings report.The stock also has a poor IBD Composite Rating of 35 and an abysmal relative strength rating of 17.The farm equipment giant has invested significantly in China, and risked a big drop in demand at home from Chinese tariffs and bans of U.S. agricultural products. Back in April China said it would slap tariffs on $50 billion worth of American imports, including soybeans, wheat, corn, cotton and other agricultural commodities. China imported $14 billion worth of soybeans from the U.S. last year.Deere stock rose 2% to 158.33. The stock has been building a cup base for the past 13 weeks and is shooting for a 175.36 entry point. Deere shot up 5.75% Friday on its quarterly earnings report.In every trade war there are winners and losers, and steel seemed to be a big winner when the Trump Administration slapped a 25% tariff on imported steel and a 10% tariff on imported aluminum.But the Trump administration has made several exemptions and postponements on those tariffs.

Data released by the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday showed an unexpected buildup in weekly oil inventories. The API data often foreshadow results from the Energy Information Administration's weekly crude stockpiles report, which is due out at 10:30 a.m. ET.Housing starts slowed sharply in April, with the Commerce Department reporting an annualized pace of 1.287 million starts. That was down from March's rate of 1.319 million, and well below consensus expectations for an uptick to 1.324 million. Building permits eased slightly, to a pace of 1.352 million. The number was below March's 1.354 million rate, but better than the decline to 1.350 million forecast by economists. Global markets recovered from an initial dip, but remained cautious following news late Tuesday that North Korea had reportedly canceled talks recently launched with South Korea. The country apparently has threatened to also abandon the planned June 12 summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Trump.Across Asian stock markets, the Shanghai Composite fell 0.7% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index took a 0.1% loss. In South Korea, Seoul's KOSPI index shed its early losses and closed a fraction higher.In Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 dipped 0.4% after data showed Japan's economy contracted 0.6% — more than expected — in the first quarter. That broke an eight-quarter growth streak and raised questions about Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic reforms, as the country wades into renegotiating its trade protocols with the U.S.Stocks in Europe traded with narrow gains in their afternoon sessions. The DAX in Frankfurt led, up 0.3%.Teva sprung 4.3% higher, after being lifted by news late Tuesday that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) had more than doubled its stake in the company to 40 million shares.

The big-volume gain sent shares beyond a buy range above a 20.41 buy point in a three-month cup base.U.K.-based Micro Focus International (MFGP) hammered ahead 5.9% in opening action. The company said the early closing of a $40 million deal would drive its six-month revenue, through April, above the forecasted range. The company had guided to revenue declines between 9% and 12%. Micro Focus paid $8.8 billion to acquire the software arm of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) in September 2016.China-based Tencent Holdings surged 6.8%, despite reporting mixed first-quarter results. Revenue topped analyst targets. Earnings missed, but the stock had taken a sharp dive in March, after warning that development spending could crimp profits.  The gain lifted Tencent shares above resistance at its 10-week moving average and up the right side of a three-month consolidation.Macy's rung up a 7% gain to lead the S&P 500, after reporting a blowout win in its first quarter. A 40% gain in earnings per share added a second quarter of positive earnings gains. And a 2% revenue increase marked its first revenue rise since the first quarter of 2015.

36,MMM,"Retailing, apparel, consumer-spending and semiconductor-related stocks dominated the market's upside in stocks today, as major indexes sought to beef up their morning gains. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), meanwhile, reaffirmed a new trend of emerging institutional demand within the restaurant industry group.Chipotle, which is a new trading idea in IBD SwingTrader on Wednesday, rallied more than 3% to 440.27 in healthy turnover for what figures to be its fourth up day in a row.Chipotle's volume is running 52% above usual levels, hinting that mutual funds, pensions, hedge funds, banks, insurers and the like are accumulating shares heavily.The stock ran in the short sellers on April 26 after reporting Q1 results that pointed to an ongoing turnaround in fundamentals. After that big jump, Chipotle traded tightly and volume dried up, forming a handle in the process. That positive action following the catapulting move in price in essence formed a handle and a 433.10 buy point within its new deep first-stage base.At 2:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite paced the key indexes with a gain of more than 0.7%.

Micron Technology (MU) broke out of a new double-bottom base at 54.37 in decent but not great turnover.Notice how in this nine-week double bottom, the middle peak of 54.27 is actually 10 cents beneath the midpoint of the actual base (45.31 low plus 63.42, giving a base midpoint of 54.37). You'd prefer to see the midpoint of a double bottom be firmly lodged within the upper half of the base.That said, Micron is still 11% below the base's 63.42 peak. In other words, it's possible for the stock to continue building the right side of the current base. Double-bottom bases can also form handles, which represent a final shakeout of uncommitted shareholders, and boost the chances of a successful breakout.Micron is a member of the strong data storage industry group. In that group, Smart Global (SGH) continues to act as a market leader as well. Shares, up nearly 4% to 47.33, are working on the right side of a potential cup pattern.Returning to the restaurant group, Wingstop (WING) and Shake Shack (SHAK) are showing robust action so far in 2018.The former has made a series of rebounds off the 50-day moving average after it cleared a 33.64 buy point in a 10-week flat base on Nov. 3, 2017. On that day, the chicken wing chain reported a 31% jump in earnings to 17 cents a share for the third quarter of 2017 as sales lifted 19% to $26 million.Since then, earnings have risen 13% and 19% in the prior two quarters. In IBD Stock Checkup, Wingstop ranks 5th within the Retail-Restaurants industry group with an 87 Composite Rating. That overall ranking belies a solid EPS Rating of 88 on a scale of 1 to 99, which means that the company's long- and short-term profit growth is superior to 88% of all publicly traded companies in IBD's database.Wingstop's Composite score is likely hurt by the fact that it doesn't have an SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity) Rating. Why? Wingstop does not have a calculable return on equity. As of the first quarter of 2018, the Dallas-based company showed a total stockholders' deficit of $146 million. Nonetheless, Wingstop posts excellent operating cash flow that has been higher than annual earnings per share for four years in a row.The Street sees Wingstop's earnings rising 14% to 83 cents a share this year and 19% to 99 cents in 2019.Shake Shack powered past a 44.50 buy point in a four-month cup with handle on April 13, then blasted higher nearly two weeks later after the popular burger, crinkle cut fries, and shake chain posted a 50% bulge in adjusted Q1 profit and a 29% increase in sales to $99.1 million.Wingstop and Shake Shack are small cap firms with market values of $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.In other markets, U.S. crude oil futures eased 0.3% to $71.08 a barrel. That decline didn't stop IBD 50 member Daqo New Energy (DQ) from rallying nearly 11% to 65.22 in hefty trade.The expert in making raw polysilicon for solar cell production is a wild stock, easily prone to swinging up or down 5% any given day. Nevertheless, the stock has now cleared a 65.09 entry point in a deep double bottom base and is in buy range.The 5% buy zone for Daqo goes up to 68.34.Daqo is No. 13 in the IBD 50.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond is holding firmly above the 3% threshold, currently at 3.08%.Fed funds future now show a roughly 54% chance that the Federal Reserve will make four quarter-point hikes in short-term interest rates by December this year.RELATED:How To Find The Correct Buy Point In Stocks: Maximize Your Return, Minimize Your RiskWhich Stocks Just Entered The IBD 50, Sector Leaders, And Other Key IBD Screens?

37,MMM,"General Electric (GE) shares are set to bottom after painful recent damage wrought by insurance-related charges, a dividend cut and the lowering of performance targets for 2018 and beyond, according to a longtime GE analyst.X GE's recent actions offer ""a line of sight to rejuvenated cash flow generation and improving ROIC (return on invested capital) over the rest of this decade,"" William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann wrote in a Monday note. He noted the industrial giant intends to exit $20 billion of businesses, had a recent ""uneventful"" filing of 2017 financial statements, and announced three ""highly respected and qualified"" new directors to the board.Heymann sees five reasons GE's shares are likely to offer material upside potential over the near and medium term — and could even double in price by the end of this decade:Heymann acknowledges uncertainty in the near term tied to the regulatory reviews and shareholder lawsuits, but believes these may be resolved in ""months rather than years,"" setting the stage for a recovery.""As fundamentally adverse news shifts to more constructive positive news as 2018 progresses, we expect GE's share price is likely to normalize at approximately 20 times 2018 adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $1.00-$1.07 per share, which would suggest a share price of perhaps $20-$22,"" he said.Heymann added: ""The largest potential upside for the shares over the next 6-12 months is likely to come from how the company decides to use the proceeds from the divestitures of its $20 billion in assets targeted for disposal.""Shares of GE rose 1.5% to 14.64 on the stock market today, putting it among the top gainers in the Dow Jones industrial average. Dow industrial peers United Technologies (UTX) and 3M (MMM) fell 0.1% and rose 0.4%, respectively.

39,MMM,"General Electric's (GE) free cash flow is at risk of shrinking, putting its already reduced dividend at further risk, according to JPMorgan.X The warning comes after the industrial conglomerate pledged to shed $20 billion in assets and halved its annual dividend in November to 48 cents. GE stock now yields 3.2%.""We still see structural concerns in the key Power markets, minimal margin for error on leverage, numerous tail liabilities at both GE and GECS (General Electric Capital Services),"" JPMorgan's Stephen Tusa wrote in a note out Tuesday.The analyst noted that proceeds from shedding businesses will go toward the balance sheet, knocking ""assumptions that $20 billion of asset sales comes for free, with no lost"" earnings before interest and taxes, free cash flow (FCF).Tusa added: ""GE's 'normalized' level of FCF looks to be well below $1 (per share), with a plausible case of sustainable FCF in the $0.50 range, just above the standing dividend.""On the GE dividend, Tusa takes issue with those who espouse that the dividend yield is above the sector average.""The issue is that while it's not necessarily cut near term, it is not growing, and at a ~95% payout on post divestiture FCF, it's still high risk,"" he said.Tusa lowered his price target to $11 — a level last seen in mid-2009 — saying ""$0.50/$0.60 in 2018/2019 FCF does not support a $14 PT.""On the stock market today, shares of GE tumbled 4.4% to 14.43, trailing the 30 blue chip stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average. They have lost more than half their value over the past year.

40,MMM,"The major indexes enjoyed a slow yet steady afternoon rebound but still closed mildly lower on Thursday. Some commodity stocks and cyclical plays paced the upside, including ship transport, logistics, coal and homebuilding. Preliminary volume figures were mixed as traders fret over how the U.S. and China will handle two-day talks on trade.Inside the IBD 50, small-cap energy play Warrior Met Coal (HCC) gapped up at the open. At one point the energy play rallied to an all-time high of 26.93, briefly surpassing a 26.53 buy point within a nearly nine-week cup without handle.Meanwhile, as Apple (AAPL) tiptoed closer to a potential new breakout, an emerging group of new leaders powered past their own buy points and sharply outperformed the market. They included Marathon Oil (MRO) (up 6% in double average volume) and Tableau Software (DATA) (up nearly 7% in more than four times usual turnover).The Dow Jones industrial average eked out a tiny gain of 5 points as it notched a positive reversal. Dow components Boeing (BA) and 3M (MMM) were the only two out of 30 names to rise 1 point or more.Ninety minutes into Thursday's session, the blue chip index slid as much as 1.6% before slowly climbing higher the rest of the way.The Dow industrials poked below its long-term 200-day moving average for the second time since April 2. That's evidence of a new shakeout taking place.At 23,930, the Dow industrials still stands nearly 10% off its peak, despite the fact that IBD's current outlook for the market holds at ""Uptrend under pressure.""The S&P 500 also slid below the long-term 200-day moving average but turned a loss of more than 1.4% to just a 0.2% dip, another bullish sign. Still, watch to see if the large-cap benchmark tries in future trading sessions to mark another close below the 200-day line.The Nasdaq composite was off less than 0.2% after having fallen as much as 1.5%. The premier index of growth companies continues to test buying support near the 7000 level.Volume ran sharply higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Wednesday and slipped lower on the NYSE, according to early data.The Russell 2000 and the Dow transports both fell 0.5%. The Russell 1000, a popular small-cap gauge, is clinging to a tiny year-to-date gain.Marathon Oil rallied more than 6% at one point and got as high as 19.51 before cooling off some. The stock easily surpassed an 18.76 buy point in a 13-week cup with handle. The 5% buy zone extends up to 19.70.Marathon is an integrated oil and gas firm. The large-cap firm from Houston posted earnings of 18 cents a share in Q1, reversing a 13-cent net loss in the year-ago quarter. Sales boomed 62% to $1.73 billion.Marathon is not the only company with strong relative performance and good IBD ratings, as seen in IBD's stock quotes and in the Stock Checkup tool. Ecopetrol (EC), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Italy's Eni Spa (E) all hold a Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher.While oil and gas explorers slumped, integrated firms such as Marathon Oil advanced smartly as the rally in crude oil futures show no signs of abating. U.S. WTI near-term futures bounced from a nearly 0.7% loss to finish up and well above $68 a barrel.WTI crude is now up more than 13% year to date. In contrast, the S&P 500, at 2627, is down nearly 1.7% since Jan. 1. The 500 ran up 19.4% in 2017.Tableau, meanwhile, gapped out of a base-on-base pattern at 87.70, rising more than 7% to 91.30 in quadruple normal volume.Tableau is a Big Data analytics software expert. The Seattle-based firm notched its fourth quarter in a row of solid earnings per share. Revenue climbed 23% to $246.2 million, the biggest jump in five quarters.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Tableau's so-so 68 Composite Rating belies a strong 89 RS Rating, meaning the company is outperforming 89% of all publicly traded firms in IBD's database over the past 12 months. Given Thursday's strong advance, watch to see if Tableau's ratings edge higher.Going back to Apple, the iPhone, iPad and digital services titan acted stingy in giving back Wednesday's strong gain, a good sign for the bulls. The stock initially fell more than 1% to 174.63 in brisk trade. Then it wiped out those modest losses to end 0.2% higher to 176.89.The megacap tech is possibly forming the right side of a shallow seven-week double-bottom base. The middle peak between the base's  two lows is 178.94. Hence, a new buy point would be 179.04, 10 cents above that middle peak. The decline within the base is very light at 12.5%.Apple is still trading near all-time highs, another bullish sign. At $897 billion, it's the largest company by market value on the U.S. financial markets. In IBD Stock Checkup, the Cupertino, Calif., firm shows decent ratings such as an 85 for EPS (Earnings Per Share) and 86 for Relative Price Strength.Earlier this week the iPhone giant reported a 30% jump in fiscal second-quarter earnings to $2.73 a share, the biggest jump in 10 quarters, as revenue grew 16%, marking a sixth quarter in a row of top-line acceleration.Apple's revenue slumped 9% during the fiscal fourth quarter of FY 2016, then rose 3%, 5%, 7%, 12% and 13% in the next five quarters.The Street expects Apple's earnings turnaround to keep shining brightly. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect profit to climb 30% in the June-ending fiscal third quarter to $2.17 a share.Despite the nifty reversal by the major indexes, investors also seem to show nervousness on the outcome of two-day trade talks between top U.S. and Chinese economic officials in Beijing.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and other key players arrived in the Middle Kingdom on Thursday for talks later in the day and Friday.Bloomberg reported a senior Chinese government official as saying that China will refuse any U.S. preconditions for negotiations, such as narrowing the bilateral trade gap.On Friday, a number of top Federal Reserve officials and regional bank presidents are slated to speak, including William Dudley, John Williams, and Esther George. On Wednesday, the U.S. central bank kept short-term interest rates unchanged. The fed funds rate that's charged on overnight cash infusions to major lenders currently hovers at a 1.5%-1.75% target range.CME futures see a nearly 45% probability that the Fed will raise the fed funds rate three more times to a target range of 2.25%-2.5%, slightly down from recent days. Numerous money center banks, Wall Street investment giants and regional lenders have recently been hit with intense selling.Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) have either sliced below or came close to touching their 200-day moving averages. But some fast-growing banks, such as Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) and SVB Financial (SIVB), have been holding up much more firmly.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on leading stocks, breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:Inside The Big Picture?

41,MMM,"General Electric (GE) faces the most fundamental risk among multi-industry companies from rapidly rising steel and aluminum prices under President Trump's proposed tariffs — and that could chill takers for a business it's looking to shed, a Wall Street analyst said.X GE makes huge and heavy-duty industrial equipment made significantly of metal, such as jet engines for Boeing (BA) planes, generators for power plants and locomotives, Deutsche Bank's John Inch wrote in a Wednesday note. That raises both direct risk in terms of competitive cost pressures and indirect risk in terms of reduced global trade if other countries slap tariffs of their own, he added.""While the value/cost of GE's products are heavily weighted to the engineering performance features rather than the raw material costs, we believe that rising raw material costs (steel and aluminum) can nonetheless still pose significant spread headwinds (""value gap"") for GE,"" Inch said.GE countered the Deutsche Bank note in a statement, saying reports on the impact of potential steel and aluminum tariffs on GE's costs are completely ungrounded.""Our internal data shows our consumption of imported metals likely to be impacted by the tariffs is minimal,"" a GE spokesperson said. ""We are monitoring the situation as it develops.""Deutsche Bank's Inch cautioned that GE's international rivals in oligopolistic markets could try to gain market share by leveraging higher U.S. metals prices, while GE customers would likely balk if the company tried to re-price its order backlog higher. GE has $134 billion in backlogs tied to its power, oil and gas, and renewable energy segments, according to its 2017 10-k report.Inch also warned that the rail business GE seeks to sell or spin off could become less attractive to potential buyers as metal input costs rise. That's particularly so ""given already tough competition from the Chinese (e.g., CRRC) and cyclically depressed U.S. loco market demand,"" Inch said.GE is targeting $20 billion worth of asset sales, including the transportation unit that makes locomotives, as it looks to improve cash flow and shrink its portfolio of businesses.Shares of GE fell 0.9% to 14.51 on the stock market today, slashing losses as the White House said Trump tariffs may exempt Canada and Mexico. Inch has a price target of 13 on GE stock and a sell rating, but the stock is still hanging on to a weekly gain after a longtime GE analyst said Monday he saw material upside potential over the near and medium term.Dow Jones peers United Technologies (UTX) and 3M (MMM) fell 0.5% and rose 0.85%, respectively. Honeywell (HON) gained 0.7% and Siemens (SIEGY) added 0.4%.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

43,MMM,"The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq tumbled during the week as Alphabet (GOOGL), Caterpillar (CAT) and 3M (MMM) earnings and a 3% Treasury yield spooked investors. The stock market averages pared losses amid strong earnings from Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Boeing (BA), Visa (V) and others.The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq found support near their 200-day moving averages, rebounding to close the week with fractional losses. The 10-year Treasury hit 3% for the first time in four years, hitting 3.02% during the week before pulling back to 2.96%. Short-term yields continued to rise faster than long-term rates, squeezing the yield spread. Alphabet (GOOGL) expenses and ongoing chip weakness also hit stocks. But Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Boeing (BA) and Visa (V) rallied on strong results. Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) initially hit buy points Friday, but pulled back.Amazon's first-quarter earnings skyrocketed, more doubling the EPS estimate. Revenue rose 43% to $51 billion, the fifth straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. Revenue from Amazon Web Services rose 49% to $5.4 billion. AWS accounts for most of Amazon's overall operating profit. Amazon shares shot up to a record high Friday, paring gains for a 3.6% advance. EBay (EBAY) stock dropped after it reported Q1 results that fell short of consensus estimates, ending the quarter with 171 million global active buyers, up 4%.Facebook (FB) stock surged after posting first-quarter results that blew past expectations, dashing fears of an exodus of users and advertisers from the social media giant.

Fellow Dow Jones stock United Technologies (UTX) reported stronger-than-expected Q1 earnings and sales. The industrial giant also raised its full-year adjusted EPS and sales forecast.Lockheed Martin (LMT) topped first-quarter estimates and the defense contractor raised EPS and revenue targets. But the F-35 maker didn't raise its cash-flow expectation. Northrop Grumman (NOC) also reported Q1 earnings above estimates, but Northrop said it didn't submit a bid for the Air Force's GPS III contract, leaving Lockheed as the likely lone bidder. Raytheon (RTN) raised its full-year earnings forecast above consensus as its Q1 earnings and revenue topped estimates. General Dynamics (GD) beat on earnings and met revenue views. Shares of all four defense contractors sold off sharply for the week.The software kingpin earned 95 cents a share, up 36% year over year, on sales of $26.8 billion, up 16%, in its fiscal third quarter. Analysts expected 85 cents and $25.71 billion. Microsoft (MSFT) has been shifting its business from desktop PC software to cloud-computing infrastructure and applications, such as Office 365 and Azure. Microsoft's commercial cloud revenue rose 58% in fiscal Q3. The software giant initially reclaimed a recent buy point on Friday, but pared gains.Intel (INTC) earnings rose 32% as sales grew 9% to $16.1 billion, both well above analyst views. The chip giant guided higher for current quarter sales, indicating a third-straight quarter of top-line growth. Shares initially jumped to a 17-year high Friday but reversed to close slightly lower. Texas Instruments (TXN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) got boosts from upbeat earnings reports. But chip-gear maker Teradyne (TER) tumbled after warning of weak demand for equipment to test mobile devices. Western Digital (WDC), which makes disk drives and memory chips, tumbled Friday despite beating fiscal Q3 views. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fought for support at its 200-day moving average.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped views but a sharp rise in capital spending, margin pressure and higher traffic acquisition costs sparked a sell-off in the internet search giant. Capex jumped to $7.3 billion from $2.5 billion in the year-ago period, including $2.4 billion for a real estate purchase in Manhattan. Traffic costs — or what Google pays partner websites to generate advertising revenue — jumped 36% to $6.288 billion. Google has hiked spending on YouTube and video content, cloud computing, smart home consumer appliances and artificial intelligence projects.PayPal (PYPL) topped earnings and revenue expectations as total payment volume rose 27% to $132 billion year over year, vs. estimates of $128 billion.

U.S. crude oil futures briefly topped $69 a barrel, the highest level since late 2014, but traded little changed for the week.General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) beat quarterly estimates. Ford will not invest in traditional sedans for North America going forward, and will almost phase out passenger cars by 2020, as consumers migrate to SUVs and light trucks. GM still sees small cars as an opportunity at home and abroad, even as it too shifts focus to larger and more profitable vehicles.Casino operator Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped first-quarter results estimates, helped by strong demand in global gaming hub Macau and in Singapore. Macau also helped Q1 results for Wynn Resorts (WYNN), but its overall and Macau sales disappointed some analysts. Wynn Resorts also approved a dividend increase. The earnings report from Wynn was the first since Steve Wynn resigned as CEO and sold his stake following allegations of sexual misconduct. MGM Resorts (MGM) narrowly beat, but the stock tumbled on declining traffic at its U.S. locations. MGM is more U.S.-focused than Sands or Wynn.Amgen (AMGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) broadly topped Q1 views, though Amgen's sales and adjusted profit outlook for 2018 were a bit soft at the midpoints. Sales of Alexion's blockbuster Soliris missed some estimates, but shares popped on a promising study for new drug ALXN1210. Biogen (BIIB) sales lagged on sluggish Spinraza and multiple sclerosis drug revenue. Prothena (PRTA) tanked 69% on Monday after it scrapped a rare disease drug on a failed Phase 2 study.

Total student enrollments rose 7.7% year over year to about 861,400. IBD 50 stock TAL Education's (TAL) EPS jumped to 14 cents a share as revenue soared 59% to $504 million.

Homebuilder stocks were generally muted due to rising interest rates. But D.R. Horton (DHI), the biggest U.S. builder, on Thursday bested views with a 52% EPS surge as revenue swelled 17% to $3.795 billion. Homebuilder stocks rallied for solid gains, helped by cooling Treasury yields. New-home sales rose in March to an annualized sales pace of 694,000 units, a four-month high. Meanwhile existing-home prices rose 6.8% in February vs. a year earlier.China search-engine leader Baidu (BIDU) reported a Q1 profit that blew past estimates, lifting shares. Baidu still owns a majority of iQiyi (IQ), which held its IPO in March. Video streaming website iQiyi accounts for roughly 20% of the parent's revenue. Shares in iQiyi fell after it released earnings in tandem with Baidu.Visa (V) reported a 29% EPS gain on a 13% revenue rise, both beating fiscal Q2 views. The credit- and debit-card giant raised its full-year revenue outlook. Shares leapt 4.8% on Thursday.3M (MMM) met EPS views as revenue rose 8% to $8.278 billion, just above consensus. But the Dow Jones giant slashed its full-year EPS target. 3M stock plunged.Caterpillar (CAT) reported strong Q1 earnings and sales, but shares of the heavy construction and equipment maker reversed sharply lower Tuesday after warning that operating margins hit a ""high watermark"" for the year.ServiceNow (NOW) reported Q1 profit and revenue above estimates.

45,MMM,"The Dow Jones industrial average paced a broad rally in late afternoon trading Monday with a gain approaching 2%. With as many as 10 of the 30 components up at least 2 points or more, the blue chip Dow Jones industrials are showing a nice gain after Friday's positive reversal.X However, it's still too early to call the current market correction over. The reason: A genuine follow-through has not yet taken place.The Nasdaq composite also showed strength, however, rising 1.7%. The S&P 500, boosted in part by gains by oil and gas firms, rose 1.6%. Small caps lagged. The Russell 2000 gained 1.1%. At 1494, the popular small-cap gauge is down 2.7% year to date following a 13.1% advance in 2017.The S&P 500 is also down in 2018, but at 2661 it's off just 0.5% since Jan. 1.Volume is running lower on both main exchanges compared with the same time Friday.Within the Dow, industrial and manufacturing giant 3M (MMM) has had a sort of mirror-image-like move with the S&P 500, falling all the way to its 200-day moving average on Friday. At that session's intraday low of 218.18, the company once known as Minnesota Manufacturing & Mining had dropped as much as 16% below its recent peak of 259.77.That's quite a sharp haircut for a company that broke out of a long saucer with handle at 180.16 in mid-February 2017, then rallied a solid 44% over the next 11 months.However, go to a MarketSmith daily chart and you'll see that the stock found solid buying support at the key 200-day line, a long-term support level. That's bullish. It implies that mutual funds, pension plans, insurers, large investment advisors and the like are using the recent pullback as a timely opportunity to add to their current positions.3M is on a nice upward tilt in its fundamentals.Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 grew 12% to $2.10 on an adjusted basis vs. a year ago, and sales jumped 9% to $8 billion, the biggest year-over-year increase in more than 15 quarters.The Street sees Q1 profit accelerating to a 17% increase to $2.52 a share.Meanwhile, Snap (SNAP) gained a lot of media attention with a very positive gap up in price on Wednesday, as shares barreled 6.69 points higher, or 47%, that session to 20.75. It was the social network's biggest single-day gain ever, beating even its 24% gain on its March 2 debut on the NYSE.Shares dipped lightly on Monday, down 1% to 18.62. Despite losing ground for a third straight day, it's nowhere close to filling in the bullish price gap produced by Wednesday's 7 jump. However, the stock is still clearly in the middle of building the right side of a potential new base.From its May 8 peak of 23.57, Snap dropped all the way to 11.28, down more than 52%. That's excessive for most bases that IBD growth stock pickers look for. In most cases, a good cup with handle features a decline of no more than 33%.The Venice, Calif., firm posted a loss of 13 cents a share in Q4, but it was smaller than the Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. Revenue jumped 72% to $285.7 million, a quarterly best.Mutual funds and hedge funds owning Snap has dropped to 186 funds at the end of Q4 2017 vs. 309 funds in the first quarter that year.Snap may show a lowly Composite Rating of 60 (on a scale of 1 to 99) at IBD Stock Checkup, but its 91 Relative Price Strength Rating is excellent. In fact, it's a huge jump from a 14 just eight weeks ago.The 91 RS rating means Snap is now outperforming 91% of all companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months. At 18.63, the large-cap member of IBD's Internet-Content industry group is up 27% since Jan. 1.(Please follow Saito-Chung On Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary, analysis on growth stocks, breakouts and financial markets.)RELATED:The Latest In Investor's CornerSnap Shares Catapult Nearly 50% Higher On Strong Earnings ReportWith The Market In Correction, What Should You Do Now?

46,MMM,"Dow futures rose ahead of Tuesday's open, but lagged behind the Nasdaq and S&P 500 as the market gathered up to face a double dose of resistance. Caterpillar (CAT), Verizon (VZ) and United Technologies (UTX) stirred Dow futures early, as crude oil prices gained and investors dug into the session's long list of earnings results.Dow futures rose 0.6%, as Caterpillar forged a strong early lead, but premarket losses from Travelers (TRV) and 3M (MMM) limited gains. S&P 500 futures advanced 0.7%. Nasdaq 100 futures narrowed their early gains to 0.7%, with Paccar (PCAR) leading. But heavy losses from Incyte (INCY) and Biogen (BIIB) tempered the advance.The Dow has logged four straight declines. The Nasdaq has slipped in the past three sessions and the S&P 500 in two of the past three. The results left all three indexes back below resistance at their 50-day moving averages. The declines also pushed the Dow and S&P into negative territory for the year. The Dow industrials ended Monday down 1% for the year. The S&P 500 carried a 0.1% decline.The Nasdaq holds a 3.3% gain. But both the Dow and the S&P 500 must push past their 50-day lines, as well as into positive territory for the year, in order to put the market's struggling uptrend back on track.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

47,MMM,"Is United Technologies (UTX) a more valuable property together or is UTC better off in three separate businesses? That's the question for one of the largest U.S. industrial conglomerates — and an answer should be coming soon, its chief executive said Wednesday.X United Tech's $23 billion megadeal for Rockwell Collins (COL) last year was seen as prelude to a potential breakup of the industrial giant years down the road. As investors digested that hefty price, some hoped that CEO Greg Hayes would separate the aerospace-focused units from the parts of the company that make Carrier air conditioners and Otis elevators.On Wednesday morning, Hayes signaled he's open to all possibilities for United Tech's disparate businesses as a result of a ""great benefit"" from the recently enacted tax reform.""By end of year, we will come back and have some answers in terms of what we really think we should do with the portfolio long term,"" he told the audience at the Barclays Industrials Select Conference in Miami, Florida.""The real question is do you get significant multiple expansion by having separate companies vs. the conglomerate (structure),"" he added, describing aerospace as a $45 billion-$50 billion business that enjoys significant scale, elevators as a $12 billion-$13 billion business and climate-control systems as a $17 billion-$18 billion business.Hayes expects the Rockwell Collins acquisition to close by June or July and add to earnings next year.Under the Trump corporate-tax cuts, United Tech will be able to pay down the Rockwell debt much more quickly than it had anticipated even six months ago, giving it options around the portfolio, he explained. The company has $8 billion in cash overseas and expects to repatriate about $3.5 billion this year, about $2.5 billion more than it had expected.Shares of Connecticut-based United Technologies punched up rallied 2.2% to 129.26 on the stock market today. The Dow Jones component sits 7% below the late January high of 139.24, but found resistance at the 50-day line Wednesday. It has gained 13% over the past year vs. a 20% gain for the Dow Jones industrial average as a whole.Dow peer General Electric (GE), which is mulling a breakup of its own, retreated 1.7% Wednesday. GE shares have lost more than half their value over the past year, with the company mulling a sale of its industrial gas engines business and selling an overseas part of its iconic lighting unit as it tries to remedy a sharp decline in profits. 3M (MMM) fell 1.1% to 232.18.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersThe breakup question for many U.S. multi-industry companies comes as some investors have grown disenchanted with the conglomerate structure.In part, the disenchantment stems from concerns that hoped-for synergies among component businesses have failed to materialize.In September, Hayes had described talk of a corporate breakup as premature, telling The New York Times that United Technologies will need the revenue from all of the combined operations' businesses to pay down debt tied to the Rockwell Collins deal.Hayes pointed out Wednesday that the various businesses within conglomerates benefit from shared back-office services such as payroll and centralized tax systems.""There are, as you can imagine, significant dissynergies with splitting up the portfolio as well as one-time costs,"" he added.Hayes also affirmed at the Miami event that United Tech has resumed production on the geared turbofan engine and expects to ""have wrung out most of the teething issues"" by end of year.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?2018 Stock Market Forecasts: Read The Predictions For Top Stocks And IndustriesHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

48,MMM,"General Electric (GE) seeks to hive off a part of its industrial gas engine business in a move that could be an opening salvo in a more far-reaching breakup of the industrial conglomerate.X GE's divestiture of the unit, which makes the Jenbacher and Waukesha gas engines, would help management deliver on its promise to right-size its struggling core power division. It could bring inasmuch as $2 billion, Reuters reported Friday. The gas engines generate 100 kW to 10 MW of power and heat for industries in more than 100 countries across the globe. GE has manufactured gas engines for more than 80 years.GE reportedly has hired Citigroup (C) to prepare a sale process for the industrial gas business.

In Q4, power revenue fell 15% to $9.4 billion and profits plunged 88% to $260 million. In November, the industrial giant said gas power generation remains a key market but admitted to poor planning and operational execution, even as that market became more competitive and overcapacity issues ballooned.GE was hard hit by the acquisition of French multinational Alstom's power and grid businesses for $10.1 billion in 2015. It placed that bet as global markets for gas power grew sluggish, critics say, and made too many concessions to secure the deal. GE anticipated $3 billion in cost synergies and a strong return from the deal, but said in November the transaction was performing below expectations.CEO John Flannery said at the time that he expects it will take one to two years to fix GE Power. In December, GE announced plans to slash 12,000 jobs from its power unit as part of a broader effort to cut $3.5 billion in costs by the end of 2018. Disruptions in the power market are driving significantly lower volumes in products and services, GE Power CEO Russell Stokes said.In January, Flannery signaled he was open to a more far-reaching breakup of the company and floated the idea of spinning off or even selling GE's power, health care and aviation mainstays.Meanwhile, the company is being probed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for issues tied to a legacy long-term-care insurance business.

The Reston, Va.-based builder rose 3% to 2,891.58, causing the price-weighted industry group to show a gain, but nearly every other homebuilder was down in price.Gold prices rose more than 1%, which explained the miners' advance.

50,MMM,"General Electric (GE) shares turned lower Monday afternoon as a widely followed Wall Street analyst turned more bearish on the stock.X Steve Tusa of JPMorgan said that he sees ""an expedited evolution of outcomes at GE"" given continued underperformance, challenging fundamentals, revelations about the cash hole in its financial  business, and lack of signs of a turnaround.Tusa noted recent management comments on evaluating the conglomerate's vast portfolio of businesses. But he sees ""more urgency in the situation"" given the recent moves in GE bonds and, he added, a growing realization that, even if cash improves, the balance sheet does not offer many options for future growth.""In other words, it's either a steady grind in uncertain markets, with risk that things get more extreme in more volatile capital markets, or it's a change in structure to try and de-risk, and simplify the portfolio to grow it in a more focused way in the future, and we see a bit of a mix,"" Tusa wrote in a Feb. 12 note to clients.A low-growth portfolio ""with weak free cash flow and too much leverage"" raises the question of whether an equity raise is possible, Tusa added. He maintained an underweight rating on GE stock and lowered his price target from 16 to 14.Shares of GE fell 0.8% to 14.83 on the stock market today, pulling back from an earlier high of 15.14. The Dow component's stock has halved in value over the past year and sits at its lowest level in more than six years.

For more analysis on GE, visit IBD Stock Checkup.Tusa does not believe GE needs to raise equity from a liquidity or survival perspective. However, such a move would lower leverage, providing safety and optionality, though it could also raise the dividend burden and make a cut more likely, he added.In January, GE countered the idea of a potential equity raise by saying that it has no plans to raise new capital and has already taken steps to shore up its cash position. The company slashed its 24-cent quarterly dividend payout in half  last November.GE rallied at the start of 2018 after a dismal 2017, but the stock resumed its downtrend after the company spoke of an SEC probe and portfolio changes.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?Don't Panic, It's Just A Correction: Here's What You Do NowWhen To Sell Stocks — Rules That Help You Protect Profits And Avoid LossesIs It Time To Get Into — Or Out Of — The Stock Market?How To Spot A Major Stock Market Top, The Easy Way

51,MMM,"The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3% and enjoyed gains from a wide array of industrial and consumer stocks Wednesday. But the market's overall gains are stunted by a sell-off in an equally diverse range of industries, including automakers, internet retail, movies, gold and silver mining, mortgage finance and chip equipment. Alphabet (GOOGL) is in a critical juncture as it fights to cut losses, rising nearly 0.7% to 1,014.The Dow, helped by strength and 1-point-plus gains in its components Verizon Communications (VZ), 3M (MMM), IBM (IBM) and Travelers (TRV), edged around 0.3% higher. That's better than a slight gain for the S&P 500 and a loss of around 0.5% for the Nasdaq composite as of 2p.m. ET.Watch to see if the 30-stock Dow Jones industrials, now around 23,934 and down 3.2% year to date, can avoid a crossing of the key long-term 200-day moving average, which has been rising slowly yet steadily ever since the major indexes flashed a rare Day 3 follow-through on June 30, 2016, signaling that a major move up in stocks was highly possible.You can see the 200-day moving average clearly as a black line in all daily charts of MarketSmith, IBD's premium stock charting and screening service.

When you have a double-digit gain and the chances are high that all of those gains are wiped out, it's better for individual investors and small investment advisors to gut the position entirely and salvage at least a small gain. That way, you prevent a total loss.

The Russell 2000 dropped 2%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in slightly higher than Thursday's levels in the stock market today. Headed into Friday, the S&P 500 showed seven distribution days, with four of those days showing declines of 1% or more.A distribution day is when one of the major indexes falls at least 0.2% in volume that rises vs. the prior session. Such action indicates intense professional selling, which can lead to a new market correction.For the week, the Nasdaq slumped 6.5%, the S&P 500 gave back nearly 6% and the Dow fell 5.7%. The bond market was relatively quiet Friday as the 10-year Treasury yield eased 1 basis point to 2.81%.

Athletic shoe giant Nike reported quarterly results late Thursday that topped views and offered a bullish outlook. But DowDuPont (DWDP), 3M (MMM) and Pfizer (PFE) lost more than 3% apiece.Big-cap techs showed continued weakness: Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) each fell 2% or more. Apple extended its slide for a sixth straight session and is now 10% off its high.Banks, semiconductor ad technology led the downside among sector funds. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) tumbled 3% to take out its 50-day moving average. Dow component Intel fell 2.7%, while graphics chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) slid nearly 4% and rolled back below its 50-day line for the second time this week. Micron Technology (MU), which reported earnings late Thursday, was down nearly 8%.Investors flocked to a safe haven Thursday as technology and most other sectors got routed amid heightened trade war fears.Most equity ETFs saw losses. But Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) held on for a 0.4% gain and even managed to close above its 50-day moving average. The defensive ETF has been testing that support line the past week. When the market is in confirmed uptrend, a rebound off the 50-day can set up a potential buy opportunity. But when the uptrend is under pressure, all buys are at greater risk than usual.Also note that since late January, the 50-day line has been below the 200-day line. That's a bearish sign.

57,MMM,"The SEC probe into how General Electric (GE) records revenue for servicing industrial equipment raises significant risks for the troubled industrial giant, according to a Wall Street analyst.X GE disclosed during its Jan. 24 quarterly report that it is being investigated by Wall Street's government watchdog. Financial regulators are looking into both what led the company to take a worse-than-feared $6.2 billion charge to its insurance reserves, as well as whether its accounting and controls for long-term service agreements (LTSAs) may have been lacking in any way.The service agreements — a major part of what GE calls ""contract assets"" — are troubling to John Inch of Deutsche Bank. They have become bigger drivers of GE's slowing profits, even though they are drawn in large part from GE's severely challenged power business, he wrote in a Jan. 29 analyst note.""LTSAs potentially comprised 22% of GE's earnings in 2017 — a sizable step-up from 16% in 2016 despite the 2017 collapse of the Power business,"" he noted.That discrepancy highlights issues tied to the value of GE's contract assets. One is that GE often books revenue before it actually gets paid by customers. Another is that the ongoing downturn in the power market heightens the risk that GE may have to revise down the value of its contract assets, Inch said.""If GE were required to revise down the value of its contract assets (which are based on internal company assumptions), this would result in negative drag to the company's book value — coming at a time of rapidly rising GE Industrial debt,"" Inch added. Ultimately, a potential write-down could hurt Wall Street's consensus 2018 EPS guidance of $1 for GE, pushing its share price even lower, he said.Shares of GE slipped 2% to 15.95 stock market today, closing below 16 for the first time since Dec. 1, 2011.

While he said Monday that he doesn't think there will be a trade war, he added that the U.S. is ""not backing down"" on tariffs.Eaton has already sized the tariff impact as a potential 2% headwind to 2018 earnings per share, Dray noted.Overall, the tariffs would squeeze near-term margins for manufacturers of automobiles, HVAC systems, electrical equipment, and construction or building products, Dray added.Still, RBC expects multi-industry companies to eventually withstand the tariff  impact, citing strong underlying fundamentals in the manufacturing sector and the recent tax reform windfall.Shares of United Technologies closed up 1.4% at 131.71 on the stock market today, on reports that Republicans in Congress were pushing back more against the tariff plan.

61,MMM,"February's stock market performance serves as a reminder that volatility can still take a bite out of market leaders like Apple (AAPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL). After a stunning 2017 in which everything worked, the market entered January with aggressive buying, sending the major indexes to all-time highs.X But February started with a shocking reversal. The market experienced its first correction, defined as a 10% drop, in two years. The S&P 500's 10.2% decline was as swift as it was dramatic. It lasted just nine days, ending Feb. 8. But the damage was done.Despite bouncing back the last three weeks, the benchmark ended the month down 3.89%. It's first monthly loss since March 2017. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.3% in February, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds lost 3.61% according to Lipper Inc. Surprisingly, S&P 500 Index funds beat the index by 18 basis points, down 3.71%, according to Lipper.General domestic taxable bond funds average a loss of 0.8% in February and were down 0.75% year to date.""The past month has been a snapback of the previous month,"" said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide Funds. In January investor sentiment turned aggressive, especially in technology, buying went a little too far too fast, Hackett said. Then at the beginning of February it reversed, partly triggered by the specter of rising interest rates.""It was indiscriminate selling,"" said Hackett. ""Even the names you would think of as safe havens didn't work because people thought of the defensive stocks, like telecom and utilities, as bond proxies and sold them. The fact we had a correction is not the slightest bit unusual and actually a healthy thing. You get a pressure valve release, so things don't get overheated and people don't get too complacent.""David Joy, the chief market strategist for Ameriprise Financial, said he wasn't surprised the market recovered quickly, ""because there was no change in the fundamental outlook. We think the economy will be quite strong and that we're going to get growth close to 3% this year.""The February bounce back came because of two events from Washington, the spending bill and tax reform, which combined should increase gross domestic product over the next two years by 50 basis points, said Lawrence Kemp, the portfolio manager of the BlackRock Capital Appreciation Fund (MAFGX). The fund was up 6.75% year to date going into Friday vs. the S&P 500's return of 0.49%, according to Morningstar.""That's positive for additional money for the consumer to spend and for corporations to invest and to increase dividends and buy back stock,"" said Kemp. ""It's a very positive tailwind regarding U.S. fundamentals and for very strong earnings growth.""We're overweight in technology,"" said Kemp. ""Financials will benefit from a rising rate environment.""Among the fund's top 10 holdings are five technology stocks, Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), Google parent Alphabet, Facebook, Booking Holdings (BKNG) (formerly Priceline Group) and China's Tencent Holdings (TCEHY).His top financial picks are Visa (V) and Bank of America (BAC). He also said he thinks the health care sector and consumer discretionary stocks will do well this year. He likes UnitedHealth (UNH) and Constellation Brands (STZ), a beer and wine company.Hackett and Joy agree that technology and financials are likely to do well. Other technology companies to look at are the ones repatriating income back to the U.S., such as Apple (AAPL), Oracle (ORCL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO).As for financials, they say look at the large money center banks, such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS).  They both also see potential in late-cycle winners like industrials. This would include Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX)) and 3M (MMM).The names that were down because of interest rates have not bounced back nearly as much. Hackett said real estate is down 9% year-to-date, telecom is down 8% utilities are down 7% and consumer staples are down 7%, Names that were defensive and that you would expect to perform well in a volatile period to perform have not and are not viewed as defensive but as interest rates sensitive, and are suffering because of that.""We're also constructive on the international markets,"" said Joy. ""We like equity market in most parts of the world, developed and emerging, as there is a global recovery. There are not too many countries where the economies are not expanding. You still get very accommodative central bank policies in Europe and Japan and cheaper valuations.""""Even with huge upside in the U.S., we think foreign markets are one of the best places to be at this point, with the dollar weakening, the rest of the world lags the U.S. by two or three years,"" said Hackett, who said optimal international equity exposure would be 40%.RELATED:See What Leading Stocks Are Driving This American Century Growth FundNew To Stock Investing?

62,MMM,"General Electric (GE), an icon of American industry and the last remaining component of the original Dow Jones industrial average, now presents investors with a dilemma. At the brink of a potential breakup of the 126-year-old conglomerate, does the widely followed GE stock offer a transformational investment opportunity — or a dead end?X After years of attempts to remake the sprawling company, GE watchers aren't sure. Some say a GE breakup could unleash robust returns, but others see nothing but more damage to its already diminished value.After outlining a major slim-down in November, new GE CEO John Flannery is now open to a breakup, he revealed Jan. 16, and a major activist investor has reportedly pushed for it. But even breakup proponents say there's no quick fix for GE's problems. Indeed, key roadblocks, legal and otherwise, could make sticking together a better bet than a breakup for holders of GE stock.""GE cannot whittle down to three separate entities"" in power, aviation and health care, said Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch. ""Trust me, if it could, it would.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe breakup question comes as investors look for some upside to the beleaguered GE share price, which is at the lowest since December 2011. The company's status as an income stock play, a key reason to hold GE stock, was severely damaged after it halved its quarterly dividend to 12 cents a share in November. (The falling stock price, though, raises GE's dividend yield.)IBD'S TAKE: Investing for income alone can be risky if you chase stocks just because of their high dividend yields. Learn how to buy the best dividend stocks that combine yields with earnings growth and a solid share price trend. News of a potential breakup follows a disastrous 2017 for GE stock, which tanked 45% while the Dow Jones industrial average soared 25% and fellow Dow industrials 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX) jumped a respective 32% and 16%. GE's low price could even threaten its status as a Dow component. Other industrial conglomerates like Siemens (SIEGY) and Honeywell (HON), which also have also taken steps to slim down recently, saw hefty 2017 gains too.But you can't blame GE for not trying. The company is vastly different from what it was a decade ago. It has shed its stake in NBC Universal and most of one-time profit driver GE Capital, as well as its iconic lighting and appliance businesses. Former CEO Jeff Immelt sought to refocus GE on its industrial core and rebrand it as a ""digital industrial"" company, touting its efforts in software and the cloud.But that failed to arrest the decline of GE stock. Immelt stepped down as CEO in June after a 16-year tenure, and General Electric's longtime chief financial officer left in October. Soon after taking over as CEO, Flannery laid out plans in November to unload another $20 billion in assets and focus on the company's aviation, health care and power segments, which together account for most of GE's industrial revenue and profits.Yet the plan pleased almost no one, neither analysts seeking a radical restructuring of its vast asset portfolio nor investors looking for a clear path back to growth. It also left lingering concerns over the flagship power segment, which sells gas turbines and other utility equipment, where plunging profits led to 12,000 GE job cuts in December. Analysts caution that the power market is in the early stages of an extended downturn.The sale of other, smaller businesses had been telegraphed by GE, so Flannery's November announcement produced little sense of a bold vision. Then came the Jan. 16 bombshell that GE was on the hook for $11 billion in charges from its long-term care insurance portfolio and new U.S. tax laws. Management acknowledged more drastic moves might be needed. GE stock ended last week with a 13% loss, marking its worst week since 2009.GE shares fell a fraction Monday ahead of the company's fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday. Some analysts expect GE to slash 2018 earnings guidance again.""We are looking aggressively at the best structure or structures for our portfolio to maximize the potential of our businesses,"" Flannery said on a conference call. A review ""could result in many, many different permutations, including separately traded assets really in any one of our units, if that's what made sense.""For now, GE says everything is on the table, include outright sales and spinoffs. Flannery also floated the idea of staged exits, akin to the merger of GE's oil and gas division into Baker Hughes last July to form Baker Hughes a GE Company (BHGE).Other equity analysts look on GE more favorably. The conglomerate is now an asset story, and GE's well-established aerospace and health care segments would make exceptional stand-alone businesses, Scott Davis of Melius Research told IBD. Those two units alone are worth more than the entire market cap of GE, he says, while accounting for less than 40% of GE's revenue.GE Aviation is ""one of the best aerospace assets out there,"" Davis wrote in a December sum-of-the-parts analysis. He sees significant long-term value in the Leap engine and says aviation should enjoy strong services demand in the next two to three years.Here's What Fidelity Stock-Picker Will Danoff Likes Now – And What He Says About GEAnd General Electric could easily spin off its health care assets to ""unlock value"" in GE stock, similar to Siemens' upcoming IPO of its Healthineers unit, he adds.While Davis calls GE's power business severely challenged due to the rise of renewable energy, he believes it is fixable, with room for positive surprises down the road.Besides, Davis notes, the shareholder bases for GE's core businesses are completely different. For example, power holds appeal as a dividend payer and aviation as a secular growth engine.More immediately, he says Flannery should focus on cutting costs. That includes everything from general corporate expenses to its global research centers and its Predix software platform for the industrial Internet of Things. Many of these he describes as ex-CEO Immelt's ""very expensive investments that have just not panned out.""Since GE's Jan. 16 investor update, Davis has even more conviction in a GE breakup scenario.""The recent news helps confirm the fact that GE is too complex in its current form,"" he said. ""The conglomerate structure incentivizes wasteful and duplicative spending, while stifling the true earnings power of the underlying businesses.""But GE may not be able to take bold action without a feat of financial wizardry. What remains of GE Capital is saddled with $97.5 billion in debt, and the company is on the hook for more than $31 billion in underfunded pension liabilities, Deutsche Bank's Inch said in a Jan. 17 note to clients. GE is unlikely to separate aviation, power and health care into three stand-alone companies, especially since its industrial businesses backstop GE Capital's debt, he argues.""A separation of GE could carry serious ramifications in the bond market on which GE continues to heavily rely"" to fund the pension plan and operations, including the risk of litigation from GE Capital bondholders, he wrote.GE bonds also risk a rapid debt downgrade if General Electric gets rid of cash-generating businesses, which it can ill afford as a company on the hook for billions in pension obligations, he said in an interview.Other risks to GE stock loom. Inch cited billions in potential liability tied to the long-term-care insurance business, an ""inexplicably low"" tax rate that is almost certain to rise over time, a ""completely ineffective board"" that failed its duty to provide oversight and the ""very large, looming threat"" of class-action lawsuits from shareholders who may now feel misled.Before November, ""the company was adamant everything was great, the dividend was safe and secure,"" said Inch. ""I don't see how a company so large sees its earnings and dividends collapse. Somebody in the government, the SEC specifically, should be looking at what happened to get us to this point.""A GE spokeswoman said the company ""continues to work constructively with (government) agents as issues like that come up."" GE has set up a new board committee focused on capital allocation as it explores ""all options"" for its structure and portfolio, and is working through the legal and IP ramifications as part of its rigorous review, she added.For others, the math doesn't support the case for a GE breakup. A sum-of-the-parts analysis by Cowen's Gautam Khanna found GE's breakup value was 11-15 a share, below the current GE stock price near 16, after factoring in the underfunded pension and other debt-like items.""This implies that investors are currently ascribing a 'conglomerate premium' to GE's portfolio,"" Khanna said. In other words, asset sales are unlikely to add value, and a full GE breakup could even destroy value.And that doesn't account for operational synergies among the businesses that would be lost in a breakup of General Electric, he adds.Morningstar equity analyst Barbara Noverini also points out that innovations in one GE unit can provide solutions for another. For example, a subsea drilling platform in the oil and gas segment may draw from three other units: turbines from the power segment, distribution networks from energy management and imaging technology created in the health care segment.GE's complicated portfolio makes restructuring likely to be a multiyear slog, depressing earnings growth in the near term, she says. And in the GE dividend cut, the second in a decade, she sees ""a stark reminder that even great portfolios can suffer under the weight of poor capital allocation.""CFRA analyst Jim Corridore, too, points to synergies among General Electric's core units as a reason why a complete GE breakup is unlikely. The ""core R&D"" needed to make a gas turbine or an aircraft engine is basically the same, he says. Additive manufacturing technologies, or 3D printing, also connect its diverse business.""When you build a conglomerate, you build it for a reason,"" he told IBD. ""To break (conglomerates) up just because shareholders don't like the direction of the stock, that's no way to run a business.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:2018 Stock Market Forecasts: Read The Predictions For Top Stocks And IndustriesHow Did This Biotech Stock Become A Dividend Leader?This Top-Performing Dow Titan Is Reaping The Benefits of RestructuringAI In Business: What The Future HoldsHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

69,MMM,"U.S. stocks remained broadly lower at midday Tuesday in what appears to be a perfectly normal pullback after stunning gains earlier this month. Commodity plays helped pace the downside as agricultural chemical, oil and gas exploration, oil drilling, metal ores and steel shares fell hard.X Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, fell for the fourth time in five sessions. At 165.94, the largest company on the Nasdaq by market cap is now 4% below its 50-day moving average, which flattened out last week. Gains from an Oct. 27 breakout from a good second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 have now been squeezed to 3.4%, and shares are down more than 5% from the 176.34 buy point.Apple's 1.2% slide weighed on all three major indexes, with the Nasdaq composite down 0.9%, the S&P 500 off 1% and the Dow Jones industrial average sinking 1.3%.At least eight of the 30 components within the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2 points or more, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Goldman Sachs (GS), 3M (MMM) and McDonald's (MCD). Yet even with Tuesday's decline, at 26,198 the Dow stands 8.3% higher since Jan. 1.McDonald's posted a 19% jump in adjusted fourth-quarter profit to $1.71 a share. But sales dropped 11% to $5.34 billion, the biggest year-over-year drop since the first quarter of 2015.Nevertheless, shares of the fast-food icon have performed well since clearing a long saucer with handle at 130.10 in late March, rolling up more than 38% from that breakout point. As seen on a weekly chart, it continues to hug its slowly rising 10-week moving average (painted in red in all IBD and MarketSmith charts).On Monday, the Nasdaq notched its third distribution day, or instance of heavy professional selling, and its second in four sessions. Keep track of the distribution count for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 by reading The Big Picture column on a daily basis. When the current outlook for the market changes, you'll have a good strategy and motivation to take action to either sell stocks and reduce exposure, or hold on to your positions.At this point, a new investor in Apple shares has to decide where to draw the line in the sand. When a stock has gained 10% or more following a sound breakout, a good rule of thumb is to sell shares for a small profit to prevent a complete wipeout of gains. The stock can always be bought back when market conditions improve.From a longer-term point of view, however, Apple is still acting just fine.On Jan. 6, 2017, the iPhone, iPad and digital services giant broke out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12. By Jan. 18 of this year, shares rose as much as 52.5%. Over the same period, the Nasdaq composite rallied 32%. The S&P 500 also trailed, rising 22.9%. The S&P SmallCap 600 rose just 14.5%.Over that ascent, Apple survived normal-looking sell-offs that sent shares temporarily below the 50-day moving average in June and September. Notice on a long-term weekly chart how Apple did not venture too far below the 10-week moving average, which moves in similar form with the 50-day on a daily chart.Elsewhere in the stock market, investors sought to accumulate shares in select names in business and medical software. Workday (WDAY) rose more than 3% to 120.75 in volume running nearly double its usual levels. The stock is now slightly extended after breaking out of an eight-week cup with handle at 114.98.Find the correct buy point in this pattern by adding 10 cents to the highest price within the handle, which is 114.88.Paycom Software (PAYC), which also excels in the HR and payroll automation and outsourcing markets, erased mild early losses to edge slightly higher. At 92.69, the Oklahoma City-based firm has gained 7.5% after a Jan. 12 breakout past an 86.20 entry in a good flat base.Defensive industries including hospital, nonalcoholic beverages, soap and meat rallied.Back to the downside, Pulte Group (PHM) gapped down and dropped more than 3% to 32.18 in active turnover. The stock closed below its 50-day moving average on Monday for the first time since a breakout past a 24.53 buy point in a flat base in June 2017, marking a key sell signal.The homebuilder reported a 27% rise in Q4 profit to 85 cents a share, matching the consensus view. Revenue rose 12% to $2.79 billion, missing the Thomson Reuters estimate.A large number of Pulte's industry peers have also slid sharply below their 50-day lines, including NVR (NVR), LGI Homes (LGIH) and Toll Bros. (TOL). But a few reversed nicely off their lows, a good sign.After a healthy breakout and substantial price run, a sharp undercut below the 50-day line and failure to recover back to the support line is a key IBD defensive sell rule to help you preserve your profits.As a two-day Federal Reserve meeting on interest rate policy began on Tuesday, bond traders did not seem to actively seek bargains even after the recent sell-off in Treasuries. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond is currently at 2.71%.The 3-month Treasury paper has a yield of 1.42% and the 2-year note a yield of 2.12%; thus, the yield curve continues to maintain a positive slope.The Building sector ranks No. 3 among 33 sectors as ranked by mid- and long-term relative price performance as of the latest IBD Weekly print edition.

That would mark the biggest year-over-year increase since a 72% gain in the first quarter of 2015.In the prior four quarters, Illumina showed a 5% EPS increase, declines of 11% and 5%, and a 14% gain.Illumina, down just 0.5% to 240.40 in light turnover, has rallied in steady stair-stepping fashion after breakouts past a 12-week flat base at 189.58 on Aug. 2, 2017, and from a base-on-base breakout past 214.44 on Nov. 22.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary and analysis of breakouts, growth stocks, and financial markets.)RELATED:Can You Really Spot Major Market Tops?

It benefited from 3M (MMM), which leapt nearly 3% to an all-time high after the company's earnings and sales topped views. Megacap 3M also raised its quarterly dividend and announced plans to increase investments this year.Another contributor to the Dow was Caterpillar (CAT), which reversed higher. The heavy-equipment maker breezed past sales and profit expectations. The stock also is near a record high. United Technologies (UTX), which reported earnings Wednesday, and Boeing (BA) also were outperforming.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite were up 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was flat.

But the pattern is a risky late-stage base and it lacked a cohesive shape, making any purchase riskier.

Some of their charts continued to deteriorate.Alaska Air Group (ALK) gapped down to the lowest level since July 2016 but pared losses.

Southwest beat expectations, but cited higher labor and fuel costs.United Airlines (UAL) — which sparked a sell-off in the industry with a vow to raise capacity, match low-fare rivals and other strategic moves — fell 2% in intense volume.  The stock is forming a cup-with-handle base but it is faulty because the handle's depth exceeds 12%.RELATED:Dow Leader Caterpillar Just Steamrolled Estimates AgainAmerican Airlines Guides High, Tops Views; Southwest Beats, But Airline Stocks Keep FallingAmazon Price Target Raised On Expectations Of Strong Results

73,MMM,"Thursday's session was volatile early after major stock indexes opened nicely higher amid more weakness in the U.S. dollar and a three-year high for the euro. But the dollar moved off lows and the euro weakened after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi hinted that 2018 could come and go with no rate hikes despite improving economic conditions in the eurozone.X In late-afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average led the way, rising 0.3%. Dow Jones industrial component 3M (MMM) was a top gainer in the blue-chip index, up around 2%, after the company reported accelerating earnings and sales growth and also increased its dividend to $1.36 a share. That gives it an annualized yield of around 2.1%. Boeing (BA) also delivered a solid gain, up around 2%.The Nasdaq composite eased less than 0.2% as semiconductor stocks lagged. The S&P 500 gave back 0.1%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking lower than Wednesday's levels in the stock market today.Some of the worst performers in the Nasdaq 100 hailed from the chip sector with names like Broadcom (AVGO), Lam Research (LRCX), Xilinx (XLNX) showing losses ranging from 3% to 4%.Netflix (NFLX) and Biogen (BIIB) outperformed in the Nasdaq 100 with gains of around 2% to 3%.Airlines were also hard hit amid earnings from American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV).

Airline stocks plunged as United Airlines (UAL) said it would expand rapidly, setting the stage for a renewed price war.X The S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq all rallied solidly to hit fresh record highs as earnings season heated up. The falling dollar, which has acted as a tailwind for U.S. multinationals' stocks and profits, rebounded from three-year lows Thursday as President Trump said he expects a stronger greenback. Netflix (NFLX) was a big earnings winner. Intel (INTC) also did while after Texas Instruments (TXN) and Lam Research (LRCX) were among several leading chip stocks to struggle on earnings.

The Internet TV streaming giant ended 2017 with 117.58 million total streaming subscribers, with one analyst predicting 200 million Netflix subscribers in 2020.

Investors fear the move, done in part to regain relevance in the smaller cities United once abandoned, risks more competition and cheaper fares, helping passengers but threatening profits.

76,MMM,"Stocks staged a strong open Thursday, with earnings news driving early trade, but many early leaders were rapidly paring their opening gains.X The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 0.4% at the start of trade, the S&P 500 rolled 0.3% higher, as Caterpillar (CAT) and 3M (MMM) gave up the early gains that followed their quarterly reports.The Nasdaq Composite slimmed its opening gain to 0.3% higher, as Lam Research (LRCX), Xilinx (XLNX) and Biogen (BIIB) all backtracked their early advances.The dollar traded marginally lower vs. the euro and the yen. A four-day slide left it at a three-year low Wednesday, asserting a strong influence on the day's stock market action. Commodities moved moderately higher, crude oil was among the fastest early movers, although West Texas Intermediate had narrowed its early gain to less than 1%.Intel (INTC) and Boeing (BA) stepped up to lead the Dow, up 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively. Caterpillar shed its early 1.8% advance to trade effectively flat. Its fourth-quarter results showed earnings comfortably above expectations, after reporting Wednesday its overall sales growth accelerated to a 34% gain during the quarter,  a six-year high. The stock is looking to add a 10th straight week to its recent run-up, ending Wednesday up 70% from a breakout in April.Dow industrials peer 3M rose 0.6% after reporting an across-the-board beat in the fourth quarter. Shares closed in a buy range Wednesday, above a flat base buy point at 244.33.Apple (AAPL) inched up 0.1% and the four FANG stock tech leaders all posted early gains. Amazon.com (AMZN) led the pack, up 1% at the start of trade.IBD 50 stock Lam Research powered up nearly 3%, after trouncing analysts' earnings targets with a 94% jump in earnings in its fiscal second quarter.

The chip developer's shares are just below a cup-base buy point at 75.24.Biogen climbed 2%.

The gain hoisted the stock out of a buy range above a 335.90 buy point in a first-stage base.Varian Medical (VAR) vaulted nearly 8% higher. The maker of radiation therapy and imaging systems reported late Wednesday its fiscal first-quarter earnings spiked 113%, with revenue and full-year guidance also topping forecasts. The gain marked a breakout past a 114.19 buy point in a first-stage flat base.Tal Education (TAL) spiked almost 11% at the open.

77,MMM,"Apple (AAPL), one of the true tech forces in an outstanding 2017 for the Nasdaq composite, showed poor action Thursday, closing below the 50-day moving average.X The megacap tech's 1.8% drop to 171.11 came in above-average volume, the second straight heavy-volume decline.The Nasdaq, also hurt by some wild trading in the semiconductor sector, edged less than 0.1% lower but the Dow Jones industrial average, boosted chiefly by its industrial components such as United Technologies (UTX), 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT), rallied more than 0.5%.The S&P 500 added less than 0.1%. Deep declines in homebuilding, airline, chip equipment, RV, automaker and gold mining shares hurt the major U.S. indexes. The Dow transports sold off again, losing 1.6%. At 11,007, the sector index still holds a 3.7% gain since Jan. 1, but that now significantly trails a 7.3% year-to-date rise for the Nasdaq composite.At 2839, the S&P 500 boasts a 6.2% advance since Jan. 1 with four trading sessions left in January.The S&P SmallCap 600 led the day with a 0.4% lift. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq dropped from Wednesday's levels.Within the recreational vehicle industry group, Winnebago Industries (WGO) flashed a defense-type sell signal as shares dropped 4.35 points, or 8%, to 49.The leisure and transport stock play, a nice winner in 2017, slumped even further below the important 50-day moving average in volume that was 178% above the 50-day moving average.The 50-day moving average is an important tool for knowing when to sell and capture solid price gains in leading stocks. Drawn as a red line in IBD's daily charts, it traces the average closing price of a stock or an index over the past 50 trading sessions. Once a new trading day is completed, a new average close is computed and plotted on the chart; thus, the average is ""moving.""Healthy leading stocks hold above their 50-day moving averages. After a strong breakout, a mild pullback to or near the 50-day line (or the 10-week moving average on a weekly chart) for the first or second time offers a follow-on buy opportunity.Winnebago has rallied as much as 57% after breaking out of a long and deep cup with handle at 37.30 on Sept. 6 last year.Notice how Winnebago also gave an early sign of a potential change in character on Jan. 16 as the stock clipped its 50-day line in heavy volume. That was the first close below the mid-term support and resistance level since late August.Going back to Apple, watch to see how the largest company by market cap in the U.S. financial markets finishes for the week.For now, an 11.9% gain for the iPhone and digital services titan from an Oct. 27 breakout past a second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 has been whittled down to 6.2%.One of the key sell rules in IBD investing: Don't allow a 10% or more gain in a stock to turn into a complete round trip.Plus, the stock's relative strength line, painted in blue in all IBD and MarketSmith charts, has been diving over the past five sessions. That's a bad sign, because a falling RS line means a stock is underperforming the S&P 500.The action by Apple, certain chip plays such as Broadcom (AVGO) and other Apple component suppliers, also hints at institutional money rotating a little bit more out of tech and into cyclical and commodity-focused sectors.Broadcom, a humongous winner since the 2009 major market bottom, dropped nearly 4% to 247.25 in steep volume and undercut its long-term 200-day moving average. In doing so, the diversified semiconductor giant also did a round trip of gains following an Oct. 30 breakout past a 259.46 buy point in a nine-week flat base.Broadcom reportedly is a major chip component supplier to Apple.Those with outsize gains in Apple, however, have the luxury to be patient and check whether institutional investors see the recent sell-off as a brand new opportunity to buy shares and shore up the stock. As seen in a weekly chart, Apple is trading only 1% below the 10-week moving average, which moves similarly with the 50-day line on a daily chart.Apple began its impressive run back on Jan. 6, 2017, when it rallied out of a bottoming base pattern. Back then, it formed an excellent cup with handle that presented a proper buy point at 118.12.Since then, Apple's fundamentals have greatly improved, and the company has even posted mild double-digit growth (EPS up 11%, 18% and 24% in the past three quarters, revenue up 12% in fiscal Q4).However, as reported by IBD tech writers, some analysts are concerned about the sales figures of Apple's latest flagship, the iPhone X.For now, the fiscal Q1 EPS estimate has not changed as Wall Street consensus is for earnings to rise 13% to $3.80 a share.Elsewhere, chip equipment leader KLA Tencor (KLAC) dropped nearly 2% to 113.16 after being up as much as 5.9% intraday. The stock's uptrend is still intact, but continued negative reversals in heavy turnover would indicate that some institutions are heavily taking profits.On Dec. 18, KLA bolted past a 110.11 buy point in a base on base, but the ride has been volatile.As seen in IBD's stock research tables, which are ranked by performance among 33 distinct industry sectors, the Chips sector has fallen in the rankings after being in one of the top 3 spots for a long time in 2017. As of Jan. 24, Chips are now ranked No. 10. (See the complete rankings by going to Data Tables in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com, then click on IBD Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables.)Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rose nearly 1% to 1,686, gaining for a second straight session. But the fund still lies beneath its rising 50-day moving average. Shares are also still 52% below a 3,522 peak.Gold futures fell, sending the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) ETF down 0.8% to 127.93 in double normal turnover. Watch to see if the popular exchange-traded fund can climb back above a recent breakout point at 128.42.In crude oil markets, near-term WTI futures dipped nearly 0.6% to $65.24 a barrel.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary and analysis on financial markets, high growth stocks, and breakouts.)RELATED:Finding Great New IPOs: Who Are The Next Home Depot, Cisco, Yahoo And Google?The Renewed Case For A Bull Run In GoldInside The Big Picture: This Commodity Broke OutHow To Discover The Next Major Stock Market Top: Here Is The Easy WayKnow This Key Sell Signal For Growth StocksFinding The Best Growth Stocks: Follow A Simple Routine

78,MMM,"To get ready for earnings season, look for stocks in or near a potential buy range ahead of their next quarterly report. Roper Technologies (ROP) currently fits that bill. It's expected to release its latest numbers around Feb. 2. The stock is approximately 3% above a 267.93 buy point from a first-stage flat base.X Understand that jumping into a stock right as it gets ready to report means you likely won't have enough time to build a profit cushion before the release. That leaves you exposed to a sudden and perhaps sharp drop if the company misses analyst estimates or provides weak guidance. You can reduce your risk by waiting to see the actual numbers and the market's reaction. Another way to minimize the risk of a post-earnings sell-off is to use an options strategy.Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereIn terms of top and bottom line numbers, the company has posted three quarters of rising earnings growth. Revenue gains have also increased during the same period. Analysts expect earnings-per-share growth of 40% for the quarter, and 24% growth for the full year. EPS estimates for the full year were recently revised higher. Roper Technologies has a 96 Composite Rating and holds the No. 1 rank among its peers in the Diversified Operations industry group.

79,MMM,"General Electric (GE) could be left out in the cold while other U.S. companies, including fellow industrial conglomerates, benefit from a tax windfall, according to an analyst.X The GOP tax package that President Trump signed into law Friday cuts the current corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. But Deutsche Bank says GE could end up a ""significant net loser"" because the plan also calls for a 15.5% repatriation rate on earnings held offshore as cash, and 8% if overseas profits are invested in nonliquid assets, such as plants and equipment. The repatriation tax would be mandatory.As a result, GE could end up owing up to $9 billion in new taxes, or an average of $1.1 billion for the next eight years, on $82 billion in foreign earnings reinvested abroad, according to Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch.""GE's substantial tax bill would come at a difficult time for the company given GE's ongoing cash squeeze from weak cash generation that recently forced the company to cut its dividend in half,"" Inch wrote Dec. 20.GE's quarterly dividend is now 12 cents a share, a 50% cut, allowing the company to save about $4 billion a year.Additionally, Inch noted, $4.5 billion of GE's overseas cash hoard, as of Sept. 30, was held in countries that may restrict or limit the return of funds.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point may have the wind at their backs.GE has long enjoyed an ultralow tax rate, the result of ""aggressive"" tax planning that leverages both GE's position as a multinational and GE Capital's ability to move funds around the world for tax advantages, the Deutsche Bank note added.This year, the firm forecasts GE Industrial's tax rate to be less than 5%. By comparison, GE's multi-industry peers on average pay rates from the mid- to high 20s.Companies had held off on paying income taxes on foreign earnings until those funds are returned, or repatriated, to the U.S. The 35% domestic rate has led several companies to stockpile profits abroad, leading to charges of tax avoidance.Several profitable U.S. companies paid an effective tax rate far less than 35% between 2008 and 2015, due to the tax loopholes and special breaks they enjoy, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.In fact, 18 companies, including GE, Priceline (PCLN) and PG&E (PCG), paid no federal income taxes at all over that eight-year period despite consistently churning out profits, it added.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksHere Are The Latest Stocks Joining The Bitcoin FrenzyTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info Tech

80,MMM,"U.S. stock indexes sauntered to small gains midday Friday, with only small caps holding a losing hand for the week. Volume was running higher on the NYSE but flat on the Nasdaq.X The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 added 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively, while the Dow Jones industrial average sagged 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000, which was on track for a loss for the week, rose 0.8%.Breakouts midday Friday in strong volume included Signature Bank (SBNY), up 3% in volume 78% above average, and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGFA), up 3% in volume 330% greater than usual. Lions Gate has been rallying on word that the company is in buyout talks.Investors also might want to monitor stocks that are either in buy zones or close to buy points. For example, despite rising 25% last year and 5% year to date, the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average still has some potential buy opportunities.Stocks in their 5% buy zones include Goldman Sachs (GS), 3M (MMM), Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and DowDuPont (DWDP).Dow stocks in bases and not far from potential buy points include Coca-Cola (KO) and Travelers Companies (TRV).Of the above seven Dow stocks, four are expected to accelerate earnings growth in 2018. The four are Apple, Travelers, DowDuPont and Coca-Cola. Each has a base that is either first or second stage.As a stock advances, it pauses to consolidate. Breakouts from the first two bases are more likely to work than those from later stages.The base count is one reason why Apple may have more left as an investment. Also, Apple grew earnings 11% in fiscal 2017 ended in September, and the Street expects growth to pick up to 24% in fiscal 2018. While the 24% growth may be priced into the stock, earnings surprises offer the potential for additional thrust.Meanwhile, among IBD's 197 industry groups, three groups have shown uncommon strength this week.Over the past five sessions, the chip equipment group jumped 7% (think of stocks such as Applied Materials (AMAT)), while the commercial document group popped 4% (think label company Multi-Color (LABL)) and the hotel segment rose 3% (think La Quinta (LQ)). The biggest loser for the week was office supplies, down 5%.RELATED:Schlumberger Is Bullish Oil-Patch SpendingRetirement: Changes In The Roth IRACan This Great Stock Lead Again?

82,MMM,"The stock market held solid gains in afternoon trading Friday as the main indexes rose to — what else — fresh all-time highs.X The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.8% increase. 3M (MMM) broke out of a flat base, rising modestly above the 244.33 buy point.The relative strength line is near the lows of the six-week basing period, which shows considerable lag and reason to be suspicious of the breakout.

Marvell jumped past the 23.74 buy point of a cup with handle in volume about double its normal pace. Microsemi edged above a 58.07 buy point in a long consolidation. But volume was lackluster. For both chip stocks, the RS line is lagging.Regional banks continued a parade of breakouts. Heritage Commerce (HTBK) was trying to hold above its 16.73 buy point. Breakout attempts for First Midwest Bancorp (FMBI) and BancorpSouth Bank (BXS) lacked much energy.Online lender Curo Group Holdings (CURO) broke out from its first base since it went public Dec. 7 at 14 a share. The IPO base had a buy point at 15.09, and shares were in buy range in late trading. The company posted earnings of 54 cents a share in 2015 and $1.46 in 2016, and for 2017 expectations are for EPS of $1.80.RELATED:Twitter Jumps As Facebook Flops Over Shift In Content StrategyChipmaker Marvell Beats Third-Quarter Targets; Shares Climb3M Reaches 80-Plus Relative Strength Rating Benchmark

83,MMM,"Honeywell (HON) set a conservative 2018 profit target Wednesday, but it was seen as part of a pattern of underpromising and overdelivering.X The industrial giant expects earnings of $7.55-$7.80 per share in 2018, with the midpoint 8 cents below the consensus view of $7.76, according to Zacks Investment Research.

86,MMM,"The power division of General Electric (GE) will slash roughly 12,000 jobs globally as the industrial conglomerate looks to take out $3.5 billion in overall structural costs by 2018. One billion dollars is targeted to come from GE Power.X The core, but deeply troubled, GE unit has been hard hit by weak demand for gas turbines and coal-fire plants. Traditional power markets, including gas and coal, are challenged by ""overcapacity, lower utilization, fewer outages, an increase in steam plant retirements, and overall growth in renewables,"" GE said in a statement Thursday.Russell Stokes, CEO of GE Power, described the decision as a ""painful but necessary"" one that would help drive a turnaround in margins and cash flow for 2019 and beyond.But in the short term, Stokes expects market challenges to continue.

"
90,MMM,"General Electric's (GE) moment of truth dawns Monday, with new CEO John Flannery set to reveal a turnaround strategy for the troubled industrial giant.XFlannery is expected to announce dramatic changes at GE, which is staring a cash crunch and meager profits in the face. He has said he will slash more than $20 billion in assets and costs, with Reuters reporting layoffs in its software division. He is likely to slash GE's prized high dividends to fund the turnaround.But even those moves may not be bold enough to satisfy restless investors, who see GE stock stuck near five-year lows while those of other industrial giants like 3M (MMM), Siemens (SIEGY) and Honeywell (HON) have shot up. GE shares rose 2.5% to 20.49 on the stock market today, but have fallen 35% this year, wiping billions off the market capitalization of this 125-year-old giant.Problems dog even its core units, such as GE Power. An executive shake-up is underway after former Chief Executive Jeff Immelt retired earlier than expected, with his own strategy to focus on GE's main industrial operations failing to produce the hoped-for gains. As his successor Flannery gears to share how he will put GE back on the right track, these are some questions that analysts are likely to ask:In just the past few weeks, speculation has ballooned about the businesses that could get sold or spun off. GE's aircraft-leasing, locomotive, and health care IT units are rumored to be headed to the chopping block. But analyst Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets expects more than a nip-and-tuck.""We're looking for an upheaval of the previous GE business model,"" he told Investor's Business Daily.Dray has previously said ""anything less than a promise to 'de-conglomerate' GE will be disappointing"" and he thinks GE could make a wholesale ""staged exit"" from Baker Hughes (BHGE), the oilfield services company of which GE is a majority owner.But in an interview, Dray said shedding the health care unit would be the ""most telling"" sign of GE's commitment to change. That segment, in his view, isn't broken but doesn't fit in GE's industrial infrastructure portfolio.GE could shrink its portfolio to the core aviation and power businesses, he said, adding that he's especially looking for a ""deep dive"" on the strategy for power, which has been hit hard amid a shift to wind and solar, as well as other disruptive technologies.IBD'S TAKE: Find the best stocks to buy now by regularly reviewing screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Flannery has said there will be ""no sacred cows"" as he seeks to reshape GE. Many take that to mean a threat to the company's prized high dividends — GE stock has a 96-cent annual payout.Many income investors have come to view GE's dividend as sacrosanct, in part because the Dow giant has paid it for years and consistently describes it as a top priority.But a chorus of analysts recently pointed out that GE's businesses don't produce enough cash to support its rich dividend and that GE would do better using its cash to fund a new growth strategy.Morningstar's Barbara Noverini is modeling a dividend cut to 65 cents next year. JPMorgan's Steve Tusa, a noted GE bear, says a ""material"" dividend cut is likely, but cautions that this strategy is not sustainable"" in the long run.""Ultimately, it's the state of the business that matters because things have to turn and grow to sustain whatever they decide longer term,"" he wrote in a recent note to clients.RBC's Dray told IBD that GE's portfolio moves and divestitures will give it ""some cover"" to say a smaller notional dividend is in line with a smaller GE, rather than a reflection of cash constraints.While Dray noted that the options market is pricing in a ""more severe"" 66% dividend cut, he considers a 30% cut more realistic.""Everything is on the table,"" Flannery told investors last month.That has led to murmurings that anything is possible — even a once-inconceivable breakup of the industrial giant, whose manufacturing businesses span jet engines, gas turbines, medical scanners, locomotives and more.With that possibility in view, analysts have been crunching numbers as to how GE's market value stacks up against a piece-by-piece tally of its key business components.JPMorgan's Steve Tusa conducted a sum-of-the-parts analysis and calculated the while GE's aviation and health care units are valued at or above sector averages, its power, renewable energy, transportation and lighting units are below them. He assigned GE stock with a fair value of 17, below the current value, and sees downside risk in the event of an expedited breakup.""The standing stock price is likely overvalued, with aggressive portfolio rationalization likely to be a dilutive exercise, at least in the near term,"" Tusa wrote on Thursday.Scott Davis, head of Melius Research, who also conducted an SOTP analysis, concluded that GE's current market cap of $176 billion puts it approximately $90 billion below what the company should be worth, based on the anticipated future earnings of each business unit.Davis believes Flannery will need to break GE apart in a more aggressive fashion.The plan for GE to sell or spin off $20 billion in assets amounts to roughly 12% of GE's market value. ""We think 50% is more in the ballpark of what's needed,"" he said.New CFO Jamie Miller said in October she's considering a ""back to basics"" approach to financial reporting.That comes amid growing disenchantment about how GE reports earnings — specifically, its use of several custom metrics — and how it handles contract assets worth billions on the balance sheet.For example, GE offers at least three different measures for EPS: GAAP net income, GAAP income continuing operations, and industrial operating plus verticals earnings.Dray says new accounting standards, more aligned with standard industry practices, would improve the quality of its reports and boost transparency.He believes there is a very good chance that this highly sought change could come during the meeting GE's CEO will hold with analysts Monday.RELATED:Why There Is Little Hope General Electric's Dividend Will Stay IntactWhich Companies Are Now Outperforming 95% Of All Stocks?Dow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And Analysis

Goldman Sachs brought the company public on Nov. 17 at 15.Among the day's movers, Deere & Company (DE) extended gains, rising 2%, after shares popped 7% last week on strong earnings.Inside the IBD 50, Ichor (ICHR) added nearly 4% as it trades near the 50-day moving average.

98,MMM,"The Dow Jones industrial average edged nearly 0.2% higher in afternoon trading Monday, thanks in part to strength in 3M (MMM), Home Depot (HD) and insurance giant Travelers (TRV), all of which rose 1 point or more. The other major indexes showed tiny pullbacks after nifty advances during Thanksgiving Week.X Meanwhile, the IPO market continued to bolster investors' returns as streaming video hardware pioneer Roku (ROKU) surged more than 10% to 44.71. The small-cap member of IBD's Consumer Products-Electronics industry group is up 49% since charging out of a first-stage IPO base at 29.90 on Nov. 10.Roku has lost money in all but one of the past 11 quarters, but sales have been brisk, rising 17%, 28%, 19% and 40% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. The Street sees the Los Gatos, Calif., firm losing 10 cents a share in Q4 vs. a 3-cent profit in the year-ago quarter.At 2:45 p.m. ET, the S&P 500, up nearly 1% during last week's four-day session, was virtually flat as gains by consumer electronics retail, homebuilder, solar, internet content and select food stocks offset declines in the oil and gas, cement, metal ores, generic drug, outpatient and home care, and long-term medical care industries.The small-cap S&P 600 lost 0.4%; it was down nearly 0.6% in the early going. The Nasdaq composite was virtually flat after lifting more than 1% last week.Volume is running higher on both main exchanges following Friday's half-day session.On the NYSE, Square (SQ) slid more than 11% to 43.44 in massive turnover. At 2 p.m. ET, more than 49 million shares had already changed hands, vs. its 50-day average turnover of 11.5 million and running at more than six times the usual pace. The midcap tech has a market value of $16 billion and a float of 255 million shares.The 5.42-point drop in heavy volume is Square's largest in a single session since the stock initially broke out in late February. That stands as a mid- and near-term sell signal. (On the IBD daily chart, the red line running across the volume bars is the 50-day moving average.)As noted in a Big Picture column last week, Square has been a truly outstanding performer in 2017. Briefly noted on IBD Leaderboard, the point-of-sale, data analytics and financial services firm for small and midsize businesses has climbed as much as 75% since breaking out of a nearly seven-week flat base with a 28.07 entry in September.However, the rally gained a near-vertical slope in recent weeks, and a 42% jump over just 10 sessions (from the Nov. 9 intraday low of 34.83) was one sign of climax-run-type action.Notice how on Friday, despite the market being open just 3-1/2 hours, Square saw heavy turnover but failed to make further headway. Such stalling action indicated that some institutional investors were selling into strength.Shareholders who prefer to make short- or midterm trades may decide to sell, especially if Square closes below its short-term 10-day moving average. (The IBD Leaderboard charts show the 10-day line in green.)Others with more conviction may decide to be patient and see if a new base will form. Meanwhile, the 50-day moving average is still trying to catch up, currently near 34.72. A drop to the 50-day line's current level from a 49.55 high would be equal to roughly a 30% correction, and that's not out of line for a new base to form after such a powerful advance.On Feb. 23, Square bolted out of a first-stage flat-base pattern with a 15.59 buy point in massive volume after the hardware and software tech play posted Q4 earnings of 5 cents a share, its best quarterly result ever, and a 21% jump in revenue to $452 million.The Street sees earnings rising 40% to 7 cents in the fourth quarter this year. Square currently gets a top-notch 99 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup and a 99 for Relative Price Strength on a scale of 1 to 99; but keep in mind that the Composite, EPS, RS, SMR and Accumulation/Distribution ratings are best used to determine which stocks to buy, and not when to sell.Elsewhere, Dow Jones industrial components Microsoft (MSFT) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) also showed healthy action, with the former rallying nearly 0.5% to 83.78 and keeping a healthy upward price gap that it produced four weeks ago. The software, cloud-computing and Xbox giant is up 47% since hauling out of a saucerlike base sitting next to a longer base over a few weeks in late July.Microsoft also produced tight trading after the breakout, yielding follow-on buy points at the 10-week moving average and ultrashallow flat bases.Cisco rallied more than 1% and gained further ground after a recent breakout from a saucer with handle at 34.20. The data networking and telecom gear giant recently gave a bullish sales forecast for the current fiscal year that ends in July 2018. Wall Street currently expects FY 2018 sales to rise just 1% to $48.5 billion, but that would mark a slight turnaround after a 3% drop in FY 2017.CFO Kelly Kramer noted in a Nov. 14 news release that the company returned $3.1 billion through share buybacks and cash dividends. On an annualized basis, that would be equivalent to 6.8% of the company's $182 billion market value.Elsewhere in other markets, WTI crude oil futures slumped 1.4% to $58.21 a barrel on the Nymex. Last week, oil fell short of retaking the $60 level, last seen in late May of 2015.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged up to 2.33%, unchanged since the start of October. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise short-term interest rates by a quarter point during its final FOMC meeting of the year, scheduled on Dec. 12-13.IBD's TAKE: Even with new IPOs, there's a right way and wrong way to buy such stocks.

99,MMM,"Crane (CR) had its Relative Strength (RS) Rating upgraded from 69 to 74 Wednesday -- a welcome improvement, but still short of the 80 or higher score you look for. X IBD's unique rating measures market leadership with a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score. The rating shows how a stock's price behavior over the last 52 weeks stacks up against all the other stocks in our database.

See if Crane can continue to rebound and hit that benchmark. See How IBD Helps You Make More In StocksCrane is still inside a buy range after breaking past an 84.44 buy point in a cup without handle. Once a stock moves 5% or higher beyond the initial entry, it's considered extended and out of buy range. Crane saw both earnings and sales growth rise last quarter. Earnings-per-share increased from -3% to 6%. Revenue rose from -1% to 0%. Crane earns the No. 10 rank among its peers in the Diversified Operations industry group.

Despite the charge, the aerospace giant raised full year cash flow outlook and its full-year core EPS to $9.90-$10.10 from a prior view of $9.80-$10.00. But the EPS midpoint is still under analyst views. Boeing's Q3 EPS fell 22.5% to $2.72, but topped forecasts for $2.65, while revenue rose 1.7% to $24.31 billion, above estimates.

101,MMM,"Caterpillar (CAT) kept up its momentum in the third quarter, reporting much better-than-expected earnings and revenue early Tuesday.XEstimates: EPS to jump 49% to $1.27, as revenue climbs 16.0% to $10.63 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: The construction and mining heavy equipment maker earned $1.77 per share on revenue of $11.4 billion.Outlook: Caterpillar expects full-year 2017 adjusted EPS of $6.25 on revenue of about $44 billion. In April, the Dow Jones industrial average component said it expected adjusted earnings of $5 per share at the midpoint of its revenue guidance of $42 billion to $44 billion. Before Tuesday's report, analysts were expecting fiscal year EPS of $5.29 on revenue of $42.94 billion.Stock: Caterpillar shares jumped 5% to 138.24, hitting a new all-time high intraday. Caterpillar is second-best performing Dow industrials stock in 2017, up 49%. Boeing (BA), which reports earnings Wednesday, has soared 71% year to date.Caterpillar's strong results drove the Dow industrials, with United Technologies (UTX), McDonald's (MCD) and 3M (MMM) also lifting the blue-chip index early Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Caterpillar shares cleared a buy point of 99.46 when the company blew past Q1 earnings estimates. A buy point is the point at which an investor has the best opportunity for near-term gains, and Caterpillar has been a case in point, gaining more than 30% over the past six months. Here is a good place to start to look for other quality stocks that may be nearing buy points and poised for gains.On Monday, Caterpillar reported that global retail sales accelerated in each of its three main business lines over the past three months, with sales of machinery for resource industries up 8% vs. the year-ago period, construction machinery sales up 15%, and energy and transportation equipment sales up 5%.Commodities have rebounded, lifting demand among miners for heavy equipment, while housing markets in the U.S. and China remain robust. One potential cloud that hasn't seemed to dampen investor enthusiasm, Caterpillar has been subject to a federal tax investigation and has contested a package of taxes and penalties the IRS has proposed.RELATED:2 Stocks In Buy Zones With Earnings Due: Investing Action PlanUnited Technologies Tops Q3 Earnings Views, Raises GuidanceLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

102,MMM,"Powered by strong gains in construction- and mining-gear firm Caterpillar (CAT) and diversified manufacturer 3M (MMM), the Dow Jones industrials flexed more strength with a 0.8% gain to lead the stock market higher at lunchtime Tuesday on Wall Street.XCaterpillar (rising more than 4%) and 3M (climbing nearly 7%) both gapped up in heavy volume, a sign that institutions are putting even more money to work. Both members of the Dow Jones industrial average are also extended from proper buy points (99.56 for Caterpillar in a 13-week flat base, 214.67 for 3M in a 15-week flat base).At 12:30 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite lagged the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, rising around 0.2% to 0.3%.Volume zoomed sharply higher vs. the same time Monday on the NYSE but cooled a bit on the Nasdaq.Meanwhile, TD Ameritrade (AMTD) also showed nice action as shares retook a 47.36 buy point in a nine-week flat base that is part of a long base structure. Shares jumped 2% to 49.04 after the online broker reported its best quarterly results in more than three years. Volume is running 60% above usual levels; watch to see if total turnover goes at least 40% to 50% higher than the 50-day average of 2 million shares by day's end.TD Ameritrade, which has merged with privately held competitor Scottrade, posted a 29% jump in third-quarter profit to 49 cents a share, the biggest year-over-year increase since a 35% increase in Q1 of 2014. Revenue rose 19% to $983 million.That 19% jump also represents an acceleration in the rate of growth for a fourth quarter in a row. Revenue was flat in Q3 2016, then picked up by 5%, 7% and 11% in the next three quarters through Q2 of this year.TD Ameritrade shares had originally cleared the 47.36 buy point (10 cents above the base's left-side high) in late September, getting to as high as 50.72 before pulling back. Yet the pullback did not trigger any sell signals.At the intraday low of 46.66 on Oct. 19, the stock was just 1.5% below the entry. Not a big enough drop to warrant a sell.The buy zone for TD Ameritrade goes up to 49.73, or 5% above the proper entry. The stock sports an excellent up/down volume ratio of 1.6, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. Prefer those stocks with a 1.0 or higher ratio when they are attempting breakouts.Ameritrade's investment bank and brokers industry group has improved in recent weeks, rising to the upper half of IBD's daily rankings of 197 industry groups at 80th, up from 150 just eight weeks ago.Other leaders in the brokers industry group include Interactive Brokers (IBKR), which rose more than 1% to 51.16 in fast turnover. The stock is well extended after clearing a 38.49 buy point in a good saucer with handle in late July. The stock, which sports a 93 RS Rating and an A for Accumulation/Distribution, has rallied nearly 33% since that breakout.Last week, the discount broker posted a 43% jump in Q3 adjusted earnings to 43 cents a share, according to data from William O'Neil + Co., on a 33% spike up in revenue to $487 million.In other financial markets, investors continue to trim their holdings in U.S. long-term government bonds. The yield on the benchmark Treasury 10-year note edged up to 2.40%, the highest since May 10. The Street is almost unanimous in predicting a quarter-point rise in the short-term fed funds rate during the Federal Reserve's final meeting of 2017 in December.U.S. crude oil futures rose 0.9% to $52.36 a barrel. The U.S. dollar strengthened against the yen (almost at 114 yen vs. the dollar) but lost ground against the euro.IBD's TAKE: Using stock charts correctly can help you time your purchases in leading stocks so that you can maximize your gains and minimize losses within a relatively short period of time. Watching for breakouts from key chart patterns during earnings season is especially helpful.

103,MMM,"Major indexes edged higher at midday Monday, the start of a holiday-shortened week that currently see the market in a confirmed uptrend.Apple (AAPL) backtracked in light volume, and another light-volume drop could put shares back in buy range. Last month, Apple cleared a brand-new cup with handle, moving past a 160.97 entry. The 5% chase zone extends up to 169.02.XOther key megacap and big-cap techs to keep watching with less than two months to go in 2017 include Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Square (SQ) and Nvidia (NVDA). All five of these names rank in the latest IBD Big Cap 20.All five of these names are currently extended from a proper buy point. However, given their excellent fundamentals, superior position within their respective markets, and outstanding relative price strength, they certainly deserve a spot on a long-term watch list. New follow-on entry points or new bases will eventually emerge.At 1 pm ET, the Nasdaq composite rose less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 rose close to 0.2%. Most Chinese ADRs flexed strength, following a third straight advance for the Hang Seng equities benchmark in Hong Kong. Volume is running sharply lower vs. the same time on Friday, which saw turnover boosted by expiring monthly and weekly stock and index options.The Dow Jones industrial average rallied nearly 0.4%, buoyed by 1-point gains or more by at least five of the 30 components, including Home Depot (HD), 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT) and IBM (IBM).Investors received additional confirmation that the U.S. economy is rising. The leading indicators index showed a 1.2% gain in October, blasting the Econoday consensus view of up 0.6% and a big improvement from a 0.2% drop in September.Home Depot barreled more than 1.5% higher to 170.49, good for a new all-time high. The stock marked a follow-on entry point as it bounced off the rising 10-week moving average near 165 last week in hefty volume.Those who bought shares when the stock cleared earlier buy points may add a small amount of shares to the winning position. Adding shares to your best stocks is a great way to compound your overall return, but it should only be done when the market is in a solid uptrend, as noted in the Market Pulse table of IBD's The Big Picture.The Street sees the home improvement chain's earnings rising 12% to $1.62 a share in the fiscal fourth quarter ending in January. That would extend Home Depot's streak of double-digit profit growth to 16 quarters in a row.No wonder Home Depot's EPS Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, is a very respectable 92 on scale of 1 (atrocious earnings) to 99 (exceptional profit growth, both near and long term).Back to Apple, the stock provides multiple reasons why the outlook for a continued fundamentals turnaround remains very strong.Earnings per share jumped 24% to $2.07 in the September-ended fiscal fourth quarter, and Apple crushed the consensus view by nearly 11%. But perhaps more importantly, the iPhone marketer is poised to continue growing profit at double-digit pace into the next fiscal year.The Street sees fiscal Q1 earnings (for the quarter ending in December, a big-time shopping month) rising 12% to $3.77 a share; that would also be a quarterly best.A second reason to have confidence in Apple's turnaround? Revenue growth is accelerating. In the latest quarter, revenue jumped 12% to $52.58 billion, the biggest year-over-year gain in nearly three years. Analysts on consensus see sales picking up 10%, 30%, 25% and 17% vs. year-ago levels in the next four quarters.Three, Apple's ratings in IBD Stock Checkup continue to stay solid and show dramatic improvement vs. the start of the year. While the Composite Rating dipped just a bit to 89, it's still up strong from a lowly 51 on Jan. 1. The RS Rating continues to reflect leadership among big caps at 83.Four, the daily and weekly chart action for Apple has not shed any sell signals, other than to take profits at 20% to 25% for those who wish to raise some cash and look for perhaps a better growth name. Apple has jumped nearly 50% since clearing a first-stage bottoming base pattern at 118.12 on Jan. 6-9. Meanwhile, the B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, on a scale of A to E, indicates mutual funds, banks, hedge funds and insurers are overall net accumulators of Apple shares.IBD's TAKE: Taking many gains when your stock has risen 20% to 25% past a proper buy point is an excellent way to build a strong overall return. Not only are you locking in gains in a stock on the way up, but you are also freeing up cash to possibly put into another top market leader.

Analysts expect EPS of $8.95. 3M now sees full year sales growth of 4% to 5%, narrowing its early outlook of sales growth of 3% to 5%.Shares jumped 5.9% to close at 234.65 on the stock market today, gapping above a buy range and hitting a record high. 3M and Caterpillar (CAT) led the blue chips to record levels on their strong results, with United Technologies (UTX) and McDonald's (MCD) also contributing.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500 so far this year.3M's Q3 earnings jumped 8.4% to $2.33 per share and revenue was up 6% to $8.17 billion.

105,MMM,"The Dow remained a pillar of strength in afternoon trading Tuesday, helped by big moves in shares of Caterpillar (CAT) and 3M (MMM), which soared on strong earnings.XWith a little over an hour remaining in the session, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.8%, the Nasdaq composite rallied 0.3%, and the S&P 500 picked up 0.2%. Small caps did well: The Russell 2000 rose 0.5%. Volume on the NYSE was tracking higher than Monday's level. Nasdaq volume was on pace to be close to Monday's.Economic data were light, but money continued to flow out of bonds, lifting the 10-year Treasury yield higher by 4 basis points to 2.40%. WTI crude oil futures for December delivery added 1% to $52.48 a barrelOther earnings movers included TD Ameritrade (AMTD). Shares jumped nearly 3% to 49.53. A gain from a 47.36 entry hit 7% before the stock pulled back.ATV maker Polaris Industries (PII) soared 15% to 123.07, also on strong earnings. Polaris was featured as a call-option play in the latest Earnings Preview column. It just paid a visit to the 10-week moving average for the first time after a breakout last month over a 99.26 buy point.Carpenter Technology (CRS) is a good example of what a three-weeks-tight pattern should look like after a breakout. Shares soared 7% the week of Sept. 29. Soon after, it flashed a series of tight weekly closes, presenting an add-on entry of 51.08. Shares were recently trading around 51.55, up 3%. Notice that Carpenter hasn't shown a tendency in the past to form a three-weeks-tight pattern after a breakout. It certainly makes the latest pattern more interesting.On the heels of a 6% gain Monday, shares of Lumentum (LITE) soared another 6%. Wall Street was enthusiastic after Germany-based AMS gave strong guidance. AMS is a presumed supplier of 3D sensor technology to Apple (AAPL) like Lumentum.Lumentum is working on the right side of a 16-week consolidation that shows plenty of wild swings on the weekly chart. Wide-and-loose price action like this is considered a negative.On the downside, Biogen (BIIB) slumped below the 50-day moving average but recovered off lows. Shares were still  down 3% despite an earnings beat as investors worried about sluggish sales for some its key drugs, including its blockbuster Tecfidera, used to treat multiple sclerosis.RELATED:Grubhub Earnings Arriving During Period Of Intense CompetitionLumentum Lights Up As AMS Earnings Show Big Gains From AppleCaterpillar Soars On Blowout Q3 Earnings, Raised Guidance

VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) rose 0.5% but SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) was flat after paring early gains. West Texas intermediate crude oil prices surged 1% to $52.40 a barrel.Gold miners, biotech and health care funds lagged. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) fell 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively as gold futures dipped 0.3% to $1,277.30 an ounce. VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) sank 1%, while VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) gave up 0.6%.Although tech stocks have pulled back recently, two top FANG-owning sector funds (Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix, and Google's owner Alphabet) are still in a buy zone.First Trust Dow Jones Internet (FDN) has been in buy range since clearing a 101.94 entry of a flat base on Sept. 29. While it offered additional buy points at rebounds off the 50-day moving average, it rose 22% from a January breakout to its July 27 high.The fund, which marked its 11th year in June, has gathered $5 billion in assets. It tracks the Dow Jones Internet Composite Index, which starts with companies that generate at least half their annual revenue from the internet. They must also have at least a three-month trading history and meet minimum market cap, closing price and trading activity requirements.FDN's top sector weightings as of Oct. 20 include information technology at 70%, consumer discretionary at 19% and 5% in financials. Its top-five holdings are Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), PayPal (PYPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL), which together accounted for 32% of assets.The ETF's 32.2% year-to-date gain through Oct. 20 tops the S&P 500's 16.9% return, according to Morningstar Direct. Its average annual returns of 22.6%, 23.8% and 14.7% over the past three, five and 10 years, respectively, also lead the benchmark index.

107,MMM,"Stocks climbed near the best levels of the day Tuesday afternoon, as the Dow Jones industrial average led by a big margin and reached a record high.XThe Dow maintained its lead after 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT) surged on strong earnings reports and raised outlooks. 3M rallied nearly 8% and Caterpillar 4.5%, both hitting record highs. Combined, they accounted for about 80% of the Dow's 0.9% increase. That would be the industrials' best day since Sept. 11.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 were up 0.2%. The Philadelphia semiconductor index jumped 0.5%, stretching an advance of more than two months now, and giving the technology-laden Nasdaq a boost.Facebook (FB), a big piece of the composite, rose 0.9% as the social media bellwether tries to stay above its 50-day moving average. The small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 0.4%, while the Dow utilities average was down 0.3%.With 3M and Caterpillar raising the flag for industrial stocks, others were breaking out of bases in today's trading. Machinery, steel, mining, tooling and transportation equipment were some of the best industry groups.Lincoln Electric (LECO) cleared a 19-week base with a 98.07 buy point in average volume. The maker of welding, electrical and other industrial products had already topped the 93.58 buy point of a handle in its shallow cup-with-handle pattern three weeks ago, so the new entry is an alternate buy point.Hubbell (HUBB) rallied past the 126.03 buy point of a long, odd-shaped flat base that also has elements of a saucer with handle. Volume was heavy as the manufacturer of electrical products beat profit expectations this morning but missed sales estimates.Kennametal (KMT) rose above a 43.19 buy point in a cup-without-handle base, but volume was half the average. Pittsburgh-based Kennametal makes equipment for mining, construction, oil drilling, metalworks and other heavy industries. The company has been turning itself around after EPS fell for a couple of years. Analysts expect a 45% jump in earnings in the fiscal year ending next June.Avangrid (AGR) broke out of a flat base as it leapt past the 49.14 buy point in more than double its usual volume. A diversified energy and utility company, Avangrid beat estimates with an adjusted profit of 40 cents a share for the third quarter, up 11% vs. a year ago. Revenue fell 5% to $1.34 billion.Some health care, retail and gold stocks were among Tuesday's weakest.RELATED:Caterpillar Soars On Blowout Q3 Earnings, Raised Guidance3M Raises Outlook After Strong Q3 Earnings; Dow Stock Gaps To High

108,MMM,"Major indexes cooled again in afternoon trading Wednesday, but the week-to-date decline remains mild. Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, suffered its first gap down in price in more than four weeks, putting shares nearly back into the proper buy zone.XApple, up more than 46% year to date despite losing ground for a fifth straight session, had recently bolted out of a new, very shallow cup with handle at 160.97. The 5% buy zone goes up to 169.02.At Wednesday's intraday low, the iPhone, iMac and digital services marketer was at 168.38, 4.6% above the proper entry. But it's best to avoid buying while the stock is still trending down.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite fell nearly 0.6%, losing some of its strong bounce off early-morning lows. The Nasdaq had been down nearly 1% following a sell-off in East Asian equity markets. U.S. Treasury bonds rallied, sending the benchmark 10-year note's yield down around 5 basis points to 2.33%.Week to date, the Nasdaq is down nearly 0.6%, adding to last week's 0.2% dip. But the tech-rich index is still up 3.3% since the beginning of the fourth quarter.The Nasdaq 100, which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the all-electronic exchange, is up 4.7% since Oct. 1.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average also lost a little more than 0.5%. Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM) and Home Depot (HD) led the downside for the 30-stock Dow Jones industrials, each falling 2 points or more.Truck transport, major discount chain retailing, chipmaker, cement, heavy construction, airfreight and chemical stocks paced the market's downside.The Dow transports slipped nearly 0.6% as a rally in airlines helped cushion the fall.The Dow Jones industrial average is a price-weighted index, meaning that point moves, up or down, in triple-digit-priced stocks have more influence over the benchmark than, say, General Electric (GE). GE is up 1.5%, but the 26-cent gain has less impact.Back to Apple, which also has a big influence over the Dow. The megacap tech may be falling in response to reports of some users of the new iPhone X experiencing eye pain due to the newly enhanced OLED screen. Or investors may be reacting to news that retail sales in China, a key Apple market, rose 10% in October, missing a consensus estimate of 10.5% as reported by Bloomberg.Whatever the true reason may be, Apple continues to act like a big-cap leader should.In addition to continuing a string of higher highs and higher lows, Apple is still trading on the north side of both its 50- and 200-day moving averages. Plus, both of those averages continue to rise.Apple's Relative Price Strength Rating (see it, track it at IBD Stock Checkup or on an IBD daily chart) is now a solid 86, meaning that over the past 12 months, it's outperformed 86% of all companies in IBD's database.Apple also leads the Telecom-Consumer Products group with a 93 Composite Rating in IBD Stock Checkup. (Read this recent Stock Market Today column for five reasons why a long-term shareholder in Apple should continue to sit on shares.)Meanwhile, Inogen (INGN) may represent one of a new batch of emerging stock market leaders. The respiratory care products expert is hardly budging after gapping out of a seven-week flat base at 105.45 last week. The breakaway gap followed a strong third-quarter report (adjusted earnings up 32% to 33 cents a share, revenue up 27% to $69 million).Goleta, Calif.-based Inogen, a small cap at $2.5 billion in market value, is also up more than 70% past a 69.45 entry in a superb eight-week flat base. Inogen cleared that base in late February.Four more stocks that are showing strength after breaking out are Applied Materials (AMAT), which reports quarterly results Thursday; Sector Leader MKS Instruments (MKSI), which cleared a new cup with handle at 86.70 in September; Nvidia (NVDA), which on Tuesday returned to Sector Leaders, IBD's most stringent quantitative growth stock screen; and variety retailer Five Below (FIVE), which cleared a four-month cup without a handle at 54.23 in late September.Applied is part of IBD Big Cap 20, currently ranked No. 3 on that list.RELATED:Apple's iPhone X Screen Is Giving Some Users HeadachesStock Market Today: 5 Reasons To Keep Holding AppleThe Latest In Investor's Corner: Are You Using This Feature To Capture Breakouts?Stocks Near A Buy Zone

109,MMM,"General Electric (GE) CEO John Flannery isn't surprised by the plunge in GE stock over the past two days to its lowest point in nearly six years, but even GE bulls were surprised by the comeback strategy he unveiled Monday after more than 100 days at the helm — deeming it surprisingly bad, that is.XOn Tuesday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray yanked his outperform rating from General Electric. He said Flannery's turnaround plan fell short of a hoped-for sweeping reset and sees few reasons to believe the stock has bottomed at roughly 18.""There were very little new or bold ideas among the divestiture targets announced and no meaningful changes to the business model or quality of earnings,"" Dray wrote Tuesday. Instead, he said, Flannery's comments about missteps at the core GE Power segment and admission of systemic cash-flow shortfalls rattled the markets.Worse, GE executives said little about 2019 that inspired confidence in Dray about an eventual profit recovery. He slashed his price target on GE stock from 25 to 20, in light of ""deeper structural problems"" and a turnaround likely to be ""more protracted"" than previously thought.Meanwhile, Flannery told CNBC Tuesday he's unsurprised by GE stock's dive as disappointed investors bail, but insisted he can fix the broken industrial giant. Flannery on Monday vowed to slash both GE's vast portfolio of businesses and its beloved dividend to put GE back on the path to growth.IBD'S TAKE: Forget GE. These are some of the best income stocks for your watch list right now.But not all GE bulls are giving up. Melius Research's Scott Davis, who has a buy rating and $35 price target on GE stock, gave ""a B grade overall"" to that plan in a Monday note. Flannery's reset left him wanting more, and Davis suggested pushback from the board may help GE deliver on promises.Having an activist director was smart, Davis added, referring obliquely to Edward Garden of Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners. Garden joined the GE board just over a month ago.He believes things can get better for GE, if only because they can't get much worse.""Guidance was set appropriately low and seems very beatable,"" Davis said, adding that revenue upside offers ""incredible opportunity"" for investors.Shares of GE fell 5.9% to 17.90 on the stock market today after tumbling to 17.46 intraday, their lowest level since December 2011. GE crashed 7.2% on Monday.Among its industrial peers, Siemens (SIEGY) was fractionally lower, while Honeywell (HON), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX) advanced.RELATED:Why General Electric's Radical Moves Are Making The Stock Fall HarderAs GE's Moment Of Truth Nears, Look For Answers To These 4 QuestionsDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And Analysis

111,MMM,"General Electric's (GE) attempts at an image makeover with a slew of cost-cutting measures and executive reshufflings may be signs that things are about to get worse instead of better at the industrial giant.XOn Monday, GE announced that Ed Garden, founding partner of Trian Fund Management, will join its board. Trian has pressured GE to cut its $2.4 billion in corporate costs and revive its slumping stock price. The move followed several C-suite changes at GE on Friday, including the departure of CFO Jeff Bornstein.Analysts at JPMorgan, however, slammed the leadership moves, saying they suggest ""core fundamental challenges are worse than consensus is currently discounting,"" while also reaffirming an underweight on GE stock.""Not only is the baseline of the now hotly debated 'reset' likely lower, but what we think investors are ignoring is the trend line on the businesses, some of which have secular issues (i.e. implications for multiple), a hole that is unlikely to be dug out of with simple cost cuts alone,"" JPMorgan's Stephen Tusa and his team wrote in a Monday note.Tusa was referring to expectations that new GE CEO John Flannery will offer an updated 2018 outlook next month. GE already has signaled that a current EPS goal of $2 for 2018 may be too high.Also, Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague said Friday that the CFO change is ""especially troubling"" because Bornstein had been seen as Flannery's partner in his turnaround plan.Shares of GE dived 3.2% to 23.62 on the stock market today. Among industrial peers, 3M (MMM) edged up 0.1% to 216.64, just above a 214.67 buy point. United Technologies (UTX) rose 0.3% to 118.68 as it forms a flat base with a 124.89 entry point and an alternative entry of 120.29. 3M and United Technologies as Dow components, like GE.Honeywell (HON) dipped 0.1% to 143.54 after initially rising to a record 145.30 on reports that it's planning to spin off noncore assets into at least two public companies. Honeywell is in buy range from a 140.31 entry.IBD'S TAKE: Earnings season is about to kick off. Here's a list of Dow stocks near buy points to watch ahead of third-quarter results.On Friday, GE said Jamie Miller, who heads GE's transportation business, will assume the CFO role on Nov. 1. Bornstein exits at the end of the year, with two other GE vice chairs and longtime veterans.JPMorgan's Tusa questioned the ""rationale for a seemingly heavy focus on internal candidates"" in selecting a new CFO and added that the likelihood of a dividend cut ""moves materially higher.""Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague also said Friday that a dividend cut is now more likely.""The dividend consumes all or most of GE's industrial FCF (free cash flow) for the foreseeable future,"" Sprague added. ""A dividend cut could crush the stock as retail investors flee, but maintaining it gives GE little or no excess cash to grow the company. ""And now that activist investor Trian is getting a board seat, RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray says its engagement in shaping GE policy will intensify.""We expect Trian to promote value-adding moves like transitioning closer to GAAP EPS reporting, further boosting structural cost-out, and rationalizing the portfolio,"" he said in a Monday note, adding that the move highlighted that Flannery ""clearly wanted to avoid a messy proxy fight with Trian's Nelson Peltz.""Trian's $2.5 billion bet on GE in October 2015 is now worth about $1.7 billion, with Trian trimming its GE holdings by more than 20% as the stock has underperformed over the past year, Dray noted.RELATED:These 5 Dow Stocks Are Near Buy Zones As Earnings Season BeginsHoneywell's Expected Spinoffs Fall Short Of Investor's PlanDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisGE Shakes Up Top Execs While More Perks Fall To Cost-Cutting Drive

113,MMM,"In a welcome move, Bayer (BAYRY) saw its Relative Strength Rating improve from 68 to 73 on Thursday. X This exclusive rating from Investor's Business Daily measures price performance with a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score. The score shows how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks stacks up against all the other stocks in our database.

Start HereBayer broke out earlier, but is now about 4% below the prior 34.86 entry from a cup without handle. If a stock you're tracking clears a buy point then declines 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. Wait for the stock to set up and breakout from a new base and buy point. Also keep in mind that the latest pattern is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. Earnings growth dropped last quarter from 4% to -10%. But sales moved higher, from 5% to 6%. The company earns the No. 1 rank among its peers in the Diversified Operations industry group. Chemed (CHE) and 3M (MMM) are also among the group's highest-rated stocks.RELATED:Stocks With Rising Relative Strength RatingsWhy Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

114,MMM,"The freight train that is the stock market kept on chugging ahead in October, with the S&P 500 tacking on a 2.33% gain to make it 12 straight months of growth, according to Lipper Inc. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds jumped on board, advancing 1.70% on average, the 14th monthly gain in the past 15 months.XThe broad market got a lift from such leading stocks and Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Caterpillar (CAT), Apple (AAPL), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), 3M (MMM) and Intel (INTC).The October gain by U.S. diversified stock funds was due largely to ongoing global economic growth, increased odds of corporate tax reform with a possible lowering of the corporate tax rate, and increased likelihood of the Federal Reserve raising its short-term interest rate in the near term, said Jonathan Edwards, a manager of Invesco Value Opportunities Fund (VVOAX). The $839 million fund's 1.64% gain in October topped 69% of its large-cap value rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct.In addition, for the most part corporate earnings have been OK, said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. He added that a few individual companies logged disappointments, which helped mute investor sentiment. Sentiment was further dampened by infighting among Republican leadership. That reminded investors that corporate tax reform is not a sure thing, Samana said.With a 3.41% October gain, large-cap growth funds outpaced other U.S. diversified stock fund categories last month. Multi-cap growth funds averaged a 3.08% gain.Douglas Roman, manager of $92 million PNC Multi-Factor Large Cap Growth Fund (PEWAX), attributed outperformance by large-cap stock funds to strong economies in the U.S. and abroad. Large-cap companies are more likely to sell goods and services abroad as well as in the U.S. The PNC fund's 3.98% October gain outpaced 78% of its large-cap growth competitors.U.S. multinationals in particular got a tailwind from the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar vs. the euro, especially later in October, which helped U.S. exports, Roman said.Reflecting widespread global economic growth, world equity mutual funds rose 1.83% last month, topping the showing by U.S. diversified stock funds.India region funds led the way for foreign stock funds, jumping 5.89% last month.Global science and technology funds led the major sectors, rising 5.49% last month.General domestic taxable bond funds gained 0.29% on average in October. Loan participation funds' 0.56% return led all taxables in the month. Muni bond funds were about flat in October.The stock market got an additional lift from the hunt for a new chairperson of the Federal Reserve — who in November turned out to be current Fed Governor Jerome Powell. In October, investors appeared to welcome the prospect that the apparent leading contenders would keep the central bank on its current path of raising rates, said Charles Shriver, manager of T. Rowe Price's $2.3 billion Personal Strategy Balanced (TRPBX) and $295 million Global Allocation (RPGAX) funds. Balanced beat 87% of its allocation peer group in October. Global Allocation topped 62% of its direct rivals.Going forward, T. Rowe Price's Shriver likes foreign stocks in general more than U.S. equities. ""Fundamentals are positive, but valuations give us a little pause. We are underweight in areas whose valuations are a little more rich,"" he said.Among foreign stocks, ""Japan is an area where we see the cheapest valuations among developed markets.""IBD'S TAKE: Tokyo-based bank holding company Mitsubishi Ufj Financial Group was a top holding as of June 30 of $6.7 billion Matthews Asia Dividend Investor Fund (MAPIX), which is a diversified Pacific/Asia fund and an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner. The stock edged up 4.4% last month. Earnings per share rose 20%, 44% and 55% the past three months after having declined for five stanzas in a row.On the other hand, lower U.S. corporate tax rates would benefit U.S. stocks, said Invesco's Edwards. ""That favors economically sensitive stocks as well as financials,"" he said.Holdings he likes for those reasons include LPL Financial (LPLA). ""They are one of the largest independent financial advisory firms,"" Edwards said. ""One hundred percent of their profits are from the U.S., so they would benefit from a lower corporate tax rate. And a significant part of their earnings are from interest on customers' cash balances. As interest rates go up, they would earn more on those balances.""He also cites SVB Financial Group (SIVB). ""They're a regional bank (mostly) in California, focused on the technology sector,"" he said. ""A lot of their loans are floating rate. As (the Fed raises) short-term rates, it would increase their net interest margin."" And the large portion of their profit that is based on U.S. revenue would benefit from a lower corporate tax rate.PNC's Roman is overweight in industrials, financials and consumer discretionary. He likes industrials because of the prospects for aerospace and defense firms. Financials should benefit from rate hikes. And he likes the diversity of consumer discretionary. ""From homebuilders to dollar stores, there's always some opportunities,"" he said.As of Sept. 30, among his top holdings were aerospace giant Boeing (BA) and defense contractors Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD).He likes auto parts, travel and home furnishings. Auto-parts maker Delphi Automotive (DLPH) was another holding. Smaller holdings included Wyndham Worldwide (WYN).RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Income At Your Age And Income

115,MMM,"Large and megacap stocks mostly continued to hold firm amid another whirlwind day of quarterly results. Tesla (TSLA) led the downside among companies reporting as the innovative electric vehicle maker likely posted its biggest quarterly net loss on a per-share basis since it came public in June 2010.XTesla gapped down at the open and slid more than 7% to 297.85. Volume is running nearly four times the usual pace; the big cap trades on average 5.42 million shares each day.Meanwhile, all eyes are on Apple (AAPL) as it reports fiscal fourth-quarter results after the close.The stock is behaving well since clearing a new buy point in a decent cup with handle. The classic chart pattern shows a 160.87 buy point. Apple's cup with handle formed next to a flat base created from May to July. The buy point from that base was 156.75, and Apple, currently at 168.43, has lifted 7% above that correct entry. It is less than 5% from the 160.87 entry.The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 0.4%, despite a nearly 2% sell-off in Home Depot (HD). The stock is getting buying support, however, at the 50-day moving average. Home improvement chains fell on reports that President Trump and the GOP are mulling the idea of reducing the mortgage interest deduction from taxes.Eight of the 30 Dow Jones industrial average components rose 1 point or more, including industrial plays 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX) as well as consumer spending bellwethers such as McDonald's (MCD).At 3:45pm ET, the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 edged slightly up. The Russell 2000 rose nearly 0.3%.Going back to Tesla, the stock posted a critical sell signal when it fell 7% below a recent breakout past a 370.10 entry in a cup with handle of its own. That base began forming when Tesla peaked at 386.99 on June 23.While that base had a normal-sized decline of 22% from head to toe, one problem with the base was that it revealed numerous sharp declines, including gap downs, in heavy or increasing volume. That's a no-no; you'd prefer a stock to show quiet, smooth price action on a day to day and week to week basis.Those who bought at Tesla's breakout in the spring of 2013 near 50 still hold a very large profit cushion and can afford to hold patiently. The stock is 23% off its 52-week peak of 389.61, and that is not severe.However, two more reasons for newer shareholders to sell include the following:One, the stock is now on the verge of forming a deeper, longer base. It's going to take a while before Tesla will set up again. Keeping shares means that you lose the opportunity to invest in a stock that currently shows more horsepower.Two, Tesla failed to deliver on its promise to rapidly ramp up production and deliveries of its Model 3, its most affordable e-vehicle yet. Now, the company must deliberately slow down production in its highly successful Model S to meet already huge demand for the Model 3. Continued failure to manage institutional investors' expectations and beat them may result in heavier selling among fund managers.Tesla's third-quarter revenue rose 30% to $2.98 billion, which is a quarterly record. However, that gain also represents a deceleration in the top-line growth rate. Sales grew 27%, 22%, 33%, 145%, 88%, 135% and 120% vs. year-ago levels in the prior seven quarters.Elsewhere, Sony (SNE) jacked up more than 3% to 44.91 in heavy turnover, extending its breakout out of a three-month flat base with a 41.75 entry. The base also has elements of a double bottom. From that perspective, the buy point was 40.59, 10 cents above the middle peak within the shallow base.Despite the breakaway gap on Tuesday, one could try to buy as close as possible to that session's opening price of 43.21 because that price was within the proper buy range, up to 5% past the 41.75 flat-base entry.Sony, one of Japan's most famous manufacturers and innovator in the video game space, reported a huge increase in adjusted Q3 profit (90 cents a share vs. 4 cents a year ago) as revenue climbed 10% to $18.3 billion, the biggest year-over-year increase in at least four years.Sony has helped Japan's Nikkei 225 enjoy strong gains in 2017. The Japanese equities benchmark finished 0.5% to 22,539 overnight, extending its year-to-date gain to 17.9%.At 2579, the S&P 500 is up 15.2% since Jan. 1.Returning to Apple, watch to see if the company can not only post another quarter of respectable double-digit earnings growth but also give hints as to whether business can accelerate during the holiday quarter and beyond.Earnings had dropped 10% in the fiscal year ended in September 2016, on an 8% slump in revenue. However, Apple has been staging a classic turnaround in fundamentals lately.In the past three quarters, the iMac maker's earnings rose 2%, 11% and 18% vs. year-ago levels, following a three-quarter slump. And in Q4 (ended in September), earnings are seen increasing 12% to $1.87 a share, which would mark a third quarter in a row of mild double-digit gains. It's slated to report Q4 results on Nov. 2 after the market close.For fiscal year 2019, the Street sees earnings accelerating 24% to $11.16 a share.Another positive for Apple shareholders: a respectable annualized dividend yield of 1.5%, with plenty of potential for  further increases in that cash payout. Apple tends to raise its dividend in the spring. But William O'Neil + Co. calculates that the company has a long-term annual dividend growth rate of 24% in recent years.Apple, featured in Stock Market Today columns frequently as it formed a bottoming base in the last quarter of 2016, has risen more than 43% since breaking out of a first-stage cup with handle on Jan. 6-9 at 118.12.In other financial markets, traders bought U.S. government bonds, pushing yields a touch lower following news that the Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in a decade. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond is at 2.35%. President Trump, meanwhile, formally announced he's picked Jerome Powell to replace Janet Yellen as the head of the Federal Reserve.RELATED:Finding Superb Market Outperformers: Inside IBD 50Still The Golden Rule Of SellingWhat Does A Great Cup With Handle Look Like, And Why Does It Make Money For Traders?How To Invest: Use A Stock Checklist, Boost Your Portfolio ReturnHow To Find Excellent Stocks With Investors.com: Start Here

116,MMM,"Stock indexes were mixed midday Thursday, but the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average kept its leadership role vs. the major indexes.XThe Dow rose 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq advanced 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.5%.Volume in the stock market today was higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq  vs. the same time Wednesday.In each of the previous three weeks, the Dow has outperformed the major indexes. The Dow also is leading so far this week.What accounts for that?Four Dow components are largely responsible. So far this month, Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) is up 14%; 3M (MMM), 12%; Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), 10%; and Caterpillar (CAT), 10%.Also, the 30-component Dow is a price-weighted index, and three of the four stocks are in the top 10 in price. Caterpillar, 3M and Johnson & Johnson recently reported earnings and each topped the Street's consensus views on earnings and revenue.Wal-Mart will report quarterly results before the open Nov. 16. The Street expects revenue to rise 2%, but earnings to slip 1%.In the IBD 50, a list of some of the best stocks in fundamentals and technicals, advancing issues led declining issues by a 7-to-4 ratio.The top percentage gainer was Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL), which popped more than 5% in heavy volume. The trucking firm reported earnings that rose 20%, topping the Street's consensus estimate for a 13% increase. Revenue grew 12%, which beat views for a 9% gain.Going into Thursday's session, the trucking group was No. 9 in six-month price performance among 197 industry groups. The group was up 1.9% midday Thursday.Close behind in the IBD 50 was PRA Health Sciences (PRAH), which rose 4% in heavy volume. The stock cleared an 81.09 buy point earlier this month, but volume was unimpressive and the stock made little progress. Today's action looks more confident.PRA reported quarterly results, topping views on the top and bottom lines. Earnings rose 38% and revenue 28%. Its after-tax margin was 9.9%, the best in at least 19 quarters.On the downside midday Thursday, China-based TAL Education (TAL) staggered 10% lower on quarterly results that missed views. The stock plunged below its 50-day moving average in heavy volume.RELATED:Another Top Chinese School Operator Misses Earnings Views; Stock DivesGasoline Tax Or ""User Fee"" Could Be In For A HikeThis Aerospace Stock Dives On Quarterly Results

117,MMM,"The stock market erased some of its small gains, and the Nasdaq composite was barely higher in afternoon trading Wednesday.XThe Nasdaq, up only 0.2% earlier, was up a fraction. Facebook (FB), a major Nasdaq component, was one to watch because it is trying to climb back above the 50-day moving average. It could be a key threshold for the social media stock as it tries to complete a base.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average held on to 0.1% increases. Dow component 3M (MMM) climbed past the 214.67 buy point of a flat base.The Russell 2000 was off 0.3% and at risk of ending an eight-day win streak. As The Big Picture noted, the small-cap index has been rallying sharply for weeks and seems due for a rest.Volume was tracking lower compared with the same time Tuesday. Advancers and decliners were about evenly split on the NYSE and Nasdaq. Automakers, utilities and homebuilders, one of the hottest industry groups, were leading today's market.Corning (GLW) broke out of a cup with handle. But volume was running at only about half its usual pace and the price increase also lacked power. The specialist in fiber optics, ceramics and other high-tech materials has turned itself around, posting EPS gains of 24%, 47%, 39% and 14% after several quarters of declining earnings.Boston Beer (SAM) cleared the 163.75 buy point of a cup with handle as volume climbed 30% more than average. Last month, Credit Suisse upgraded the maker of Samuel Adams beer to neutral from underperform and noted that Boston Beer could be acquired by private equity firms or Molson Coors (TAP).In the same industry, Constellation Brands (STZ) climbed 1% in some of the heaviest volume above average. The stock is finding support in a pullback to the 50-day moving average.Among stocks down in unusual volume, the two leading RV stocks slid as they cool off from rapid gains. Thor Industries (THO) fell nearly 2%, on track to end a seven-day win streak, and Winnebago Industries (WGO) gapped down to a loss of more than 6%. Stifel Nicolaus downgraded Winnebago to a hold rating, citing concerns that the stock has gotten overheated, reports said.Both stocks remain well-extended from their breakouts several weeks ago, but the abrupt break in their price uptrends warrants attention.RELATED:Thor Beats Fiscal Q4 Forecasts, Sees More Production Capacity GrowthTop RV Maker In Buy Range, But Will Hurricanes Help Sales?FANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google

118,MMM,"Bulls tilted toward the blue chips early Tuesday, as seven stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.8% or more.The Nasdaq, which has shown signs of institutional selling lately, was nearly flat. The S&P 500 added 0.1%, while the small cap Russell 2000 rose 0.4%. The Dow gained 0.7%.Volume was up on the NYSE and down on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Monday.In the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average, big hitters ruled. Caterpillar (CAT) and 3M (MMM) each rumbled 5% higher. Goldman Sachs (GS), McDonald's (MCD), and United Technologies (UTX) added 1%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Boeing (BA) rose 0.8% each.Of the seven stocks, the only stocks that could be poised to break out are Goldman Sachs and United Technologies.According to William O'Neil + Co. data, Caterpillar beat the Street's earnings estimate by 53%. The 3M Company topped the consensus estimate by 5%. McDonald's was just under an in-line performance, but same-store sales in the U.S. increased 4%. United Technologies delivered earnings 3% above the Street's target.Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan reported last week, beating views by 20% and 7% respectively.Top sectors showed steady gains early.

119,MMM,"The Dow industrials snapped higher Tuesday, rising 0.7% to lead a rebound from the week's slouchy opening and moving the index to another new high. The index is already nearly halfway to the 24,000 mark from the 23,000 level it cleared Oct. 17.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also gained ground, up 0.2% apiece. But neither succeeded in taking back Monday's losses, leaving them lower so far this week. Steel/alloy, home furnishings and chips scored many of Tuesday's best gains. Appliances, commercial loans and telecom services were at the bottom of the list.Blue chips and earnings reports generated the bulk of the day's news, but FANG stocks also held up their end of the bargain.Neflix (NFLX) stepped up more than 2%, just after pricing a $1.6 billion offering of high-yield bonds to help fuel its ambitious capital expenditures planned for 2018. The stock was still in a buy range above a 190.05 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT) easily outpaced peers among the Dow industrials. Both companies reported better-than-forecast third-quarter results. Megacap 3M surged 7%, leaving it 10% above a 214.67 buy point from a cup base.Caterpillar shares spiked 5% in heavy trade to a new high. The stock is also extended, up 32% from a July rebound from 10-week support.Off the Dow, Polaris (PII) delivered the day's surprise earnings news, soaring 16% after a big third-quarter beat. It reported earnings growth that accelerated from the single digits to 192% for the quarter, with sales growth accelerating for a third straight quarter. The big gap-up move sent shares up the right side of a complex, 25-month consolidation.Shares of Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) surged 6% and entered a buy zone, rebounding from a test of support at the 10-week line, despite lower-than-expected numbers on both the earnings and revenue lines for its third quarter.Names losing the most ground Tuesday included Whirlpool (WHR), down 11%; Commvault Systems (CVLT), down 9%; and Paccar (PCAR), with a 6% loss.RELATED:Earnings Fuel Dow To Record High; 2 FANG Plays In Buy ZoneLockheed: F-35 Growing By 'Leaps and Bounds' But Sales To Slow In 2018Boeing, Grubhub, Nike, Glaxo Amgen Lead Investing Action Plan

121,MMM,"Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials were little changed early Wednesday morning. Apple (AAPL) now has a new, lower buy point. Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a rival to Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC), tumbled late Tuesday despite beating Q3 estimates after closing just shy of a buy point.XAMD's tumble underscores two important lessons. First, always wait for a stock to clear a proper buy point. Second, you generally should look to buy the leaders in a particular field, such as Nvidia, rather than an also-ran.S&P 500 index fell slightly vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.1%. Dow futures rose 0.1%.On Tuesday, the Dow industrials powered ahead on strong earnings from 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT). The S&P 500 and Nasdaq advanced 0.2%.Apple, another Dow component, rose 0.6% to 157.10 in Tuesday's stock market trading. But the iPhone giant's stock now has etched a proper handle in its shallow cup base, reaching the minimum five days. That gives Apple a new buy point of 160.97 vs. its prior potential entry of 165.04.A few caveats. Apple gapped down in volume in its handle, which is not ideal, undercutting its 50-day moving average. Apple has a lowest-possible E Accumulation/Distribution Rating: The stock sold off in volume in the left side of its base, which is not that surprising, but volume on the upside has been weak.Also, while the market is in a confirmed uptrend, there has been a recent spate of distribution days, so investors should keep that in mind.IBD'S TAKE: Apple reports earnings on Nov. 2. Buying or holding a stock heading into earnings can be risky. Investors doing so may want to consider an earnings options strategy that offers a chance to cash in on the upside while minimizing potential losses.AMD earned 10 cents a share excluding various items, up 133% vs. a year earlier. Revenue climbed 25% to $1.64 billion, its third straight quarter of accelerating growth. Analysts had expected EPS of 8 cents on sales of $1.51 billion. AMD sees Q4 revenue of $1.34 billion to $1.44 billion vs. views for $1.322 billion. But that's also a 15% sequential decline. AMD also said it sees a ""leveling off"" in cryptocurrency demand for its chips.AMD shares, which briefly rose to around 13.70 in late trading, soon crashed. The stock is down about 10% to 12.84 in premarket trading, suggesting moves below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. AMD had closed up 1.1% to 14.25 in Tuesday's stock market trading, ending just below a 14.51 cup-with-handle entry.An overeager investor might have been tempted to cheat, heading into earnings. The justification is that you get a lower price and stroke your ego about how you were smarter or braver than other investors. But saving a few cents, or even a few percentage points, isn't worth the risk.The buy point is a key technical level, maximizing your odds of significant near-term gains while limiting the risk of losses and offering signals for cutting losses short. When a stock clears a bullish entry point in heavy volume, almost every current shareholder should be happy. Mutual funds and other institutional buys must bid up the price to acquire shares. If a breakout falters, and drops below the buy point, that's a clear sign that something is wrong.Barring a big turnaround in Wednesday's session, AMD is not going to trigger that 14.51 buy point. Patient investors avoid a big loss by never taking a position.For investors who felt compelled to buy a stock early, they may want to try options to hedge their risks. IBD's Earnings Preview column covers this options strategy with specific examples.AMD actually made a similar point after its Q2 report on July 25. The next day, shares popped as high as 15.65, exactly hitting a buy point. But AMD closed in the bottom half of its range and then sold off over the next several weeks. Except for that momentary trade at 15.65, AMD didn't offer a buying opportunity.You get what you pay for.AMD has long been a distant No. 2 to Intel in PC chips, and competes against the larger rival in server chips as well. AMD also takes on Nvidia in graphics chips, with both taking advantage of such chips being used for artificial intelligence and Bitcoin mining.But while AMD has had some recent success in terms of financials and stock performance, it's still a big laggard next to Nvidia, which delivered 56% sales growth in its latest quarter, on top of tough comparisons.AMD historically has struggled to maintain profitability, even on an adjusted basis, with sales often slumping as well.Nvidia shares fell 0.4% early Wednesday after closing about 1% higher Tuesday to 198.68. Nvidia is extended from a 174.66 buy point cleared last month.Intel dipped 0.3% in the premarket. Shares climbed 0.3% Tuesday to 40.95, hitting their highest level in nearly 17 years. Intel, which reports Q3 results on Thursday, is extended from a 38.55 buy point.RELATED:The Big Picture: Meet The Stock Market's Surprising New LeaderWhen Analyzing Stocks In An Industry Group, Focus On The RS Rating LeaderBullish Chart Patterns: Do You Know The Basics Of A Cup With Handle?Bullish Chart Patterns II: How To Find The Exact Buy PointChip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each added 0.2%.On the Dow, Caterpillar thundered ahead 6% after its third-quarter earnings and revenue trounced analyst estimates, and management hoisted its full-year guidance to well above consensus views. Caterpillar shares are extended, up 30% since a July rebound from 10-week support.Dow peer 3M climbed 3.7% as third-quarter results and full-year guidance easily outpaced analyst forecasts. The gain lifted shares beyond a buy range above a flat-base buy point at 214.67.United Technologies opened up 0.9% after reporting third-quarter revenue and earnings above analyst expectations, and lifting its full-year profit guidance above the consensus target. The stock had cleared a 120.05 buy point in a cup-with-handle base Friday.General Motors (GM) perked up 2% on its third-quarter results. Earnings and revenue easily topped analyst projections, but free cash flow came in below expectations. The stock is extended, 27% above a handle buy point of 36.73.Snow machine and off-road vehicle maker Polaris (PII) spun up a 9% opening gain. The Medina, Minn. company reported a strong third-quarter beat and raised its full-year revenue and earnings guidance above targets.Whirlpool (WHR) collapsed 9% as RBC Capital downgraded the stock to sector perform, from its top pick list, after third-quarter earnings and revenue fell short of expectations late Monday.

The sale's proceeds are expected to fund restructuring initiatives at GE.Both companies declined to confirm the report.GE's industrial-solutions business makes products such as uninterrupted power supply systems for backup power and voltage regulators. It is one of the smaller GE divisions and the move to jettison it is part of a broader reorganization of GE Energy Connections & Lighting, the company's least-profitable unit last year with margins of 2.1%, Bloomberg said. GE's iconic lighting unit is also up for grabs.Meanwhile, Swiss engineering firm ABB is one of the largest in the world and is trying to strengthen its portfolio, after recent restructuring.Shares of GE were up 0.5% at 24.87 on the stock market today, but hit resistance at their 50-day average, a key marker of institutional support, and carry an IBD RS Rating of just 12. ABB rose 0.45% to 24.74, continuing to form a flat base with a 25.93 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: Market-leading stocks usually boast an RS Rating of 80 or higher. This IBD screen helps you identify top growth stocks with superior price performance relative to the S&P 500.With profits under pressure, Flannery is said to be considering a raft of measures to improve results and to revive GE's sagging stock price. He is reportedly planning layoffs at GE's corporate office and just dumped a decades-old executive perk to save money.A spokesperson said Wednesday that the conglomerate is on track to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by the end of next year.Over the past several years, GE has shed its finance as well as certain consumer and media units to focus on core industrial businesses. But investors were restless with the pace of changes and GE's sliding stock price, leading to the recent exit of Jeff Immelt as CEO. Flannery took over as chief on Aug. 1 and takes over as chairman on Jan. 1.RELATED:Dow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And Analysis

125,MMM,"General Electric (GE) has grounded its corporate jet fleet and plans to eventually sell them, as new CEO John Flannery delivers on his promised ""intense focus"" on operations and review of the conglomerate's vast portfolio of businesses.XThe GE chief executive's cost-cutting effort, reported by The Wall Street Journal Wednesday, comes as investors fret about cash flow and margins at the industrial giant. The measure took effect Wednesday and fleshes out other initiatives to trim the fat, such as reducing staff and delaying construction of its new headquarters in Boston.GE owns several business jets, including at least two Bombardier Challenger aircraft, which are heavily used by company executives to travel to business meetings around the globe, the Journal added. Executives will instead fly on charter and commercial flights.While GE will unwind its internal airline for corporate executives, it will still operate some helicopters and other aircraft, the Journal said.""As we have said, we are executing on a plan to take out $2 billion in cost by the end of 2018,"" a GE spokeswoman said. ""As part of that effort, starting today, we are reducing the Corporate Air Transport services and will use charter companies as needed.""GE spent $258,000 on personal jet travel for former CEO Jeff Immelt in 2016, taking into account just ""incremental"" costs such as fuel and crew expenses. It spent another $75,000 on personal travel for other top executives, the company revealed.Shares of GE rose 1.8% to 24.75 on the stock market today, trying to rebound from long-time lows set earlier this month. GE earns an IBD RS Rating of 10, meaning it has underperformed 90% of stocks over the past 12 months.IBD'S TAKE: Market-leading stocks usually boast an RS Rating of 80 or higher. This IBD screen helps you identify top growth stocks with superior price performance relative to the S&P 500.GE has, so far this year, seriously underperformed the Dow Jones industrial average of which it is part.  The Dow component has sunk 23% year to date vs. a 4% gain for United Technologies (UTX) and an 18% advance for 3M (MMM) — which also belong in the blue-chip index.With profits under pressure, Flannery is expected to present his strategy to improve results and to revive GE's sagging stock price in November.Some analysts have suggested the company could sell assets in transportation as well as in energy and lighting, while others consider the health care unit, formerly run by Flannery, vulnerable.RELATED:Will General Electric Sell More Assets To Maintain Its Dividend?This 'Outlier' GE Unit May Ironically Be Ripe For Sale Under New CEODow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And Analysis

But the spotlight economic news is scheduled for 2 p.m. ET, when the Federal Reserve announces any policy changes from its two-day meeting. A press conference with Fed Chair Janet Yellen follows at 2:30 p.m. ET.After months of well-telegraphed intentions, the Fed is today expected to announce a gradual shift from the neutral stance of holding bonds to being a seller as it begins to trim $4.5 trillion in debt from its balance sheet. The move points to declining bond prices and rising yields which, in turn, should drive up interest rates across the economy.The expectations have been a positive for banks and other credit and financial institutions, the leading beneficiaries of rising interest rates.

127,MMM,"General Electric (GE) announced several executive changes late Friday, another in a raft of measures that it's taking to cut costs, restructure the portfolio and streamline operations.XJamie Miller, CEO of GE Transportation, takes over as chief financial officer Nov. 1, replacing Jeffrey Bornstein, who is also a vice chair at the industrials giant.Bornstein leaves GE Dec. 31 after 28 years of service. Two other vice chairs and longtime GE veterans, John Rice and Beth Comstock, depart at the same time.Under new CEO John Flannery, GE is showing it's serious about trimming $2 billion in costs by the end of 2018. Late Thursday, news emerged that is whisking away corporate cars on the heels of grounding its corporate jet fleet — perks that senior executives have enjoyed for decades.Top bosses at GE were informed via email that their leases on company cars will only be good through the end of 2018, CNBC reported Thursday evening. The move affects roughly 700 execs, and a GE spokeswoman confirmed the report.In September, the Dow component eliminated the use of GE-owned business jets for company executives to get to meetings around the globe. They will take charter and commercial flights instead.GE plans to eventually sell those aircraft, revealing last month that it had spent $258,000 on personal jet travel for former CEO Jeff Immelt in 2016, and another $75,000 on travel for other top executives.Shares of GE dipped 0.6% to 24.39 on the stock market today and are down 24% year to date. GE earns an IBD RS Rating of 11, meaning it has underperformed 89% of stocks over the past 12 months. Among other diversified industrial giants, Honeywell (HON) and Roper Technologies (ROP) inched up 0.4% Friday, and United Technologies (UTX), Siemens (SIEGY) and 3M (MMM) also clawed out fractional gains.IBD'S TAKE: Market-leading stocks usually boast an RS Rating of 80 or higher. This IBD screen helps you identify top growth stocks with superior price performance relative to the S&P 500.Flannery has promised an ""intense focus"" on operations and a review of the industrial conglomerate's vast portfolio of businesses, as investors worry about cash flow and margins.

"
128,MMM,"General Electric (GE) may have to sell more assets to maintain its current dividend as it battles weak cash flow, and GE investors should brace for more pain after a tough year so far, according to a JPMorgan Chase analyst.XThe industrial conglomerate's fundamentals are ""worse than we think,"" JPMorgan's Stephen Tusa wrote in a note to clients Thursday. Against that backdrop, he believes GE's prized dividends are safe ""for now"" — but likely not without some tough decisions.""GE is already below break-even when it comes to funding the dividend with ongoing free cash flow, with compounding risk if fundamentals come in worse than expectations,"" Tusa wrote. ""Our sense is that GE will sell assets to plug the near-term hole.""But a Morningstar analyst noted in July that Industrial free cash flow turned positive in GE's second quarter at over $700 million, rebounding from the first quarter's negative $2.2 billion.GE could raise $13 billion to $14 billion by selling assets in transportation as well as energy/lighting and renewables, and ""some smaller businesses within larger segments that most people have never heard of"" also could be dumped, Tusa said.He made note of difficult transportation trends into 2018, including weak locomotive demand in the freight markets, and of low cash margins in energy and renewables.But if GE's businesses suffer further in a tougher macro climate, the dividend would be highly vulnerable, ""meaning GE is not a safety stock,"" Tusa — described by Bloomberg as a consistent GE bear — wrote.GE didn't respond to a request for comment.GE's high dividend payouts — the stock currently has a 3.96% yield — have made it attractive to income investors. Many believe the dividend is safe, with the 125-year-old company merely suffering a short-term setback rather than more permanent distress.But others have recently questioned the safety and sustainability of GE's dividends. A Deutsche Bank analyst warned in May that GE's weak cash flow could mean a cut in dividends, prompting a forceful GE rebuttal.IBD'S TAKE: General Electric shares hit a post-financial crisis high in July 2016, but GE has been underperforming the S&P 500 index for the past five years, or even as far back as 2000. Here is how the Relative Strength Line can help you pick the best stocks to invest in.In his note, Tusa maintained an underweight rating on GE stock and a year-end price target of 22.GE shares crumbled 3.6% Thursday after the JPMorgan Chase report and extended losses Friday and Monday morning. GE pegged a fresh two-year intraday low of 23.58 Friday.GE stock is down about 25% year to date, by far the worst performer on the Dow Jones industrial average. The Dow itself is up more than 10% so far in 2017.GE's tumbling share price has flattered its dividend yield, but that's small comfort to investors who have held the stock on the way down.New CEO John Flannery is expected to present his vision for the future in November as well as a potential reset of GE's earnings-per-share targets. One analyst recently suggested that Flannery may shed the health care unit as he puts the company's vast-but-streamlined portfolio under review.Under former CEO Jeff Immelt, GE cut loose its financial and certain consumer units and returned to its industrial core, which include the power, aviation, energy and transportation segments. But those measures failed to revive investor confidence in the company's overall strategy, leading to Immelt's exit this year.Meanwhile, industrial peer 3M (MMM) rose 0.6%, finding resistance at its 50-day moving average within a flat-base consolidation. Honeywell (HON) added 0.4%, Siemens (SIEGY) slipped 0.9% and United Technologies (UTX) shed 0.4%.3M and United Technologies, which this week agreed to buy Rockwell Collins (COL) for $30 billion including debt, are Dow components like GE.RELATED:This 'Outlier' GE Unit May Ironically Be Ripe For Sale Under New CEODow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisBest Stocks To Buy And Watch

129,MMM,"Selling was concentrated in the Nasdaq composite in afternoon trading Wednesday as the Fed stuck to its forecast of four rate hikes through 2018, including one before the end of the year.The Fed left its key lending rate unchanged at 1%-1.25%, which was widely expected, but said it would start unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet in October. After eight straight gains, the 10-year Treasury yield added another 3 basis points to 2.27%.XThe Nasdaq lost 0.4%; the S&P 500 gave up 0.1% and the Dow was nearly flat. Small caps held up well, with the Russell 2000 up 0.2%. Volume on both main exchanges picked up in the market after the Fed's policy statement at 2 p.m. ET. NYSE and Nasdaq volume was tracking about 10% higher than Tuesday's levels. JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) outperformed in the Dow with gains of around 1%. 3M (MMM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Apple (AAPL) lagged with losses of around 2%.Apple slumped below the 50-day moving average, falling 2%, after the company acknowledged cellular connectivity issues with the new Apple Watch. It's back below a 156.75 entry after clearing the buy point in early August on strong earnings.In the stock market today, IPO Best (BSTI), backed by Alibaba (BABA), jumped 6% to 10.60 after pricing last night at 10. The downsized offering was initially supposed to price between 13-15. Best is a China-based delivery firm.Another IPO fared better. Argentina-based Despegar.com (DESP), an online travel company, priced last night at 26, at the high end of a proposed range of 23-26.

130,MMM,"Major indexes traded mixed in late afternoon trading Thursday, but remained in good shape overall.XMeanwhile, Square (SQ) showed a solid breakout from a second-stage base with a 28.07 entry. The electronic payments facilitator rose more than 4% to 28.77 and is still in buy range.As noted in IBD's premium stock-picking service, Leaderboard, the stock is in buy range. Don't buy shares more than 5% past the proper entry, or in this case 29.47.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite was off nearly 0.5% but remains up for the week with a 1.1% weekly gain. Plus, the Nasdaq's intraday range is narrow, suggesting that large players in the market — from mutual funds and hedge funds to banks, insurers and pension managers — are reluctant to sell with vigor.The S&P 500 was off just 0.1% and is within arm's length of its recent new all-time high of 2498. The S&P SmallCap 600 was down nearly 0.2%.Only a handful of IBD's 197 industry groups are up 1% or more; they include the solar, automaker, water utility, hospital, leisure product and semiconductor equipment names. Applied Materials (AMAT) is leading the chip gear names with a 2% gain to 47.19 in slightly above-average turnover.Watch for a potential breakout by the tech giant past a 47.96 base entry. Aggressive traders could act if the stock breaches the 47.59 near-term high.There doesn't seem to be too much hoopla about the possibility of the S&P 500 breaking the 2500 barrier. In fact, as seen in IBD's Psychological Market Indicators section, bullishness among stock newsletter editors tracked by Investors Intelligence has actually fallen to 47.1%, the lowest since the aftermath of the Nov. 8 U.S. elections.Meanwhile, the put-call volume ratio recently notched a high of 1.18 on Aug. 17, meaning that among options traders, pessimism is still rampant. And that's good for equities. Why? Pessimistic investors have generally sold stocks and raised cash, thinking that equities are due to fall. But if they don't, these pessimists could potentially become new buyers of stocks.The Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 0.2% as four of the 30 components, including United Technologies (UTX), 3M (MMM) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), rose 1 point or more.United Tech is trying to reclaim its key long-term support level, the 200-day moving average, which is near 116. Meanwhile, the 50-day moving average is now trending lower. The manufacturer of aircraft engines, elevators and security systems triggered a sell signal for short-term investors when shares pierced the 50-day moving average near 122 during a high-volume sell-off on July 25.On that day, United Tech reported a 2% jump in Q2 profit to $1.85 a share. Earnings growth has been stuck in the low- to mid-single digits for four straight quarters, unlike the bigger EPS increases seen among members of IBD Big Cap 20, IBD's screen for premier growth companies with a market value of $15 billion or more.Like Apple (AAPL) in earlier years, when Steve Jobs reassumed the CEO post, then spurred a series of game-changing consumer electronic devices and digital services, San Francisco-based Square has made a big hit with its easy-to-use hardware and software for small shops and individual sole proprietors (think plumbers, taxi drivers and the like) to enable fast, secure transactions at the point of sale.IBD's TAKE: Notice how, on a daily chart, Square is showing two bullish traits. First, the stock found buyers near the 50-day moving average (painted in red on an IBD daily chart), a common occurrence among stocks that get strong institutional support. Second, the relative strength line, drawn in blue in both IBD charts and in IBD's professional-grade stock screening and charting service MarketSmith, has rocketed into new high ground. This means that Square is sharply outperforming the S&P 500.Square lost money from 2012 to 2015, but last year it notched earnings of 4 cents a share. Wall Street now expects profit to catapult 500% higher this year to 24 cents a share and another 79% to 43 cents in 2018.Revenue jumped 35% to $1.71 billion in 2016, up from $203 million in 2012. The Street sees the top line sliding 45% to $942 million this year, but then rebounding 25% to $1.17 billion in 2018.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Square gets a commanding 98 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, which means that the stock's fundamental, technical and fund sponsorship attributes place it in the top 2% of all companies in IBD's database.As noted in IBD Leaderboard, the current new base is second stage.Apple shares, meanwhile, continue to hold on to a thin gain following an Aug. 2 breakout from a second-stage flat base at 156.75. The stock was featured heavily in IBD's Stock Market Today column back in early January when the iPhone giant broke out of a first-stage bottoming base at 118.12. Shares have since climbed more than 39%.Apple is expected to post a third quarter in a row of double-digit EPS growth, up 13% to $1.88 a share in the September-ending fiscal fourth quarter.Apple's earnings rose 2% in the fiscal first quarter ended in December 2016, snapping a three-quarter streak of falling profits, then grew 11% and 18% in the next two quarters.In FY 2018, earnings are accelerating 21% to $10.91 a share, up from an 8% jump in the current fiscal year.Elsewhere, Oracle (ORCL) is hanging tight ahead of its fiscal first-quarter results due after the close. The stock, nearly flat at 52.74, holds a 12% cushion of gains after it gapped up powerfully on June 22 on improved Q4 results. That move sent shares past a 47.09 entry in a solid flat-base pattern.The database and cloud-based enterprise software giant is mimicking Apple's latest trend of slowly reaccelerating its growth. In the November-ended fiscal second quarter, Oracle's earnings slumped 3%, but then rebounded 8% and 10% in the past two quarters. Analysts see Q1 profit rising 9% to 60 cents a share on a 5% increase in revenue to $9.03 billion.In fiscal Q4, Oracle's net margin improved by 220 basis points to 34.5%.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil futures surged nearly 2% and reached as high as $50.50 a barrel intraday, while natural gas futures eclipsed the $3/million BTU level and hit its highest levels since May of last year. Futures got as high as $3.10.The sell-off in U.S. government bonds remained in place; the yield on the benchmark Treasury 10-year bond returned to the 2.20% level.The spread between the 3-month note (1.05% yield) and the 10-year bond remains healthy at 115 basis points.RELATED:When To Sell A Stock: Take Many Gains When The Profit Reaches This LevelHow To Invest: How To See If It's The Right Time To Buy StocksInvesting For Kids: How To Make A Million Dollars

131,MMM,"As General Electric (GE) steps up efforts to cut costs and boost profits, the industrials giant may sell a stake in the industrial software unit that served as a linchpin of ex-CEO Jeff Immelt's ""digital industrial"" vision but proved a drag on GE stock.XNew chief executive John Flannery is contemplating expanded partnerships and the possible sale of some equity in the unit, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the business.Immelt — who bowed out of the Uber leadership race in a Sunday tweet — reportedly spent six years and poured more than $4 billion into efforts to infuse GE's core industrial businesses with technology. But revenue and returns fell short of expectations, and the Predix industrial software platform was dogged by problems this spring, according to Reuters.I have decided not to pursue a leadership position at Uber. I have immense respect for the company & founders — Travis, Garrett and Ryan.— Jeff Immelt (@JeffImmelt) August 27, 2017But those problems have now been fixed, the report added, and GE will focus on sales to existing customers in its energy, aviation and oil-and-gas businesses, while paring back sales efforts to new customers in other sectors.IBD'S TAKE: GE is a laggard among Dow stocks this year. But the Dow's top stock may be offering a new entry point.""Our resources will go to our fastest-selling markets,"" GE Digital Chief Executive Officer Bill Ruh told Reuters in an interview.Additionally, to help investors better understand Predix and avoid double-counting, GE has redefined digital revenue to shut out certain hardware sales and emphasize ""pure"" software sales.As a result, GE officials now anticipate $12 billion in digital revenue in 2020 vs. $15 billion earlier.The Predix platform — a cloud-based operating system for what GE calls the industrial internet — outfits turbines, jet engines wind farms and medical equipment with data-collecting sensors and then analyzes that data to analyze performance, cut costs or create new businesses for GE customers.GE estimates the market could be worth $225 billion market by 2020.Shares were unchanged at 24.49 in morning trade on the stock market today. GE bounced off a fresh 23-month low set last week.The stock is down 22.5% year to date vs. a 10.5% gain for the Dow Jones industrial average as a whole.Conglomerate peers 3M (MMM), Siemens (SIEGY), Honeywell (HON), United Technologies (UTX) and Roper Technologies (ROP) were little changed.RELATED:How GE Could Become The Apple Of The Industrial InternetThis 'Celebrity CEO' May Be Able To Change Uber, But It's Not Tesla's MuskDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And Analysis

133,MMM,"Key U.S. index funds were narrowly mixed in the stock market today as gold rose but retail and oil lagged.XSPDR S&P 500 (SPY) and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) were fractionally higher, while PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) dipped 0.2%.Gold plays led the upside as gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,296.80 an ounce. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) and VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) advanced more than 1% each, while SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) added 0.4% a piece.Real estate, heath care and homebuilders turned positive.But Oil ETFs slipped: United States Oil Fund (USO) and PowerShares DB Oil Fund (DBO) were down more than 2% each. SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) fell 1.6% and VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) gave up 1.1%.Telecom, chips, banks and retail underperformed.KraneShares CSI China Internet (KWEB) jumped 2% and is extended from a 51.43 flat-base buy point cleared in mid-July. One of its top holdings, 58.com (WUBA), surged 20% after its quarterly results. Baidu (BIDU), another top holding, was up more than 1% amid reports it's exiting the food delivery market.New opportunities to buy big names like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) could crop up as the stock market pulls back from record highs.SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) is looking for support at its 50-day moving average for the first time since early June, when it cleared a 211.69 flat-base buy point. If it can make a solid rebound off the support line, that sets up a potential entry.Keep in mind, however, that all purchases are exposed to greater risk when the market uptrend is under pressure.DIA advanced nearly 5% from the breakout to its Aug. 8 intraday peak, and 6% following a February breakout from a previous flat base. It was featured in the June 2 ETF column as it neared the 211.69 entry ahead of the breakout.The $18 billion behemoth that the ETF tracks is price weighted, which means the holdings are weighted by share price. As a result, its biggest weightings as of Aug. 16 were Boeing (BA), Goldman Sachs (GS) and 3M (MMM), in that order. Apple was the fifth-largest holding.DIA has outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date, 11.7% to 10%, through Aug. 17, according to Morningstar Inc. It outpaced the benchmark index over the past three years, and has performed roughly in line with the S&P 500 over the longer haul.The fund is 19 years old. Its expense ratio is 0.17%.IShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM), launched in April 2013, is also seeking support at its 50-day line. The last time it touched the 50-day line was in December. It then went on to clear a flat-base entry early this year.

134,MMM,"President Trump said Wednesday he's disbanding two advisory groups of American business leaders, after CEOs quit this week as the president faced blowback for failing to sufficiently condemn white supremacists.Trump made the announcement on Twitter, less than an hour after one of the groups was said to be planning to inform the White House that it would disband.Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 16, 2017Trump's remarks were a reversal of what he said a day before, when he tweeted that he had plenty of CEOs who wanted to be on the panels to replace those who quit, and called the CEOs who left ""grandstanders.""Several more CEOs on the councils said after Trump's remarks that they had informed their respective panels that they would step down, suggesting that Trump scrapped the panels before they dissolved entirely.The strategy council, led by Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, said that participation had become an unwelcome ""distraction.""BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told staff in a Wednesday memo that he had informed the strategy council he was stepping down within the past 24 hours.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, who earlier this year hailed Trump for reigniting ""animal spirits,"" said Wednesday afternoon that ""it is a leader's role...to bring people together, not tear them apart.""The strategy group is one of several the White House convened earlier this year to advise the president. Several CEOs from a manufacturing council quit this week, following blowback over Trump's remarks about racially charged violence in Virginia on Saturday.Pressure to leave the groups has grown following a press conference Trump held in New York Tuesday where he placed partial blame for the weekend violence on demonstrators protesting a gathering of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va. A woman was killed during the event after a man rammed a car into a crowd.While more than half a dozen CEOs have quit a manufacturing CEO group, others have said they wanted to stay on the panels in order to influence White House policy.The manufacturing council hasn't met since February. The CEOs of Under Armour (UAA), Intel (INTC) and Merck (MRK) quit earlier this week. And on Wednesday Inge Thulin, CEO of 3M (MMM), left, as did Campbell Soup (CPB) CEO Denise Morrison.""Following yesterday's remarks from the president, I cannot remain on the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative,"" Morrison said in a statement. ""I will continue to support all efforts to spur economic growth and advocate for the values that have always made America great.""Jeff Immelt of General Electric (GE), Alex Gorsky of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Gregory Hayes of United Technologies (UTX) stepped down from the manufacturing council minutes after Trump said he was scrapping that body. Immelt said he had informed the council Wednesday morning of his decision.RELATED:Big Business Dumps Trump: 4 Execs Quit Council; But This One Is Staying

135,MMM,"Computer-related stocks, including MacBook maker Apple (AAPL), helped lead the stock market higher Monday with a 1.5% rally to 159.85 in light trade. Growth stocks continued to reflect healthy institutional demand, even if the volume in many issues ran lighter than normal for the day.XThe Nasdaq composite led, rising 1.3% for the day and getting as high as 6340, less than 2% below its recent all-time peak of 6460. The Nasdaq 100 was also up 1.2%.The S&P 500 wasn't that far behind despite lagging the Nasdaq all year long. The large-cap benchmark rose 1%.Eight of the 30 components within the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1 point or more, helping the popular index rise 0.6%. They included Goldman Sachs (GS) (up 1.4% to 227.36), which is still in the middle of forming a potential new saucer base; Visa (V) (up 1.8% to 101.87), extended 5.3% past a 96.70 entry in a shallow flat base; and 3M (MMM) (up 0.7% to 207.37), which has muscled 19% past a 180.16 saucer-with-handle entry and is now possibly working on a new base.Volume finished sharply lower than at the same time Friday on both main exchanges.Other top industry groups for the day include data storage, specialty enterprise software, fiber-optic telecom equipment, logistics transport, Midwest banks, Southeast banks, fabless semiconductors, trucking and medical software. All of these groups ran up more than 2% each.The S&P SmallCap 600 and the Russell 2000 both beat the major indexes, rising almost 1.5%, while the Dow Jones transports hustled 1.6% higher as crude oil futures slid more than 2.6%. WTI futures hit a session low of $47.51 a barrel. Brent crude fell 2.6% to $50.73.Apple's move past a 156.75 flat-base entry has not produced big gains yet. But the stock is keeping its bullish post-earnings gap (established Aug. 2 following its fiscal Q3 report). The best market winners often gap up in price on a breakout from a conventional base, then keep rising and hitting new highs.Two more reasons why Apple is showing good prospects of further gains:One, the RS line has moved into new high ground, signifying outperformance vs. the S&P 500.Two, the stock is holding nicely above the short-term 10-day moving average. Apple tested support on this line, painted in green on the daily charts at IBD Leaderboard, last week.Apple has now rallied more than 37% from a Jan. 6-9 breakout past a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12.Elsewhere in the stock market today, IBD Sector Leader YY (YY) got close to posting a new all-time high as shares rallied as much as 4.6% to an intraday high of 82.54. Turnover jumped more than 30% above its 50-day average.Late last week, the Guangzhou-based Chinese social network posted terrific quarterly results (EPS up 53% to $1.53 a share, revenue up 29% to $384.8 million). YY noted ""exceptional popularity"" in its April launch of ""Happy Werewolf Kill,"" a small-room online social game. Meanwhile, the company's total mobile live streaming monthly active users grew 27.1% year over year to 66.1 million. Total live streaming paying users catapulted 46% to 5.7 million.Full-year results also look to be bright. The Street sees earnings rising 40% to $5.85 a share in 2017 on a 24% jump in revenue to $1.52 billion.In FY 2018, earnings are seen growing 16% to $6.77 a share and revenue up 18% to $1.79 billion.YY is too far above a proper buy point of 61.62. The buy zone extends up to 64.70, 5% past the entry.On Monday, YY said it plans to sell 5.5 million American Depositary Shares (ADS's). One ADS equals 20 Class A common shares.Another Sector Leader, Arista Networks (ANET), is also keeping its recent bullish gap in place. Shares rose as much as 3% to 170.69 and are still in buy range from a 163.07 entry in a six-week flat base.Arista on Aug. 3 reported fiscal Q2 results, and few other public companies in the U.S. can match the firm's growth of 81% in earnings or 51% in sales. Plus, the specialist in cloud network hardware showed an amazing 600 basis-point lift in after-tax margin to 26%, a quarterly record.Arista has a relatively thin supply of shares with 73 million outstanding and a float of 45 million. These are far smaller figures than its arch rival Cisco Systems (CSCO) (5 billion shares out, 4.95 billion float.)A 99 EPS Rating puts Arista at the top of its 15-member Computer-Networking industry group, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.RELATED:Inside IBD 50: Why Last Week's Sell-Off Proves It's Still A Stockpickers' MarketWhich Companies Remain On IBD's Sector Leaders Screen?The Latest In Investor's CornerWhy The Stock Market Uptrend Is Under Pressure: The Latest In IBD's The Big Picture

136,MMM,"S&P 500 index futures rose early Tuesday morning, but Nasdaq 100 futures fell after Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported higher-than-expected traffic acquisition costs to partner sites, with some blaming Apple (AAPL). Meanwhile, four notable stocks that are near buy points report early Tuesday: General Motors (GM), Eli Lilly (LLY), 3M (MMM) and New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU).XThe Nasdaq composite rose 0.4% on Monday, hitting another all-time high. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average retreated 0.3%.Nasdaq 100 futures fell a fraction vs. fair value. But S&P 500 index futures rose nearly 0.2% while Dow futures climbed 0.3%.Alphabet reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenue, factoring in a $2.7 billion charge for a European Union regulatory fine. But traffic acquisition costs (TAC), what it pays partners to carry its ads, shot up 28% to $5.09 billion. That could be tied to a revised search deal with Apple, analysts said.Alphabet had closed up 0.45% to 998.31, rising as high as 1,006.10 intraday, just below a 1,008.71 buy point from a flat base. But Google's parent fell nearly 3% in early trading Tuesday.While overnight action doesn't always translate into regular-session stock performance, Alphabet shows that being near a buy point is not the same as actually rising above it. Still, stocks approaching sound entries from bullish patterns are often worth watching. Here are four stocks near buy points that are reporting quarterly results early Tuesday.General Motors cleared a 36.10 cup-with-handle buy point on July 14, and continued to edge higher in below-average volume for a few days. But GM shares have retreated for the past three sessions, losing 0.7% to 35.84, dropping below the still-valid entry.Analysts expect GM's per-share profit to fall 7.5% to $1.72 as revenue drops 5% to $40.25 billion, according to consensus estimates from Zacks Investment Research.For the past three sessions Eli Lilly shares have risen intraday above an 84.86 buy point in a cup-with-handle base, only to close just below that level. Lilly ended Monday at 84.74.Eli Lilly is expected to report EPS of $1.04 up 21% vs. 86 cents a year earlier. Revenue should climb 3% to $5.589 billion vs. $5.405 billion.The industrial conglomerate and Dow Jones industrial average component has formed a short flat base with a potential entry of 214.67. 3M closed Monday at 210.Analysts expect 3M to deliver a 24.5% EPS jump to $2.59, with revenue up nearly 3% to $7.879 billion.Fellow Dow components McDonald's (MCD), United Technologies (UTX), DuPont (DD) and Caterpillar (CAT) also report Tuesday.The Chinese operator of for-profit schools is a member of the IBD 50. New Oriental Education has formed a cup base with an 83.31 buy point. Shares rose 1.7% to 80.49 on Monday.New Oriental is expected to report 38 cents per U.S. share, up 52% vs. a year earlier, with revenue up 21% to $478.8 million, according to Thomson Reuters figures.TAL Education (TAL), another Chinese school company, is No. 1 on the IBD 50 list.

137,MMM,"General Electric (GE) reported a smaller-than-expected earnings decline early Friday and sees cash flow improving as costs come down, but signaled that weakness in its oil and gas businesses suggest full-year profit will be at the low end of its forecasts. Industrial bedfellow Honeywell (HON) also topped profit and sales views and gave a generally upbeat outlook.X Estimates: Earnings per share to decline 51% to 25 cents as revenue drops 13.1% to $29.12 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. The revenue drop reflects divestitures in part.Results: GE earned 28 cents a share on revenue of $29.56 billion. Organic industrial revenue rose 2%. Power segment revenue grew 5% to $6.97 billion. Renewable energy revenue jumped 17% to $2.46 billion. Healthcare climbed 4% to $4.7 billion. But oil and gas fell 3% to $3.11 billion, and aviation was flat at $6.53 billion. Transportation revenue fell 14% to $1.07 billion. Adjusted industrial operating margin ticked up to 13.2% from 13.1%.Industrial cash flow was $1.5 billion, reversing negative cash flow of $1.6 billion in the prior quarter. Industrial orders climbed 6% from a year ago to $28.3 billion.""We expect cash flow to continue to improve throughout the year,"" said Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt in a statement. ""We've reduced our industrial structural costs year to date by $670 million and we are on track to meet or exceed our $1 billion cost reduction target for the year.""Outlook: GE backed its full-year EPS forecast of $1.60-$1.70 on organic sales growth of 3% to 5%. But CFO Jeff Bornstein said EPS is trending to the bottom end of that $1.60-$1.70 range due to oil and gas weakness. The oil and gas industry has been weaker than expected with oil prices down in 2017. Customers are delaying purchases and hurting legacy businesses.Stock: Shares tumbled to a 21-month low of 25.26 soon after the market open, closing down 2.9% to 25.91 on the stock market today.RBC Capital Markets questioned the quality of GE's Q2 earnings: ""GE's headline 2Q17 operating EPS of $0.28 was nicely above our estimate and consensus of $0.25. That said, underlying quality of earnings was mixed, with the beat driven almost entirely by lower corporate expense and restructuring.""Vertical Research Partners also saw problems in the details, citing weaker-than-expected industrial operating margins and industrial cash flow.On Aug. 1, GE gets its first new chief executive in 16 years, marking the end of the Jeff Immelt era. The diversified conglomerate made several key strategic changes under his leadership, emerging with a much keener focus on its industrial roots and digital operations. However, GE stock has fallen in value over the course of Immelt's tenure and investors have been impatient for change.Estimates: Honeywell is expected to post a 7% gain in EPS to $1.78 as sales dip 1.6% to $9.84 billion.Results: EPS rose to $1.80 as revenue unexpectedly climbed 1% to $10.09 billion. Organic sales rose 3%. Aerospace sales fell 3% to $3.67 billion but were up 2% on an organic basis. Home and building technologies sales rose 2% to $2.74 billion. Performance materials sales fell 8% to $2.24 billion but rose 6% organically, and safety and productivity sales jumped 30% to $1.43 billion, or ticked up 1% organically.Outlook: Honeywell raised its full-year revenue target to $39.3 billion-$40 billion. It raised the low end of its full-year EPS target, moving from $6.90-$7.10 to $7-$7.10, lifting the midpoint by 5 cents.Stock: Honeywell stock initially fell to 133.70 but found support at the 50-day line.

139,MMM,"Dow Jones industrial average component General Electric (GE) reports results Friday for the last quarter presided over by CEO Jeff Immelt. Peer Honeywell (HON) reports the same day.XLong seen as a bellwether for the U.S. economy, GE has seen that image come under a cloud as GE stock languishes near 2015 levels while stocks of peers such as Honeywell, 3M (MMM) and United Technologies[ticker symb=UTX] flirt with all-time highs.GE is the second-worst performer on the Dow so far in 2017, while 3M and United Technologies are enjoying double-digit gains.Investors will be closely watching top-line results, where growth has been elusive for both GE and Honeywell in recent quarters. They also will be hoping GE's report puts it on the path of becoming a turnaround under John Flannery, who becomes the industrial titan's first new CEO in 16 years on Aug. 1.Industrials is the only S&P 500 sector that has seen estimates for second-quarter earnings growth tick up since the start of the quarter in April. Still, it is expected to report tepid 3.1% earnings growth vs. 8.1% for the S&P 500 overall as of July 14, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Analysts at CFRA describe the outlook for the industrial conglomerates subindustry as neutral.""We think industrial activity metrics indicate the industrial economy continues to experience modest expansion and that the global economy is likely to continue to be relatively tepid in 2017,"" CFRA equity analyst Jim Corridore wrote recently.Here is what to watch when GE and Honeywell report. GE's Dow peers United Technologies and 3M are on the dock July 25.Estimates: Earnings per share to decline 51% to 25 cents as revenue drops 13% to $29.12 billion, according to consensus analyst estimates from Zacks Investment Research. The revenue drop reflects divestitures in part.Stock: Shares were down 0.2% at 26.77 on the stock market today, after rebounding 2.4% last week from a 21-month intraday low on July 10.What to watch: Analysts pay attention to organic revenue, which filters out divestitures and some other noise, along with industrial orders. Both of those metrics have been weak in recent quarters.Cash flow will be in focus after spooking investors in the last report. Does GE's big buyback program make sense given weak cash flow?Investors will want to hear about GE's oil and gas segment following that segment's July 7 merger with oil service giant Baker Hughes and Immelt's recent downbeat comments. Are GE's jet engine and other aviation assets performing well, following positive rumblings during the Paris air show? GE's jet engine comments also will be noteworthy for United Technologies, with its big Pratt & Whitney jet engine division.Does GE's 2018 earnings goal of $2 a share still look like a stretch? GE could choose to lower its guidance to clear the decks for new CEO Flannery.Is General Electric on track to reach a $1 billion cost-cutting goal?Estimates: Honeywell is expected to post a 6.6% gain in EPS to $1.77 as sales dip 1.6% to $9.83 billion.Stock: Honeywell stock was down 0.15% Tuesday, dipping below buy range after rising 1.3% last week and setting a record high Friday.What to watch: The performance of its aerospace unit, which an activist investor has pushed to be spun off, given Honeywell recent cautions about corporate and defense demand for jets.RELATED: Fastenal Growth Accelerates, But Industrial Distributors Dive Once AgainNetflix, Microsoft, GE, Lockheed To Amp Up Earnings: Investing Action PlanBig Hits And Misses Of The Current Earnings Season

Cigarettes, But One Tobacco Giant Is Holding UpThe Federal Reserve kept to Wall Street's preferred script on Wednesday, leaving its key interest rate unchanged and putting off an announcement that it will begin unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.The Fed's patience comes as the economy is performing pretty well, with real GDP growing at a 2.6% pace in the second quarter, but inflation and wage gains have been more muted than expected. The combination has been good for the stock market, partly because the prospect of low interest rates has weighed on the dollar, which could be a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals in the second half of this year.The decision by the Fed to wait until September to announce a shift in its reinvestment policy — a gradual pullback from its current stance of reinvesting all principal from its maturing mortgage and Treasury bond portfolio — also sent a signal that policymakers aren't overly concerned that financial markets are too exuberant.The next interest-rate hike is expected in December.

146,MMM,"Hopes of a better economy helped big banks like JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) close out 2016 at the top of the Dow Jones industrial average. Six months later, stocks like Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA) and McDonald's (MCD) are the top blue chips helped by a mix of strong earnings reports and the companies' adaptation to an ever-digitizing world.XHere's a look at the Dow industrials' five best performers so far this year, which also include Visa (V) and 3M (MMM).Meanwhile, here are the Dow's five biggest dogs of 2017.The biggest gainer is aerospace giant Boeing, up 27% so far this year. Solid earnings reports have lifted the aerospace company's stock, and orders at last week's Paris Air Show came in ahead of those of rival Airbus (EADSY).The stock has pulled back slightly from last week's record high but are still slightly extended from a May breakout.At the end of last year, President Trump's complaints about the cost of Boeing's Air Force One program may have signaled a new age of strong-arming out of the White House. But the president later softened his stance, concluding an event at a South Carolina Boeing facility by saying: ""God bless Boeing.""Second in line is McDonald's, whose stock price has jumped 26% on a combination of strong earnings and strong prospects. The burger chain is expanding its delivery services and mobile ordering, and rolling out a new, more digitized restaurant format to its locations.""We believe McDonald's rapid implementation of mobile order and pay and in-restaurant kiosks will help drive meaningful sustained sales lifts in addition to reduced front of house labor,"" BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said in a research note Thursday, in which the firm raised its price target on the stock to 175 from 156.Following up McDonald's is Apple. Shares of the iPhone maker are up 24% this year, boosted by excitement surrounding the iPhone 8 and hikes in dividends and buybacks in its last quarterly report. Apple had been up more than 30%, leading the Dow, until selling off in June.Shares are in a flat base but has a lot of work to do.Like other tech stocks, shares of Apple sank on June 9 on concerns that the long run-up in the sector had gone a little too far. But unlike many other big techs, Apple fell below its 50-day moving average the following day and has been stuck below that level.More recently, Pacific Crest Securities said that Apple's services business — which includes the App Store, iTunes and Apple Music — could slow down.Other analysts have worried that the company was too slow to put out a smart-home assistant that could compete with Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL). But Apple could up the stakes in the battle for a more sophisticated device with smart glasses.Visa, up 20%, is the Dow's fourth best performer. Zacks analysts say that acquisitions, in particular that of Visa Europe, stand to help Visa expand, as do its prospects internationally and in electronic and mobile payments.3M, the diversified manufacturer best known to consumers for products like Post-it notes and Scotch tape, rounds out the Dow' s top 5. Shares have gained 16.6% in 2017.""Since 2012, the company has significantly pruned its businesses, thereby improving customer relevance, productivity and speed through a leaner operating structure,"" Zacks analysts said in a research note.

The ideal buy point is as close to the support line as possible. Shares rose nearly 5% in one month from the last pullback to the 50-day line in May.The ETF's four biggest sector weightings as of July 11 were industrials with 20%, financial services with 18%, utilities with 16%, and consumer defensive with 14%. Top names included 3M (MMM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Waste Management (WM).SPLV carries a 0.25% expense ratio.Schwab U.S. Large-Cap (SCHX) also rebounded off its 50-day line.

Vanguard Large-Cap (VV) and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) each rose nearly 1%. Both remain in buy range from the 50-day line.Going back to the June 17 picks, KraneShares CSI China Internet (KWEB) rose more than 7% in two weeks after rebounding off its 10-week line. It made one more pullback to the line after that and is up 3% from the later bounce.

Microsoft didn't start paying dividends until 2010, but has boosted its payout each year since. The other three companies are all members of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have increased their dividend payout for at least 25 straight years.While dividend stocks are often thought of as slow gainers, these four have all outpaced the S&P 500's 8% year-to-date return. Microsoft is up 13% through July 10, PepsiCo 9% and J&J 14%. 3M has rallied 18%.VIG is testing its 50-day moving average line and could set up a buy opportunity on a solid rebound. It offers an annualized yield of nearly 2.1%, slightly ahead of the S&P 500's average 1.9% payout. The $24.5 billion fund has a 10-year average annual return of 7.3%, in line with the S&P 500's 7%. Its expense ratio is 0.08%.ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) is showing similar action to VIG as it, too, seeks support at its 50-day line. As the name implies, the fund tracks the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index.Johnson & Johnson and 3M are among its top 10 names. Other big YTD winners in the top 10 include McDonald's (MCD), up 28%, and Abbott Laboratories (ABT), up 26%. NOBL carries a 0.35% expense ratio and pays a 1.9% yield.The $3 billion fund, launched in October 2013, has returned nearly 8% for the year through July 7, according to Morningstar. That lags the S&P 500's 9.5% gain. NOBL has a three-year average annual return of 9.75% vs. the S&P 500's 7.3%.Going back to the June 30 picks, both SPDR S&P 500 Growth (SPYG) and iShares Russell 1000 (IWF) are still trading near their respective 50-day lines. A solid bounce could still put them in play.RELATED:2 Income Plays Near Buy Points Own This Big Dividend StockMarket Sell-Off Tough, But Could Offer Opportunities Like These

He has been with GE for 24 years and led the takeover of Alstom's power and grid unit — the biggest industrial acquisition in GE's history.Russell Stokes, a 20-year GE veteran and the current head of the electrical connections unit, replaces him starting July 3.Bolze's departure has echoes of the exodus of senior managers after Jeff Immelt was named CEO in 2000, said analyst Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets, noting that Bolze is believed to have been on the list of potential candidates to succeed Immelt.The 2000 transition resulted in the ""immediate bitter"" departure of the losing CEO contenders, such as Bob Nardelli, then-CEO of GE Power Systems, and Jim McNerney, then-head of GE Aircraft Engines, Dray said in a statement. (Nardelli went on to helm Home Depot (HD) and then Chrysler, while McNerney took over at 3M (MMM) and later Boeing (BA).)""That said, it is possible that the brain drain this time will be limited,"" Dray continued. ""We note that the other leading candidate for the role, CFO Jeff Bornstein, was appointed vice chair of GE on Monday, supposedly in lieu of the CEO position.""Shares of GE, a Dow Jones industrial average component, edged up 0.8% to 28.69 on the stock market today, closing just below its 50-day line. GE stock surged on Monday, when Immelt's retirement was announced, its largest gain of the year so far. But the stock is mired 13% below its July 2016 high.Among other industrial conglomerates, United Technologies (UTX) fell 3 cents to 120.03, just in range from a 114.54 buy point. Honeywell (HON) dipped 0.1% to 134.24, just below a 135.10 buy point.U.S.-listed shares of German rival Siemens (SIEGY) rose 0.1%.IBD'S TAKE: GE shares are having a strong June so far after three down months, but this is why GE is not a buy yet.Despite Immelt's upcoming retirement, incoming CEO John Flannery is expected to build on the strategy of infusing core units like aviation, power systems, transportation and energy with technology, which began under Immelt and has been generally praised.Still, GE's transformation into a digital-industrial company during Immelt's leadership has done little for the stock, which sits at around 28 — roughly where it was more than two years ago.GE stock has posted an annual average 5.2% gain in the past two years through Tuesday, roughly half that of the S&P 500 over the same period.RELATED:Stocks Flatten Ahead Of Fed, But Dow Etches New HighGE Signals New CEO Will Continue Software Push Started By Immelt

152,MMM,"Stocks were flat in late trading Friday, as the market dared not cause any waves before the start of the three-day Memorial Day weekend.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 were virtually unchanged. The Dow Jones industrial average was flat, too. Microsoft (MSFT) made a new high. The stock has been rising from support at the 50-day moving average. 3M (MMM), another Dow component, also is up after finding support at its 50-day line.The small-cap Russell 2000 was down 0.1%. Volume was running below Thursday's levels at the same time of day, another sign that traders were packing up to go home.The apparel industry group led, thanks largely to an 18% surge in shares of Deckers Outdoor (DECK). The stock broke out of an irregular base with a 65.16 buy point. Deckers, best known for Ugg fashion boots, beat sales and profit expectations late Thursday and raised its outlook.Canaccord Genuity analyst Camilo Ryan raised the price target on Deckers to 76 from 69. ""Based on work it has done to improve the health of its U.S. distribution channels, segment the Ugg brand across price points/channels, and hire new talent across the organization, DECK expects to generate sales of $2 billion and an EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin of 13% in 2020, yielding $260M in EBIT,"" he noted.Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) broke out of a cup-with-handle base. The breakfast-fare chain rose past the 57.90 buy point but volume was about one-third less than average. That makes the breakout suspicious, although several restaurant stocks have been performing well.Momo (MOMO) rose 2% and is finding support after pulling back to the 50-day moving average. The Chinese internet company has already made a superb advance, though.Some retail and construction industry groups were at the bottom of the day's performance, including RV makers, homebuilders and suppliers of cement and concrete.Splunk (SPLK) gapped down below its 50-day moving average, falling as much as 7.5% from the 66.56 buy point of its most recent breakout. Shares of the supplier of data analytics software slid, even though the company's quarterly results topped estimates.RELATED:U.S. Growth Not So Bad After Revisions To Spending, InvestmentMarvell Technology, Broadcom, Qorvo Earn Price-Target Hikes

155,MMM,"As we move through May, the old Wall Street adage ""Sell in May and go away"" comes to mind, a reminder that stocks historically tend to underperform during the May-to-October period.But does that mean ETF investors should liquidate their holdings, take the summer (and a few extra months) off, and resume buying stocks in November?That's one investment strategy. But, as with most old sayings, it doesn't have to be taken literally. Even if the market's return tends to be bigger in the November-April period, investors sitting out the other six months miss out on intermediate rallies and on the power of reinvesting dividends and compounding returns.That's why Oliver Pursche, chief executive of Bruderman Brothers and Bruderman Asset Management, doesn't think the adage proves advantageous for most investors.""It is at best unreliable and inconsistent and amounts to market timing,"" he told IBD. ""When taking into account possible tax consequences, missed dividends and trading commission, the math doesn't bear out.""But Pursche, who oversees the New York-based firm's investment banking and wealth management divisions, thinks May is a good time for investors to reassess their portfolios.Click Here To See A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017Bruderman Asset Management is a registered investment advisor (RIA) with more than $1 billion in assets under management.Here are Pursche's three best ETF investment ideas, in his own words:""Sell in May and walk away"" is not a strategy we feel is particularly smart or beneficial to investors. However, as we enter the summer months and the second half of the year, there is a need for investors to revisit their investment thesis and potentially reallocate their portfolios. After a solid double-digit run by the S&P 500 since Mr. Trump was elected president, a portfolio risk assessment is certainly due. Investors should expect a continuation of the current positive sentiment, even though the Trump administration is unlikely to pass any major legislation, in particular tax reform. Nonetheless, there are several key factors that are benefiting our economy and consequently, corporate earnings.The United States economy, as well as the world as a whole, is benefiting from a cyclical rebound in growth and consumer demand that is helping drive corporate earnings higher, and could help boost U.S. GDP growth by 4% or more in the second quarter. One phenomenon that has been interesting to observe in the current earnings cycle is the strength of earnings coming from outside the United States. Of the companies within the S&P 500 that have reported earnings so far, those companies that earn more than 50% of their revenues offshore have seen EPS growth of nearly 20%, while companies that derive all of their earnings domestically are experiencing low- to middle-single-digit EPS growth.One last note: Expect a correction at some point, but don't let that change your long-term investment strategy. The ETFs named above should perform well if the current environment persists through the end of the year and into 2018, as we expect it to.RELATED:This ETF Is Knocking The 'Socks' Off The Tech Sector

160,MMM,"Sometimes a small prod is all it takes to make a hot investment idea go cold in no time — as small as a quarter-point bump in a benchmark rate in the case of low volatility and dividend stock ETFs.As the era of zero ends and interest rates rise, investors in exchange traded funds have turned away from certain high dividend and low volatility strategies this year. Instead, they favored more cyclical exposures that benefit from a tick up in rates — banks and transporters, for example.""Yet, thanks to product innovation, there are now strong smart-beta strategies that combine defensive and cyclical components,"" Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA, wrote in a March note. Smart beta ETFs seek to achieve better returns or lower risk vs. cap-weighted counterparts.As examples of ""next-generation products"" for a rising rate environment, Rosenbluth offered these two names:As relatively new products without a three-year history, both ETFs should be traded with care. However, Rosenbluth considers them worthy choices for large-cap stock exposure in light of the March rate hike and the Fed's signals of more gradual rate hikes this year.XRLV is the younger sibling of PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV), an ETF that aims to give investors a smoother ride in the stock market. SPLV invests in the 100 least volatile stocks in the S&P 500 and surged in popularity during 2016's choppy markets. So did iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (USMV).But this year through March 21, SPLV and USMV saw net outflow of $1.238 billion combined, according to FactSet data — a big chunk of their total assets, which now stand at roughly $19 billion.Hefty stakes in defensive, high-yielding sectors could be hurting them.Those equity sectors, such as consumer staples, real estate and utilities, are seen as ""bond proxies"" because of their higher yields. They have historically lagged the S&P 500 when bond yields are rising.As the Federal Reserve seems inclined to keep raising rates this year, more pain may lie in store for SPLV and USMV, in Rosenbluth's view.XRLV has little to fear in this context. It boots out the 100 most rate-sensitive stocks from the S&P 500 and so has virtually no exposure to utilities and real estate. Gas and electric companies such as Dominion Resources (D) and Southern Co. (SO), which belong in the older sibling's portfolio, are missing here.Instead, it skews heavily toward financials, technology and industrials, such as JB Hunt Transport Services (JBHT). Those economically sensitive sectors tend to perform well amid rising interest rates.Basically, XRLV is defensive — but not too much.""It's a middle ground for investors who are expecting more choppiness in the marketplace but also wish to participate in an improving economy,"" said Rosenbluth.XRLV has gained 10.3% since the Nov. 8 election, roughly in line with the S&P 500 and outpacing the 9.2% advance of the low volatility heavyweights, SPLV and USMV.While the Fidelity dividend ETF also holds stocks that perform well when rates are rising, it avoids big sector bets.It is up 4.8% year to date and has a 30-day SEC yield of 3.05%.RELATED:The Best Lage-Cap Growth ETF For 10 Years, But Is It Best For You?

162,MMM,"From small firms to corporate titans, U.S. businesses are bullish about the economy and their own plans, betting on tax cuts and other pro-growth policies from the Trump administration, a pair of surveys showed Tuesday.Small business optimism dipped in February, but from a 12-year high, the National Federation of Independent Business reported. Its index fell 0.6 point to 105.3. Meanwhile, the Business Roundtable CEO Economic Outlook Index shot up 19.1 points in the first quarter to 93.3, the highest since Q2 2014. It was the biggest quarterly jump since the end of 2009, when corporate America was just emerging from the Great Recession.""I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to enact a meaningful pro-growth agenda that will benefit all Americans, said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who's also chairman of Business Roundtable.Business Roundtable includes CEOs of many of the largest U.S. companies, including Dow Jones industrial average components JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Boeing (BA), 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT), DuPont (DD), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Wal-Mart (WMT) and more. With the Dow industrials up nearly 14% since the election, CEOs only have to look at their own stock options to feel more optimistic.The Business Roundtable CEO survey found the big CEOs are ramping up hiring and capital spending plans for the next six months, with expectations of higher sales.In a special question, 52% of CEOs identified tax reform as a top priority to improve the business climate, with regulatory reform and infrastructure coming in second and third, respectively. Trump has promised tax cuts, deregulation and $1 trillion in infrastructure spending. Trump has indicated he supports the idea of a border adjustment tax. The House GOP corporate tax reform, which would slash overall rates, would tax imports at 20%. Several Dow components (and Business Roundtable members) have endorsed a border adjustment tax, including Boeing, General Electric and Caterpillar, but Wal-Mart and retailers are strongly opposed.Small businesses also identified taxes and red tape as key issues, in the NFIB survey, also citing shortages of qualified workers. Job openings rose to the highest since December 2000, NFIB said, good news for people looking for work. Sales turned higher for the first time in nearly two years.But the small business advocacy group stressed that hope for pro-growth policies under President Trump can only do so much. Those policy proposals must actually go forward.""The enthusiasm has yet to be translated into an equally impressive increase in spending and hiring. This will require progress on the agenda that business owners voted for.""Meanwhile, the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index edged lower in March, but from February's 12-year high.RELATED:Job Openings At Small Firms Hit Highest Since December 2000IBD/TIPP Poll: Americans Don't Love Trump, But Love Trumponomics, Trump Rally

163,MMM,"The stock market continued to struggle in a broad decline in late afternoon trading Tuesday as the Federal Reserve began a two-day meeting on interest rate policy.Amid the Dow Jones industrial average, at least four stocks were at one point down 1 point or more each: Chevron (CVX), 3M (MMM), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and DuPont (DD).Among these four, only Chevron is trading below its key 50-day moving average, which can act as an important sell signal. Watch to see if the integrated oil major can keep its head up above the long-term 200-day moving average. UnitedHealth, as seen in either a long-term daily chart or a recent weekly chart, has clearly benefited from the Trump effect as the insurer and its peers are likely to face fewer obligations in handling coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act.UnitedHealth shares, up 5.7% year to date, have also climbed 17% past a 144.58 flat base entry that followed the stock's earlier breakout in 2016 from a long saucer base that featured a 126.31 entry. Be sure to see a weekly chart to fully view such long basing patterns.3M has rallied nearly 7% since moving past a 180.16 saucer-with-handle entry on Feb. 13. DuPont, despite cracking a four-day streak of gains with 1% drop to 80.42, has been gliding rather smoothly to 52-week highs since the agriculture, construction and electronics diversified giant hopped out of its aircraft-carrier-sized saucer with handle with a 71.19 entry in late November.DuPont shares have since gained as much as 14% and have not triggered any offense or defense-related sell signals.While a 25-basis point hike in the fed funds rate has long been considered in the bag for several weeks now, equity trading desks will focus on the statement that the U.S. central bank is set to issue after its meeting concludes at around 2 p.m. ET Wednesday.With producer prices in February higher than expected (up 0.3% month over month vs. the Econoday estimate for a 0.1% lift), the market will focus on whether the Fed shows more concern about inflation, which could lead to a quickened rebound in interest rates.On Dec. 15, the Fed raised short-term interest rates for only the second time in two years, sending the rate that large lenders get charged for overnight loans to a target rate of 0.5%-to-0.75%.Meanwhile, oil prices continued to fall as there appears no relief in the bulging supplies seen in the U.S.April-delivery West Texas Intermediate futures slumped more than 1.4% to $47.70 a barrel. Oil is in correction mode, now having sunk as much as 12% below the Feb. 23 high of $54.45.The Dow Jones industrial average is seeing the smallest decline among the major indexes, down just 0.2%, as strength in Apple (AAPL) and a solid 0.7% gain to 112.31 by entertainment titan Walt Disney (DIS) helped buffer the slide. Disney has built a superlong saucer with handle and is effectively breaking out past a new buy point of 112.09, 10 cents above the handle's high of 119.99.Near the session close, the Nasdaq fell 0.3%, as did the S&P 500, while the small-cap S&P 600 lost almost 0.5% and the Russell 2000 nearly 0.6%. Volume cooled off in the final hour yet appeared to still rise on the NYSE vs. the same time Monday and was lower on the Nasdaq.IBD's TAKE: Learn more about the saucer with handle base, a moneymaker for patient growth investors, by reading this Investor's Corner column by markets writer Paul Whitfield.Returning back to the Dow-30 components, IBM (IBM) is down 0.4% to 175.75. While volume is running more than 30% lighter than normal, shares are now testing buying support at the critical 50-day moving average near 175.37, which has been rising since the fourth quarter of last year.You'd prefer to see a stock not only rise, but keep an air pocket above its 50-day moving average. Big Blue is testing the 50-day line for the first time since clearing a four-month flat base at 165.05 in early December.That flat base could be seen as the finishing touch on a monster-size bottoming-base pattern that began after IBM peaked at 215.90 in 2013.IBM's fourth-quarter earnings rose 4% to $5.01 a share, breaking a six-quarter spell of shrinking profits. Revenue dipped 1%. However, IBM's net margin improved to 21.9% from 21.3% in the year-ago quarter.IBM earns a mediocre 60 Composite Rating by IBD Stock Checkup, just 20th best within the Computer-Tech Services industry group. Topping the industry group are CDK Global (CDK) (93 Composite out of a maximum 99) and CDW (CDW) (92 Comp).Fellow Dow industrials component Intel (INTC) pierced its 200-day moving average but recouped most of its early losses, down just 0.06 to 35.10. Watch to see if the 200-day line also acts as a floor of support.Intel shares have slumped after its decision to pay $15 billion to acquire the advanced driver assistance tech expert Mobileye (MBLY) of Israel. On Jan. 24, Intel broke out of a 15-week cup with handle at 37.44, but the rally lasted just four days and the breakout gain was limited to just 3%.A drop to 34.44 would mean Intel has fallen 8% from that precise entry, triggering the golden rule of selling.Apple, meanwhile, is holding steady after rising more than 18% past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point. Apple cleared this new base on Jan. 6-9 and has led its own 50-day moving average sharply higher.While shareholders who bought Apple at the first cup-with-handle breakout at 110.33 on Sept. 14 could decide to sell shares now, based on IBD's ""sell on the way up"" technique by taking gains at 20% to 25%, the excellent relative strength, low volume in recent down days, and prospects for a continued rebound in fundamentals serve as sound reasons to keep holding with conviction.A potential sell target for Apple would be if the stock were to reach a 30% to 40% gain from that bottoming-base breakout at 110.33, or 143.43 to 154.46.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Is It Time To Take Profits In Apple?Why The Bottoming Base Pattern Matters For Stock Investors TodayThe Bottoming Base, Part II: How Apple Formed One During The 2009 Market BottomWhen To Sell A Stock: Learn Key IBD Sell Rules Based On The Facts, Not OpinionsIBD News Coverage: Why Walt Disney Got An Upgrade From Wall Street

165,MMM,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average has had quite the turn in the spotlight of late, breaching the 20,000 level for the first time in its 120-year history and then stringing 12 straight record closes for its longest winning streak in decades.This hot streak for the blue chip index, and the exchange traded funds that track it, came as investors cheered President Donald Trump's proposals to deregulate industries, cut taxes and boost infrastructure spending.Relative to the S&P 500, the Dow has far more exposure to industrials, financials and consumer discretionary — economically sensitive sectors that could disproportionately benefit from the Trump vision — and zero exposure to defensively oriented utilities and real estate, points out Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA Research.On Wednesday, following Trump's well-received maiden speech to Congress, SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) soared to a fresh all-time high powered by big jumps for Apple (AAPL), Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).""The optimism following the (Trump) speech, as well as increased confidence that the Fed is going to raise rates sooner, is driving more cyclical stocks and sectors,"" said Rosenbluth. The Dow ETF, he added, ""has experienced a renaissance in the past few months.""Interest ticked up as the elite components of the Dow outperformed the S&P 500 after Trump's election win.From Nov. 8 through Tuesday's close, the SPDR Dow ETF jumped 9.1% vs. a 5.9% gain for SDPR S&P 500 (SPY). Of note, some top-performing stocks over the past three months, such as Boeing (BA) and Goldman Sachs, have a far bigger presence in the price-weighted Dow than in the cap-weighted S&P 500.DIA saw net inflow of more than $1 billion per month in November, December and January, following four months of net outflow. ""Diamonds"" was the No. 1 ETF in terms of flow of money in the week ended Feb. 9, attracting $1.1 billion. But over February as a whole, DIA leaked $826 million, including $2.03 billion on Feb. 15, reportedly the biggest one-day outflow in its nearly 20-year history.Rosenbluth describes the ETF as ideal for investors looking for a more economically sensitive slant to their large-cap exposure under the new regime.But, he cautioned, its concentrated 30-stock portfolio won't give them the same degree of diversification as S&P 500 funds.Those ETF investors who believe the Dow rally could continue have several ways to participate in the trend. These include:The portfolio is broadly representative of the stock market, but price-weighting makes for some idiosyncratic stock positions and sector bets. Higher priced stocks get a bigger portfolio stake, which means Goldman Sachs, trading at around 250, currently has the top spot in the portfolio, at an 8.2% weighting vs. 0.5% in the S&P 500. Industrial giant 3M (MMM), trading near 190, is No. 2.Morningstar analyst Alex Bryan calls price weighting ""a relic from the 19th century"" that lacks a sound economic basis.At the same time, he believes Dow stocks boast a more competitive edge — or ""wide economic moats,"" in his words — than S&P 500 companies.DIA is up 5.7% year to date and has produced an average annual 7.4% gain over the past 15 years, in line with the S&P 500 over both periods.The ETF has a 0.17% expense ratio vs. 0.10% for SPY. DIA trades roughly 3.5 million shares a day on average.This approach ""tends to weed out few if any stocks, highlighting the need for conviction in the Dow's names in the first place,"" according to ETF.com. However, Guggenheim says its dividend-focused approach ""should be of interest to investors as reinvested dividends historically have been a significant source of the DJIA's total return.""The top two holdings are Boeing, with a yield of 3.2%, and Chevron (CVX), yielding 3.8%.DJD debuted in December 2015 and charges 0.30% of assets in expenses. It yields 2.46% vs. 2.17% for DIA.Rosenbluth believes this relatively new product merits the additional scrutiny required of smaller, less liquid ETFs.Leveraged ETFs generally are short-term tactical tools, traded for a single day. Over longer periods, and in the hands of an inexperienced investor, the leverage can significantly erode returns.DDM has $334.7 million in assets and trades with high volume and tight spreads. Its 0.95% expense ratio makes it expensive to hold over long periods.The ETF spiked 3% in massive volume on the stock market today, with its relative strength line bolting to new highs.Sibling ProShares Short Dow30 (DOG), an inverse strategy, offers positive returns when the benchmark declines. It allows ETF investors to make a bearish bet on the Dow.RELATED:The 'Trump ETFs' Spotlighted As 6 Best Investment Ideas For 2017

166,MMM,"3M Co.'s fourth-quarter sales fell in its consumer division as the maker of Post-it notes contended with weak demand for office products and stationery.The business posted its first year-over-year decline since 2009, Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note Tuesday. The ""uncharacteristic softness"" offset better performance elsewhere, he said.The results capped a challenging year for 3M (MMM), which faced a steady drag from a strong U.S. dollar and a sharp downturn in the consumer-electronics market. With about two-thirds of revenue coming from overseas, the maker of adhesives, touch screens and dental tools has attempted to reduce U.S. expenses and strengthen business in Europe and Latin America.3M's sales in the quarter were little changed at $7.33 billion, the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company said in a statement. That compared with the $7.35 billion average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 0.7% in the consumer operation.3M fell 1.6% to 175.59 in morning trade on the stock market today. The shares climbed 28% in the 12 months through Monday, compared with a 19% gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.Earnings rose to $1.88 a share, narrowly beating the $1.87 average of analysts' estimates. The effects of foreign-currency exchange reduced sales by almost 1%, while divestitures trimmed the results by 0.4%, 3M said.The industrial division posted the biggest sales gain, up 3%, boosted by the automotive-parts business. The original-components business, which makes films, emission-control materials and adhesives for use in vehicle manufacturing, ""continues to outpace global auto builds,"" the company said in slides accompanying its earnings announcement Tuesday. Sales climbed 0.6% in the safety and graphics unit.Chief Executive Officer Inge Thulin has been reshaping 3M's portfolio through moves including the sale last month of an identity-verification business to Gemalto NV for $850 million. That followed agreements to shed the safety prescription eye-wear unit and buy coding technology company Semfinder. 3M ""made incremental investments to accelerate growth"" during the year, Thulin said in the statement.The company has been battling a slowdown in the consumer-electronics market, leading to a 1 percent sales decline for the unit in the quarter. 3M said last month that the operation's revenue could fall in 2017.Profit this year will be $8.45 to $8.80 a share, 3M said, reaffirming a forecast given last month. Organic local-currency sales will grow 1%-3%.

168,MMM,"The Dow Jones industrial average and other key indexes strove to cut early losses on Thursday as the nation remained embroiled in controversy over incoming President-elect Donald Trump and Congress engaged in a deep-fry questioning of Treasury secretary pick Steve Mnuchin.Meanwhile, select large-cap techs brushed off worries over the future of Capitol Hill and the White House as institutional trading desks deployed more capital in names such as Nvidia (NVDA), one of the market stars of 2016 that this week tested support at its 10-week moving average near 99.72, setting off a technical buy signal.Nvidia shares rallied nearly 3% to 105.99, with volume initially running sharply above average pace. But by mid-afternoon, Thursday's pace fell around 25% below average. Nvidia's 50-day average turnover is 19.5 million shares.This is the second time that Nvidia tested the key 10-week line following a late-September breakout past a 63.60 flat-base entry.However, as noted in a past Stock Market Today column, the graphics processors expert staged climax-run-like action at the end of December, meaning that a significant price correction was due.Indeed, that has happened, with the stock falling nearly 18% below its 119.93 all-time high. And yet the stock has been showing much restraint in its current decline, a good sign for long-term holders who have a healthy profit cushion in the stock.The 30-stock Dow industrials index was off nearly 0.4% with less than 45 minutes remaining in Thursday's session. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite nursed losses of 0.2% to 0.5%.But the Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial firms in that all-electronic exchange, was virtually flat.Small caps lost their edge following the Russell 2000's solid gain of 0.5% on Wednesday. The Russell caved 0.8% Thursday. With less than an hour to go until the market close, volume is still running higher vs. the same time Wednesday on the Nasdaq and mildly lower on the NYSE.U.S. government long bonds tanked, sending the 10-year Treasury yield up as high as 2.48%. That's still well below its mid-December peak of 2.60%.Returning to Nvidia, one could argue that the stock has already made two pullbacks to the 10-week moving average after its late-September breakout. The first occurred just four weeks into the new rally following that breakout, in the week ended Oct. 14. The second test of that 10-week line took place over a roughly two-week span that began in the week ended Nov. 4.However, in that Oct. 14 week, while the 10-week line in fact was a touch higher than the 63.60 entry, it also could be seen more as an initial pullback to the proper buy point. Such tests can happen in as many as four out of 10 big stock market winners, as IBD research has shown.Regardless, anyone who wishes to add shares to an existing position in Nvidia should take great care in 1) adding only a small amount, which abides by the law of pyramiding into a stock (i.e., adding smaller amounts of shares as a stock rises in price, thus keeping the average cost per share low); and 2) be ready to cut losses very quickly in that newly bought position.Elsewhere in the stock market today, 3M (MMM) is trading just a few points below a potential saucer-with-handle breakout price of 180.16. The shallow chart pattern began forming after the stock peaked near 182 in July last year.Analysts see the Dow component's Q4 earnings up 4% to $1.87 a share.3M is also trading nicely above its 50-day moving average, exactly what you want to see before a potential breakout occurs. The stock's RS Rating improved to 53 from 49 on a scale of 1 to 99, and is in a range typically seen in stocks forming long bases.Apple (AAPL) lifted off early-morning lows to trade nearly flat at 119.81, still in buy range from a breakout past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point. The 5% permissible buy zone extends up to 124.02. Those who follow CAN SLIM investing rules should in general not chase a stock that breaks out and then moves more than 5% past the proper buy point.On Sept. 14, the iPhone giant cleared a 110.33 buy point in an earlier cup with handle that emerged out of a long bottoming base pattern., then rallied nearly 8% before pulling back, testing support at the pivotal 200-day moving average, and forming its latest new cup pattern.While Apple is not moving with the same gusto as it's done during past huge breakouts over the prior 12 years, the stock's ratings are gradually improving. Apple's 61 RS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 is up from as low as 52 seven weeks ago, and its up/down volume ratio of 1.4 signifies heavy volume on up days in price relative to down sessions over the past 50 trading days. Focus on those stocks with an up/down ratio of 1.0 or higher. (IBD Stock Checkup, a premium research tool available at Investors.com, shows this ratio for all companies in IBD's database.)Mobileye (MBLY) continues to form its base as shares in the automobile self-driving and assisted-driving tech firm gained 3.7% to 43.59 and is holding nicely above its 50-day moving average.Mobileye showed solid gains following a long, deep cup-with-handle breakout past 48.88 in June 2015 and rallied as much as 29% in less than two months before forming a new flat base.That next base, however, failed, and the Israeli software and vehicle vision systems firm went into an even deeper price slide, falling more than 63% to a low of 23.57 by the first quarter of 2016. Such action indeed marks Mobileye's shift into a bottoming-base action.It's too early to set a new buy point for the mid-cap tech play for now, but the 93 Composite Rating and rising RS Rating of 64, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, suggest that it's worth a spot on aggressive growth investors' watch lists.Later today, watch for quarterly results from airline industry leader Alaska Air (ALK) (earnings seen falling 7% to $1.36 a share) and Dow 30 name IBM (IBM) (EPS seen up 1% to $4.88, which could snap a six-quarter streak of year-over-year declines).IBM is trying to bottom out after striking a low of 116.90 in February 2016. Big Blue has made minimal progress so far since clearing a 165.05 buy point within an aircraft carrier-size saucer-with-handle base.The handle itself, which formed from August to December last year, is long enough to qualify as a flat base.RELATED:Stock Market Today: When Did Nvidia Signal That A Correction Is Near?How To Invest: The Importance Of Pyramiding, And Other Nuggets Of Trading Wisdom From Gerald LoebHow To Invest: Why The Bottoming Base Pattern Still Matters Today For Growth And Value InvestorsHow To Invest: Still The No. 1 Rule In Stock TradingCan Nvidia's Fundamentals Turn It Into The Next Apple?

170,MMM,"The general market seesawed between gains and losses in the stock market today as financial and retail stocks continued to weigh on the indexes.The Nasdaq was barely higher and the S&P 500 inched lower while the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 0.2%.3M (MMM) led in the Dow, rising about 1%, while UnitedHealth (UNH) was the biggest laggard, down 2.6%, following its Q4 earnings release after the close yesterday.Despite beating earnings estimates, Dow components Goldman Sachs (GS) fell 0.8% and JPMorgan (JPM), which reported last week, just edged lower.NetEase (NTES) gave back 3.3%. The Chinese internet gaming stock is building the right side of a potential base. However, the stock needs longer to consolidate as no recognizable entry can be found.Ahead of its Q4 earnings release after the close today, Netflix (NFLX), a Leaderboard member, fell 1%, continuing its decline from its highs after yesterday's reversal. The stock remains just above a 129.39 cup-with-handle buy point.Retailers continued to be plagued by weak holiday sales after Target (TGT) issued a profit warning for Q4, causing the stock to fall more than 6%.Oil prices declined 2%. Crude has been trading between the 50 and 54 prices levels for several weeks now.Leading growth stocks were mostly positive heading into afternoon trading with financial stocks continuing their recent declines. Leading on the day were chip stocks, which bounced back nicely from yesterday's downturn. Microchip (MCHP) rose 1.9% and is approaching a 66.91 flat-base entry.On the upside, Cognex (CGNX) ran up 4%, reaching a new 52-week high.On the downside, Gigamon (GIMO) gapped down 30% after reporting preliminary fourth-quarter earnings and revenue figures below its prior guidance.RELATED:Dow Stock Goldman Sachs Crushes Earnings Estimates On Bond TradingNetflix Earnings After The Close: What To ExpectTarget Is Latest Retailer To Warn As Amazon Hogged HolidaysGigamon Preliminary Earnings, Revenue Weak Amid Customer Delays; Stock Dives

171,MMM,"U.S. stock indexes were up modestly midday Wednesday with blue chips showing the most strength.The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.5%, while the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 added 0.1% each. The small cap Russell 2000 also inched up 0.1%. Volume in the stock market today was running slightly lower on the NYSE and a bit higher on the Nasdaq.In the price-weighted Dow, the day's biggest percentage gainer among the highest priced stocks were Goldman Sachs (GS) and 3M Company (MMM). Each rose almost 1%. Merck (MRK) scored the biggest pop, up 3%. But Merck's price is roughly 62, giving far less weight in the Dow than Goldman's 244 price and 3M's 177.Meanwhile, biotech stocks tumbled as President-elect Donald Trump bashed the high-end drugmakers in a news conference. The biotech group fell 3.5%.The Nasdaq was trying to deliver its seventh consecutive daily gain. The tech-leaning index went into Wednesday's session 6-0 for the year. In the Nasdaq 100, First Solar (FSLR) was the biggest percentage gainer, up 5% in average volume. The stock is 52% off its high. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, solar is No. 196 — one notch above the last place gold-mining stocks.Superregional banks are in first place, but were barely up midday Wednesday. Energy held the biggest gains, with oil drillers and oil machinery joining solar to nail down three of the day's top five positions.West Texas intermediate crude oil popped more than 2% to more than $52 a barrel. The Energy Information Administration reported an increase of 4.1 million barrels for the week. Analysts had expected an increase of less than 1 million barrels.Oil stocks didn't appear much bothered by the bad news. In the drillers group, 10 stocks rose 3% or more. The biggest percentage gainer was Atwood Oceanics (ATW), up 6% in more than twice its usual volume.RELATED:Trump Says Drugmakers Are 'Getting Away With Murder'Economic Optimist Surges

173,MMM,"Investors showed less cheer amid a broad decline, but most of the major indexes shaved losses by Thursday's close. Volume grew on both main exchanges, according to preliminary data.Retailers paced the decline on a negative report from the influential market research firm NPD that pointed to lower retail sales during the holiday season vs. the same time a year ago. News that President-elect Donald Trump is mulling a sizable tariff on imports certainly did not dampen concerns.Department store chain, discount and variety store chain, home furnishings, apparel and shoes and specialty retail groups all slid more than 3% for the day. Auto retailing, leisure products and jewelry stocks also got battered.Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) kept its two-week stretch run intact, getting as high as 108.87 before finishing the day up 1.2% at 107.10 — up more than 220% since shares bolted out of a second-stage cup with handle in mid-March at 33.17.Apple (AAPL) dropped to as low as 115.64 before edging back to cut the loss to a reasonable 0.7% at 116.22. As noted in Wednesday's Stock Market Today column, the iPhone and iPad giant could be poised to form a proper handle, which would be in line with its prior action over the past 12 years that ushered new breakouts and outstanding price gains.Apple remains up 5% past a prior 110.33 buy point in a cup with handle that sits within a much larger, deeper bottoming base pattern.The Nasdaq composite fell 0.4% after being down as much as 0.7%. The Nasdaq 100, however, lost just 0.3% and the NYSE composite eased less than 0.3%. The S&P 500 gave back less than 0.2%, the Dow Jones industrials just 0.1%.Five Dow 30 components, including integrated oil major Chevron (CVX), 3M (MMM) and Verizon (VZ), rose half a point or more to buffer the index's slide. But the Russell 2000 sank 0.9%, now on pace for a slight decline for the week.Investors did not react that wholeheartedly to the bigger than expected 3.5% final print on Q3 U.S. GDP annualized growth. The price index gained modestly and less than the 2% minimum target of the Federal Reserve.Returning to Nvidia, one major reason why it's been acting so well: The champion of innovative graphics processors, or GPUs, is feeding off the strength of the fabless chip firms as a whole.As the world gets increasingly digital and more machines join the IoT era, Nvidia and its peers are seeing rosy demand for semiconductors that can process heavy loads of data and information and allow devices to become more intelligent.Besides Nvidia, at least 14 more companies in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group post a Composite Rating of 90 or higher, and all 15 trade at least 10 a share — from small caps Semtech (SMTC), Silicon Laboratories (SLAB) and China's Alpha & Omega Semiconductor (AOSL) to mid- and large-cap names Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Xilinx (XLNX).Xilinx recently cleared a 54.39 entry in a cup with handle base and has risen nearly 12% in less than four weeks so far.You can see all of the names that make up the Chips sector by going to Stock Lists at Investors.com, clicking on ""IBD Data Tables,"" then selecting the Nasdaq + NYSE Smart Tables.Research by IBD has found that up to half of a great stock market winner's overall price move is generated by the strength of its broad sector and individual industry group.Nvidia's fabless semi group is currently 10th out of 197 IBD industry groups and subgroups in terms of relative six-month performance and is up more than 43% YTD.RELATED:Why Nvidia's Fundamentals Could Turn It Into The Next AppleInvesting To Win: Pearls Of Wisdom From Wall Street Great Gerald LoebThe Big Picture: What Do Economists Fear The Most In 2017?When Did Apple Initially Break Out?The Bottoming Base Pattern, And How Apple Formed One In 2009

177,MMM,"Major stock indexes were moderately lower with about one hour left to go in Tuesday's session, unfazed by a robust reading in consumer confidence from the latest IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index.Leading growth stocks were under a lot of pressure, while earnings and tepid guidance from 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT) and Whirlpool (WHR) didn't help matters.The Nasdaq composite was down 0.5%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.3% each.One bit of good news was the latest reading from the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index.

178,MMM,"Stocks shaved a small chunk of their intraday losses with an hour left in Wednesday's session. Bargain hunters swooped in after the Federal Reserve announced -- without surprise to investors -- no change in the fed funds rate it charges on overnight loans to Wall Street banks.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, showed its mettle with a nearly 0.5% gain to 111.40, holding mildly above a 110.33 cup with handle breakout point.However, two members of the policy committee, Esther George of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank and Loretta Mester of the Cleveland Fed, voted against the action, as they both argued instead for a 25-basis-point hike in the rate. The current fed funds rate is in a target range of 0.25% to 0.5%.The Nasdaq composite, down as much as 0.9% just after 2 p.m. ET, cut the loss to around 0.7%.The S&P 500 rebounded to trade less than 0.5% lower. The 2100 level may be acting as a support level, but the 50-day moving average, which has been sloping lower for nearly four weeks, continues to cap the large-cap index's recent rally attempts.The Dow Jones industrials is outperforming the other key indexes, down less than 0.3% and getting a boost by a 1.1% gain by 3M (MMM) as well as modest gains from Apple and Home Depot (HD). Small caps continued to bleed more red, with the Russell 2000 down nearly 1%.Fellow Dow 30 component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) cut early losses and was down just 0.4% at 68.69, up from a recent breakout from a bottoming base at 65.08.The 65.08 entry derives from adding 10 cents to a handle that formed on a long cup base. Last month, the Wall Street bank and consumer lending institution reported its best quarter in years as earnings grew 20% on a 10% revenue jump.JPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley (MS) was off 1.4% to 32.89, still up 1% past a 32.47 handle buy point, while Citigroup (C), down 0.9% in slow turnover to 48.49, was clinging to minute gains from a breakout at 48.28.Apple initially broke out on Sept. 14 and gained nearly 8% before pulling back. So far, the decline appears normal, particularly during a stock market as choppy as today.The iPhone company has benefited by a tragic misstep by rival Samsung Electronic in its battery problems with the Galaxy Note big-format smartphone, which the South Korean company has decided to discontinue.Apple has unveiled a new refresh of its Macbook computers that have a new touch bar feature at the top of the keyboard, making it easy for users to apply emoji icons and other commands into emails and messages. Apple watchers are also speculating that next year's iPhone 8 will include new features such as wireless charging. In other words, the company continues to innovate relentlessly.Meanwhile, Wall Street expects Apple's earnings in the December-ending first quarter to decline just 2% to $3.22 a share, an improvement from year-over-year declines of -18%, -23% and -15% in the prior three quarters.Also in the stock market today, Tesla Motors (TSLA) continues to slump after holding in a range of 190 to 215 for months. The stock fell 1% to 188.90 and is near taking out its June 27 low of 187.87.FleetCor Technologies (FLT) sold off, gapping down at the open and falling more than 12% and hit as low as 149.21 before rebounding a tad. The former growth stock leader saw turnover surge more than six times usual levels and gave back all of its gains since an Aug. 3 breakout sent the stock past a 152.83 double bottom with handle buy point.The fuel card technology firm, serving the trucking industry, posted a 15% increase in earnings to $1.92 a share, narrowly edging the Street's view, as revenue rose 7% to $484.4 million. Perhaps the recent fall in crude oil prices are dampening investors' expectation of future demand for FleetCor's fuel cost efficiency-boosting services.RELATED:Federal Reserve Leaves Rates Unchanged, Awaits 'Further Evidence'What Is The Bottoming Base Chart Pattern, And How Does Help Investors Make Money?When Did Citigroup Break Out?When Was The Right Time To Buy Apple Shares?

179,MMM,"The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey index out Tuesday showed a steady, slow pulse for the factory sector, ticking up to 51.9 in October from 51.5 the prior month, slightly ahead of expectations.Yet the U.S. factory sector remains stuck in first gear, and that's not likely to change as automakers tap the brakes and interest rates edge higher.Meanwhile, the construction sector has stalled outright, dragged down by weak public-sector outlays. Total construction spending in September fell 0.4% from August and 0.2% from a year ago. That's the first year-over-year decline since 2011.Private construction spending fell 0.2% from August as a 1.0% drop in nonresidential spending offset a 0.5% rise in residential spending. In the past year, nonresidential spending has led the way, rising 4.1% vs. 0.9% for residential. Still, growth in private spending has been swamped by a 7.8% drop in public construction spending from a year ago.The ISM survey showed a pickup in production to 54.6 from 52.8, but there was less visibility into future production as the new orders index slipped 3 points to 52.1 and the gauge of order backlogs fell to 45.5 from 49.5. Readings above 50 signal expansion, while those south of 50 suggest contraction.On a positive note, the employment index rose to 52.9 from 49.7.While the overall ISM was only modestly above the 50 neutral level, a sixth rise in seven months is somewhat encouraging after weak overseas growth and a retrenchment in the oil patch led to a manufacturing contraction in the second half of 2015 and early this year.Even as health care and housing costs push up services inflation, plodding growth in the industrial side of the economy gives the Federal Reserve more leeway to leave interest rates low for longer, because factory slack limits pricing power. The Federal Reserve began a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday.Ford Motor (F) said last week that it would idle some plants or run fewer shifts to avoid a backup in inventories if U.S. auto sales slow in 2017, as it expects. This week, it was cutting one of three shifts at its F-150 pickup truck plant in Kansas City, Mo.Ford said late Monday that it won't release October U.S. sales later this week due to a Monday fire, knocking out power for data systems at its Dearborn, Mich., plant. Ford is expected to report that its sales in October fell 10.9% from a year ago, according to Edmunds' auto-information service.Still, overall U.S. sales are expected to match the highest level of the year, coming in at a 17.8 million-unit annual rate, though that would be another year-over-year decline.General Motors (GM) reported sales slipped 1.7% from a year earlier, but that was much better than the 6.3% drop expected by Edmunds.IBD'S TAKE: While the Federal Reserve is virtually certain to hike interest rates in December, the strengthening dollar may lead policymakers to spring another kind of surprise to avoid a repeat of what happened after the hike in December 2015.Several industrial companies have lowered their earnings guidance in recent weeks. Steel maker Nucor (NUE) said on Oct. 20 that profitability will ""decrease notably"" in the fourth quarter, not entirely due to regular seasonality. Nucor said its end markets are a mixed bag, with automotive remaining strong, but energy, heavy equipment and agricultural markets are still weak.The ISM survey showed that 10 of 18 manufacturing industries reported growth. Among survey respondents, positive comments came from the chemical sector, computer and electronics, fabricated metals, plastics and rubber — along with food, beverage and tobacco. Negative comments came from primary metals, where it was noted that production was down 20%, and transportation equipment.General Electric (GE) said on Oct. 21 that its comparable industrial orders fell 6% during the third quarter, though its digital and software orders rose 11%.United Technologies (UTX), Caterpillar (CAT) and 3M (MMM) all offered earnings outlooks below analyst estimates when they reported last week.One positive in the third-quarter GDP report released on Friday was a 10% rise in exports, the biggest since the fourth quarter of 2013. But that trend is unlikely to continue after the surge in the dollar vs. other currencies in October.RELATED:GM, Fiat Chrysler U.S. Sales Fall Less Then Feared; Ford DelayedNucor, Steel Dynamics Profit From Fewer ImportsGM, Caterpillar Fall Below Buy Points As Industrial Giants Guide Low

180,MMM,"It was a huge week for earnings. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) were A-list headliners, but a slew of industrials, medicals, restaurants and more also reported. Tesla Motors (TSLA) reported a surprise profit, while Qualcomm (QCOM) will buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).The Nasdaq fell 1.3% for the week, with Amazon's miss and Apple's modest beat failing to impress. The tech-heavy index dropped below its 50-day line after retaking that level last week. The S&P 500 sank 0.7%, while the Dow rose 0.1%. Bonds continued to fall around the world, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield to multimonth highs.In the September quarter, Apple earned $1.67 a share, down 15% year over year, on sales of $46.85 billion, down 9%. Analysts expected Apple to earn $1.66 a share on sales of $46.94 billion. For the holiday quarter, Apple guided Wall Street higher on revenue, but its profit margin outlook came up short. Apple also unveiled new MacBook Pro notebook computers, which feature a touch-screen strip for application commands and shortcuts that replaces the function keys. Apple fell 2.5% for the week, but remains above its 50-day line.Amazon reported Q3 earnings of 52 cents a share, a big gain but well short of estimates for 78 cents. The e-commerce giant plowed money into its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit, along with a big expansion of fulfillment centers heading into the holiday season. Revenue rose 29% to $32.7 billion, meeting views. AWS was among the bright spots in the earnings report as revenue rose 55% year over year to $3.23 billion, beating the consensus. Q4 revenue guidance also lagged. Amazon shares fell 5.2% Friday, closing below its 50-day line for the first time in months.Q3 earnings per share minus items rose 23% to $9.06 while total revenue climbed 20% to $22.45 billion vs. consensus estimates of $8.60 and $22.05 billion. Google-parent Alphabet signaled higher investments in its  cloud computing business and higher Q4 marketing costs tied to the September launch of Pixel-branded smartphones and a smart home speaker that competes with Amazon's Echo. Google's Q3 net revenue — despite higher traffic acquisition costs (TAC) costs of $4.18 billion — was $18.27 billion, topping views.Alphabet shares nearly hit a record high Friday morning, but closed the day fractionally higher and the week fractionally lower, but still in buy range.Tesla Motors earned 71 cents a share excluding items, soundly beating the consensus estimate of a 54-cent loss. Revenue climbed 45% to $2.3 billion, up 45% and topping estimates of $1.977 billion. Elon Musk had pushed Tesla to boost deliveries and turn a profit in Q3, but some analysts are skeptical that the effort is sustainable. Tesla maintained its guidance of 50,000 vehicle deliveries for the second half of 2016, with a Q4 plan of just over 25,000.Tesla and SolarCity (SCTY) late Friday were expected to unveil an integrated product offering of solar panels, battery storage and charger. Tesla is in the process of buying SolarCity. Elon Musk is the top shareholder in both companies, as well as SpaceX.Tesla found resistance at the 50-day line and reversed, ending the week down 12 cents at 199.97. SolarCity climbed 2.7%.Gigamon (GIMO) reported third quarter profit and revenue that blew past estimates and raised current quarter guidance. Santa Clara, Calif.-based Gigamon said Q3 EPS minus items rose 64% to 36 cents, while revenue jumped 47% to $83.5 million. Analysts had projected 31 cents and $79.6 million. In the current quarter, Gigamon forecast EPS of 37 cents and revenue of $92 million at its midpoint of guidance vs. consensus estimates of 33 cent profit and 29% revenue growth to $86 million. Analysts say AT&T (T) may be a new customer, joining T-Mobile US (TMUS).Gigamon shot up 16.1% Friday, hitting a record high intraday. Shares had fallen 5.2% Thursday to below its 50-day line.Lumentum (LITE) said Q1 EPS rose 69% to 44 cents and revenue climbed 19% to $252.3 million, topping expectations but current quarter revenue guidance was light amid a telecom component shortage from an unnamed supplier. EPS guidance of 51 cents at the midpoint was above consensus estimates of 49 cents. Lumentum fell 3.7% after its late Thursday report, but that followed a 4.3% fall Thursday as Acacia Communications (ACIA) crashed 16% that day and for the week. Chinese telecom gear giant ZTE, a key Acacia customer, reported weak revenue.Qualcomm announced a deal to buy NXP Semiconductors for $39 billion, creating the No. 2 chipmaker by revenue after Intel (INTC). Including debt, the deal is worth $47 billion. Mobile-communications chipmaker Qualcomm said the acquisition will expand its footprint into key growth markets, including automotive, Internet of Things, security and networking. The Qualcomm-NXP transaction marks the biggest semiconductor deal ever, surpassing Avago Technologies' $37 billion purchase of Broadcom (AVGO).New Oriental Education and Technology (EDU) met fiscal Q1 EPS views with a 15% gain to 90 cents. Revenue climbed 16.5%, above analysts' expectations, as enrollment boomed. The IBD 50 stock sees Q2 revenue above analyst guidance. Fellow Chinese for-profit school stock TAL Education (XRS) Q2 results topped estimates as total student enrollment jumped 77%. It guided Q3 revenue above Wall Street views. New Oriental stock rose more than 10% for the week, blasting out of a base to a new high.

Same-store sales tumbled 21.9% as fast-casual burrito chain still struggles to recover from late 2015 food-borne illness outbreaks. Shares fell 9% Wednesday, hitting a 3-year low. Panera Bread (PNRA) beat views, sending the stock higher intraday Wednesday, but reversed lower, falling to an eight-month low on Thursday. Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) met EPS views and missed on sales, but shares rose 6% Thursday from recent lows.Food delivery services provider GrubHub (GRUB) reported that EPS rose 73% and revenue 44%, both topping. But Grubhub's active diners rose by 19%, missing estimates slightly. Shares, which had been near an 18-month high, fell nearly 13% on Wednesday, tumbling below its 50-day line.Biogen (BIIB) posted $2.96 billion in sales and $5.19 EPS ex items, topping views and prodding shares up nearly 4%. Thursday, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) rose 5%, Celgene (CELG) 7% and Alexion (ALXN) 9% after beating on earnings. Amgen (AMGN) late Thursday beat, but shares tumbled nearly 10% Friday amid concerns about key drug Enbrel going forward. Also Friday, Novo Nordisk (NVO) dived 13% and Sanofi (SNY) rose 4.3%, as the European drugmakers had different views on the outlook for insulin treatments.Meanwhile, drug distributor McKesson (MCK) crashed 22.7% Friday after a big miss, blaming rival AmerisourceBergen (ABC) for heavy competition and further pressure from political attention on drug prices.

"
188,MMM,"Few companies can say they've paid a dividend without interruption for a century and increased the payout for 58 straight years.But 3M (MMM), the maker of Post-It notes, industrial adhesives and a wide range of other products, has done just that, while also offering nice stock price gains this year, rising 20% compared the S&P 500's 7% gain. It's currently climbing along its rising 10-week moving average.The success of the St. Paul, Minn.-based giant and S&P Dividend Aristocrat is underpinned by remarkably stable earnings and strong cash flow. 3M's five-year earnings stability factor is 2 on a scale of zero to 99, with zero being most stable.3M reported July 26 that Q2 profit rose 3% to $2.08 a share, just above Wall Street estimates. Sales were flat, ending a five-quarter streak of top-line shrinkage, as gains in the health care, consumer and safety/graphics segments offset declines in the electronics/energy and industrial units.Meanwhile, operating cash flow per share has risen for six straight years. Cash flow per share far exceeds earnings per share, an indication that the company is well-positioned to keep the dividend increases coming.IBD'S TAKE: Click here for a discussion of the importance of cash flow in determining a company's health and picking great stocks. The Investor's Corner columns also highlight other key fundamental metrics that you should know before buying any stock, including return on equity, earnings per share, profit margins and revenues.3M's latest dividend hike took effect in March, an increase of 8.5 cents, or 8%, to $1.11 per share. The long-term dividend growth rate is 17%.The annualized dividend yield of 2.5% at the current share price beats the S&P 500 average of about 2%.Profit this year is expected to rise 6% to $8.21 a share, followed by an 8% increase in 2017. That's roughly in line with the company's five-year earnings growth rate of 7%.""We view current CEO Inge Thulin as re-establishing a more balanced and attractive earnings growth strategy at 3M,"" UBS said in an Aug. 4 research report. It has a buy rating on the stock. Thulin, a long-time 3M executive, was named CEO in February 2012, succeeding George Buckley.

189,MMM,"The Dow Jones industrial average hit an all-time high at 18,622 on July 20. Which are the blue chip index's blue chip performers in 2016?The top five Dow stock winners this year are a diverse group: UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Caterpillar (CAT), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and 3M (MMM).Health care products and services giant Johnson & Johnson continues to rise after reporting its third straight quarter of earnings growth on July 19. Consensus is for earnings per share to climb 11% for the current quarter to $1.66, which would be an acceleration from the mild 2% increase in Q2. The New Brunswick, N.J.-based company is growing organically and via acquisitions, and on July 18 concluded its $3.3 billion cash purchase of Vogue International, a privately-held salon-influenced maker of hair-care and other personal products. Johnson & Johnson stock was up 22.1% in 2016 as of Monday. J&J fell 0.4% in the stock market today.Shares of the nation's largest managed health-care provider rose 1.3% after it reported outstanding earnings and revenue growth. Over the past year UnitedHealth grew to serve more than 2.1 million people in domestic medical benefits markets, including 320,000 more people added in the second quarter.UnitedHealth was relatively conservative about entering the ObamaCare exchange markets, and has said it will exit most of those states in 2017. Some of its peers have announced similar withdrawals.UnitedHealth was up 22% year-to-date as of Monday, falling just 0.2% Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: J&J and UnitedHealth are the top performers on the Dow this year, bulling ahead to a 22% gain so far. To see what other medical stocks are top performers this year go to the IBD Stock Checkup.Sales for the largest maker of mining and construction equipment were weak last year and into early 2016 amid low prices for metals, while Caterpillar continues to sell construction equipment to the slowly recovering housing industry. RBC Capital Markets raised its price target on Caterpillar on July 26 based on the success of its restructuring so far.Although its position seems to be improving, it's not out of the deep mine shaft yet. On Tuesday, July 26, Caterpillar reported a drop in Q2 EPS and revenue, as EPS beat estimates while revenue missed. Caterpillar shares rose 20.6% as of Monday, dipping 0.9% Tuesday.The world's biggest retailer continues to hold its own against upstarts like Amazon.com (AMZN), which is growing fast but still just a fourth of Wal-Mart's size in revenue. Wal-Mart is scrambling to add features to entice shoppers and on July 6 announced that Walmart Pay, its card swipe technology, is now available at all 4,600-plus Walmart superstores nationwide. Walmart Pay works with Apple (AAPL) iPhone or any Alphabet-owned (GOOGL) Google Android device. Wal-Mart stock has climbed 20.4% this year through Monday, but fell 0.9% Tuesday.The nation's largest tapes and adhesives maker, and a purveyor of medical supplies, office equipment, surveillance and communications devices and other products, like Caterpillar entered a buy zone last week and continues to trade there after it reported health care sales rose nearly 5% last quarter, leading it to beat estimates and raise guidance on July 26.However, shares fell after it said that electronics and energy sector sales plunged 9.1% for the quarter. 3M rose 18.4% this year through Monday, and rose 7 cents to 178.36 on Tuesday.
"
190,MMM,"Results were mixed for four big-cap Dow stocks reporting early Tuesday: United Technologies (UTX), 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT) and DuPont (DD). The slump in commodity prices, especially oil and gas, dragged on results.But shares of United Tech and Caterpillar ended the day in buy territory. The diversified maker of aircraft engines under its Pratt & Whitney business, Otis brand elevators, heating and security systems and other products reported 5.2% higher adjusted second-quarter earnings at $1.82 a share, crushing views for $1.68. Revenue fell 8.9% to $14.9 billion, topping estimates of $14.7 billion.United Technologies said it's on track to meet its growth goals out to 2020 and raised its third-quarter earnings outlook to $6.45-$6.60 a share, up from $6.30-$6.60. The midpoint is still a few cents below analyst consensus of $6.55.Shares rallied 3.1% to close at 107.89, above a 107.17 buy point in a flat base, in the stock market today.The nation's largest mining and equipment maker's second-quarter earnings fell 14% to $1.09 a share and revenue slid 16% to $10.34 billion as the company deals with slack orders amid sluggishness in the mining sector after a downturn last year. Wall Street expected 96 cents earnings and $10.12 billion revenue.Caterpillar Chief Executive Doug Olberman said in a written statement that, ""we're having success managing through the downturn in industries like mining and oil and gas, and in sluggish economic conditions in much of the developing world."" Caterpillar plans more job cuts and lowered its 2016 earnings forecast to $3.55 from $3.70 a share earlier, and its sales outlook to $40 billion-$40.5 billion, down from $40 billion-$42 billion previously.Shares jumped 5.2% to 82.75, topping an 80.99 buy point.The maker of tapes, adhesives, medical supplies and other products reported a 3% rise in earnings to $2.08 a share on a fractional decline in revenue to $7.662 billion. Analysts expected $2.07 earnings a share and $7.707 billion revenue. Sales at its health care division rose 4.9%, while consumer goods were up 2.7% and its safety and graphics products climbed 2.3%. Those were offset by a 1.4% drop in industrial output and a 9.1% plunge in its electronics and energy units.It was the sixth straight quarter of lower revenue for 3M and its full-year sales forecast of 0%-1% growth is below consensus. However, its stock has risen about 35% from a 2016 low of 134.65 on Jan. 20 on prospects of renewed growth.Shares of 3M slipped 1.1% to 177.66.IBD'S TAKE: DuPont formed a more than five month long cup-with-handle base and broke out early Tuesday, climbing above a 69.50 buy point. For other, higher rated diversified manufacturers, go to DuPont's IBD Stock Checkup here.The maker of products for the agricultural, food, building, communications and other industries is in the midst of merging with Dow Chemical (DOW), a pairing that would create a diversified manufacturer with roughly $73 billion annual sales. DuPont Chief Executive Ed Breen said in the earnings report that ""We are preparing to hit the ground running,"" if the merger receives regulatory approval, which could happen by the end of the year, he said.DuPont's second-quarter earnings climbed 5% to $1.24 a share, easily topping forecasts for $1.10. Revenue fell 18% to $7.061 billion, topping projections of $7.008 billion.DuPont stock rose 0.4% to 69.16, just under a 69.50 buy point of a long cup-with-handle base, often a prelude to a breakout. Dow Chemical edged up 0.5% to 53.54.
"
191,MMM,"It was a huge week for earnings. Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) all beat forecasts, while McDonald's (MCD) and Ford Motor (F) indicated some weakness in U.S. demand. Tech M&A stepped up, including a Verizon (VZ) deal to buy Yahoo's (YHOO) core assets. The U.S. economy is growing a lot slower than expected, and oil prices are nearing $40 a barrel.The Nasdaq composite rose 1.2% to its best levels since early December, fueled by strong earnings from Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon. The S&P 500 hitting a new record high Friday but closed the week down fractionally. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.7%, also snapping a four-week uptrend, as weaker oil prices and earnings reports hit the energy sector. The Federal Reserve's statement that the ""near-term economic risks"" have ""diminished"" seemed to have little impact on investors.The iPhone maker earned $1.42 a share, down 23% year over year, on sales of $42.4 billion, down 15%. It was Apple's second straight declines in earnings, revenue and iPhone sales -- but they were still better than expected. Apple's current-quarter revenue target is $46.5 billion at the midpoint, off 10% but above Wall Street consensus of $45.71 billion. The iPhone 7 is expected to be released in mid-September.Apple stock rose 5.6% for the week, just retaking its 200-day line.Amazon Q2 EPS of $1.78 shattered the estimate of $1.11. Revenue rose 30% to 30.4 billion. Amazon Web Services continued to boom. Revenue guidance for Q3 also was strong, though operating income may be light.Amazon stock rose 1.9% to 758.81 for the week, hitting a record 766 intraday Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is a Leaderboard stock, hitting new highs as growth booms. But it's only rated No. 4 in IBD's Retail-Internet group. To see who's No. 1, go to IBD Stock Checkup. Facebook reported Q2 revenue of $6.43 billion, up 59% and maintaining a streak of double-digit growth going back more than four years. EPS jumped 94% to 97 cents, shattering consensus for 82 cents. It was the fourth straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth. Facebook stock rose 2.4% to 123.94, hitting a record high and still within range of a 121.18 buy point.Twitter (TWTR) reported Q2 EPS that topped views. But revenue fell short, and Q3 revenue guidance also missed estimates. Twitter stock fell 9.4% but closed the week above its 50-day line.Bouncing back from a Q1 miss, Alphabet reported Q2 EPS and revenue that blew past expectations. The Google parent's earnings minus items rose 20% to $8.42 a share. Total revenue climbed 21% to $21.5 billion. Despite Google's size, it's still delivering growth, says Mark Mahaney, analyst at RBC Capital. ""This is now the 18th straight quarter of 20%-ish year-over-year revenue growth, and did we mention acceleration?"" he said in a report.Alphabet stock rose 4.2% to 791.34, closing just above a 791.05 entry point after rising as high as 803.94.Ford Motor sent a signal that the long auto industry bull market is over, as U.S. auto sales stall, and higher incentives hit profit margins. The No. 2 U.S. automaker's Q2 earnings per share and revenue rose, but EPS growth was weakest in five quarters, sales growth was the slimmest in three quarters, and Ford cited ""downside risk to global growth."" Offering further evidence of slowing, auto parts maker Lear (LEA) missed on sales and warned on 2016 revenue, while Gentherm (THRM) earnings missed. Volkswagen (VLKAY) Q2 sales edged up 1.7%, but its net profit plunged 57% vs. a year early as it struggled to recover from an emissions test cheating scandal involving diesel-engine models.Ford stock fell 8.5%.The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged after its two-day policy meeting, as expected. Policymakers said ""near-term economic risks ... have diminished,"" suggesting a baby step to raising rates, and some analysts said it opened the door, slightly, to a September rate increase. But after the Fed meeting and weak GDP data, investors pushed back their expectations for the next hike beyond the next 12 months.The U.S. economy rose at a 1.2% annual rate in Q2, less than half of what Wall Street expected, after Q1's downwardly revised 0.8% pace. Consumer spending was very strong, climbing 4.2%.But residential investment fell, even as separate reports show new- and existing-home sales hitting multiyear highs. Business investment contracted for a third straight quarter. With oil prices falling back toward $40 a barrel, corporate spending may remain weak going forward.U.S. crude oil futures tumbled 5.9% to $41.60 a barrel, hitting three-month lows as the crude tumbled 13.9% for July. U.S. crude and gasoline supplies rose again, according to the Energy Information Administration, which also reported higher U.S. production. The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a fifth straight week, suggesting further production gains. But a glut of gasoline and refined products, suggesting less refinery demand for crude ahead. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP) reported weaker-than-expected results.Mobileye (MBLY) reported Q2 EPS jumped 70% to 17 cents, while revenue grew 51% to $83.5 million. Both topped views. The maker of driver-assistance systems said that its relationship with Tesla Motors (TSLA) is ending. That news sent Mobileye down 8% on Tuesday, but the stock pared losses for the week to 3.4%. Tesla rose 5.6%.Boeing (BA) reported its first quarterly loss in years due to various charges, but it wasn't as deep as feared. Free cash flow was better than expected on big jet deliveries. Northrop Grumman (NOC) reported modest earnings and sales growth that topped views, but weaker tech services revenue hurt margins. Raytheon (RTN) beat views and raised profit guidance. General Dynamics (GD) topped on earnings and raised EPS guidance, but Q2 revenue missed.McDonald's earned $1.45 a share, beating analysts' expectations for $1.38. Total revenue fell 3.6% vs. a year earlier to $6.265 billion. Analysts had expected $6.27 billion. Global same-store sales, excluding currency effects, rose 3.1% vs. estimates for about 3.6%. U.S. same-store sales rose just 1.8%. Management said they were ""not immune"" to consumer unease -- be it over finances, the election or, in general, ""an unsettled world"" -- that may have hurt other restaurants during the quarter.Shares fell 8.3% to 117.60 for the week, tumbling through their 50-day and 200-day moving averages -- and a 124.18 buy point.Stifel Nicolaus downgraded a large number of restaurant stocks, while Jefferies predicted a U.S. recession would hit the sector. Top-rated Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which reports earnings in the coming week, fell 6% on Wednesday. But the steakhouse chain found support at its 50-day line and closed the week down 2.3%.United Technologies (UTX), maker of Pratt & Whitney brand aircraft engines, Otis elevators and other products, reported second-quarter earnings per share and revenue that beat estimates and raised its Q3 EPS estimate. Its stock hit a one-year high at 108.49, above a 107.07 buy point. Caterpillar's (CAT) Q2 EPS and revenue both fell as the mining and construction equipment giant deals with an energy and mining downturn. Its stock hit a roughly one-year high at 84.29, rising above an 80.89 entry point. Chemicals giant DuPont (DD), which is merging with Dow Chemical (DOW), crushed earnings estimates but was light on revenue. Shares rose to 69.87, the highest point since mid-December, triggering its 69.50 buy point. Meanwhile 3M (MMM), which makes tapes, adhesives, medical supplies and other products, also reported higher EPS and lower revenue, beating estimates on both. But its shares fell 1.1%.Analog Devices (ADI) agreed to buy Linear Technology (LLTC) in a cash-and-stock deal worth around $14.8 billion to create a microchip-industry giant. The deal is expected to close within the first half of 2017. Meanwhile, Oracle (ORCL) said it would buy cloud-services provider NetSuite (N) in a $9.3 billion deal. Oracle's Larry Ellison is the leading shareholder of NetSuite. Meanwhile, Citrix Systems (CTXS) will merge its Go To Meeting unit with LogMeIn (LOGM). Citrix was already planning to spin off Go To Meeting.Verizon Communications acquired struggling the core assets of Yahoo for nearly $6 billion, including $1.1 billion in stock compensation costs. ""Despite the massive execution challenges ahead, the Yahoo acquisition demonstrates that Verizon recognizes its own limitations as a consumer brand,"" said research firm The Diffusion Group. Verizon reported Q2 revenue that missed views and in-line EPS, and added fewer wireless postpaid phone subscribers than expected.T-Mobile US (TMUS) in Q2 added 646,000 postpaid phone subscribers, topping Sprint (S) at 173,000 and Verizon's 86,000. AT&T (T) lost 160,000 postpaid phone subscribers. T-Mobile's earnings fell 40% but still beat expectations. Revenue rose nearly 13% to $9.2 billion. ""TMUS revenue growth continues to significantly outpace peers,"" said Matthew Niknam, a Deutsche Bank analyst, in a report.Under Armour (UA) met top-line and bottom-line expectations when it reported per-share earnings of a penny, down 75% from the prior-year Q2, and 28% revenue growth to $1 billion. The Nike (NKE) rival announced several assertive plans, including its takeover of the FAO Schwarz space in Manhattan, as well as a partnership with Kohl's (KSS). But shares tumbled 7.9% for the week.Amgen (AMGN) beat and raised, but its stock slipped as its growth continued to be driven by price increases rather than volume. Celgene (CELG), meanwhile, jumped as only a third of its growth was price-driven, making up for a hit earlier in the week when its drug Revlimid failed a lymphoma trial. AbbVie (ABBV), Merck (MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) also rose on solid reports. AstraZeneca (AZN) was the biggest winner stock-wise when it jumped 9% Thursday on rumors that Swiss pharma Novartis (NVS) was thinking of acquiring it. The biggest loser was Gilead Sciences (GILD), which trimmed its guidance as its hepatitis C franchise continued to decline.Meanwhile, top-rated medical device companies Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and orthopedics giant Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) each hit new highs after beating estimates and raising guidance. Big Cap 20 stalwart Boston Scientific (BSX) hit a 10-year high after it reported its strongest quarter of sales growth in nearly a decade.
"
192,MMM,"United Technologies (UTX) stock has finally formed its first pattern of 2016, and it's been working through a flat base for going on two months.The question is: Can United Technologies move into a buy range where other large diversified manufacturers such as 3M (MMM), Honeywell (HON) and General Electric (GE) are currently positioned?United Technologies makes aircraft engines via its Pratt & Whitney unit, as well as Otis brand elevators, heating and security systems and other aerospace components and systems. Its stock took a drubbing early in the year but it's risen 25% since hitting a 2016 low at 83.39 on Jan. 20.It's following similar patterns by 3M, maker of various medical supplies and office supplies, and Honeywell, which makes automotive and aerospace systems. They both sank early this year in sync with the sharp early-2016 market pullback and then recovered. Shares of both recently climbed into record territory.General Electric, largest of the quartet with roughly $119 billion annual sales, hasn't slipped this year but continued its slow, steady climb as it transforms into what it calls a digital industrial company, rolling out its Predix Industrial internet operating system and industrial manufacturing software. Its stock, though, is still well below its all-time high.Mining equipment giant Caterpillar (CAT), with $43.8 billion annual sales, has moved into buy territory as well. Like United Technologies, Caterpillar is forming a first-stage flat base, and it has an 80.99 buy point. Its stock has risen on hopes that the long commodities price slump is nearing an end amid higher prices for crude oil and some metals.While 3M, Honeywell and GE are in buy range, United Technologies is working its way through that flat base. Shares were on track for a fifth straight higher close on Tuesday amid new contacts and announcements at the Farnborough Air Show in England. Just before the show, on July 8, Pratt & Whitney received a contract valued at $1.5 billion from the Department of Defense to manufacture F135 engines for all three variations of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter jet.IBD'S TAKE: United Technologies and a number of other big-name industrial stocks are in buy range, but many don't have high composite ratings from IBD. For a listing on the highest-rated stocks, try IBD's MarketSmith.However, on Monday Qatar Airways at the show said it was looking at buying 30 Boeing (BA) 737s in place of Europe's Airbus Group's (EADSY) A320neos. The carrier canceled delivery of one A320neo saying it found glitches in the Pratt & Whitney engines. Qatar Airways has been in talks with the CFM joint venture between GE and France's Safran S.A. to provide an alternative engine but no deal had been reached as of early Tuesday.United Technologies shares were up 0.5% at 104.50 in Tuesday afternoon trading on the stock market today. It was trading in the upper half of the first stage flat base, with a 107.17 buy point.GE rose 0.2%, Honeywell 0.4% and 3M 0.7% Tuesday.
"
193,MMM,"Stocks erased early gains to turn lower Tuesday morning as Dow component McDonald's (MCD) reported weak domestic sales, with investors looking ahead to Apple (AAPL) earnings due out after the close.The Nasdaq fell 0.2%, the S&P 500 0.3% and the Dow 0.5%. Volume was tracking higher than at the same time Monday on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq exchanges in the stock market today.Crude oil prices fell about 1% to $42.73 a barrel, continuing a recent slide. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) were testing support at their 50-day moving averages.McDonald's reported U.S. same-store growth below forecasts. The stock gapped down and was trading down 4.5% to 121.68. McDonald's had recently cleared a 124.18 buy point in a double-bottom base, but is now back below that entry area. The stock is also below its 50-day line.Fellow Dow stock Apple fell 0.5% to 96.88 intraday, back below its 50-day moving average. Apple has been a laggard. EPS is expected to fall 25% when it reports after the close today.IBD'S TAKE: Apple was once a dynamic market leader. Now, it underperforms. See the tale of the tape at IBD's Stock Checkup.Among six Dow components that reported early Tuesday, Caterpillar (CAT) rose nearly 2% after posting earnings of $1.09 a share compared to $1.27 a year earlier, but better than the consensus estimate of 96 cents.3M (MMM) beat and raised guidance and was down nearly 2%. United Technologies (UTX) rose 2% after reporting its results. DuPont (DD) gained less than 1% after its report as it broke out of a cup-with-handle base. And Verizon (VZ) fell nearly 2% on its own report.
"
194,MMM,"Major indexes traded mixed Tuesday, with the Dow taking a mild hit as investors digested blows to some blue chip stocks.SPDR S&P Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) gave up 0.1% on the stock market today. The ETF holds 30 industrial leaders.McDonald's (MCD), a top-10 holding, gapped down to lose nearly 5% after its second-quarter revenue missed, even as quarterly earnings topped analyst estimates. Same-store sales were also a weak spot.Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM), Dupont (DD), United Technologies (UTX) and Verizon (VZ) were among other stock holdings to disclose results early Tuesday. Apple (AAPL) jumped as much as 7% in after-hours trade following its quarterly report after the close.Top holding 3M stumbled after lowering its guidance for 2016 sales growth.Verizon, the nation's largest wireless carrier, saw its stock fall nearly 2% after missing revenue expectations. A seven-week workers' strike hurt results, according to the company.However, Caterpillar, the maker of earth-moving machinery, surged more than 5% after earnings beat on both the top and bottom lines.The SPDR Dow ETF is trading near all-time highs amid a post-Brexit stock market rally. DIA has jumped more than 6% in the month ended July 25.Meanwhile, a sharp fall for Mobileye (MBLY) Tuesday weighed on ETFs holding Israeli stocks. The maker of driver-assistance technology posted Q2 earnings that beat expectations and raised its full-year guidance, but the stock tumbled nearly 8% after the company announced that its partnership with Tesla Motors (TSLA) was ending.IShares MSCI Israel Capped (EIS) closed nearly 1% lower. The ETF holds 63 stocks and counts Mobileye as its third-largest holding, at 6.6% portfolio weighting.BlueStar TA-BIGITech Israel Technology (ITEQ) gave up 0.6%. Mobileye is its No. 1 holding, with a nearly 13% stake in the portfolio.The financial markets treaded water overall as the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day meeting kicked off. The Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates leashed for now, but investors await clues on the path of future hikes. The Bank of Japan's latest decision on monetary policy is expected Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF made a nice move higher in the past month. To find out how its price and volume action compares with other nonleveraged exchange traded funds, check out ETF Center.In commodity market action Tuesday, gold traded mildly higher, while U.S. crude oil prices settled below $43 a barrel after falling to their lowest level in months.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), a commodity ETF, rose 0.4% as the dollar eased ahead of the Fed meeting.

"
195,MMM,"Stocks gave back a chunk of the day's gains, despite news from the U.K. that suggested the status quo would prevail in Thursday's vote on whether to abandon the European Union.The Nasdaq nailed down a 0.8% gain after being up as much as 1.7%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively. Volume in the stock market today ran behind Friday's pace. However, Friday was a quadruple witching day, which often boosts volume.Although bookmaker William Hill now puts the odds of Britain remaining in the EU at 83%, other factors also could have been spurring the market higher. For example, going into Monday's action, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 had lost ground in six of the past seven sessions. No trend can head the same way day after day, so a gain was due. However, whether that represented a turnaround in the short-term trend or a mere pause wasn't clear. The negative reversals in the indexes suggested that more pain could be ahead.Blue chips were solidly up. Mega-cap 3M Company (MMM), the biggest weighting in the price-weighted Dow, advanced almost 1.5% in average turnover. Although 3M is up 14% so far this year, the stock has lost some institutional support. For example, Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) trimmed its position in each of the past four quarters for an overall reduction of 26%.In the IBD 50, a collection of the strongest stocks in fundamentals and chart characteristics, 44 stocks rose and 6 fell. In the IBD Big Cap 20, the best of the large-cap stocks, 19 advanced and only 1 fell. The loser was utility WEC Energy Group (WEC), which retreated mildly in soft volume.

196,MMM,"Big- and mega-cap stocks continued to rally broadly at lunchtime Tuesday, while utility stocks declined. With 8 of the 30 components rising at least 1%, the Dow Jones industrial average struck an all-time high.The Dow rose 0.7% after hitting an intraday high of 18,363.72, eclipsing the prior all-time peak of 18,351.36 set on May 19, 2015. The Dow, up more than 5% since Jan. 1, has now rallied 184% from its February 2009 low of 6469.89.Financial and commodity-related stocks helped lead the Dow. Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) each rallied more than 1%. Both stocks have been struggling to reassert their leadership amid stale top- and bottom-line results. In Goldman's case, Q2 profit is forecast to shrink 36% to $3.02 a share.JPMorgan, which issues results Thursday, is expected to see only a 7% EPS decline as it continues to benefit from strength in consumer-oriented lending. Research from S&P Global Market Intelligence notes that industrial companies within the S&P 500 are expected to grow profits in the second quarter by 6.5%, second only to the consumer discretionary sector (+9.4%).The Nasdaq composite rallied 0.7%, helped by tech giant Apple (AAPL), which rose 0.4%. The S&P 500 rose 0.8%, while the small-cap S&P 600 jumped 1.4%. The Dow utility average slipped nearly 1%, but it was still up more than 22% since Jan. 1.In terms of Tuesday's gains, DuPont de Nemours (DD) led the blue chips in the Dow, rising more than 3% to 66.26 and rebounding back above its 200-day moving average in heavy volume. The chemicals titan has been forming a long, deep base since peaking at 80.65 in March last year. While earnings are seen falling 6% in the second quarter, the consensus estimate has been revised higher.DuPont's 65 Relative Price Strength Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, reflects the stock's long sideways motion. Within the Dow, five components hold a healthy RS rank of 80 or higher, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Chevron (CVX), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and 3M (MMM).Among IBD 50 names in the stock market today, No. 1-ranked data center operator CoreSite Realty (COR) fell in heavy volume for a second straight session, down almost 1% to 87.29. But the stock still has a comfortable price cushion above its rising 50-day moving average.As seen in Monday's Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market is currently in a confirmed uptrend. This means an investor has a higher probability of making money when buying breakouts of high-quality growth stocks at proper buy points.Is your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

197,MMM,"Stock ETFs built on recent gains Tuesday as investors cheered a bounce in oil prices and more stimulus out of Japan to prod their plodding economy.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average set record highs. And in a sign of the broad strength of this equity rally, small-cap indexes are climbing to 2016 highs as they outperform their large-cap brethren.IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), the biggest small-cap ETF, jumped 1.3% on Tuesday to close at its best level since Dec. 1. IWM has advanced nearly 6% in the past five sessions -- roughly double the gains of SPDR S&P 500 (SPY).Tuesday's higher risk appetite weighed on safe haven assets such as gold and on defensive equity sectors such as consumer staples and utilities.Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) added 0.8% on the stock market today to set a 52-week high.According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, the tech sector is a growing presence in the dividend space. Technology companies have experienced growing balances of cash and investments, and they have been increasingly committing capital to dividends, the research firm's equity analysts noted. Robust free cash flow and attractive balance sheets could translate to rising dividends from tech hardware and semiconductor companies in particular.One-third of the S&P 500 tech stocks do not offer a steady dividend stream, dimming the overall sector's income appeal. However, the average yield on the 46 stocks that sport one is 2.4%, according to S&P Dow Jones indexes.Technology stocks tend to be relatively underweighted in dividend ETFs because those strategies focus on long-term dividend records or stocks with the highest dividend yields, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global.However, he added, some smaller names may boast higher tech exposure than the most well-known dividend funds, such as Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) or SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY).SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) fell Tuesday for a second straight session. The safe-haven asset tends to perform well when there is an uptick of fear in the stock markets.The ETF tracks the price of gold and is taking a hit after six consecutive weeks of gains.Stocks have rallied as a strong jobs report, coupled with subsiding Brexit fears, have boosted investor sentiment. And in Japan on Monday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ordered new stimulus after his coalition won an election by a landslide.Here's a look at how major exchange traded funds, tracking various asset classes, performed today, with Relative Price Strength (RS) ratings.The RS rating is a measure of their price performance over the last 12 months, compared to all stocks and ETFs in the IBD database, on a scale of 1 to a best-possible 99:SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), +0.7%, RS 61PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), +0.5%, RS 51SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), +0.7%, RS 58IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), +1.0%, RS 68IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), +1.3%, RS 61IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), +1.4%, RS 29Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), +1.5%, RS 51SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), -1.7%, RS 80United States Oil (USO), +5.1%, RS 21IShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG), -0.3%, RS 51PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish (UUP), -0.1%, RS 39IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (VXX), -2.2%, RS 3

198,MMM,"Shares of General Electric (GE) and other big U.S. industrials fell  Friday amid concerns about the strong dollar and the possible effect on trade from Britain's vote to leave the European Union.General Electric stock fell 4.3% to 29.82 in the stock market today, undercutting the 50-day moving average. Aircraft engine, elevators and heating and cooling systems maker United Technologies (UTX) slid 3.4% to 98.89.Aerospace and defense giant Boeing (BA) dropped 5.3%, and automotive and aerospace supplier Honeywell (HON) lost 3.7%. 3M (MMM), a leading provider of tapes, adhesives, medical items and office supplies among other products, was off 2.9%.Automakers were also slammed amid the market turmoil. General Motors (GM) slid 4.9, Ford Motor (F) was down 6.6%, Toyota Motor (TM) reversed 5.45% and Volkswagen (VLKAY) skidded 6.85% to 28.71.Both the euro and the pound plunged vs. the dollar, with the latter falling to a 30-year low after hitting a six-month high earlier Thursday, and the euro suffering its worst decline on record. Prior to the Brexit referendum, U.S. manufacturers were already grappling with the effects of a strong dollar, which makes their goods more expensive overseas. Many economists are predicting a U.K. recession, with Europe barely growing in the near term. General Electric early Thursday had for the first time provided details of its strategy to transform into a digital industrial company, and its plan to make its Predix industrial operating system the platform of choice for manufacturers around the globe.Chief Digital Officer Bill Ruh said at an investor event in Silicon Valley that he sees the company's digital business, including software and its Predix OS, generating about $7 billion in revenue this year and $15 billion by 2020. That's up from an earlier estimate of $10 billion.GE announced Thursday that Cerberus Capital is bidding for its French consumer finance business, GE Money Bank. Analysts said that bid could put GE in position to free itself of the designation of being a Systematically Important Financial Institution, or SIFI, which imposes stringent regulations.The confusion in global markets after Britain's vote to exit the EU could put that deal in less favorable light for Cerberus. GE's stock has been forming a first-stage flat base for about two months, and that base was still intact Friday, although its share price slid toward the bottom of that range Friday.

199,MMM,"3M (MMM) boosted profitability in four of its five business units as cost cuts helped the maker of Post-it notes and Scotch tape battle the U.S. dollar’s persistent strength.First-quarter operating income margin rose 1.3 percentage points from a year earlier to 24.1 percent, 3M said Tuesday in a statement. The gain helped the company increase net income even as sales declined 2.2 percent.3M has struggled to generate growth as currency headwinds and a sluggish global economy have weighed on an international business that accounts for about two-thirds of the company’s sales. Chief Executive Officer Inge Thulin overhauled operations last year, including plans for 1,500 job cuts, to reduce U.S. expenses and strengthen 3M’s operation in Europe and Latin America.“We continued to march forward with business transformation,” he said on a conference call with analysts. A focus on improving margins “remains a hallmark of 3M.”Earnings in the first quarter rose to $2.05 a share, the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company said. The results included a benefit of 10 cents a share, resulting from new tax guidance for employee stock-based payments. Analysts had projected $1.92 a share, based on the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.3M fell less than 0.5 percent to $167.64 at 10:03 a.m. in New York. The shares rose 12 percent this year through Monday, outpacing the 2.1 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.First-quarter sales were $7.4 billion, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $7.3 billion. Foreign currency translation reduced revenue by 3 percent.The sales decline was “not as bad as expected,” Steven Winoker, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said in a note. The Latin America and Canada region was the top geographic market, he said.Sales in the electronics and energy unit fell 14 percent. 3M said it will take restructuring actions in the business that will result in a $20 million charge in the second quarter. Revenue rose 4 percent in the health-care division and 2.9 percent in the safety and graphics business.The company said last month that it may spend more than $10 billion on acquisitions by 2020 to help spur growth. That would add to recent deals, including the purchase last year of Polypore International Inc.’s separations-media business for $1 billion and of a safety-equipment maker for about $2.5 billion.Profit in 2016 will be $8.10 to $8.45 a share, 3M said, reaffirming an earlier forecast.  Organic local-currency sales will climb 1 percent to 3 percent.Image provided by Shutterstock.

200,MMM,"Just because you're getting a healthy dividend, that doesn't mean you can't also look for a healthy base too.

201,MMM,"The stock market opened slightly higher Tuesday as earnings reports and a smaller-than-forecast rise in March durable goods orders filtered through early trade.The S&P 500 added 0.4%. The Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq picked up 0.3% each.The stock market today is likely to be a bit edgy, awaiting Apple's (AAPL) fiscal second-quarter results and news from the Federal Open Market Committee's two-day confab, which swings into motion in Washington, D.C., this morning.

"
202,MMM,"Stocks struggled a bit and moved lower yesterday - while remaining in the range that I pointed out in yesterday's note....2080/2100 - Late morning we tested the 2080 level before finding some support and rally into the closing bell.... Trading was light as investors/traders appeared unwilling to commit to the market ahead of the onslaught of earnings today - think Apple (AAPL),  Facebook (FB),  Procter & Gamble (PG), EXXON Mobil (XOM), BAXTER (BAX), 3M (MMM), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), Corning (GLW), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Eli Lilly (LLY) (Revenues beat, but EPS missed by 0.02 cts) & Whirlpool (WHR) (missed on the top line - revenues - and missed on the bottom line. reported $2.63 vs. exp of $2.68) that are all announcing today and ahead of tomorrow's FOMC announcement.Remember - today begins the two day FED meeting and there is a lot of anticipation and paralysis about what they will say tomorrow. Again - the mkt does not expect a change in rates at all...but it does expect some clarification in terminology concerning June and the next expected hike......Recall that the last hike in December, sent the mkts into a tailspin.....causing the FED to become a bit more 'dovish' as she searched for a reason to calm the mkts.....this time citing unstable global mkts as the culprit...but since then - the mkts have come roaring back - with the S&P now up 2.1% and the Dow up 3.74% - off of what looked like a disastrous year.....As a result of the strength - expect Janet to intimate a return to a path to higher rates......not necessarily faster, just a bit higher.....Expect every word to be parsed and every sentence to be deconstructed as everyone looks for the next 'clue'.Now why the low volumes? Well there are a number of reasons really - never mind the current regulatory environment, and the abuse suffered by so many managers during the 1Q - but yesterday - there was no 'news', right? No eco reports, no significant earnings, no speeches, no big international events, no nothing.....so why do anything? The mkt held in tight - giving no reason to deviate from the plan.....and so the only ones really playing yesterday were the HFT guys and - and asset managers that were tweaking core positions....but tweaking does not mean a change of investment strategy at all...it just means tweaking.....Now oil did come under a bit of pressure yesterday - falling by 2.4% to end the day at $$42.64- but all that tells me is that the recent run up in oil was a bit premature given the current glut and lack of a deal between the OPEC nations etc. So if oil trades within the current band - $39.50/$44 - it's all good.....Why should it break down or surge higher just yet? This morning we see oil up small as the dollar appears a bit weaker......(think no rate hike). Remember - we will get the weekly API (American Petroleum Institute) report this afternoon.Now yesterday we did get a broad measure of the housing mkt.....- but again - these stats are no longer the mkt moving events that they were......although - that could change...you see - yesterday was NEW HOME SALES....and typically this is good barometer of the state of the broader US economy...and guess what? Another disappointment.....New Home Sales FELL 1.5% vs. the exp of a rise of 1.6%.......and why should we be a bit concerned?Well - This is the time of the year when new home sales should be strong....so is this disappointment just another barometer of a weakening economic picture? What is really mind boggling is that we are now a decade into the housing collapse....a decade - that is 10 yrs of an incomplete recovery...as pockets of single family housing continue to stall..... New Home Sales on a total unit basis came in at 511k units - significantly below the 50 yr average of more than 650,000 units. During the Greenspan era - Subprime loans/mortgages propelled sales of New Homes into the stratosphere - sending them as high as 1.28 million units in 2005, - the yr before the beginning of the crash.......a crash created by the adjustable rate mortgages that managed to destroy so many people - triggering waves of foreclosures that then ignited the Great Financial Crisis of 2007 - 2010 (some say the crisis is still ongoing.....I'll leave that up to you...).US futures are up 2 pts in early trading...as the mkt gets ready to react to the slew of those earnings reports noted above. Whirlpool - which we noted missed the numbers is quoted down about $10 bucks in pre-mkt trading....quoted NOT trading just yet....so let's see what investors/traders think about that.....Today is also a big economic day...lots of macro data to consider....Durable Goods exp of +1.9%, ex trans of 0.5%, Cap Good Orders of +0.6%, Cap Goods Shipped of +0.9%, Markit US PMI of 52 and the Richmond Fed Survey of 12. The earnings will all be happening prior to the open while the macro data begins at 8:30 and goes until 10 am. This will create a lot of noise in early trading...but once it settles in after 11 am....then expect the discussion to revolve around the FED once analysts consider the implications of whatever today's macro data reveals.Again - I expect the broader mkt to hold tight within the 2080/2100 range until tomorrow. (Think FED paralysis). Individual names today will get rewarded or punished depending on what they reported and what they say about the future....All in a day's work.....Take Good Care

Portland, Ore., Seattle and San Francisco logged the biggest increases.  The gain was in line with economists consensus projections.Consumer outlooks improved in March, lifting the Conference Board's Consumer Sentiment Index to 96.2, a big jump above February's 92.2 reading and easily clearing consensus views for 94.Oil prices continued lower, dropping 3% and putting West Texas Intermediate just above $38 a barrel.  Oil and energy related stocks packed into the low end of the S&P 500.Boeing (BA) dropped nearly 2%, the worst slip among Dow stocks.

207,MMM,"Gigamon is becoming a contender in the battle against cyber crime, as its portfolio of hacker-fighting products has lifted its financial performance and revved up investor enthusiasm.After posting losses and struggling for two straight quarters in the first half of 2014 with sales execution issues, Gigamon (GIMO) has come back strong amid growing momentum in the cybersecurity arena.It's beaten earnings forecasts six quarters in a row and enjoyed double-digit earnings growth the past five quarters. After a strong performance in 2015, Gigamon is expected to keep up its winning streak.Investors have been impressed. Gigamon's stock has soared 41% since it posted fourth-quarter results Jan. 28 with double-digit sales and profit gains that topped views and gave solid first-quarter 2016 guidance.""Investors saw a very strong December quarter come in significantly over consensus on both the top and bottom line,"" D.A. Davidson & Co. analyst Mark Kelleher told IBD.Gigamon helped its cause with last July's introduction of GigaSecure, which it claims is the industry's first security delivery platform. GigaSecure sales have been strong and are expected to stay that way as adoption rates increase, industry watchers say.Gigamon's good fortune comes as its business related to cybersecurity is heating up at a time when it has become such a high priority, says Kelleher.""The security market is an important driver to Gigamon’s growth,"" he said.Gigamon's products provide visibility and control of traffic across networks in an effort to enhance security. Gigamon's ""Visibility Fabric"" architecture and GigaSecure are two of the products touting advanced intelligence so that network security measures operate more efficiently and effectively.In the fourth quarter, nearly 50% of Gigamon's total business was related to security deployments, Chief Executive Paul Hooper said in a prepared statement. For all of 2015, more than 45% of Gigamon's sales were related to security in one form or another, compared with 36% in 2014, he said on the fourth-quarter conference call.In looking at the company's pipeline for 2016, the number of opportunities directly associated with security products is ""fast approaching"" 60%, he added.Said analyst Kelleher: ""Gigamon’s network visibility products watch what is going on in the network and pass along what they see to other tools (security for example) that need information to complete their task.""In addition to security, its products also monitor the network for other applications, such as network diagnostics, Kelleher says.But Hooper is optimistic about the company's role in combating security threats, describing Gigamon as ""an enterprise security company.""That's where GigaSecure comes in. GigaSecure is tailored toward providing information to cybersecurity application providers such as FireEye (FEYE).""The security portion of their portfolio has become increasingly important to the mix, most notably GigaSecure,"" Needham & Co. analyst Alex Henderson told IBD. ""GigaSecure has been phenomenally successful.""He cites the fact that in the third quarter -- the first quarter of the GigaSecure launch -- 25% of new customers purchased the GigaSecure package. He says deal sizes were twice the corporate average, and gross margins were about 9 to 10 basis points above the mean.""That's pretty impressive,"" Henderson said.In the fourth quarter, GigaSecure accounted for 35% of new customer sales. On top of that, deal sizes were four times the average for new customers.Henderson says Gigamon's pipeline of security orders coming into the first quarter suggests the percentage of customers buying GigaSecure continue to go up.The GigaSecure platform combines ""purpose-built"" hardware with custom software. GigaSecure makes security infrastructures more effective at identifying and reducing threats inside networks, the company says.It does so by providing users with ""pervasive visibility"" of network traffic, users, applications and suspicious activity, according to the company's website. It also delivers information to multiple security devices simultaneously without impacting network availability.The company says it also helps third-party security appliances, such as firewalls, become more effective at protection. Thus, the cost and complexity of security infrastructure is reduced.Gigamon has seen marked gains on the financial front. In the fourth quarter, earnings soared 61% from a year earlier to 29 cents a share. That followed a 450% rise the prior quarter. Revenue climbed 31% to $67 million, the fifth straight quarter of double-digit sales growth. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings to increase 24% in 2016, followed by the same percentage jump in 2017.Gigamon's product portfolio has several key components, including a distributed set of physical and virtual Visibility Fabric nodes that collect and move traffic. So-called GigaSmart software applications also provide traffic intelligence and a Visibility Fabric management software layer called GigaVue-FM.GigaSmart software can perform a number of functions to provide the security applications with useful information, says Kelleher. One such function is ""decryption"" of data, he adds.Gigamon has multiple security vendors in its so-called ""Ecosystem Partner Program"" to combat cybersecurity threats.The company doesn't displace or compete with security tool vendors, Hooper said on the conference call. Rather, Gigamon ""increases the relevancy"" of the information they receive, he said. Gigamon has 60 companies in this partnership program, including Cisco Systems (CSCO), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and FireEye.In fiscal 2015, it had more than 1,900 customers, up from approximately 1,600 customers in fiscal 2014.Its customers include giants such as eBay (EBAY), Intel (INTC), 3M (MMM), big banks, telecoms and retailers. It also serves government agencies.Kelleher expects Gigamon to keep up its strong momentum as it continues to ""innovate and add more functionality"" to its products.""I expect the company to continue to put up some very strong year-over-year growth rates,"" he said.

278,MMM,"The October jobs report is due out Friday morning at 8:30 a.m. ET. And it's even more important than usual, with a Fed rate hike hanging in the balance. Here are three key things to look for.1. Will Fed Get A Go Signal?Hiring abruptly stalled in the last two months, with nonfarm payrolls up just 142,000 in September and a downwardly revised 136,000 in August. Private hiring had the worst back-to-back gain in three years. The Federal Reserve is signaling a December rate hike, and markets are starting to believe it. But if hiring remains sluggish, it will be hard for policymakers to pull the trigger.Wall Street is predicting a rise of 190,000 nonfarm jobs in October. Economists also may be expecting an upward revision to September.2. How Hard Hit Is Manufacturing?Manufacturing lost 9,000 jobs in September after falling by 18,000 in August. Manufacturers are exposed to overseas economic woes, a strong dollar and weak energy prices. Mining and construction equipment giant Caterpillar (CAT), oil services giant Schlumberger (SLB), 3M (MMM) and heavy truck engine maker Cummins (CMI) have all announced layoff plans in the last several months.Manufacturing output is still growing, modestly. But with manufacturing productivity ramping up, that may not be enough to maintain factory employment. If factories continue to shed high-paying blue-collar jobs, can services and construction activity offset that?3. Will Weekly Earnings Remain Weak?When economists discuss wages in the jobs report, they usually focus on average hourly wages.September hourly wages actually fell by 1 cent vs. August. But the year-over-year gain remained 2.2%, which is more or less where it's been for years.But workers are paid by the hourly wage, but by how many hours they work. The work week fell in September to 34.5 hours. So weekly earnings rose by 2.2% vs. a year earlier vs. 2.8% in January. (Weekly wages among nonsupervisory employees rose just 1.6%, down from a recent peak of 3% in July 2014.)The good news is the inflation-adjusted wage gains remain solid, because price gains have been nonexistent. But starting in December and January, real wage gains will quickly fade as easy oil and gas comparisons end. So nominal weekly pay will become more pressing.Economists are counting on October hourly earnings to rise by 0.2%, with the workweek unchanged at 34.5 hours.

301,MMM,"Stocks rallied hard yesterday - sending the S&P up 1.8% just enough to nearly 'kiss' it's 200 dma at 2060...... .....ignited by commentary supplied by none other than Santa Claus - otherwise known as the European Central Bank (ECB) President Uncle Mario (Draghi). Yesterday morning - Draghi 'hinted' (wink, wink) that he was prepared once again to 'do more to boost…
"
302,MMM,"Little Lies.....Fleetwood Mac - Tango in the Night - 1987 ""If I could turn the page, In time then I'd rearrange just a day or two, I couldn't find a way, So I'll settle for one day to believe in you........Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies...Oh no, no, you can't disguise....""
"
303,MMM,"And so - let the confessions begin - or not......Yesterday - Citron Research - a firm that publishes negative research and actively makes bets against companies - made some very high-profile allegations against Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) using phrases like - ""web of deception"", ""Fraud"", calling it the ENRON of the pharmaceutical industry.....Now for those of us who actually remember the ENRON scandal - that was not good.... and or those of you who do not - let me outline it....
"
304,MMM,"At the height of its 'season' Enron was an energy, commodity and pulp and paper services company based in Houston, TX. Ticker symbol on the NYSE was ENE and it was one of the most actively traded stocks at the time.....Everyone wanted to be 'in' ENRON.....there was always a big crowd, big trades, lots of action.....Just the name caused your blood to pump and your brow to sweat.........and it was right outside of my booth... ..so the energy and excitement was never far away...... It was a company that claimed to have $100 bil. in revenues in 2000 and for 6 consecutive years was named one of ""America's Most Innovative Companies"" by Fortune magazine..... and then in December 2001 - they filed for bankruptcy and it all went POOF!
"
305,MMM,"Rumors had been building for weeks, questions raised, stories written....but remember - there was NO Internet, no Facebook, no Twitter.....so the news moved a bit slower....but it moved just the same....and then it was revealed...that all of that money and supposed financial condition......was nothing but a fraud.......I will never forget the action on the floor of the NYSE at the time - the stock crashed, dozens of brokers, vying for position, the roar of the market at work....the energy, the excitement, the tension, it was a broker's dream......it was the very definition of the functionality of the exchange....it was the very core, the heart and soul of capitalism........ and so today when something or someone is ENRON-like - it is accusing them of fraudulent and corruptive behavior....It is essentially a death knell......
"
306,MMM,"At about 10:13 am yesterday - the headline hit Twitter - Citron Research was calling 'VRX the pharmaceutical ENRON ' and the rest is history.....The stock crashed - Now the stock fell 30% in 30 mins......only to rally and then fall another 18% by 1:30.....Then Bill Ackman (large shareholder) comes out and announces that he was buying 2 mil more shares....and the company defends itself saying that the report is 'erroneous full of false and misleading statements'......""We categorically deny the allegations"".....Oh boy.....Now it's gonna get interesting..... The stock closed last night at $118.61 (down 28% on the day) and this morning in the pre-market , the stock is trading at $117...this is a story that is far from over.....so sit down and pay attention.....One day there will be a book written about this....
"
307,MMM,"So - that was all the excitement yesterday - pharma and healthcare - and that managed to cast a pall over the broader market...... The decline added to the market's losses from Tuesday and came on top of crude oil price weakness and investors focusing on the latest wave of companies reporting quarterly financial results. The lower close reflected ongoing concerns about corporate earnings and the outlook for the global economy. Now yes BA, and UTX did help to push industrial names higher but the broader market suffered under the negative tone created by the action in VRX and a buildup in oil reserves.......
"
308,MMM,"A DOE (Dept. of Energy) report showed an 8.0 mil barrel inventory build in crude oil, which is the highest weekly inventory build since April 3rd and dramatically higher than what was expected - this caused oil prices to fall $1.09 closing at $45.20. We are still holding within the range ($43/$50), but are now worried if the intermediate-term is looking more and more challenging as supplies continue to build. This morning - oil is trading up a bit - so the churn remains.
"
309,MMM,"As we have noted this is the one to keep your eyes on...a breach below $43 a barrel will bring more selling in the market despite all of the chatter that the Fed governors might say.
"
310,MMM,"Weak earnings continue to pressure stocks....and because earnings expectations have been lowered, when a company beats its expectations it doesn't necessary mean we're expanding - it just means that they beat lowered estimates - just like when you buy or sell a stock in pico seconds - it does NOT mean you did a good job...it just means you did it fast....
"
311,MMM,"So now 3rd quarter earnings for the S&P are coming in slightly better than expected....analysts are now calling for a 4.8% decline in profits - better than the original 7% decline they had prepared us for - this because 70% have beaten the estimate while only 40% are beating the top line.....(disconnect) .....Now 9 of the 10 sectors in the S&P 500 moved lower yesterday. Energy stocks fell the most on the back of weaker oil, industrials the only sector to rise thanks to BA and UTX......
"
312,MMM,"More earnings to come today.. MCD, CAT, and MMM all report prior to the open.....some have already reported and they have been positive.....SWK, Alaska Air, LLY, LUV, DOW, AEP, RTN, UA.. - all showing bottom line beats....and pre-market trading has most of these names moving higher.... After the bell look for Alphabet (Goog), AMZN, MSFT and T..... Eco data today includes - Inti Jobless Claims of 265k, Cont Claims of 2.18 mil, Existing Home Sales of 5.39 mil, and M/M of +1.5% - Kansas City Fed to show lower activity at -9.....
"
313,MMM,"European markets are all slightly higher as they await the ECB rate news....No one expects that Draghi will change rates but will in fact leave the door open to further easing..... Will they increase their current 1 tril Euro QE program? My guess is - not yet......FTSE flat, CAC 40 + 0.14%, DAX + 0.37%, EUROSTOXX + 0.33%, SPAIN +0.36% and ITALY flat.
"
314,MMM,"US futures are up 7 pts at 2015...I suspect that with oil a bit higher and the dollar flat - as long as we get better earnings the market will hold steady here....Resistance still holds at 2035.....with short term support right here at 2015.....if that does not hold - then look for 1980 to be the next real support level.

Total net sales fell 20% to $7.59 billion. Equipment sales were down…
"
331,MMM,"This morning U.S. futures are surging - currently up 11 points in early trading as stocks used long-term support as a springboard to move ahead.... ......This after a bit of downer yesterday...when talk of impending doom caused markets to stumble......
"
332,MMM,"Yesterday morning as the sun was rising over the Atlantic - European markets were in decline reacting to the beating that Asian stocks took on Monday - all Asian markets had been under assault...... Japan -1.2%, Hang Seng -3+% and according to every news source out there - China was in freefall - plunging by 8+% even the gov't could not control their market - and we know how hard they are trying. I mean look - Monday night the gov't announced that they (the gov't) would increase the purchases of stocks to try and keep the market 'artificially elevated' (my words not theirs!- but that is what they are trying to do.) This morning - Chinese authorities announced that they are investigating whether 'share dumping' was behind Monday's disaster - Oh boy.....you know what that means....
"
333,MMM,"And so U.S. stocks took it on the chin yesterday......The media was quick to blame the overnight action in China - I emphatically disagree. Most Americans are not affected by the plunge in the Chinese stock market - not at all - yet the negative tone did give traders a reason to take money off the table.....….American investors might be affected by a slowdown in the Chinese economy (temporary) - but those are two very different things…what is happening in their market is completely disconnected to what their economy may or may not be doing….. The market got way ahead of itself - thanks to central bank and regulatory policy.
"
334,MMM,"In the last 12 months - The Shanghai Composite is up 140%...and since January 1st - that market is up 60% - all on what? Artificially created growth -all at a time when most analysts never believed the data coming out of China - yet bought the story......Asian investors flocked to China - Alibaba (BABA) - the massive Chinese 'Amazon' that many viewed to be a proxy for investing in China- came listed to the NYSE - China was now 'on the board'........
"
335,MMM,"They 'opened' their market to retail investors - sucking in the 'average Zhang Wei' (Chinese equivalent for the Average Joe) ..... seeing it as the next 'gold rush'.....and when the music stopped - everyone tried to run for the door causing the market to implode..........And then - The Chinese gov't - in an attempt to stop the bleed - halts trading, imposes regulatory limits, threatens caning and beatings to anyone caught selling and you ask - ""why is the Chinese stock market acting this way?"" Listen to yourself? You know the answer.....Buyer beware .
"
336,MMM,"And while all the 'he-man' talk from China about how they are prepared to buy stocks to stabilize their market many doubt whether any of this intervention can really stop the bleed.....the recent action in China has caused fear among some of the investing community about the broader health of the Chinese economy, and so we see commodities getting slammed as well......slammed so hard that you would think the end of the world was coming....that my friends is not the case...and as usual - the pendulum has probably begun to swing too far to the left........Capisce?
"
337,MMM,"Ok...back home - U.S. stocks have been a bit psychotic lately - reacting with a heavy heart as we moved through the Greek tragedy and now have to deal with the 'China Syndrome'...testing the will of investors as the market backed off to test long term support at the 200 day moving average. Last Friday the broader S&P 500 gave back 1%... (and a total of 3% for the week) .......China, commodities, earnings and rate increases were all the rage…..valuations peaking out at near 18x for 2015 - leaving the market nowhere to go but down - I mean how could we justify paying up for stocks in 'this environment'? - Yet 2 weeks ago - investors and traders were climbing over each other to put money to work.
"
338,MMM,"Last week - some of the Dow's biggest names disappointed - Caterpillar (CAT) (all about China - or so they want us to believe that), IBM (IBM), 3m (MMM), causing broader concern for investors - and in the 'hot' biotech space (Spider S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) +34% year to date) - Biogen (BIIB) - took it on the chin giving the bears something to scream about - (but look - Biogen does not represent the U.S. economy - not by a long shot) so it is difficult to connect trader reaction to the broader U.S. economy.....….Yet the negative tone did weigh on the markets and all sectors appeared weak -with semi's, basic materials, energy and industrials all showing the greatest signs of exhaustion. This is most evident in the Dow - which has now broken all support levels - now testing the lows of late Dec/early January - returning -2% ytd.
"
339,MMM,"Earnings continue to be the focus as we have about 150 more names that will report this week - Key for today - Ford (F), United Parcel Service (UPS) and Twitter (TWTR). On the economic calendar we will get - a host of Case Shiller Home reports (yawn), Markit U.S. Services PMI - expectations of 55, consumer confidence of 100 and the Richmond Fed Survey of 7.
"
340,MMM,"Tomorrow brings the FOMC rate decision....now hold onto your hats - rates are not going anywhere just yet......but any hawkish fed speak will raise the odds of a September move....(Now I still believe it will be later) Expect to hear Yellen express some concern about the Chinese 'situation' and how further instability in that market could cause an economic slowdown in the global economy. The ongoing rout in the commodity space will also cause the Fed to pause and take a breath before charging ahead.
"
341,MMM,"Wednesday will bring us 2Q GDP - estimates call for a 2.5% annualized rate - a weaker report will be cause for caution - but I don't think that is what we will hear at all.
"
342,MMM,"Like I said - U.S. futures are up 11 points - which will put the S&P 500 right back in resistance range (2080/2085ish) as the market continues to toy with both support and resistance in the same day.....Watch for the tone of earnings today and the speculation about what the Fed will say. The market IS expecting rates to rise this year - so that is not the issue - the issue will be more about the tone of her remarks - what does it say about future rises and the pace of those rises.....that will be the catalyst for markets.
"
343,MMM,"In Europe - markets are bucking the Asian trend and all moving higher. Yes - investors are watching the ongoing drama in China - but now seem to be putting all of that on the back burner - at least for today. The focus is on earnings and U.S. fed policy..... UK GDP came in at +0.7% - meeting the expectation - so no surprise there. FTSE +0.8%, CAC 40 +1.21%, DAX +1.43%, EUROSTOXX +1.35%, SPAIN +1.06% AND ITALY +1.73%
"
344,MMM,"Overnight in Asia - markets there ended the day a bit lower...China did sell off 5% before rebounding to end the day -1.6%, Japan -0.10%, Hong Kong +0.62% and ASX -0.09%. Commodities continue to be the story there as any China slowdown will negatively impact commodities.....Don't know about you, but I think that has already happened right? The Thomson Commodity index is off 13% from the May highs (and is off 37% from the June 2014 highs) as investors fled that market.....We have now broken the lows of March in what feels like capitulation.....and capitulation creates opportunity - I'm just sayin.....

Japan -1.2%, Hang Seng -3+% and according to every news source out there - China was in freefall - plunging by 8+% even the gov't could not control their market - and we know how hard they are trying. I mean look - Monday night the gov't announced that they (the gov't) would increase the purchases of stocks to try and keep the market 'artificially elevated' (my words not theirs!- but that is what they are trying to do.) This morning - Chinese authorities announced that they are investigating whether 'share dumping' was behind Monday's disaster - Oh boy.....you know what that means....And so U.S. stocks took it on the chin yesterday......The media was quick to blame the overnight action in China - I emphatically disagree. Most Americans are not affected by the plunge in the Chinese stock market - not at all - yet the negative tone did give traders a reason to take money off the table.....….American investors might be affected by a slowdown in the Chinese economy (temporary) - but those are two very different things…what is happening in their market is completely disconnected to what their economy may or may not be doing….. The market got way ahead of itself - thanks to central bank and regulatory policy.In the last 12 months - The Shanghai Composite is up 140%...and since January 1st - that market is up 60% - all on what? Artificially created growth -all at a time when most analysts never believed the data coming out of China - yet bought the story......Asian investors flocked to China - Alibaba (BABA) - the massive Chinese 'Amazon' that many viewed to be a proxy for investing in China- came listed to the NYSE - China was now 'on the board'........They 'opened' their market to retail investors - sucking in the 'average Zhang Wei' (Chinese equivalent for the Average Joe) ..... seeing it as the next 'gold rush'.....and when the music stopped - everyone tried to run for the door causing the market to implode..........And then - The Chinese gov't - in an attempt to stop the bleed - halts trading, imposes regulatory limits, threatens caning and beatings to anyone caught selling and you ask - ""why is the Chinese stock market acting this way?"" Listen to yourself? You know the answer.....Buyer beware .And while all the 'he-man' talk from China about how they are prepared to buy stocks to stabilize their market many doubt whether any of this intervention can really stop the bleed.....the recent action in China has caused fear among some of the investing community about the broader health of the Chinese economy, and so we see commodities getting slammed as well......slammed so hard that you would think the end of the world was coming....that my friends is not the case...and as usual - the pendulum has probably begun to swing too far to the left........Capisce?Ok...back home - U.S. stocks have been a bit psychotic lately - reacting with a heavy heart as we moved through the Greek tragedy and now have to deal with the 'China Syndrome'...testing the will of investors as the market backed off to test long term support at the 200 day moving average. Last Friday the broader S&P 500 gave back 1%... (and a total of 3% for the week) .......China, commodities, earnings and rate increases were all the rage…..valuations peaking out at near 18x for 2015 - leaving the market nowhere to go but down - I mean how could we justify paying up for stocks in 'this environment'? - Yet 2 weeks ago - investors and traders were climbing over each other to put money to work.Last week - some of the Dow's biggest names disappointed - Caterpillar (CAT) (all about China - or so they want us to believe that), IBM (IBM), 3m (MMM), causing broader concern for investors - and in the 'hot' biotech space (Spider S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) +34% year to date) - Biogen (BIIB) - took it on the chin giving the bears something to scream about - (but look - Biogen does not represent the U.S. economy - not by a long shot) so it is difficult to connect trader reaction to the broader U.S. economy.....….Yet the negative tone did weigh on the markets and all sectors appeared weak -with semi's, basic materials, energy and industrials all showing the greatest signs of exhaustion. This is most evident in the Dow - which has now broken all support levels - now testing the lows of late Dec/early January - returning -2% ytd.Earnings continue to be the focus as we have about 150 more names that will report this week - Key for today - Ford (F), United Parcel Service (UPS) and Twitter (TWTR). On the economic calendar we will get - a host of Case Shiller Home reports (yawn), Markit U.S. Services PMI - expectations of 55, consumer confidence of 100 and the Richmond Fed Survey of 7.Tomorrow brings the FOMC rate decision....now hold onto your hats - rates are not going anywhere just yet......but any hawkish fed speak will raise the odds of a September move....(Now I still believe it will be later) Expect to hear Yellen express some concern about the Chinese 'situation' and how further instability in that market could cause an economic slowdown in the global economy. The ongoing rout in the commodity space will also cause the Fed to pause and take a breath before charging ahead.Wednesday will bring us 2Q GDP - estimates call for a 2.5% annualized rate - a weaker report will be cause for caution - but I don't think that is what we will hear at all.Like I said - U.S. futures are up 11 points - which will put the S&P 500 right back in resistance range (2080/2085ish) as the market continues to toy with both support and resistance in the same day.....Watch for the tone of earnings today and the speculation about what the Fed will say.

"
349,MMM,"Citing ""severe weakness"" in mining, lower oil prices and sluggish sales in China and Brazil, Caterpillar (CAT) reported subpar revenue in the second quarter — a fate that also befell 3M (MMM) and Dow Chemical (DOW) as they reported Q2 earnings on Thursday. Excluding items, the Peoria, Ill.-based Caterpillar earned $1.27 a share in Q2, down 24.9% from a year…
"
350,MMM,"3M (MMM) said it has agreed to acquire fall-protection company Capital Safety from KKR for $2.5 billion, including $700 million in debt, boosting its safety-equipment segment. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter and will be funded with existing cash. It sees the acquisition weighing on earnings by 4 cents in the first year after the transaction…
"
351,MMM,"Stocks continued the selling yesterday - even in the face of so many earnings beats that we heard throughout the morning and the day….commodities also continued to come under pressure and now seem to be in a clear 'sell at any price' mode……this mindset is what is causing equities to come under pressure as traders and investors look to raise cash from other assets - and since equities are closer to teasing the highs - it makes some sense to raise cash here.
"
352,MMM,"The Dow broke its long term support (200 day moving average) But remember - the Dow - represents 30 of the most liquid, largely capitalized companies in the country and is a clear source of cash for nervous investors as well as nervous portfolio managers -thus the pressure. You should also remember that earnings from American Express (AXP), 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT) - all Dow stocks - each reported 'weaker' earnings yesterday along with mixed guidance - causing an exodus in those names putting pressure on the Dow.
"
353,MMM,"The S&P 500, a much broader representation of the economy and the country and still only slightly off its all time highs - had a number of stocks in this index report 'better than expected' earnings helping that index to offset the negatives from the 3 big boys. Keep in mind - this is NOT a rout in equities - by any stretch of the imagination...(commodities -well that's a different story) The S&P 500 is only off 1.3% from the highs... Yes individual names get punished or rewarded depending on the results and guidance but overall - the U.S. economy is moving forward.
"
354,MMM,"Now this morning, commodities continue to be sold with abandon.....most of the metals and agriculture names are not feeling the love......Oil on the other hand is trading slightly higher but remember it is down 20% just from the late June highs of $64...so a bounce is not out of the question. Overnight - commodities got a further kick in the head after HSBC/Markit's China PMI fell to 48.2, down from 49.4 (a 15-month low) ....this number says that manufacturing has not yet stabilized in China which only causes analysts and investor to question the validity of Q2 GDP growth of 7%.......Hmmmmmmm
"
355,MMM,"Which now brings up next week's release of U.S. Q2 GDP! In addition to more earnings next week - we will also get a range of economic data to help us navigate the waters…the big one is next Thursday's release of Q2 GDP - which is expected to show an increase of 2.4% - this after the gov't conveniently found a new way of computing the results. Read what San Francisco Fed President Williams had to say:
"
356,MMM,"""The government agency that computes GDP and related economic statistics, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, uses a bottom-up method to account for seasonal adjustments to arrive at its overall numbers. They do this for a number of reasons that are appropriate for their purposes. But for monetary policy, it's preferable to have the most accurate reflection of the broader economy….. To get a measure that avoids seasonal patterns, SF Fed economists ran a second round of seasonal adjustment, not just on GDP, but on gross domestic income (GDI) and something called GDP Plus, a new measure of economy-wide activity that combines GDP and GDI and strips out the extraneous noise. After making this modification for recurring seasonal patterns, the data show GDP actually grew about 1½ percent in the first quarter. GDI and GDP Plus grew at about 3 and 2¾ percent, respectively. Based on these revised numbers, and relative to trend growth of around 2 percent, the first quarter appears to have been more or less on track. More recent data on spending have also been encouraging, indicating the economy is still on a solid trajectory with a good deal of forward momentum. Looking forward, I expect growth to average about 2¾ percent for the remainder of the year, then slow to a more sustainable pace next year.""
"
357,MMM,"So what does it all mean? It means that the administration will 'massage' the numbers until they get what they want…..and if they get a number they don't like - then they will massage it some more until they get the reaction they want! I mean - they must be taking a lesson from China 101 - ' How to produce a positive GDP - just make it up'.
"
358,MMM,"From a technical perspective - for the Dow - the 50 dma is now beginning to trend downwards towards a rising 200 dma……a couple of more days of this indiscriminate selling and we could have what we know as the 'death cross' - when the 50 dma breaks below the 200 dma - a technical sign of more difficult times ahead….I think it is too early to call that - and in fact I do not believe it will happen.
"
359,MMM,"The S&P 500 on the other hand is not confirming that at all - both its 50 and 200 dma continue to trend flat to upwards. The test will be how the S&P finishes out the month… (considering that it did breach its long term support earlier in the month amid all of the Greek drama) - so next week will be about more earnings and some 'window dressing' as PM's doll up their portfolios.
"
360,MMM,"Overnight in Asia - the markets ended the week in negative territory - as they got slammed from all sides.....U.S. markets ended lower. Commodities still under pressure and lousy Chinese economic data all contributed to the 'risk off' mentality..... China ended down 1.3% breaking their 'six-day winning streak'.......but look - the Chinese market has had some ride over the past two months...suffering swift losses not seen in decades....so that the market continues to try and find its footing and that may take some time. Japan -0.67%, Hong Kong - 1.06%, China -1.3% and ASX -0.43%
"
361,MMM,"In Europe - markets there are not paying any attention to the negatives out of China....Miners and producers are still coming under pressure as commodities continue to suffer - but that action is not taking the broader indexes lower with it. German and EU PMI also slightly missed - but analysts are blaming Greece for that......so no one is getting worked up. In Greece - the Troika is now back in town (after being kicked out months ago by Yanis Varoufakis) - so many are looking for more positive results for the negotiations.
"
362,MMM,"Investors there are also in the midst of earnings season and are trying to focus on the positives...... FTSE + 0.14%, CAC 40 + 0.39%, DAX + 0.01% EUROSTOXX +0.17%, SPAIN -0.37% and ITALY +0.53%
"
363,MMM,"This morning - U.S. futures are trending higher + 3 pts in early trade. Last night after the bell Amazon.com (AMZN) 'blew the roof off the house' - reporting much better than expected earnings...sending that stock up some $70 in the after market.....and this morning it is trading even higher.....up $90 at $570/sh......I guess Bezos and traders are not worried about China at all.....
"
364,MMM,"On the earnings front - look for results from American Airlines (AAL), VF Corp. (VFC), Biogen (BIIB) and a few others. On the economic front - we are only getting New Home Sales - expectations of 548k or 0.3%..... Again - it is Friday in the summer - volumes to remain a bit light so moves can be more exaggerated....It feels like the S&P 500 wants to find support right here....but if it does not - then a move to 2080 would not be out of the question. On the upside - 2125ish will provide resistance.

369,MMM,"The Nasdaq rose 0.3%. The S&P 500 clung to a fractional gain. The Dow Jones industrial average hung 0.1% in the red. For all the big volume stock moves, overall market volume was tracking below Wednesday's levels: 4% lower on the NYSE and down 19% on the Nasdaq.
"
370,MMM,"The stock market today opened to a dose of positive economic news, as weekly jobless claims slipped to a 41-year low.

Volvo, which is owned by Chinese automaker Geely, said March 30 that it will build a $500-million manufacturing plant in the United States to bolster flagging U.S. sales by giving it a local presence and reducing the effect of the strong dollar.

479,MMM,"Aggressive growth investors know that betting against the the stock market trendis a bad idea.Yet sometimes aggressive investors will snub a fine-performing sector because it just doesn't sound growthy enough.This too is a bad idea. When the market is rewarding conservative names, savvy investors adjust.Consider four stocks from the Diversified Operations industry group. The names will prompt groans from aggressive investors. But get past the initial emotions. These stocks are outperforming the market.Diversified manufacturer 3M (NYSE:MMM) has gained 24% since mid-October, when the market pegged a short-term bottom. (During the same period, the major indexes gained 12% to 14%.) Big-cap 3M grew earnings 11% to 15% in the past four quarters. The last time the company delivered double-digit earnings in any quarter was in 2010.Pretax margin has stayed in a 20% to 23% range for at least nine years.The strong U.S. dollar could provide some headwinds for 3M. In Q3, 3M estimates that currency effects decreased quarterly income by $10 million.The company has shifted strategies since Inge Thulin became CEO in 2012. Thulin has increased spending on research and development and is pushing international growth.Honeywell (NYSE:HON), also a big cap, gained 20% from mid-October to now. Earnings growth has accelerated from 6% to 8% and 19% in recent quarters. Pretax margin in 2013 was 14%, the best in at least nine years.CEO David Cote said in a recent news release that Honeywell can deliver higher organic growth and expand margins in 2015 despite ""only modest GDP growth in most regions around the world.""Carlisle Companies (NYSE:CSL), a midcap, rose 19% since mid-October. Quarterly earnings grew 19%, 17%, 16% and, most recently, 28%. Revenue growth was 13% in Q3, the best in 11 quarters.Carlisle jacked up sales outside the U.S. from 12% in 2009 to 23% in 2013. The company has been growing through acquisitions.Roper Industries (NYSE:ROP) gained 14% since mid-October, narrowly topping the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Quarterly earnings growth dropped to 9% in Q3, ending a long streak of double-digit growth.All four stocks have Composite Ratings of 92 or better.The stocks also are housed in IBD's Miscellaneous sector, which was No. 1 among 33 sectors in Tuesday's IBD.Of the four stocks, three are extended from proper buy zones. Carlisle, though, appears to be working on a flat base and has found support at the 50-day moving average. The potential buy point is 91.99.Honeywell and Roper are barely extended from first-stage bases.Given the moderate growth these stocks offer, investors who play the conservative stocks should lower their price targets and lower their cut-loss figure.

Sales growth accelerated for the second straight quarter, rising 6% to just over $7.9 billion.Sales at its industrial segment rose 9% to $2.7 billion, making up just over a third of total revenue. Sales grew in all businesses, led by aerospace, automotive, advanced materials, and industrial adhesives and tapes.Sales at 3M's safety and graphics segment rose nearly 7% to $1.4 billion; health care sales grew 5.5% to $1.3 billion; and electronics sales increased 2.5% to $1.4 billion.Earnings are due Jan. 30 after the close. The consensus estimate calls for profit of $1.62 a share, up 15% from a year ago with sales up 4% to $7.71 billion.

561,MMM,"With S&P 500 companies expected to boost dividend payouts by 10.4% to a record total of $310 billion this year, 2013 has been a good year for income investors.Diversified industrial giant 3M (MMM) is just one of the big caps focusing on shareholder returns lately. On Dec. 18, the St. Paul, Minn.-based company increased its quarterly dividend for the first quarter of 2014 by 35% to 85.5 cents.It also lifted its five-year stock repurchase program to $17 billion-$22 billion from $7.5 billion-$15 billion. The company forecast 2014 earnings at $7.30-$7.55, with the midpoint above consensus views for $7.40. Shares rallied 4% that day.Quarterly cash dividends have been paid for more than 97 years in a row and 3M has increased the payout amount for 55 consecutive years. It offered a quarterly dividend of 63.5 cents a share in 2013, up 8% from the prior year.Based on the 85.5 cents 3M will pay out, its annualized yield is about 2.5%, slightly above that of the S&P 500.Earnings dipped 1% in the first quarter this year, but recovered with 3% and 8% growth in Q2 and Q3 respectively. Analysts expect Q4 profit gains of 14%.The three-year Earnings Stability Factor is a very stable 1 on a scale from 0 to 99 for 3M. Its five-year factor is 7. Its annual profit stumbled in 2009 but recovered and resumed growth in 2010. Consensus estimates call for EPS to rise 5% this year and 11% the next.The provider of industrial tapes and adhesives, medical supplies, office products and surveillance gear is geographically diversified. The U.S. accounted for 35% of revenue last year, Asia Pacific 30%, Europe/Middle East/Africa 23%, and Latin America and Canada 12%.The stock tends to be a slow and steady performer over time, but has outperformed the overall market this year. It's surged 47%, well ahead of S&P 500's 28% gain.

563,MMM,"Nowadays, Amgen is a gray eminence among biotechs. With more than $18 billion in sales last year, it's the kingpin in an industry that's turned into one of America's biggest innovation machines, and one of the highest-returning stock groups of the last few years.
"
564,MMM,"It's hard to believe now, but back in the 1980s biotech was still a largely unproven business model. And Amgen (AMGN), founded in 1980 and public in 1982, was one of the first to show what could be done.
"
565,MMM,"""When I think of the forefathers of biotech, I think of Amgen and Genentech,"" said Les Funtleyder, author of ""Healthcare Investing: Profiting from the New World of Pharma, Biotech and Health Care Services."" ""(They were) able to go public early on and able to show a lot of success early on.""
"
566,MMM,"Industry watchers give much of the credit to Amgen's first chief executive, George Rathmann. Rathmann worked as a research chemist at old-school giants 3M (MMM) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) before being recruited by venture capitalists for their new biotech startup.
"
567,MMM,"Rathmann died in 2012, but in 1992 he spoke with IBD for a Leaders & Success profile. He emphasized the importance of investing in good science as the key to business success.
"
568,MMM,"""The person who leads a good scientific team has to have tremendous respect for science. He has to be able to differentiate good science from bad. And then from there on, it's mostly a support function,"" Rathmann said at the time. ""Get the guy the money, get him the facilities, and get him the resources to make it possible to sustain the effort all the way to the marketplace.""
"
569,MMM,"Rathmann was particularly interested in genetic engineering, which was then cutting-edge science. Pharmaceutical technology, then the dominant platform for drug development, is based on chemistry. But biotechnology is based on manipulating biological processes. Rathmann eventually zeroed in on the goal of cloning the erythropoietin gene, which stimulates production of red blood cells. He saw the potentially huge market in treating severe anemia brought on by kidney failure or chemotherapy.
"
570,MMM,"The eventual result was Epogen, which launched in 1988 and became one of biotech's first blockbusters. Not surprisingly, it also launched a big stock run-up. From July 1988 to January 1992, the stock — which was already up sharply from its levels several years earlier — increased more than 17-fold.
"
571,MMM,"Amgen shares have staged other big runs since then. Last month they hit an all-time high of 128.96 — up 165,233% from their 1984 low. That gain puts Amgen near the top of the greatest stocks of the past 30 years.
"
572,MMM,"Amgen wasn't the only company interested in erythropoietin in its early days — in fact, there was something of a race to get a viable product out first. Rathmann was so conscious of the time pressure that he reportedly threatened to shut down the research of the eventually successful scientist unless he isolated the gene.
"
573,MMM,"""He was resolute in his determination to be first to market with Epogen,"" said Michael King, a biotech analyst at JMP Securities. ""I was a salesperson at the time, and I used to call on him and try to convince him, when the stock was exploding to new highs, to sell some of the stock and diversify. His answer was constantly no — and he was right. He built a great fortune for himself and his family by maintaining his vision and his focus on what Amgen could be.""
"
574,MMM,"Despite that commitment, in 1988 Rathmann decided to hand the reins over to his CFO, Gordon Binder, who shepherded Amgen through its greatest period of financial growth before leaving in 2000. Binder oversaw the launch of another blood-cell-stimulating blockbuster, Neupogen, in 1991, and rheumatoid-arthritis treatment Enbrel in 1998. Those three drugs together, along with a pegylated version of Neupogen launched in 2002, still provide more than two-thirds of revenue.
"
575,MMM,"While all that was going on, biotechs started breaking out like measles all over the market. Funtleyder says Amgen not only helped prove the science of biotechnology but also the business model, whereby a company could lose money for nearly a decade, most of that time publicly traded, before bringing a product to market that eventually would earn investors a handsome return.
"
576,MMM,"Amgen ""sent a clear message that you could be a pure biotechnology company and succeed,"" said King. ""In some ways, it also set expectations a bit too high. A lot of the early biotech companies picked the low-hanging fruit.""
"
577,MMM,"Nonetheless, the era produced a number of winners that went on to become big caps such as Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Biogen Idec (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), or were acquired by big pharmas. Although getting in on the ground floor of a young biotech is still risky, King says that ""(the) model works much better now"" due to the long years of experience.
"
578,MMM,"In a 2009 interview with IBD, former CEO Binder pointed out that innovations in research technology have also helped speed biotech innovation.

579,MMM,"""In the early days of Amgen, if you wanted to make a piece of DNA with 100 base pairs, it was a major project.

"
582,MMM,"Joe Wilson had one little problem in trying to launch the Xerox copier in the late 1950s.His early machines sometimes caught on fire.He couldn't exactly tell prospects not to worry, since each came with an extinguisher.Wilson's solution was, naturally, to build machines that didn't light up — but also to show how easy they were to operate.He used a chimpanzee to make copies at demos. That changed the conversation and revolutionized business communication.Today, Xerox (XRX) brings in $22 billion annually from a wide range of copying and digital printing products and consulting services. And its stock, struggling since 1999, has almost doubled in the past year.Wilson (1909-71) grew up in the family business, Haloid Photographic Co., which sold photo-sensitive paper at a lower price than its Rochester, N.Y., neighbor, film giant Eastman Kodak.His grandfather, J.C. Wilson, who founded the company in 1906 and became mayor, inspired young Joe with his self-discipline and will power.The LearnerWilson developed an appetite for reading at an early age. By the time he was an adult, he was consuming two books a week, able to quote Shakespeare and Plato for insight into solving business problems.After graduating from the University of Rochester in 1931, Wilson spent two years getting an MBA from Harvard. He then joined Haloid as a management apprentice to his father, J.R., granddad having died in 1930.The next year, Haloid acquired control of Rectigraph Co., which had a primitive process to produce document copies without using photographic paper.Wilson married Peggy Curran in 1935 and was good about not bringing his work home. Later, as head of the company, he insisted that all calls from his children be put through so they didn't feel business was more important than family.In 1936, Wilson was put in charge of hiring, and displayed an extraordinary ability to remember and understand people. Even after Xerox became a global corporation, he would astonish line workers by asking for updates on family matters.Naturally shy, Wilson hated speaking in public, but forced himself to give as many speeches in the community as he could accommodate. He would eventually be regarded as one of the most eloquent business leaders of his time.Although Haloid's sales rose from $3.9 million in 1940 to $9.7 million in 1949, its profit margin was cut by half because its photo paper was out of date. Meanwhile, it struggled to create an affordable copier that could be used in offices.Kodak and 3M (MMM) already had image transfer machines, although they were slow and required expensive, special paper. Wilson wanted his firm to pass them.He was in a position to do so, having become Haloid's president in 1945 (later adding the CEO title) when his father retired. Knowing he had to re-invent the company, he had his research director, John Dessauer, comb trade publications for product ideas.Right up there was a process developed by a Columbus, Ohio, lawyer named Chet Carlson.In 1938 he transferred an image on a page without chemicals or special paper by creating a picture with an electrostatic charge (like plastic wrap that clings to your hand) on a drum, using dry powder to make the picture visible.Carlson approached 34 companies, including IBM (IBM) and General Electric (GE), to make a copying machine in partnership, but they all passed. Finally, in 1944 he signed an agreement giving 60% of any revenue to Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit research lab in Columbus, for further development. Battelle named the process xerography, Greek for dry writing.Wilson and Dessauer visited two years later and agreed to pay $25,000 to Battelle each year, plus 8% of future revenue, if Haloid was able to develop a photocopier based on Carlson's principles.No one knew that producing a commercially viable machine would take 13 years and $92 million (worth $750 million now), wrote Charles Ellis in ""Joe Wilson and the Creation of Xerox.""The company survived by doing research for the U.S. military and licensing other companies to use its increasing number of patents for niche products. It saved every penny, working in tiny, shabby offices and using subcontractors for manufacturing. Wilson mortgaged his house, while Haloid borrowed $1 million from a bank and $3 million from an insurance company.""Wilson had studied corporate finance at Harvard and understood the importance of demonstrating consistently prudent financial discipline, having clearly articulated business plans designed to capitalize on opportunity and matching this with actions, so lenders would have confidence,"" wrote Ellis. ""Wilson's priority was not sales or profits, but cash flow, and he was a stickler for accuracy, which appealed to bankers.""In 1958, the firm changed its name to Haloid-Xerox, since it was banking on xerography, and aimed to launch its 914 machine, which would make one duplicate on 9-by-14-inch paper in 22 seconds.Big And ExpensiveWhen the 914 came out in March 1960, it had 1,260 components, weighed 650 pounds and cost $29,500 (worth $230,000 today).Most companies couldn't afford that, so Wilson made a crucial call: He would lease the copier at $95 per month.The 914 and Wilson's strategy vaulted Xerox ahead of the pack. Other companies came up with 40 competing copiers, but they were slower, difficult to use, required special paper and proved more expensive per copy.Forbes magazine, which had dismissed Wilson as a dreamer in 1957, now reported, ""He is nothing if not a big thinker,"" as noted by the editors of Forbes' ""Greatest Business Stories of All Time."" ""Potentially, Xerox is not so much a company as an industry.""The firm's revenue leapt from $31 million in 1959 to $59 million in 1960. By 1962, 10,000 machines had been installed across America and the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange with its new name, Xerox Corp.It turned into a sensational stock winner, rocketing 3,300% into the early 1970s.The Right PriceXerox helped its cause by cutting the cost of the 914 dramatically in 1965. Making the machine for $2,400, the firm leased it for $25 a month at 4 cents per copy. The average user made 8,000 copies, so Xerox collected $4,500 per machine each year. It had 60,000 installed by 1965, for 61% of the copier market, and revenue soared.Photocopying changed daily life in innumerable ways:• Dozens of employees working on a project could easily circulate status reports for comments.• Government departments were able to distribute new policies to workers quickly.• Teachers could pass out copies of lessons, while students no longer had to tediously write down information from reference books.• Doctors could give patients an X-ray on paper for 5 cents instead of making another original for $5.Xerox continued to spend heavily on innovation. It filed its 500th patent in 1966, when it used $40 million for research and development out of its $500 million in revenue. The company reports that it now has 11,500 active U.S. patents.Also in 1966, the number of copies made using all brands of machines stood at 14 billion, a massive rise from 20 million in the mid-1950s.Xeroxing was now a generic term for making copies. The company fought this term, preferring the less catchy ""copying on a Xerox Brand copying machine.""Wilson stepped down as CEO in 1968, becoming chairman. In 1970, Xerox revenue reached $1.5 billion. The next year he died at 61.""Wilson was an inspiration to everyone to persevere, taking calculated risks with a daring vision of creating the office of the future,"" George Cook, who worked at Xerox for 32 years and is now a professor at the University of Rochester's business school, told IBD.Today Xerox has 140,000 employees in 160 countries and is headquartered in Norwalk, Conn.

596,MMM,"Income stocks tend to be large, mature, big-cap companies with slower growth. Dow component 3M (MMM) fits the bill. The St. Paul, Minn.-based firm offers investors steady growth and rising dividends. Since 2000, the maker of everything from Post-it notes to bandages to medical devices has delivered top- and bottom-line growth in all but two years. It has a five-year…
"
597,MMM,"On Tuesday, 3M became the latest in a flurry of blue chips issuing dividend hikes or stock buybacks, as corporate giants prefer to return cash to shareholders rather than step up investment amid continued uncertainty.
"
598,MMM,"General Electric (GE) hiked its dividend by 16% on Friday, while Honeywell (HON) announced a $5 billion buyback. Boeing (BA) late Monday set a $10 billion buyback and raised its dividend by 50%. 3M (MMM) followed with a $22 billion buyback program while raising its payout by a third.
"
599,MMM,"For the full year, S&P 500 companies should pay a record $310 billion in dividends, up 10.4% vs. a year earlier, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That comes after climbing nearly 17% in the prior two years, including a late 2012 flurry as companies rushed to return cash before a possible tripling of the dividend tax rate.
"
600,MMM,"Estimated S&P 500 buybacks should spike 20.8% to $482 billion, though that's below 2007's record $589 billion. Apple (AAPL) accounted for much of the increase with its $60 billion buyback program announced in the spring.
"
601,MMM,"Shareholder Return
"
602,MMM,"All 30 companies on the Dow industrials — including 3M, GE and Boeing — have increased dividends this year. So have 272 companies on the S&P 500.

607,MMM,"More Uncertainty
"
608,MMM,"So with S&P 500 industrials' cash holdings reaching $1.25 trillion, corporations have been returning cash to investors. Dividends offer direct payments to shareholders. Buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding, boosting earnings per share.

609,MMM,"The Federal Reserve's stimulus program has poured trillions of dollars of cheap liquidity into financial markets. The S&P 500 has risen 25% so far in 2013, which would be its best annual gain since 2003.

617,MMM,"MINNEAPOLIS — To hear Don Ball tell it, Minneapolis is amid a tech startup boom.
"
618,MMM,"From the start of this decade, around the time Ball co-founded CoCo, a shared work space for entrepreneurs housed in the Minneapolis Grain Exchange building, tech outfits have increasingly peppered the city and its twin across the Mississippi River, St. Paul.
"
619,MMM,"CoCo, the first of its kind in the Twin Cities, started from scratch three years ago and now has 700 members, mostly tech startups.
"
620,MMM,"""We jumped up quickly,"" Ball said. Along the way, CoCo opened a second location in St. Paul and plans to open a third in October in Minneapolis' Uptown neighborhood.
"
621,MMM,"CoCo stands for coworking and collaboration. The workplace organization regularly hosts meet-up events, where tech enthusiasts gather to share ideas and show off their latest endeavors to one another, potential customers and, importantly, investors. More than 4,000 people have attended its meet-ups this year, Ball says.
"
622,MMM,"But CoCo isn't alone. Minnestar, a nonprofit, is another group devoted to galvanizing the Twin Cities tech scene. It also hosts events for startups to demo their products. Attendance at its MinneDemo events has swelled more than 40% since the start of the decade.
"
623,MMM,"""There is definitely momentum building here,"" said Adrienne Peirce, a Minnestar board member.
"
624,MMM,"Jeff Pesek, co-founder of tech.mn., a Minneapolis website that tracks local tech startups, estimates there are 150 to 200 of them in Minnesota, the vast majority in the Twin Cities.
"
625,MMM,"Pesek says at least 87 Minnesota tech startups raised some $145 million in 2012, up from 63 ventures that drummed up $126 million the year before and 42 that raised about $60 million in 2010.
"
626,MMM,"In the second quarter of this year alone, 61 local tech ventures collectively raised more than $65 million, he says. Both figures are quarterly highs, according to tech.mn.

628,MMM,"19 Fortune 500 Companies
"
629,MMM,"The Twin Cities area counts among its strengths a long-established and large talent pool. Ball says that with 19 Fortune 500 companies with headquarters or major operations, including 3M (MMM) and Best Buy (BBY), the area has more such companies per-capita than any region. Up-and-comers such as 3D printer maker Stratasys (SSYS) also call the area home.
"
630,MMM,"Engineers, programmers and others from big firms often branch out to start their own ventures, he points out. The Twin Cities also regularly ranks among the nation's most literate metro areas by percentage of population with post-high school degrees, he says, thanks in large part to a heavy concentration of colleges, including the University of Minnesota.
"
631,MMM,"Minneapolis-St. Paul also is affordable, says Peirce, with office rents and housing costs lower than in the major markets on both coasts.
"
632,MMM,"She says the workforce is considered especially reliable. She says that in Silicon Valley people often jump from one job to another, but in Minnesota people tend to commit for several years.
"
633,MMM,"Startups percolating at CoCo include Spark Devices. Its Spark Core, a tiny Wi-Fi-enabled circuit board used to build Internet-connected hardware products, is slated for release in October. Spark Devices recently raised nearly $600,000 via the Kickstarter crowd-sourced funding platform.
"
634,MMM,"SmartThings, a startup that provides a platform to manage various devices connected to the Internet, also calls CoCo home. A year ago, it used Kickstarter to raise more than $1.2 million from nearly 5,700 backers.
"
635,MMM,"Angel Funding Big Factor
"
636,MMM,"Many Twin Cities startups take the same path as Spark and SmartThings, gathering funding from various sources by Internet outreach or via seed and angel funding, as opposed to building their business plans around the hope of attracting venture capital funding.
"
637,MMM,"PricewaterhouseCoopers' MoneyTree report, an oft-cited measure of venture capital investments, ranks the Northcentral region — Minnesota and five neighboring states — far below not only Silicon Valley but many other areas too. Of some $6.7 billion invested by VCs nationwide in Q2, the Northcentral received only 1%, said PwC. Silicon Valley accounted for nearly 40%, followed by New England at 12% and New York City at 10.5%. Texas, where Austin is a hotspot, and Colorado, where Boulder houses a thriving tech startup scene, each attracted more than the entire Northcentral region.
"
638,MMM,"But Pesek says the MoneyTree report picks up on less than half of all activity in the Twin Cities because it focuses only on venture capital, not angel investors, seed capital and other sources.
"
639,MMM,"Though he knows of no reliable data that calculates all forms of funding, he says such a measure would find the Twin Cities about as large as the Austin and Boulder areas.

649,MMM,"3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) recently announced the sale of substantial part of its Communication Markets Division to Corning Incorporated. Notably, Corning is a premier manufacturer of glass, ceramics and related materials for industrial and scientific applications. The transaction worth $870 million is likely to generate a full-year 2018 earnings benefit of 40-45 cents per share to 3M.The Communication Markets Division incorporates the company’s optical and copper passive connectivity solutions such as xDSL, FTTx and structured cabling solutions. The sale of the remaining telecommunications system integration services business, which remains pending, is likely to be completed later in 2018 for about $30 million.Existing Business ScenarioBeing one of the most recognized and trusted brand globally, 3M remains focused on inventing new products with its scientists and innovators. This, in turn, gives the company a worldwide competitive advantage over its peers. Also, 3M is investing heavily to bolster its competitive edge in the future. Meanwhile, the company’s portfolio restructuring efforts by divesting assets that no longer fit in its strategy are commendable. It continues to invest in other lucrative markets as well. In a year’s time, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 2.2%, outperforming the industry’s decline of 14.4%. 3M has also initiated some prudent steps to strengthen and focus on its core portfolio of businesses. Since 2012, the company has streamlined its businesses to a large extent, thereby improving customer relevance, productivity and speed through a leaner operating structure. At the same time, it has maintained a steady investment in R&D to develop innovative products.Portfolio management, investment in innovation and business transformation are the three key levers on which the company intends to focus moving forward. Moreover, 3M’s global footprint, diversified product portfolio and ability to penetrate in different markets have been its forte.However, 3M’s growth objectives are largely dependent on timing and market acceptances of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new offerings and bring those to market at acceptable price points.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report) and Raven Industries, Inc.

650,MMM,"Investors with an interest in Diversified Operations stocks have likely encountered both Crane (CR  -  Free Report) and 3M (MMM  -  Free Report). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Crane and 3M are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold) respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that CR is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.CR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.77, while MMM has a forward P/E of 18.92. We also note that CR has a PEG ratio of 1.43. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MMM currently has a PEG ratio of 1.86.Another notable valuation metric for CR is its P/B ratio of 3.42. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, MMM has a P/B of 10.61.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to CR's Value grade of B and MMM's Value grade of D.CR has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than MMM, so it seems like value investors will conclude that CR is the superior option right now.

This system has been consistently validated by popular scientific validation organizations across the globe for a variety of sample types.The system combines unique technologies — bioluminescence detection and isothermal DNA amplification — which easily outpace the limitations of conventional Polymerase Chain Reaction pathogen testing methods.3M currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).On a quarter-to-date basis, shares of the company have rallied 1.9%, outperforming 1% growth recorded by the industry.The company is poised to grow on the back of strategic restructuring moves, ongoing portfolio-solidification initiatives and efficient enterprise resource planning system.

Based on the hitherto observed pattern, the third quarter is anticipated to register modest single-digit percentage earnings growth on a year-over-year basis.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for all the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up 2.6% on 5% growth in revenues. It represents a slightly tempered growth projection compared with the double-digit growth rate of the previous quarter, largely due to drag from the insurance industry that was hit hard by devastating hurricanes Harvey and Irma. However, experts widely believe that earnings growth is likely to improve steadily in 2018 and beyond.The Industrial Products sector appears modest. For the sector, earnings are expected to improve 2.6% year over year while sales are touted to rise 5% due to thrust on the manufacturing industries.Let’s have a sneak peek at two major Industrial Products stocks scheduled to report earnings tomorrow to see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) believes stronger automotive and aerospace solutions, industrial adhesives and tapes abrasives, as well as its automotive aftermarket businesses will bolster its Industrial segment’s revenues in the quarters ahead. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from 3M’s Industrial segment is currently pegged at $2,656 million for third-quarter 2017, higher than $2,582 million reported in the year-ago quarter.New contract wins are anticipated to augment sales of the company’s food safety, drug delivery systems and medical consumables businesses in the third quarter. This will likely reinforce the Health Care segment’s revenues. On the other hand, increased penetration in original equipment manufacturing platform and higher consumer electronics sales are expected to support Electronics and Energy segment’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, increased consumer health care, home care and home improvement sales are anticipated to propel revenues of the company’s Consumer segment in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenues from Safety and Graphics, Health Care, Electronics and Energy and Consumer segments are currently pegged at $1,481 million, $1,413 million, $1,302 million and $1,225 million, respectively for the third quarter, higher than the corresponding tallies of $1,448 million, $1,361 million, $1,293 million and $1,209 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.For the impending quarter, the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.17% as the Most Accurate estimate of $2.19 per share is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.20 per share. 3M currently has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), making an earnings prediction uncertain. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 for a likely earnings beat.

The company is also heavily dependent on the U.S. government’s budgetary allocation for defense. A reduction in capital spending for the commercial aviation or defense industries is likely to have a significant effect on the demand for its products.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UTC Climate Control and Security segment revenues is currently pegged at $4,566 million, significantly down from $4,712 million in the second quarter. Revenues from Otis and Pratt & Whitney are also expected to be sequentially low with respective estimates of $3,075 million and $3,661 million compared with reported revenues of $3,131 million and $4,070 million in the prior quarter.UTC Aerospace Systems’ revenues are likely to be $3,619 million compared with $3,640 million in the previous quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that United Technologies is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -1.16% with the former currently pegged at $1.66 and the latter at $1.68.United Technologies Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  United Technologies Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | United Technologies Corporation QuoteMoreover, United Technologies has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

658,MMM,"The earnings season for the industrial sector is off to a great start this year. Of the 83.3% S&P industrial companies that have reported earnings, 85% beat on both lines. There have been earnings improvement of 38.4% and revenue growth of 14% year over year, per the Earnings Trends issued on May 2, 2018.Against this backdrop, we take a look at some big industrial earnings releases within the last 15 days and see if these can leave an impact on ETFs exposed to the space.Inside Q1 EarningsOn Apr 26, Union Pacific Corporation’s (UNP  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of $1.68 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.65 per share. The bottom line expanded 27.3% on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by higher revenues. Operating revenues of $5,475 million also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,370.8 million. Moreover, revenues increased 6.7% year over year. Higher freight revenues boosted the top line.On Apr 24, Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report), the world’s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives, reported first-quarter 2018 results, wherein adjusted earnings of $2.82 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.11 by a margin of 34%.Caterpillar posted revenues of $12.9 billion, handily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.6 billion. However, post earnings, stocks got beaten down as management noted that the company is less likely to match the blockbuster performance of Q1 during any of the next three this year.On Apr 24, 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) reported solid first-quarter 2018 results, with impressive year-over-year improvement in adjusted earnings and revenues. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $2.50, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Total consolidated revenues for the reported quarter rose 7% year over year to $28,660 million and trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27,884 million.In the current scenario, we believe it is prudent to discuss the following ETFs that have relatively high exposure to the industrial companies discussed (see all Industrial ETFs here).ETFs in Focus Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report)This $12 billion-fund focuses on providing exposure to the U.S. industrial sector.

659,MMM,"The Dow snapped a five-session long losing streak this week, boosted by strong quarterly results. During the early half of the week, surging bond yields caused heavy losses for stocks. But strong results from key components helped the index recover toward the end of the week. The 10-year Treasury yield also retreated from the psychological 3% level, calming investors’ fears.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow declined 0.8% last Friday after Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) took a hit owing to concerns of weak demand for iPhones. Also, the broader consumer staples sector took a beating, led by PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report). Moreover, a rise in bond yields, reflecting fears of rising inflation, kept investors worried. The 10-year Treasury note touched a four-year high leading to huge selloffs.However, the index gained 0.4% over last week. U.S. equity markets surged on the first two day of the week driven by robust first-quarter 2018 earnings results, strong economic data and easing geopolitical tensions. The middle of the week was a mixed bag for the markets with the Dow declining marginally.However, the last two days of the week saw all major indexes ending in the red. This was primarily because of concerns over rising inflation, which saw the 10-year Treasury yield touching a four-year high.The Dow This WeekThe index declined less than 0.1% on Monday, making it the fourth straight day of losses since March. The Dow’s decline was led by Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), which declined 2.1%. Tech stocks continued to suffer and rising bond yields dented investors’ confidence. However, optimism about earnings prevented markets from declining further.The index fell 1.7% on Tuesday, making it the fifth straight day of losses for the index since March 2017. The 30-stock index rose as much as 131 points shortly after trading began only to witness huge selloffs in the later part of the day. However, the Dow eventually took a beating after industry bellwether Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) said economic growth might decelerate later in the year.The Dow bounced back on Wednesday, gaining 0.3% to end its five-day losing streak. The 30-stock index witnessed a lot of volatility throughout the day, declining as much as 201.05 points at one point. However, it erased initial losses to end higher after shares of The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) rallied on robust quarterly results.The index added 1% on Thursday following robust corporate earnings from a number of big companies, including Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report). The Dow gained 238.51 points, helped primarily by Visa Inc. V which posted better-than-expected profits and raised its earnings forecast. Moreover, the 10-year Treasury yield traded below the 3% level, as investors shed worries that had fueled huge selloffs over growing U.S. debts and rising costs.Components Moving the Index 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 GAAP earnings of 98 cents per share compared with $2.16 per share in the year-earlier quarter.

664,MMM,"Stocks opened slightly lower on Wednesday even as big-name companies continue to perform well during quarterly earnings season. This means that investors need to be even more selective and only consider buying stocks that are expected to outperform expectations.Economic bellwethers Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) and 3M (MMM  -  Free Report) provided downbeat guidance after reporting strong quarterly results recently, which helped quash some investor confidence. These moves also underscore larger market uncertainty and put even pressure on companies to post Q1 earnings beats in order to boost investor confidence in the near-term. With that said, let’s take a look at three well-known companies that look poised to impress investors on Wednesday, by posting better-than-expected earnings results. To do this, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Today, we are giving our readers a free look at three of these strong stocks in order to help them avoid any further losses as market volatility continues.Check them out now: 1.      AT&T (T  -  Free Report)AT&T stock is down 12% over the last year and 6% in the last 12 weeks. Shares also dipped in early morning trading on Wednesday, which might signal that investors are nervous about AT&T ahead of its first quarter earnings report. But the company’s bottom line estimates should please investors. AT&T is expected to see its earnings surge 17.6% from the year-ago period to reach $0.87 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates.AT&T is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 1.53%. The company’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $0.89 per share, which comes in 2 cents above our current consensus estimate. Therefore, AT&T is a stock that investors can reasonably expect to top Q1 earnings estimates.  2.       eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report)EBay’s quarterly revenues are projected to hit $2.6 billion, which would mark a 17.2% climb. Meanwhile, the company’s earnings are expected to expand by 8.2% to reach $0.53 per share. Better still, eBay’s Most Accurate Estimate calls for earnings of $0.54 per share, which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate.The company is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an Earnings ESP of 0.91%. Therefore, investors can consider eBay a stock that looks poised to top Q1 earnings estimates when it reports its financial results after market close.3.       Visa (V  -  Free Report)Shares of Visa slipped slightly today, but are still up 31% over the last year and 3% in the last month. And it looks like Visa might be able to continue its current run as its quarterly revenues are projected to reach $4.78 billion. Meanwhile, the credit card firm’s quarterly earnings are expected to expand by 17.4% to hit $1.01 per share. Investors should also note that the company’s Most Accurate Estimate comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate at $1.02 per share. This gives Visa an Earnings ESP of 0.73%, which coupled with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) ranking, means that investors should consider Visa a stock that could beat quarterly earnings estimates. Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

GAAP earnings came in at 98 cents per share compared with $2.16 per share in the year-earlier quarter. The year-over-year decline in GAAP earnings despite higher sales was largely due to a pre-tax charge of $897 million or $1.16 per share related to a lawsuit, and a tax expense of $217 million or 36 cents per share.Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $2.50, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Operating income was up 7.3% year over year to $719 million and operating margin was recorded at 22.9%.Health Care segment sales improved 7% year over year to $1,536 million in the reported quarter driven by higher sales in food safety, health information systems, and medical consumables.

670,MMM,"3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for MMM broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 5.5% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for MMM stock.If that wasn’t enough, 3M isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 5 estimates have been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for MMM.

671,MMM,"Markets traversed a month characterized by turbulence but ultimately closed in the green. Geopolitical tensions stemming from the actions of North Korea dragged down stocks on several occasions. Domestic political events also added to investor concerns. Near the end of the month, Hurricane Harvey led to widespread devastation across Texas and crippled the United States’ refining capacity to a significant extent. In contrast, economic data on GDP and employment was encouraging, widely exceeding most expectations. August’s PerformanceFor the month, the Nasdaq, the S&P 500 and the Dow increased 1.3%, 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively. The blue-chip index briefly touched the psychological 22,000 milestone during the month. This was possible due to strong earnings from companies like Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report).Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions between North Korea and U.S. heightened when the former threatened to attack the Guam naval and air base. President Trump responded to such statements by stating that any attacks by North Korea would be met with ""fire and fury"".Political instability also reduced market gains. Trump disbanded two advisory panels following a backlash from top CEOs in the country following his comments on the Charlottesville incident. The much-awaited Jackson Hole Symposium also failed to throw light on the future of monetary policies in the U.S. During the end of the month, the fallout of Hurricane Harvey disrupted the oil industry in Houston.Mixed Domestic DataEconomic data released during August was largely mixed in nature. In July, the ISM Manufacturing Index and the ISM Services Index declined to 56.3 and 53.9, respectively. Industrial production moved up 0.2% in July, lower than June’s pace of 0.4%. Leading indicators increased by 0.3%. Notably, durable orders declined by 6.8%. PPI and core PPI each slipped by 0.1%.However, factory orders increased by 3% in June after contracting in May. Also, retail sales moved up 0.6%, the best performance since a gain of 0.9% last December. Both CPI and core CPI increased by 0.1%.Second Estimate for Q2 GDP Rises Appreciably The second estimate for the gross domestic product in the second quarter showed that the U.S. economy expanded by 3% during this period, whereas the consensus estimated it would grow by around 2.7%, notching its fastest rate of growth in more than two years. This was the result of increased consumer spending and business investment for the quarter.Increase in consumer spending was pivotal in driving GDP to a 3% pace. Consumer expenditure was up 3.3% in the second quarter on account of increased expenditure on goods and services which also include car purchases. This is the best increase reported in a year. Moreover, business investment rose 0.6% in the second quarter. Also, corporate adjusted pretax profits increased 6.7% over a year.Housing Sector Stumbles on Steep PricesThe housing sector seems to be experiencing some troubles at this point. These issues primarily stem from affordability and supply constraints. Housing Starts for the month of July fell 5.6% while building permits also experienced a decline of 3.2%. Pending home sales declined by 0.8% in July, the fourth such fall in five months. New home sales declined by 9.4% to a seven-month low.Additionally, existing home sales declined by 1.3% in July. Despite this clutch of disappointing reports, the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index  increased from 64 in July to 68 in August. Also, in June, the S&P/Case Shiller 20 city index increased to 5.7%, lifted by strong housing demand.Job Additions Rise, Unemployment Slumps to 16-Year LowAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics the U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs in June, much higher than the consensus estimate of 181,000. In the past two months alone, a total of 450,000 new jobs have been added to the economy. This has led to unemployment declining from 4.4% in July to 4.3% in August.The bulk of the new jobs were primarily from professional firms, health-care providers and restaurants and bars. However, despite the decline in unemployment, wages increased only 0.3% in July to an average of $26.36 an hour. Over a 12-month period till July, wages have increased 2.5%.Dow Hits 22,000On Aug 2, the Dow achieved the historical milestone of 22,000 for the first time. This historic benchmark was achieved within 107 trading days of Dow hitting 21,000.This stellar showing was made possible by Apple's upbeat earnings.Apple reported spectacular results for third-quarter fiscal 2017, driven by the impressive Service segment performance. iPhone sales were also steady in the quarter. Earnings of $1.67 per share and revenues of $45.4 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57 and $44.7 billion, respectively.

The Nasdaq gained 63.05 during this session, increasing over 1% last month.  The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) surged 2.8% increasing 4.5% over the month.Analysts commented that the rally in biotech stocks for the second consecutive day has boosted gains for the markets. This comes at a time when upward momentum exists despite sluggish volumes.. Consequently, Nasdaq has increased 19% year to date.Strong Economic Reports Propel Gains for the MarketStrong economic data ensured gains for the broad based markets on Thursday. Initial jobless claims increased by 1000 to 236,000 from the previous week. However, the figure fell marginally short of the consensus estimate of  237,000. The four-week moving average of new claims stood at 236,750, a decrease of 1,250 from the previous week’s revised average. This reading indicates that the economy has stabilized. Further, it is the second lowest level recorded since the middle of 2009.,Consumer spending improved by 0.3% for July as a result of higher incomes and low inflation rates. However, the figure fell short of the consensus estimate of a 0.4% increase. Core PCE inflation increased 0.1% for July, consistent with rate of June. Economic data released on Thursday was mostly at par with the estimates. This boosted the investor sentiment and the overall markets gained. Only pending home sales decreased 0.8% for the last month.Trump Administration Presents Detailed Tax Plan to CongressSteven Mnuchin, United States Secretary of the Treasury, announced on Thursday to CNBC that Trump Administration had laid down a detailed tax plan. Mnuchin also said that the plan has been presented to the Congress and White House expects to push through the policy by the year end. The administration would also release a blueprint to the public by the end of September.The Trump Administration expects the Congress to approve the tax plan which would then be signed into law by the President. In a speech in Springfield on Wednesday, President Trump expressed the desire to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15% but said that a detailed tax plan was yet to be framed.Monthly RoundupFor the month, the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and the Dow increased 1.3%, 0.1% and 0.3% respectively. Benchmarks ended in the green for the fifth straight month, with the Nasdaq gaining during nine of the past ten months. The blue-chip index briefly touched the psychological 22,000 milestone during the month. This was possible due to strong earnings from companies like Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report). Boeing has added about 300 points to the blue chip index since February and helped it cross the psychological milestone.Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions between North Korea and U.S. heightened when the former threatened to attack the Guam naval and air base. President Trump responded to such statements by stating that any attacks by North Korea would be met with ’fire and fury’. Further, North Korea also tested a missile over Japan which again raised tensions between Pyongyang and Washington.Political instability also reduced market gains. Trump disbanded two advisory panels following a backlash from top CEOs in the country following his comments on the Charlottesville incident. Further, Trump also threatened to shut down the government if he did not receive funding for his proposed physical wall along the US-Mexico border.

Shares have lost about 1.5% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.3M Slightly Misses Q2 Earnings Despite Organic Growth Driven by broad-based organic growth across all segments, 3M reported strong second-quarter 2017 results with healthy year-over-year increase in earnings and revenues. GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were $1,583 million or $2.58 per share compared with $1,291 million or $2.08 per share in the year-earlier quarter. The year-over-year improvement in earnings was largely due to higher sales. However, the reported earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.01.    Net sales during the quarter were $7,810 million, up from $7,662 million in the year-ago quarter, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,879 million. Foreign currency translation impact and divestures decreased sales by 0.6% and 1%, respectively, while organic local-currency sales improved 3.5%.       On a geographic basis, total sales increased 8.3% in Asia Pacific, 2.5% in Latin America/Canada, and 0.5% in the U.S and declined 3.6% in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa). From a segment perspective, total sales increased 7.5% in Electronics and Energy, 2.5% in Industrial, 1.8% in Health Care, and 0.5% in Consumer, somewhat offset by a 0.9% decline in Safety and Graphics. Operating income in the reported quarter increased to $2,184 million from $1,866 million in the year-ago-quarter, resulting in respective operating margins of 28.0% and 24.4%.Segment ResultsIndustrial segment sales increased 2.5% year over year to $2,720 million with improvement in all regions, driven by higher sales of advanced materials, automotive and aerospace solutions, and industrial adhesives and tapes, partially offset by lower sales of separation and purification sciences products. Operating income decreased 15.6% year over year to $523 million for operating margin of 19.2%.Health Care segment sales improved 1.8% to $1,440 million in the reported quarter, driven by higher sales in drug delivery systems, food safety, and medical consumables. Operating income fell 10.6% year over year to $412 million for operating margin of 28.6%.Consumer segment revenues were $1,137 million, up 0.5% year over year, driven by higher sales in home improvement, home care and consumer health care. Operating income was $195 million, down 30.4% year over year for operating margin of 17.2%.Safety and Graphics segment sales decreased 0.9% year over year to $1,547 million, owing to lower sales in roofing granules and transportation safety. Operating income increased 102% year over year to $852 million for operating margin of 55.1%.Electronics and Energy segment revenues were $1,214 million, up 7.5% year over year due to growth in electronics material solutions and display materials and systems. Operating income was up 38.8% year over year to $301 million for operating margin of 24.8%.Balance Sheet and Cash Flow    Cash and cash equivalents at quarter end were $2,654 million, while long-term debt stood at $11,088 million.

During the reported quarter, 3M paid $701 million in cash dividends and repurchased $494 million worth of shares.  Updated GuidanceBuoyed by strong quarterly results and favorable growth dynamics, 3M raised its earlier guidance for 2017. The company anticipates 2017 GAAP earnings in the range of $8.80 to $9.05 per share, up from prior projections of $8.70–$9.05. This represents year-over-year growth of 8–11%, up from 7–11% expected earlier. Organic local-currency sales are expected to be 3–5%, up from 2–5% expected earlier, while free cash flow conversion rate is anticipated to be 95–100%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Analysts were quiet during the past month as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions.3M Company Price and Consensus  3M Company Price and Consensus | 3M Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a D.

674,MMM,"President Donald Trump’s administration has taken an unconventional path to protectionism. It has launched a formal investigation into whether China is violating international trade laws relating to intellectual property rights.The point here is that Trump’s administration and the United States business groups consider Chinese trade practices as damaging to the country’s industry. American businesses operating in China are forced to hand over key technological advances to China, while operating their businesses abroad.The White House triggered section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. This section specifically forces foreign countries to open up their markets to the United States exporters. It allows the United States to impose tariffs on imported goods from a foreign country or restrict access to domestic markets for goods from that country.China has regarded this move as disappointing and harmful to bilateral relations. China’s Ministry of Commerce has said that a trade war would do harm to both parties and has expressed strong dissatisfaction toward United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer’s decision. Moreover, Chinese representatives have called their United States counterparts’ behavior irresponsible for using domestic laws to settle a dispute, while completely disregarding WTO rules.Although the investigation would take more than a year, it marks the beginning of a potential trade war among the two countries.This move is aimed at making life easier for American multinationals. What’s ironical is that Trump has spent most of his campaign speaking against American companies doing business abroad. Therefore, even if there is some fruitful outcome of this move, doing business abroad will be easier, thereby reducing U.S. jobs.Let us now discuss a few United States industrials and Chinese ETFs that might be impacted by a potential trade war.Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report)This fund is one of the most popular United States equity ETFs and focuses on providing exposure to the U.S. industrial sector.It has AUM of $11.74 billion and charges a fee of 14 basis points a year.

675,MMM,"With operations spread across 70 countries worldwide, diversified technology firm 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) offers dynamic growth opportunities in a broad range of sectors with its flexible product lines. Over the years, 3M has initiated some prudent steps to focus on its core portfolio of businesses. Since 2012, the company has pruned its businesses from 40 to 24, thereby improving customer relevance, productivity and speed through a leaner operating structure. 3M also aims to continue investing in capital expenditures and research and development to support organic growth.However, given its international presence, adverse foreign currency translations are likely to affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings. As the extent of competition is increasing over time, investors have been eagerly awaiting for the company’s latest earnings report.3M has a fairly decent earnings surprise history. In the last four trailing quarters, 3M has managed to beat earnings thrice for an average earnings surprise of 3.2%. Currently, 3M has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), but that could definitely change following first-quarter 2018 earnings report which was just released. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

676,MMM,"Around 87 S&P 500 companies have reported first-quarter 2018 results as of Apr 20, reflecting a continuation of the strong momentum seen in the preceding earnings season. Total earnings for these companies are up 25% year over year on 10.7% higher revenues, with 82.8% beating earnings estimates and 67.8% surpassing top-line expectations. Based on the hitherto observed pattern, the first quarter of 2018 is anticipated to register robust growth in earnings and revenues.Per our latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 18.3% on 7.7% revenue growth. This represents better growth projections compared with the previous quarter — courtesy of a corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data. Experts believe that earnings growth is likely to improve steadily in 2018 and beyond.Notably, earnings growth is expected to be in double-digits on a year-over-year basis for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors. Only two sectors (Autos & Conglomerates) are expected to show earnings declines in the to-be-reported quarter.For the Conglomerates sector, earnings are expected to decline 9.4% year over year while sales are anticipated to rise 2.6% (as on Apr 18). Meanwhile, ongoing Ongoing tariff issues, which are likely to impact major U.S. industrials, are weighing on the companies margins in the sector.Let’s take a sneak peek at two major Conglomerate stocks scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings tomorrow and see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results. 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results before the opening bell. The company is likely to report higher industrial segment profit in the quarter backed by strong automotive and aerospace solutions, industrial adhesives and tapes abrasives as well as its automotive aftermarket businesses. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from 3M’s Industrial segment is pegged at $2,866 million, higher than $2,718 million in the previous quarter. However, of late, the company is facing steep pension expenses and remains susceptible to commodity price risks. Additionally, it remains concerned about adverse currency translations, which may be a drag on its profitability. (Read more: What's in the Offing for 3M Company in Q1 Earnings?) For the first quarter, the company’s earnings are expected to improve 15.7% year over year on 5.1% higher revenues. 3M has an Earnings ESP of +0.40% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which makes an earnings surprise prediction difficult. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.3M Company Price and EPS Surprise  3M Company Price and EPS Surprise | 3M Company QuoteUnited Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) is also scheduled to report results before the opening bell. In the impending quarter, the company’s earnings are expected to rise 2% year over year on 5.2% higher revenues. However, United Technologies’ financial performance depends on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries. Also, it strongly relies on suppliers, including third-party contract manufacturing and commodity markets, to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems, and that that exposes the company to market price volatility and availability risks. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its UTC Aerospace Systems segment’s revenues is pegged at $3,642 million, significantly down from $3,803 million in the prior quarter. Further, Pratt & Whitney segment’s revenues are likely to come in at $4,280 million compared with $4,461 million in the previous quarter.Our proven model does not show that United Technologies is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is -0.75%, with the former pegged at $1.50 and the latter at $1.51. Moreover, United Technologies has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

677,MMM,"3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before the opening bell.The company has a decent earnings history, surpassing estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.2%. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of $2.10, delivering a beat of 3.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider3M enjoys diversified product portfolio. However, the company’s growth initiatives are largely dependent on timing and market acceptances of its product offerings that include 3M’s ability to frequently renew its pipeline of new offerings and bring those to market at acceptable price points. Also, the company has to manage commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts.Moreover, the company’s global presence makes it susceptible to tremendous local competitive pressure, particularly in Brazil, China, India and Indonesia. In order to survive the stiff competitive environment, 3M has to locally develop, manufacture, hire and purchase. These, in turn, are likely to reduce its profitability to some extent due to continuous investments in value drivers that act as a hedge against stiff competition.Given 3M’s international presence, adverse foreign currency translations might affect its net investment in foreign subsidiaries and cause instability in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions moving ahead. These undermine the company’s long-term growth potential to some extent. Additionally, 3M is facing increased pension expenses of late. The related extra costs are likely to be a drag on the company’s bottom line in the impending quarter as well.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from the Industrial segment (which constitutes a major portion of 3M’s total revenues) remains high at $2,883 million, reflecting growth of 6.4% year over year. Also, the company’s portfolio restructuring efforts by divesting assets bode well for its growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for 3M this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: 3M has an Earnings ESP of +0.27%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.51 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.50. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.3M Company Price and EPS Surprise 3M Company Price and EPS Surprise | 3M Company QuoteZacks Rank: 3M has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which makes surprise prediction difficult.As it is we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Crane Company (CR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.32% and a Zacks Rank #2.Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.45% and a Zacks Rank of 2.IDEX Corporation (IEX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

678,MMM,"General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) core business — GE Power — recently unveiled the most comprehensive energy storage platform, GE Reservoir. The Reservoir already has a 20 MW, 80 MWh pre-launch commitment and this is likely to expand GE’s 10-year footprint in the energy storage space and build upon recent successes and milestones. It delivers the new type of energy system that customers are looking to manage electricity’s next chapter.The energy landscape is undergoing an unprecedented paradigm shift based on growth of renewables, decentralization of power and digitization. GE’s Reservoir platform is developed with innovative technology from GE’s Global Research Center and has a flexible, compact energy storage solution for AC or DC coupled systems. It is expected to deliver a suite of customized storage solutions to help customers address new challenges and seek new opportunities in a rapidly transforming power grid. It also enables cost-effective distribution, storage and utilization of cleaner and more reliable power where and when it is needed the most. It can fit into any setting from centralized grid systems to the most remote villages and communities.Road AheadGE’s Reservoir offers energy providers new degrees of flexibility as well as highly customized solutions for customers with unprecedented levels of resilience and operational efficiency in hybrid generation, grid operation and energy management. The platform leverages Predix and Edge controls technologies to provide data-driven insights that help energy operators enhance their systems. Digital technologies leverage GE’s unique and unparalleled technical and industry domain knowledge across the entire energy ecosystem from generation to consumption.The 1.2 MW, 4 MWh Reservoir storage unit is the fundamental building block of GE’s Reservoir platform. It is a modular solution that integrates GE’s Battery Blade design (module stack design) with key technologies from across the company’s portfolio to achieve an industry-leading energy density, footprint and lifetime performance. GE’s proprietary Blade Protection Unit actively balances the safety, life and production of each battery Blade, improving battery life by up to 15% and reducing fault currents up to five times. Overall, GE’s Reservoir has the potential to deliver the most comprehensive energy storage platform to help meet the energy industry’s rapidly evolving requirements.Share Price MovementGE Power is the largest business segment of the company in terms of corporate revenues. However, the business has been a drag on earnings in the last few quarters as global demand waned with increasing popularity of renewable energy sources, overcapacity, lower utilization and fewer outages. GE has underperformed the industry in the last three months, with an average loss of 17.8% compared with a decline of 4% for the latter. It remains to be seen if GE can turn around its operations and benefit in the future from this upgradation in its power space. Zacks Rank and Key PicksGeneral Electric carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

679,MMM,"Industrial goods manufacturer Raven Industries, Inc. (RAVN  -  Free Report) reported strong fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results, with GAAP earnings of $8.4 million or 23 cents per share compared with $4.4 million or 12 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The 92% increase in GAAP earnings was primarily driven by significant operating leverage within Engineered Films.GAAP earnings for fiscal 2018 more than doubled to $41 million or $1.13 per share from $20.2 million or 56 cents per share a year ago, owing to significant top-line growth in all three operating segments.     For the fiscal fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased to 24 cents from 12 cents in the year-ago quarter. However, the reported earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents.Operational Update  Fiscal fourth quarter revenues increased 39% to $95.8 million from $68.9 million in the year-ago quarter, with each of the three segments reporting double-digit growth led by Engineered Films at 61% year-over-year improvement in sales. However, quarterly revenues slightly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $97 million. Gross profit for the quarter increased 54.1% year over year to $29.8 million while gross margin improved to 31.1% from 28%.Revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 36% year over year to $377.3 million from $277.4, driven by significant sales growth across all three operating divisions, with Engineered Films achieving growth of more than 50% year over year.

Operating margin increased 280 basis points (bps) to 11.9% of net sales from 9.1% in the year-ago quarter. The significant improvement in profitability was principally driven by Engineered Films' improved margins and leverage of corporate expenses over significantly higher sales.Raven Industries, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Raven Industries, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Raven Industries, Inc. QuoteSegmental PerformanceApplied Technology: Sales from this segment improved 17.6% year over year to $30.5 million. Domestic sales were up 21.1% and international sales jumped 6.2%. Despite continued lackluster market dynamics, the division continues to drive sales growth by successfully introducing new products and building on key OEM relationships.Operating income for the segment was $5.8 million, reflecting a decrease of 8.7% from the prior-year quarter, owing to higher expenses and investments. Operating margin decreased 550 bps year over year to 19.1% of net sales from 24.6% in the year-ago quarter.Engineered Films: The segment reported strong sales of $55.6 million, reflecting an increase of 61% year over year, driven by organic growth in the geomembrane and industrial markets.

However, the segment incurred operating loss of $43 million against operating profit of $244 million in the year-ago quarter due to unfavorable mix and contract timing. Results were not consistent with company's long-term expectations.Financial UpdateRaven ended the fiscal year with cash and cash equivalents of $40.5 million compared with $50.6 million in the prior year.

680,MMM,"United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) division, Pratt & Whitney and its business partner Embraer, received Type Certification from three regulatory agencies — the Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil in Brazil, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety — for their new E190-E2 aircraft.The aircraft is exclusively powered by the Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine and is scheduled to enter into service with Widerøe Airlines, a Nordic airline company, from April 2018. Given the level of complexity involved in the E2 program, receiving statutory clearances is a testament to the companies’ dedication, hard work and teamwork. With this, together they have achieved a significant milestone in the aerospace industry.   Pratt & Whitney is one of the world’s leading suppliers of aircraft engines for the commercial, military, business jet and general aviation markets. It provides high-end technology products and services to the aerospace industries worldwide. United Technologies’ revenue-generating potential and profitability are likely to improve with this latest development.  In addition, the company expects that the strategic moves will further ensure a successful entry and production ramp-up of its GFT engines to thwart intense competition from peers. Moreover, United Technologies also has a strong aftermarket business. The company not only manufactures and sells primary products such as aircraft engines and helicopters but also sells spare parts and offers related services to keep those primary products running. The company’s aftermarket services business is relatively stable compared to new product delivery and it helps offset the negative impact of downturns in the new products market.Moreover, United Technologies has restructured its aerospace unit. These included an overhaul of its organizational structure in the aerospace business along with some key changes in the leadership positions within it. United Technologies anticipates that the streamlined organizational set-up would enable it to better serve its employees, customers and suppliers. United Technologies has outperformed the industry in the last three months with an average return of 7.6% against a loss of 4.7% for the latter.United Technologies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Raven Industries, Inc. (RAVN  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Barloworld Ltd.

681,MMM,"President Trump called for tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum imports that could hurt corporations as well as consumers. Such tariffs also stirred fears of a trade dispute between the United States and China. This in turn propelled Wall Street’s fear gauge index above its historic average and dragged the broader markets down.Inflation scare leading to rate hikes had already triggered a sudden panic among investors. After all, rate hikes will raise borrowing costs, eventually denting corporate profits and affecting the U.S. economy. Amid such uncertainty, investing in dividend aristocrats seems prudent, as these provide higher total returns with lower volatility and are undoubtedly the holy grail of investing.Tariffs to Affect U.S. CorporationsWall Street began March on a sour note after Trump said that the United States will impose steel and aluminum tariffs. Trump said that the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum. Such a protectionist trade policy may be one of the widest-reaching trade action he has taken to date, but it has triggered a lot of concern among corporations and consumers.Tariffs will increase the cost of companies that rely heavily on aluminum and steel, like auto and plane makers. Needless to say, shares of Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report), General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) dipped around 3%. In fact, Corporate America has cautioned Trump that tariffs could backfire. After all, imports make up for about a third of the steel American business houses use every year.Higher prices on steel and aluminum, furthermore, will compel companies that rely on such products to pass on some of the costs to consumers. Increased consumer prices may in the long run hamper sales growth and affect the company, leading to job losses.Wall Street is Worried About a Trade WarTrump’s contentious tariff announcement has raised apprehensions about retaliation from China and other major U.S. trading partners. China cautioned America to abide by multilateral trade rules and not to harm the delicate global economy. We shouldn’t forget that China is the world’s dominant steel producer and Trump’s tariff moves could easily start a trade war between them.Li Xinchuang, vice secretary general of the China Iron and Steel Association, added that imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports is an “extremely stupid move.” This will make U.S. industries fall behind globally during a period when “China is in its prime.”Tariffs also raise threats of a trade war with America’s closest allies, Canada. And why not? Canada is the top exporter of both steel and aluminum to the United States. Canada is solely responsible for manufacturing 17% of all the U.S. steel imports and 43% of all aluminum imports. Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland, in the meantime, has announced that “should restrictions be imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum products, Canada will take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers.”Rate Hike Fears LoomConcerns about trade came at a time when the broader market is already on a roller-coaster ride. The broader S&P 500 and the Dow tanked nearly 4% in February. Both the bourses had their worst month in two years. Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) soared 15% on Mar 1, indicating that turbulence has picked up as well.Investors remain worried that rise in inflation in the near term will prompt the Fed to hike short-term interest rates at a faster pace than expected. This in turn will increase borrowing costs for business and consumers, which will eventually lead to a slowdown in the economy. It’s important to also note that an easy monetary policy helped the equity market notch a nearly nine-year bull run.Inflation to RiseRecent hike in pay levels raised worries about higher commodity prices. Wage growth hit the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years, according to the Labor Department. Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009. Americans are now getting fatter paychecks mostly due to a tighter labor market, tax cut policy and a rise in the minimum wage threshold in several states.Consumers have also been ramping up their spending levels of late as they are largely benefiting from a rise in income. Traders predict that such upbeat consumer outlays will fuel inflation (read more: US Consumers Most Confident in 17 Years: Top 4 Picks).Minutes of the Jan 30-31 Federal Open Market Committee meeting has already shown that several officials expect inflation to move up this year and touch the Fed’s 2% target. Only a small number of them forecast inflation to fall short of 2%.Why Dividend Aristocrats? 5 Solid ChoicesGiven the aforesaid concerns, investing in dividend aristocrats seems judicious.

682,MMM,"General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 20, before the opening bell. The company’s Aviation segment is likely to report lower profit in the quarter, thanks to challenging market conditions.Modest Q4 PerformanceIn fourth-quarter 2017, GE Aviation revenues were flat year over year at $7,222 million, as Equipment revenues (which declined 6% on fewer legacy engine shipments) offset higher LEAP engine shipments. Services revenues improved 6% on higher commercial spares and military.Orders rose 11% to $8 billion, driven by Equipment and Services. Equipment orders rose 2% year over year, while service orders grew 17% (driven by higher commercial spares business).Operating profit of $1,786 million was up 2% primarily driven by favorable volume and mix, cost productivity and value gap, partially offset by margin pressure from higher LEAP shipments. Operating margin expanded 40 basis points (bps) to 24.7%.Accounting for 23% of total revenues in fourth-quarter 2017, Aviation forms an integral part of GE as CEO John Flannery intends to focus on three core segments — Power, Aviation and Healthcare. He aims to gradually exit all other businesses to plug the downtrend in its shares.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aviation revenues in fourth-quarter 2017 was pegged at $7,091 million compared with $6,804 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Operating profit for the segment was expected at $1,352 million, down from $1,684 million in the prior-year quarter. The downside was caused by pressure from higher LEAP shipments.Overall Q1 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for theIndustrial segment profit in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $2,660 million, reflecting a decline of 26.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $3,622 million. Total revenues for the industrial segment are likely to decline to $26,425 million sequentially, from $32,214 million in fourth-quarter 2017.The company is likely to report lower industrial segment profit in the quarter, thanks to higher operating costs. GE’s fourth-quarter earnings are likely to be hit by high overall expenses with the Zacks Consensus Estimate being pegged at 11 cents. (Read more: Weak Power & Transportation Margins to Hurt GE's Q1 Earnings)Moving ForwardFlannery has termed 2018 as a ‘reset year’ and is contemplating to spin off its operations to maximize shareholder returns. In addition, GE aims to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. The company intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve liquidity.Amid such drastic portfolio restructuring initiatives, management decided to continue with its inclination for the Aviation segment, which is one of the three core segments.Other stocks from the industry that are likely to report their first-quarter 2018 earnings include 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report).Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

Seattle was the index’s top performer on both a month-to-month and year-over-year basis, +1.7% and +12.7%, respectively.No cities experienced monthly or yearly price declines. The worst-performing of the 20 cities represented in the index was Chicago: +0.1% month over month and +2.6% year over year.

684,MMM,"Manufacturers in the United States witnessed a solid start to 2018, per data released by IHS Markit. The Flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) survey showed that production volumes and new orders have been reporting robust growth. Moreover, strong export growth has also been supporting manufacturers in the United States.Into the HeadlinesUnited States Flash Manufacturing PMI increased to 55.5 in January compared with 55.1 in December. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. Coming to drivers of manufacturing growth, IHS Markit Flash U.S. Manufacturing Output Index increased to 56.2 in January compared with 55.9 in December, a 12-month high.Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said, ""January saw an encouraging start to the year for the US economy. Business activity across the manufacturing and service sectors continued to expand, driving further job gains as companies expanded capacity. Manufacturing is faring especially well, in part thanks to the weaker dollar, providing an important spur to the economy at the start of the year.""Given the excessive dependence of American manufacturers on overseas customers, a weaker dollar coupled with strong global growth bode well for the U.S. manufacturing sector, as goods were cheaper for international customers. PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish ETF (UUP  -  Free Report) is down 2.1% so far this year and has declined 9.2% in a year.Economic ScenarioComing to the economic data, United States’ GDP grew 3.2% in the third quarter compared with 3.1% in the previous quarter.

685,MMM,"Along with a new full slate of Q4 earnings results ahead of today’s opening bell, we also see Initial Jobless Claims reported for last week. The headline number of 233K is higher than the previous week by 17K claims (the previous week itself was revised down to 216K from 220K originally reported), but falls nicely within the comfortable range between 225K-250K jobless claims we’ve largely seen over the past couple years.Continuing claims fell last week to 1.937 million from an upwardly revised 1.965 million the previous week. The 4-week moving average now sits at 240K initial jobless claims per week, which smooths out a bit of the week-to-week volatility we’ve seen recently, going back to the hurricanes that ripped through the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico late last summer. In fact, claims numbers in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands indicate that a full recovery in those areas has not yet been realized.Two Dow components reported solid Q4 earnings results in today’s pre-market, as well — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)-rated Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated 3M Corp. (MMM  -  Free Report) both outperformed expectations, and are sending the Dow 30 index up more than 100 points ahead of the market open.Heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar posted a 22% positive earnings surprise when it put up $2.16 per share, breezing past the $1.77 in the Zacks consensus estimate. Revenues in the quarter of $12.9 billion beat estimates by a cool $1 billion, and continues its impressive string of bottom-line beats — now 12 straight quarters. Full-year guidance also looks robust, now at a range of $8.25-9.25 per share; the Zacks consensus estimate had been $8.02 per share. For more on CAT’s earnings, click here.3M also outperformed expectations on its top and bottom lines this morning, with $2.10 per share on $7.99 billion in revenues outpacing the $2.03 per share and $7.88 billion we were looking for. Full-year guidance was also ratcheted up significantly to $10.20-10.70 per share; the previous Zacks consensus was $9.83 per share. MMM shares are up 2.5% in the pre-market. For more on MMM’s earnings, click here.More airlines companies have also posted new earnings results: American (AAL  -  Free Report) posted 95 cents per share for a 2-cent beat on $10.6 billion in revenues that squeaked out a beat over the $10.58 billion expected. Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report) beat by a penny to 77 cents per share, and revenues of $5,274 million topped the $5,242 million in the Zacks consensus.Defense companies also hit the tape ahead of the bell: Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) surpassed expectations to $2.82 per share versus the $2.75 expected, with revenues of $6.63 billion easily beat the $6.37 billion we were looking for. Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report), however, although it beat bottom-line estimates by a penny to $2.03 per share, missed its top-line estimate when it posted $6.78 billion as opposed to the $6.83 billion estimate.

687,MMM,"Corning Inc (GLW  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr24. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 6.39%.In fourth-quarter 2017, earnings of 49 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. Core revenues increased 7% year over year to $2.74 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.63 billion.For the first quarter 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share and revenues are projected to be 30 cents and $2.51 billion, respectively.We believe strength in the company’s Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials business lines to drive top-line growth.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderCorning’s results are likely to benefit from its optical communications segment, primarily owing to strong demand for fiber products. The company’s initiative to strengthen the segment is evident from the announced acquisition of 3M’s communication (MMM  -  Free Report) market division which will not only expand worldwide market access but also enhance its product portfolio.Management remains positive about TV screen size growth and ramping production of BOEs Gen 10.5 in Hefei.Moreover, robust adoption of Gorilla Glass 5 bodes well for its specialty materialssegment. The trending glass backs on devices and smart watches leveraging Gorilla Glass for its cover material is a tailwind.Additionally, the company’s focus on expanding its footprint in the automotive market driven by gas particulate filters (“GPFs”) and a Gorilla-sized automotive glass business is a positive.Furthermore, Corning collaborated with AU Optronics Corporation (“AUO”) to launch a solar panel project in Taiwan to provide sufficient electricity to address the power needs of roughly 300 U.S. households a year. The rooftop solar power equipment installed at Corning’s two manufacturing facilities will help the company reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by more than 2,375 metric tons per year.However, weakness in the Display segment remains a headwind. Management anticipates LCD glass market to grow low-single digits on account of seasonality.What Does Our Model SayAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Notably, sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Corning Incorporated Price and Consensus Corning Incorporated Price and Consensus | Corning Incorporated QuoteCorning has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which indicates an unlikely positive earnings surprise.

688,MMM,"With results from 87 S&P 500 members already out, we are off to a strong start in Q1 earnings season. The earnings and revenue growth rates and the proportion of positive earnings surprises are tracking materially above historical periods. Positive revenue surprises aren’t as numerous as we had seen at this stage in the preceding earnings season, but are nevertheless tracking in-line with historical levels. Estimates for the current period (2018 Q2) haven’t moved much since the Q1 earnings season got underway, but that will likely start showing up this week as move into the heart of the earnings season, with more than 680 companies reporting March quarter results, including 178 S&P 500 members. By the end of this week, we will have seen Q1 results from more than half of the S&P 500 members. With more than 35% S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week, we will have representation from every sector, but the notable ones are below.Monday, April 23rd: We have 10 index members reporting results today, with Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) as the key report coming after the market’s close. The search giant is expected to earn $9.21 per share on $24.29 billion in revenues, up +9.2% and +20.7% from the year-earlier period, respectively. The revisions trend has been negative, with the current Zacks Consensus EPS of $9.21 down from $9.27 a month back. The stock has struggled since the weaker than expected results for the preceding period on February 1st, with the stock lagging the broader Tech sector this year. Alphabet shares are up +3% in the year-to-date period vs. +5.6% gain for the sector and +1.3% gain for the S&P 500 index. Tuesday, April 24th: We have 33 index members on deck to report results this day, with Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report), Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), Coca Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and 3M (MMM  -  Free Report) as the notable reports, all in the morning session. Caterpillar shares have struggled as trade issues have taken center stage, with the stock down -2.1% in the year-to-date period vs. +1.2% gain for the S&P 500 index. The company is expected to earn $2.11 per share on $11.6 billion in revenues, up +64.8% and +17.9% from the year-earlier period, respectively. Estimates have been going up, with the current $2.11 EPS estimate up $2.07 a month back and $1.76 three months back.   Wednesday, April 25th: A busy day on the reporting front, with 49 index members on deck report quarterly results, including Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) in the morning and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) after the market’s close. Facebook is expected to earn $1.36 per share on $11.5 billion in revenues, up +10.5% and +42.7% from the year-earlier period, respectively. The company’s tally of daily active users will be of as much importance to the market as its top- and bottom-line results. Also important will be engagement level following the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the impact the privacy issue may have on ad revenues. Facebook shares have lagged the Tech sector this year, with the stock down -5.4% in the year-to-date period vs. +5.7% gain for the sector. Thursday, April 26th: A very busy day, with 68 S&P 500 members reporting March-quarter results, with Amazon AMZN, Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) among some of the very major reporters this day. Amazon is expected to earn $1.19 per share on $50.2 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year change of a decline of -19.6% and gain of +40.4%, respectively. The company has long ‘trained’ the market not to look for earnings performance in its quarterly results, and that will likely be case this time around. The key factor will be overall revenues and performance of the company’s cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The stock has been a strong performer this year, up +30.7% in the year-to-date period, though President Trump’s persistent negative tweets continue to be a headline issue. Friday, April 27th: Exxon (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) are the notable companies of the 16 S&P 500 members reporting results Friday morning. Exxon is expected to earn $1.20 per share on $67.3 billion in revenues, up +26.3% and +6.4% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Both the stocks have made gains in recent days on favorable crude oil momentum, but they remain in negative territory this year (-5% for XOM and -1.4% for CVX). Q1 Earnings Season Scorecard (as of Friday, April 20th)Total earnings for the 87 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up +25% from the same period last year on +10.7% higher revenues, with 82.8% beating EPS estimates and 67.8% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 62.1%. To put these results in a historical context, the charts below compare the results thus far with what we had seen from the same group of 87 index members in other recent periods.  As mentioned earlier, earnings and revenue growth rate and the proportion of positive EPS surprises is tracking above what we have been seeing from the same group of 87 index members. But revenue surprises aren’t as widespread as was the case in the preceding earnings season.In other words, the revenue growth momentum that we have been seeing over the last couple of earnings seasons is still in place, but revenue surprises are tracking below what we had seen in the preceding period and only in-line with the 4-quarter period, as the chart below shows:Finance Sector Scorecard (as of Friday, April 20th)We now have Q1 results from 29 of the 98 Finance sector companies in the S&P 500 index. Keep in mind, however, that these 29 companies account for 52.5% of the sector’s total market capitalization in the index.Total earnings for these 29 Finance companies are up +27.8% from the same period last year on +9.1% higher revenue growth, with 89.7% beating EPS estimates and 51.7% beating revenue estimates. The comparison charts below put the results thus far in a historical context: As you can see in the chart above, the sector’s growth picture is materially tracking above what we have been seeing in recent years, reflecting the combined effect of tax cuts, higher interest rates and more ‘normal’ capital market activity. The right-hand side chart shows that earnings surprises are very numerous, but revenue surprises are on the weak side.For the quarter as a whole, total Finance sector earnings are expected to be up +27% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues. This would follow +0.6% earnings growth in 2017 Q4 on +4% higher revenues.The sector’s earnings growth momentum is expected to continue in the coming quarters as well, as the chart below shows:Please note that the sector’s strong growth in Q1 and beyond isn’t a function of easy comparisons, but actual growth. You can see this in the dollar value of total sector earnings in the chart below:Expectations for 2018 Q1 as a WholeLooking at Q1 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index expected to be up +18.3% from the same period last year on +7.7% higher revenues. This would follow the +13.4% earnings growth on +8.6% revenue growth in the 2017 Q4 earnings season, the best quarterly performance in more than 6 years.The chart below shows 2018 Q1 earnings growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 5 quarters. As you can see, the growth pace is expected to accelerate in Q2 and continue in the following quarters:As you can imagine, expectations for full-year 2018 are for an impressive showing, with total earnings for the S&P 500 index expected to be +18% from the year-earlier level on +5.3% higher revenues. If achieved, this will be the highest annual growth pace for the index since 2010.The table below shows the summary picture for 2018 Q1, contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding period:As you can see, the Energy sector remains a big growth contributor in Q1, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +59.6% from the year-earlier period on +15.9% higher revenues. But growth for the quarter would still be in double-digits even on an ex-Energy basis (last row in the table above).What is driving the strong Q1 growth isn’t the Energy sector, but rather the breadth of growth across all sectors, with double-digit earnings growth for 11 out of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Technology and Finance.For the Technology sector, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up +20.9% on +11.5% higher revenues, which would follow the sector’s impressive +24.2% earnings growth on +11.1% higher revenue growth.The Finance sector, which sat out the preceding quarter with an essentially flat showing, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up +27% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues.Driving the Finance sector’s strong growth in Q1 and beyond is the combined effect of tax cuts, higher interest rates and an improved domestic growth environment. Finance sector’s earnings were only up +1.2% in full-year 2017 and in low single digits in the three years prior to that, but are on expected to be up an impressive +25.5% in full-year 2018.The Technology sector, on the other hand, has already been on stronger ground, with full-year 2017 earnings for the sector up +15.8% and expected to be up +17.3% in 2018. The enterprise spending environment was expected to improve this year even before the tax cuts, with the tax windfall expected to give a much needed boost to those trends. On top of these we have the existing secular trends in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and big data that are expected to remain growth areas in the space.Please note that Technology and Finance aren’t just any two sectors out of the 16 in the S&P 500 index; these two sectors combined are the twin pillars of index’s total profitability, bringing in more than 40% of the index’s total earnings this year. The Energy sector’s outlook has improved, but the sector simply lacks the heft of these two. The Energy sector is expected to bring in about 5% of the index’s total earnings this year.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

689,MMM,"Benchmarks finished at record level on Wednesday as the services sector posted strong growth in September. The ISM Services index hit record high since Aug 2005, hinting at broadly encouraging economic conditions. Meanwhile, the private sector added lesser number of jobs to the U.S. economy in the last month primarily due to losses for small-business sector in the wake of two devastating hurricanes that ravaged swathes of Texas and Florida last month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,661.57, gaining 0.1%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.1% to close at 2,537.74. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,534.63, increasing 0.1%. A total of 5.8 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.3 billion shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.05-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by 1.01-to-1 ratio. The CBOE VIX decreased 0.4% to close at 9.47.Benchmarks Continue Breaching RecordsDow continued its stellar showing on Wednesday and posted gains for sixth straight session. The blue-chip index amassed almost 20 points to close at a record high.

This also marked its highest level since Aug 2005 when the index logged a reading 61.3%. The report from ISM also stated that non-manufacturing sector showed strong growth despite hurricanes Harvey and Irma ravaging swathes of Texas and Florida. This augurs well for the economy. Of the 17 non-manufacturing sectors which were surveyed, 14 depicted growth in the last month. Three of the industries which lagged behind included educational services, mining and agriculture, and forestry, fishing and hunting.Furthermore, business activity also surged almost 4 percentage points in the month of September, posting growth for 98 months on the trot. Meanwhile, new orders index also increased to 63% in September from 57.1% in August. Also, the employment index grew to 56.8% in the month.Job Additions in the Private Sector SufferDespite increasing, the number of new job additions in September came in lower than last month’s figure. According to the latest report by ADP, there were a total of 135,000 — hitting an 11 month low since October 2016 — jobs that were added by the private sector to the economy. Economists had expected that the service sector would add about 140,000 jobs. Comparatively, the number of job additions in August was 237,000, revised later to 228,000.Economists attributed lower number of job additions in September to small-business sector losing jobs in the wake of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. However, it should be noted that medium and large businesses reported higher number of addition in jobs in September, with manufacturing sector gaining as many as 18,000 jobs.Stocks That Made HeadlinesShell Calls Off Thailand Gas Field Divestment DealEuropean oil giant Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) has decided not to proceed with the $900-million deal to offload stake in an offshore Thailand Gas Field to a unit of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation.

692,MMM,"Corning Inc (GLW  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Nov 30.Notably, the Gorilla Glass maker has a positive record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 8.7%. In the last quarter, Corning delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.9%.We expect Corning’s results to be driven by strength in the optical communications segment, primarily owing to strong demand for fiber products. Moreover, solid demand for Gorilla Glass 5, expanding footprint in the automotive market and acquisition of 3M’s communication market division are other catalysts.Corning reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 43 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Earnings increased 2.4%, year over year and sequentially.Growth was driven by improvement in revenues. Core revenues increased 6% year over year to $2.70 billion, which comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.58 billion. Revenues increased 4.2% on a sequential basis.The results reflect strength in the company’s Optical Communications and Specialty Materials business lines.Corning’s shares have returned 7.7% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s 6.3% rally.Expect What?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 47 cent, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 6%. Notably, the earnings estimate has moved north over the last 30 days. Further, Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.63 billion, up roughly 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Acquisitions and Product Adoptions: Key CatalystsCorning recently announced that it has agreed to take over 3M Company’s (MMM  -  Free Report) Communication Markets Division completely in an all-cash deal for approximately $900 million. Acquisition of 3M’s communication market division will not only strengthen the company’s Optical Communications worldwide market access but also expand Corning’s product portfolio. Moreover, it expects the deal to add 7-9 cents to 2019 earnings.Considering growth witnessed by the Optical Communications market in the last few years, this deal will boost Corning’s revenues and increase overall market share.Further, Ford’s use of Corning Gorilla Glass for its Ford GT is aiding the company to successfully penetrate the 6 billion-square-foot auto glazing market. Corning has also announced a joint venture with Saint-Gobain Sekurit to manufacture, develop and sell lightweight automotive glazing solutions. This venture has allowed the company to move forward in the value chain beyond glass to manufacture and sell glazing solutions with a leading producer.We expect sales to benefit from strong demand for fiber products, as reflected by the Verizon Communications Inc (VZ) deal, which was signed in April.Moreover, the company remains focused on expanding footprint in the automotive market driven by gas particulate filters (GPFs) and a Gorilla-sized automotive glass business.Optical Communications sales are anticipated to increase high-single digit percentage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter.Environmental Technologies sales are projected to increase by low-teens percentage, while Specialty Materials sales are anticipated to increase by low-to-mid teens percentage range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials are currently pegged at $275 million and $389 million, respectively.The Life Sciences business will grow mid-single digit percentage from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Life Sciences revenues is currently pegged at $217 million.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.

693,MMM,"General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) lowered its pension deficit by $2.4 billion in 2017 compared to the previous year owing to solid performance, employer contributions and changes in mortality and salary assumptions. The move marks 8% decrease in its existing $28.7 billion pension deficit. The company is going through tough times tackling the worst shortfall in corporate America.Pension WoesGE’s pension plans cover about 6,18,000 current and former employees. The pension was well funded for many years but the deficit grew over the past decade because of low interest rates and volatile financial markets. The pension trust of the company holds more than 30 million GE shares that declined more than 50% in the previous year. As of now, GE's pension remains the most underfunded on the S&P 500.GE reported $100.3 billion pension plan obligations and $71.6 billion liability in assets for 2017. Pension costs have therefore turned out to be a bottleneck for GE’s earnings growth. With poor performance, stakeholders are concerned as to how the company will generate sources to meet liabilities. Following a management overhaul in mid-2017, GE took steps to shore up the pension fund, including a move announced in November to borrow $6 billion to pre-fund the plan through 2020. Also, the company intends to focus on three core segments — power, aviation and healthcare equipment, which require advanced hi-tech products with a high degree of reliability. These products often generate higher margins and are likely to contribute to higher long-term growth. GE will also benefit from rising interest rates. Every quarter-point increase cuts $2.4 billion from the amount the company will owe its pension plan participants. Light at the End of the Tunnel?General Electric expects a gradual improvement in earnings with structural changes, simplification and cost-cutting initiatives. The company currently anticipates operating earnings in 2018 to be within $1.00-$1.07, with growth momentum in Aviation and Healthcare and continued challenges in the Power segment.Share Price MovementHowever, GE shares have fallen 17% this year, being the worst in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The stock has underperformed the industry in the last three months, with an average loss of 20.1% compared with a decline of 2% for the latter. It remains to be seen if GE at all can benefit in the future from its reduced pension liabilities. Zacks Rank and Key PicksGeneral Electric carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). A few better-ranked stocks in the industry are Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report), Raven Industries, Inc. (RAVN  -  Free Report) and 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report). While Federal Signal and Raven Industries sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 3M has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Federal Signal exceeded estimates in the trailing four quarters with an average of 11.5%.Raven Industries has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 10%. It surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 25.8%. 3M has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 10.2%. It trumped estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 3.2%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

695,MMM,"Leucadia National Corporation  reported relatively healthy fourth-quarter 2017 results with record results from two of its largest businesses, namely Jefferies and National Beef.

696,MMM,"Per Reuters, after a series of setbacks in 2017 followed by the gradual fall in earnings and write-down in stock price, General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is planning to divest its industrial gas engine unit for a consideration of $2 billion. Spinning off industrial gas engine business, including Jenbacher and Waukesha engines, will provide an opportunity for GE to streamline its power division whose profit came down 45% in 2017 due to a sharp fall in sale of power plants and services.Amid this background, GE has possibly hired Citigroup Inc. to prepare a sale process of its industrial gas engine business. Since the matter is confidential, none of the parties have come up with an official statement or have made any comment on it.John Flannery, CEO of GE, had earlier disclosed that in the best interests of the company, there is a possibility of a spin off within even the core businesses of power, aviation and healthcare. As part of business turnaround strategy and to gain back investors’ loyalty, the company seems to put more money in higher revenue generating capacity segments which will help to improve its financial performance indicators in the long run. Presently, the proposed unit for sale makes multi-ton gas turbines that generate on-site power to keep industrial plants running. Jenbacher and Waukesha engines have a range from 100 kilowatts to 10 megawatts that covers small and mid-sized segment of GE’s power business.GE Power is the largest business segment of the company in terms of corporate revenues. However, the business has been a drag on earnings in the last few quarters as global demand waned with increasing popularity of renewable energy sources, overcapacity, lower utilization and fewer outages. GE recorded lower margins in fourth-quarter 2017 due to headwinds in the Power and Transportation segments. Industrial segment operating profit decreased 39% year-over-year to $3,542 million with a decline in profits in Power (down 88%) and Transportation (down 40%), partially offset by a significant rise in profits in Renewable Energy (up 25%) and Healthcare (up 13%).   General Electric has underperformed the industry in the last three months, with an average loss of 15.6% compared with a decline of 1.2% for the latter.General Electric has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

Although, later Mnuchin said that his remarks regarding dollar was “misinterpreted.”Meanwhile, President Trump in the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland said that ""the dollar is going to get stronger and stronger” and eventually he wished the greenback to strengthen. However, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index fell 1.5% for the week to settle at 89.07, following Mnuchin’s comments.

702,MMM,"The United States manufacturing represented by an IHS Markit survey fell to a two-month low. Markit stated in a preliminary report that U.S. manufacturing activity declined to 52.5 in August compared with 53.3 in July. A figure above 50 indicates expansion.Moreover, the manufacturing output index fell to 52.2 in August from 54.1 in July. However, the composite output index increased to 56 from 54.6 in July, primarily driven by an improvement in services business activity, as the index increased to 56.9 from 54.7 in July.Given the strong dependence of American manufacturers on overseas customers, a weaker dollar coupled with strong global growth bode well for the U.S. manufacturing sector, as goods were cheaper for international customers.

706,MMM,"The Dow ended its record run of wins to suffer a dramatic decline near the end of the week. Stellar earnings performances helped the index register its 35th record close for 2017 on Monday. But by Tuesday, the tide had turned with the index closing in the red after Trump sounded off a strong warning to errant North Korea. Such saber rattling ultimately led to significant losses for the blue-chip index as well as broader markets on Thursday.Last Week’s PerformanceThe blue-chip index registered its 34th record for 2017 to finish above the 22,000 threshold yet again last Friday. The index gained 0.3%, ending in the green for the ninth straight trading day. This is highest number of gains recorded since February. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS contributed the most gains toward the index’s stellar performance during this session.Such gains were primarily attributable to an astounding number of job additions in the month of July. A total of 209,000 new jobs were created within the United States. In the past two months alone, there a total of 450,000 new jobs have been added to the economy.The index gained 1.2% last week, marking its second straight weekly increase. The Dow has finished in positive territory now for four out of the five past weeks. The Dow surpassed the 22,000 milestone riding high on performances from JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), 3M (MMM  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs. Also, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) has added 300 points to the blue chip index since February, helping it to cross the psychological milestone.The Dow This WeekThe index increased 0.1% on Monday to register its 35th record close for 2017, ending above the psychological 22,000 mark yet again.

The blue-chip index rose 2.8% since February, with Boeing and Goldman Sachs contributing to the majority of the gains.The index lost 0.2% on Tuesday, ending its 35-session record run of wins for the year on Tuesday, tumbling after Trump sounded off a fresh warning to North Korea. President Trump announced that North Korea would be dealt with “fire and fury like the world has never seen”, if the rogue country continues to threaten the U.S. The blue-chip index was led lower primarily by a drop in shares of Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), DuPont  and Nike NKE.The index declined by 0.2% on Wednesday, briefly slipping below the 22,000 milestone but pared losses to finish above the psychological level. Decline in the Dow was primarily due to losses made by shares of The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) after the media behemoth announced plans to end its distribution deal with Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report).The index lost 0.9% on Thursday even as all benchmarks endured their most dismal trading day since the middle of May. This the third successive session when all three benchmarks have suffered losses and marks the first such reverse since the middle of April.Broader markets were weighed down by heightened tensions between the U.S. and North Korea. The Dow was weighed down primarily by Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs, which lost 3.2% and 2.4%, respectively. Only three of the 30 Dow components managed to close the day with gains.Components Moving the Index Disney posted better-than-expected earnings for the third straight quarter, as it reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 results.

707,MMM,"GE Transportation, one of the operating segments of General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report), recently inked a 10-year framework agreement with Ukraine. Under the agreement, GE will supply 30 Evolution Series freight locomotives including additional locomotive kits and long-term maintenance services to Ukrzaliznytsya or Ukrainian Railways. The deal is valued at more than $1 billion and is considered to be one of the biggest signed by GE in Ukraine so far.The agreement is seen as part of Ukraine's efforts to establish itself as a key player in the European rail hub and trade corridor. It will help the Ukrainian government to improve its rail infrastructure and bring products to market faster and more efficiently, giving a boost to the country’s economic growth. The project will launch a large-scale modernization of Ukrainian Railway's locomotive fleet. In addition to addressing Ukraine's needs for greater mobility, the strategic partnership with GE will provide a powerful impetus to developing domestic manufacturing in the country.Production of the locomotives is expected to start at GE’s Erie plant in Pennsylvania in 2018 with the first delivery to be made in the fourth quarter of the year. The agreement outlines that certain part of the work would be undertaken locally in Ukraine, which will lead to new jobs and contribute to the economic development of the country. Also, the deal is likely to play an important role in strengthening United States-Ukraine relations and will give an excellent opportunity to GE to strengthen its local ties. The company is likely to gain from its increased businesses which will help it to protect the interest of stakeholders.GE has underperformed the industry in the last three months, with an average loss of 21.5% compared with a decline of 3.1% for the latter. Moving forward, the company intends to focus on three core segments — power, aviation and healthcare — which require advanced hi-tech products with a high degree of reliability. These products often generate higher margins and are likely to contribute to higher long-term growth, which would likely improve its sagging shares.  General Electric carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). A few better-ranked stocks in the industry are Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report), Raven Industries, Inc. (RAVN  -  Free Report) and 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report).

708,MMM,"Benchmarks closed mixed on Thursday with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ending in negative territory, even as the Dow finished in the green. Special counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly subpoenaed Trump Organization for Trump’s business-related documents. This factor along with trade war fears weighed on investor sentiment.The S&P 500 fell for fourth straight-day, its longest such stretch of decline since last December. However, the Dow managed to post a one-day rise of around 116 points, after investors indulged in bargain hunting, seeking out blue-chip stocks on the dip.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.5%, or 115.95 points, to close at 24,873.66.

Trump’s protectionist stance raised concerns over a possible retaliation by other countries including China.Additionally, The New York Times reported that special counsel Robert Mueller has subpoenaed the Trump Organization for documents relating to Trump’s businesses. This subpoena was issued in connection with an inquiry into Russian involvement in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Following this development, two key indexes, S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted losses for the fourth consecutive session.The Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) decreased 1.3%, becoming the worst performing sector among the S&P 500. Some of its key holdings, Monsanto Company , CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) and Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report) fell 4.8%, 3.3% and 2.3%, respectively.Investors’ Bargain Hunting Boost the DowRecent uncertainty resulted in decline in stock prices, which encouraged investors to buy on the dip and focus on blue-chip stocks. Following this development, the Dow was the only key index that managed to end in the green. Dow component UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report) increased 1.8% and was the biggest contributor to the blue-chip index’s gains on the day.

The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index slipped to 22.3 in March from 25.8 in February.

709,MMM,"Pratt & Whitney, one of the operating segments of diversified conglomerate United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), according to a Reuters article, has come to the rescue of Indigo Airlines — the biggest carrier in India by market share — by offering spare engines for its grounded jets. The strategic initiative is likely to provide some respite to the beleaguered airlines firm that was forced to cancel about 35-45 flights a day due to technical snag of the engines.The problem stemmed from a series of in-flight engine failures related to the Airbus A320neo aircrafts that use Pratt & Whitney PW1100G engines. The issue was with a knife-edge seal in the high-pressure compressor aft hub on the engine, causing vibrations and three in-service shutdowns. This forced the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) — the regulatory body of India in the field of civil aviation, primarily dealing with safety issues — to ground 11 aircraft fitted with such engines, eight of which belonged to Indigo.Pratt & Whitney has faced recurring problems with these engines that led to repeated grounding of jets in India. In last July, Indigo was forced to take seven aircrafts out of action due to engine failures, while DGCA grounded three more jets in February 2018. Although Pratt & Whitney replaced the original seal in an effort to reduce the planned service interval due to higher degradation, the problem failed to subside.In order to address the current grounding of flights, Pratt & Whitney has reportedly decided to deliver two spare engines today and the remaining within the next 40 days. It is yet to be seen if the company can come up with a permanent solution to fix the issues with these engines of Airbus narrow-body planes.Industry observers widely expected Pratt & Whitney engine business to be the profit driver for its parent firm, United Technologies. However, the engines have failed to live up to the expectations and the business seems to be a drag on overall earnings. Nevertheless, United Technologies has outperformed the industry with an average loss of 0.1% in the last three months compared with a decline of 5.8% for the latter.Despite the current setbacks, the PW1100 engines have proven its mettle in the industry. It has been able to meet the strict quality standards relating to burn, noise and emissions. The engine has the ability to reduce engine fuel consumption by 15% and regulate noise footprint by 50%.Pratt & Whitney is among the world’s leading suppliers of aircraft engines to the commercial, military, business jet and general aviation markets. Its Global Services provide maintenance, repair and overhaul services, including the sale of spare parts and fleet management services for large commercial engines.United Technologies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the industry are 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report), Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report) and Crane Co. (CR  -  Free Report), each carrying Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3M has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.2%.

710,MMM,"The Dow traversed a difficult week, declining over three consecutive trading sessions. Investors remained concerned over the prospects of a trade war following President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Trump’s decision to dismiss Secretary of State Rex Tillerson added to investors’ jitters. Ultimately, investors looking to pick up blue chip stocks on the dip helped the index finish in the green on Thursday.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 1.8% on last Friday, moving past the 25,000 mark for the first time since Feb 28. Upbeat jobs data and lower wage growth subdued inflationary concerns and curbed rate hike fears. The U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February, exceeding the consensus estimate of 208,000 job additions. However, average hourly wages rose only 0.1% in February, lower than January’s 0.3% increase.The index gained 3.3% last week. President Trump signed his tariff plan into law per which fresh levies of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports will be imposed. However, the plan excludes countries like Canada and Mexico, offering Trump a chance to renegotiate terms of the NAFTA with the two countries. Also, the United States wants to discuss national security issues with both these countries.The Dow This WeekThe index declined 0.6% on Monday. Investors remained concerned about the prospects of a trade war following Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum. Fears of this nature dragged industrials lower during the session, a decline which weighed on the broader markets.Three Dow components from this sector, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) declined 1.9%, 0.6% and 2.9%, respectively.The index lost 0.6% on Tuesday after the Trump administration dismissed U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Additionally, Trump ordered Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) to abandon the planned takeover of QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report), following which shares of Qualcomm declined and weighed on the broader markets.Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.2% in February, in line with the consensus estimate. This figure was lower than January’s increase of 0.5%. This development significantly reduced rate hike fears.The index decreased 1% on Wednesday, ending in the red for the third consecutive trading day following concerns over a possible trade war between the U.S. and China. Any hostile move from China will jeopardize Boeing’s performance, which is why its shares fell 2.5%, weighing on the Dow, which registered a one-day decline of around 250 points. Shares of 3M declined 1.4%.The index rebounded on Thursday, increasing 0.5%. Special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly subpoenaed Trump Organization for Trump’s business-related documents.

711,MMM,"Diversified industrial goods manufacturer 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 25. A favorable macroeconomic environment is likely to boost the revenues for the company in the quarter.Whether this can translate into bottom-line growth remains to be seen.Top-Line ExpansionWith primary focus on organic growth, 3M has continually invested in infrastructure and commercialization capability. Moreover, substantial investments in R&D coupled with the ability to convert such high R&D spends into up-cycle market share gains and strong pricing powers determine the company’s success.In October 2017, the company decided to divest its Communication Markets business for $900 million in order to focus on its core businesses. Since 2012, 3M has done significant portfolio restructuring — divesting assets that no longer fit in its strategy and making newer investments in more lucrative markets. The objective of this endeavor is to improve customer relevance and productivity through a leaner operating structure.Such concerted efforts by the company to augment its leading position in the market are expected to favorably impact its revenues in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 3M’s fourth-quarter revenues is $7,878 million, significantly higher than reported revenues of $7,329 million in the prior-year quarter. Higher revenues are expected across all the segments of the company. The Industrial segment, which had grossed more than 33% of the company’s revenues in the third quarter of 2017, is expected to generate $2,682 million, higher than the reported figure of $2,524 million of the prior-year quarter.Safety and Graphics, Electronics and Energy, Health Care and Consumer segments are expected to generate revenues of $1,455 million, $1,260 million, $1,488 million and $1,135 million, respectively, up from $1,301 million, $1,208 million, $1,379 million and $1,094 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Other Key FactorsAt present, the company is focused on three key levers namely, portfolio management, investment in innovation and business transformation. For portfolio management, 3M intends to concentrate on its most profit-making and fastest-growing businesses. To this effect, the company has taken steps to prune its businesses from 40 to 24. In 2018, 3M plans to increase investments in research and development to $1.9 billion or about 6% of sales for continued focus on the second lever. The third lever is enabling the company to better serve customers with even more agility and efficiency.Moreover, 3M is standardizing its business processes through a new, global ERP system. The company expects these efforts to result in $500-$700 million in annual operational savings by 2020, and an additional $500 million through reduction in working capital requirements.Our proven model conclusively shows that 3M is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.72% as the former is pegged at $2.07 and the latter at $2.03.

712,MMM,"An investor friendly jobs report led the benchmarks to close in the green on Friday, with the Nasdaq reaching an all-time high. Additionally, the Dow moved past the level of 25,000 again after Feb 28. Upbeat jobs data along with lower wage growth subdued inflationary concerns and reduced rate hike fears.  All the key indexes not only ended in positive territory on Friday, but also registered weekly gains. The weekly rise came mainly after Trump signed proclamations on aluminum and steel imports, but exempted neighbors Canada and Mexico from these tariffs.Additionally, the bull market is now nine years old, overcoming a plethora of challenges. This is the second largest bull-run in history after the 1990s rally that ended with the tech bubble burst in 2000. The rally came with five corrections (a decline of 10% or more); the last one witnessed in the beginning of February 2018.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 1.8%, or 440.53 points, to close at 25,335.74. The S&P 500 rose 1.7% to close at 2,786.57. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,560.81, gaining 1.8%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 6.7% to close at 15.43. During the intraday trade the VIX reached its lowest level since Feb 1.A total of 6.82 billion shares were traded on Friday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.47 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.77-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.81-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.Weak Wage Growth Eased Inflation FearsThe U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February, significantly higher than the consensus estimate of 208,000 job additions. Moreover, a sharp upward revision of January’s job numbers indicated strong job additions were likely this year. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.7% in February. However, average hourly wages rose only 0.1% in February, lower than January’s 0.3% increase. Average hourly earnings also rose 2.6% over the year.After strong wage growth in January markets entered into correction territory last month. Disappointing wage growth and strong job additions in February thus, soothed inflation fears. Encouraging jobs report had a positive impact on the broader markets. The Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) climbed 2.5%, becoming the best performing sector among the S&P 500. Dow components, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co.

714,MMM,"General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 20, before the opening bell. The company’s Healthcare segment is likely to report higher revenues and strong margins, owing to improved market dynamics and growth in medical diagnostics market.Impressive Q4 PerformanceIn fourth-quarter 2017, GE Healthcare’s revenues had jumped 6% year over year to $5,402 million, with orders improving 6% to $5.1 billion, driven by Healthcare Systems and Life Sciences businesses. Stable U.S. and European markets as well as strong growth in emerging markets boosted revenues. Renewables onshore contributed to growth despite significant price pressure in the industry.Orders for the segment increased 8% in the developed markets and 12% in emerging markets driven by strength in China. On a product basis, healthcare system orders were bolstered by higher demand for ultrasound and imaging products along with decent performance in mammography and CT. Order for life sciences products were driven by bioprocess and core imaging.Operating profit was up 13% to $1,159 million, driven by volume and productivity gains. However, the same was partially offset by price and program investments. Operating margin expanded 130 basis points (bps) to 21.5%.Accounting for 18.6% of total revenues in fourth-quarter 2017, Healthcare forms an integral part of GE as CEO John Flannery intends to focus on three core segments — Power, Aviation and Healthcare. He aims to gradually exit all other businesses to plug the downtrend in the company’s shares.In fact, earlier this month, GE inked an agreement to sell a trio of its health-care information technology businesses to private equity firm Veritas Capital for $1.05 billion in cash. The transaction includes GE’s Enterprise Financial Management, Ambulatory Care Management and Workforce Management software assets. This divestiture seems appropriate as the conglomerate has struggled to gain a dominant foothold in a crammed market for health-care workforce management and billing software, of late.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Healthcare revenues in first-quarter 2018 is currently pegged at $4,439 million, up from $4,291 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Operating profit for the segment is estimated at $686 million, up from $643 million reported in the prior year.Overall Q1 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Industrial segment profit in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $2,660 million, reflecting a decline of 26.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $3,622 million. Total revenues for the industrial segment are likely to be down sequentially to $26,425 million from $32,214 million in fourth-quarter 2017.The industrial goods manufacturer is likely to report lower industrial segment profit in the quarter owing to higher operating costs. GE’s first-quarter 2018 earnings are likely to be hit by high overall expenses with the Zacks Consensus Estimate pegged at 11 cents. (Read more: Weak Power & Transportation Margins to Hurt GE's Q1 Earnings)Moving ForwardFlannery has termed 2018 as a ‘reset year’ and is contemplating to spin off its operations to maximize shareholder returns. In addition, GE aims to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. The company intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve liquidity.Amid such drastic portfolio restructuring initiatives, management decided to continue with its inclination for the Healthcare segment, which is one of the three core segments.Other stocks from the industry that are likely to report first-quarter 2018 earnings include 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc.

717,MMM,"Industrial goods manufacturer General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 24. The company’s Aviation segment is likely to report lower profit in the quarter owing to challenging market conditions.Whether this would hurt the bottom line of the company remains to be seen.Solid 3Q PerformanceIn third-quarter 2017, GE Aviation recorded revenues of $6,816 million, up 8% year over year driven by strong growth in global passengers and air freight volume. Orders in the quarter improved 12% to $6.9 billion led by equipment orders (up 8%). The military equipment orders were up 10% year over year. Service orders grew 13% with commercial services up 11% on spare parts growth of 21%. Military services were up 56% driven by orders for advanced combat engine and advanced helicopter programs.Operating profit of $1,680 million was up 12% primarily driven by volume, structural cost productivity and value gap, partially offset by margin pressure from higher LEAP shipments. Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 24.6%.Accounting for 20.4% of total revenues in third-quarter 2017, Aviation forms an integral part of GE as CEO John Flannery intends to focus on just three core segments — Power, Aviation and Healthcare. He aims to gradually exit all other businesses to plug the downtrend in its shares. Incidentally, GE was the worst performer of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2017, tanking 44.8% in the year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aviation revenues in fourth-quarter 2017 is currently pegged at $7,203 million compared with $7,187 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Operating profit for the segment is expected to be $1,592 million, down from $1,749 million in the prior year as margins are expected to be under pressure from higher LEAP shipments.Overall 4Q ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Industrial segment profit in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $4,954 million compared with year-ago profit of approximately $5,842 million. Almost all the sub-segments within the Industrial segment are likely to record leaner profits on a year-over-year basis except Healthcare. Total Industrial segment’s revenues are likely to be marginally up to $31,570 million from $31,236 million in the year-earlier quarter, although total corporate revenues are expected to be down to $32,693 million from $33,088 million.The company is likely to report lower industrial segment profit in the quarter owing to higher operating costs and $6.2 billion charges from the legacy insurance business. GE’s fourth-quarter earnings are likely to be hit by high overall expenses with the Zacks Consensus Estimate being pegged at 28 cents. (Read more: Will Lower Industrial Segment Profit Hurt GE's Q4 Earnings?)Moving ForwardFlannery has termed 2018 as a “reset year” and is seriously contemplating to spin off its operations to maximize shareholder returns. In addition, GE aims to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. The company further intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve its liquidity. Also, the company halved its quarterly dividend to 12 cents per share — the first dividend cut since 2009 at the peak of the recession.Amid such drastic portfolio restructuring initiatives, management has decided to continue its thrust for the Aviation segment, which remains one of the three core segments for the company.Other stocks from the industry that are likely to report their fourth-quarter earnings soon include 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report).The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

On an organic basis, orders increased 4% in the domestic market, 8% in Europe and 11% in emerging markets driven by 20% growth in China. On a product basis, healthcare system orders grew 5% year over year, primarily led by higher demand for ultrasound and imaging products (up 11% and 8%, respectively) along with mammography and CT. Order for life sciences products were up 14%, driven by bioprocess (up 17%) and core imaging (up 9%).Operating profit was up 14% to $820 million, driven by volume and productivity gains partially offset by price and program investments. Operating margin expanded 140 basis points to 17.4%.Accounting for 14.1% of total revenues in third-quarter 2017, Healthcare forms an integral part of GE as CEO John Flannery intends to focus on three core segments — Power, Aviation and Healthcare.  He aims to gradually exit all other businesses to plug the downtrend in the company’s shares.

721,MMM,"The blue-chip index registered its 34th record for 2017 to finish above the 22,000 threshold yet again. The Dow ended in the green for nine straight trading days, the highest since February. Goldman Sachs contributed the most gains towards such a stellar performance from the index. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also ended in the green. These gains were the result of the announcement by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that the US created 209,000 jobs for the month of July. Such robust economic conditions boosted investor sentiment and there were broad based gains for markets.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today’s Ahead of Wall Street article.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) The blue-chip index closed at 22,092.81, an all-time high, rising by 0.3% or 66.71 points in the process. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.2%, rising 4.67 points to close at 2,476.83. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,351.56, gaining 11.22 points or 0.2%. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,499 to 1,245. On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by 1,542 to 1,130.Jobless Rate Touches A 16-year LowUS Stocks closed on a high on Friday and this was primarily because of an astounding number of job additions in the economy. A total of 209,000 new jobs were created within the States. In the past two months alone, there have been a total of 450,000 new jobs added to the economy. This has slashed the current level of unemployment to 4.3% from 4.4% last month. Such an excellent number has surpassed the economist’s expectation of 175,000 new job additions. This boosted the DOW and it closed on a new high and registered its 34th straight record so far in 2017. The bond yields also fell and the value of dollar also increased. Such robust economy implies that the Fed might soon start unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.Sectors Which Employed the MostAs more Americans take home paychecks, the US economy is stabilizing which implies an increase in consumer spending. As per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, bulk of the new jobs was primarily from professional firms, health-care providers and restaurants and bars. Broadly encouraging economic conditions led to companies hiring more number of workers and amidst a shortage of skilled labor. Despite the low levels of unemployment, wages haven’t increased much, rising 0.3% in July to an average of $26.36 an hour. Over the past 12 months, wages increased 2.5% year to date till July. In a healthier economy, wages generally increase 3% to 4% but such a low rise has been due to a plethora of reasons including, low productivity and a reluctance among Americans to change jobs. This is partly due to a huge number of job losses during the Great Recession.There were about 53,000 new hires in restaurants and bars across the US in July. The white-collar jobs were mainly offered by professional firms, hiring 49,000 people. On the other hand, healthcare sector hired as many as 39,000 people. Together these sectors added 70% of the total number of new jobs. Other industries which added only a small number of jobs include mining, manufacturing and construction. Although the retailers increased hiring, they actually lost jobs in the last 12 months for the first time since 2010.Weekly ResultsFor the week, the DOW increased 1.2%, marking its second straight weekly rise and finishing in the positive territory four out of five past weeks. The S&P 500 rose 0.2% whereas the Nasdaq declined 0.4%. The Dow surpassed the 22,000 milestone riding high on performances from Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and 3M (MMM  -  Free Report). Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) added 300 points to the blue chip index since February and helped it cross the psychological milestone. The S&P 500 closed in the green due to broadly encouraging economic conditions and also strong earnings from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report). The Nasdaq continued its lackluster performance due to tech overvaluation issue.Stocks That Made Headlinesj2 Global Q2 Earnings and Revenues Lag EstimatesLos Angeles, CA-based j2 Global, Inc.’s (JCOM  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.(Read More)Cincinnati Bell Q2 Earnings Lag Estimates, Sales BeatCincinnati Bell Inc.

722,MMM,"ITT Inc. (ITT  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 results, with adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. Strong productivity and restructuring benefits led to better-than-expected earnings. However, the bottom line came in 3% lower than the year-ago tally of 67 cents.Higher environmental costs along with unfavorable foreign exchange, more than offset favorable impacts of improved efficiency, a lower tax rate and interest expense.Inside the HeadlinesThe company’s second-quarter revenues came in at $630.9, up 0.8% on a year-over-year basis. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $627 million.Organic revenues declined 2% year over year due to lower industrial and global oil and gas pump project activity, which was somewhat mitigated by growth in automotive market.Adjusted operating income for the reported quarter was $88.3 million compared with $92.2 million in the second quarter of 2016. The decrease in adjusted operating income was attributable to a rise in commodity costs, unfavorable foreign exchange and a rise in strategic investments.ITT Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ITT Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ITT Inc. QuoteSegment PerformanceTotal revenue and organic revenue at the Industrial Process declined 10% year over year to $192 million. The decline was primarily attributable a lesser number of oil and gas projects in North America, Asia and Latin America along with declines in baseline oil and gas pumps.Revenues at the Connect and Control Technologies segment declined 3% year over year to $150 million. In addition, organic revenues fell 2% on a year-over-year basis. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in demand in commercial aerospace and restrictions on sales of military-specification connectors.Motion Technologies’ revenues continued the strong momentum and climbed 12% year over year to $290 million. Additionally, organic revenues recorded an increase of 5%. Significant share gains and market growth in automotive brake pads in Europe and China and strong sealing solutions at Wolverine proved favorable to the top-line improvement.Balance SheetCash and cash equivalents totaled $355.3 million as of Jun 30, 2017 compared with $460.7 million on Dec 31, 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, cash flow from operating activities totaled $92.7 million and capital expenditures were $53.3 million. At the end of the quarter, the company had 88 million shares outstanding.2017 GuidanceFor full-year 2017, ITT raised its previously announced revenue guidance of a decline of around 2% or increase up to 2% to the range of 0% to 2%, due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange. Adjusted earnings are now projected to be in the band of $2.40–$2.50 per share, up from the previous estimate of $2.28–$2.48.Our TakeITT’s focus on business streamlining, cost controls and efficiency continues to prove beneficial to its financial performance. The integration of its Interconnect Solutions and Control Technologies businesses into the Connect and Control Technologies segment will help enhance focus on target markets, streamline operations and leverage shared infrastructure and end markets. Its simplified operational framework will help unlock growth opportunities, as well as drive long-term growth in the global aerospace and industrial markets.However, the company faces risks from uncertainty in the global macro-economic environment, especially weakness in industrial markets. Also, pricing pressure on large projects and lower petrochemical and mining project activity are anticipated to aggravate the decline in petrochemical business in North America and China.The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

724,MMM,"Dow achieved the historical milestone of 22,000 for the first time on Wednesday. This stellar showing was a result of surge in the shares of Apple after the tech behemoth posted outstanding earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Broadly encouraging economic conditions also drove the Dow past the psychological milestone. The S&P 500 also finished in the green, however, the Nasdaq’s lackluster performance continued as it was dragged down to close in the red due to familiar tech overvaluation issues.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today’s Ahead of Wall Street article.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) breached all the records to finish above the 22,000 threshold for the first time on Wednesday and notched its seventh straight daily rise. The blue-chip index closed at 22,016.24, an all-time high, rising by 0.2% or 52.32 points in the process. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.1%, rising 1.22 points to close at 2,477.57. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,362.65, declining 0.29 point. A total of around 6.5 billion shares were traded on Monday, above the last 20-session average of 6.1 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,871 to 866. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by 2,114 to 601.Dow Hits 22,000, Buoyed By Apple’s Earnings Outperformance Dow breaches yet another record in 2017. The blue-chip index, for the first time, achieved the psychological milestone of 22,000. This historic benchmark was achieved within 107 trading days of Dow hitting 21,000.This stellar showing was made possible by Apple Inc.’s upbeat earnings. Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) reported spectacular results for third-quarter fiscal 2017, driven by the impressive Service segment performance. iPhone sales were also steady in the quarter. Earnings of $1.67 per share and revenues of $45.4 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57 and $44.7 billion, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, earnings grew 17.6% and revenues increased 7.2%. (Read More: Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings & Revenues Beat Estimates, Stock Up)Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) has also contributed to the Dow’s upward journey. Boeing reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $2.56 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.32 and increasing from last year’s loss of $0.44 per share. Furthermore, the escalating geopolitical risks involving Syria and North Korea has led to an increased demand for defense products. (Read More: Boeing Stock Flies to All-Time High After Q2 Earnings). The other companies which have added to the Dow’s performance Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report), 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report).Other Factors that Drove the Dow HigherSome other factors which have contributed to the Dow’s historic feat are broadly encouraging economic conditions, Fed’s hesitance to increase the interest rates any further and weakening dollar in the international markets.The private sector added 178,000 jobs in July although this was lower than the economists’ expectation of 185,000 jobs. But this would certainly lower the unemployment rate which hovered around 4.3% in the month of May, according to The Bureau of Labor Statistics. The recent addition of 178,000 jobs would go a long way in lowering the unemployment rate. Further, a steady GDP growth has also made the economy favorable for more investment and spending.The Fed increased interest rates three times since December. However, at the end of its two day policy meet, the Fed refrained from increasing the interest rates any further. This raises question on the ability of the Trump administration to deliver on the campaign trail promises and the investor sentiment was hurt leading to losses in the broader markets. On the other hand, this turned out to be a boon for the rate sensitive sectors such as utilities which would benefit from the move. Also, this boded well for the banks in general and boosted the bank shares thereby leading to broad based gains.The Dow consists of 30 large-cap companies which have overseas operations. For the record, the dollar has fallen more than 10% since the start of the year. This makes the US-based goods cheaper in the international market and an increased demand for the same. Also, foreign profits were worth more in dollars. This also resulted in broad based gains for the economy.Stocks That Made HeadlinesARRIS Beats Q2 Earnings Estimates, Revenues LagARRIS International plc’s (ARRS  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

The index improved in fits and starts over the past five months as investors remained skeptical about how efficiently President Trump will be able to implement his promised pro-growth policies. The latest setback to pass the bill to revamp the Affordable Care Act underlined those bearish sentiments.Nevertheless, the Dow is trading up 11.4% on a year-to-date basis buoyed by healthy corporate earnings results and broadly encouraging economic data.Catalysts Driving DowEarnings Blow Past ExpectationsApple Inc.’s stock drove the Dow above 22,000. The tech giant’s shares rose 4.7% after its quarterly earnings results topped expectations and iPhone sales met expectations. The iPhone maker posted fiscal third-quarter earnings of $1.67 a share, compared with $1.42 a year earlier. Earnings also came ahead of analysts’ estimates. Revenues of $45.41 billion edged past estimates, with sales of iPhones totaled 41.03 million more than 40.4 million in the same period last year. Remarkably, Apple’s revenues fell 10% in the Greater China region from year-ago quarter (read more: Apple Earnings Prove It No Longer Needs China to Succeed).The blue-chip gauge’s steady advance was also powered by moves in shares of plane maker Boeing. The aerospace company has skyrocketed 53% so far this year, making it the best performer in the Dow.  The company reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $2.56 per share, beating analysts’ expectations and improving from last year’s loss of 44 cents per share. Escalating geopolitical risks, involving Syria and North Korea, has led to increased demand for defense products, which bodes well for Boeing (read More: Boeing Stock Flies to All-Time High After Q2 Earnings).Several other blue-chip stocks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS  -  Free Report), 3M Co (MMM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report), Verizon Communications Inc.

After a feeble start to the year, Americans spent more in the spring driving the U.S. economy beyond the $19 trillion mark for the first time. Real gross domestic product rebounded in the second quarter and more than doubled from the first quarter. Pick-up in consumer spending and an uptick in business investment in software, research and equipment boosted economic growth.Consumer outlays grew 2.8% in the second quarter as Americans spent more on healthcare, groceries and clothes. Spending rebounded in the last quarter, buoyed by an uptick in household finances. Disposable income adjusted for inflation saw the best back-to-back quarters this year since the first half of 2015. Consumer spending was also driven by the strongest labor market in years.Companies, in the meanwhile, increased investments in equipment like computers, which rose at a rate of 8.2%, the highest in almost two years.

Among other bright spots, nonresidential fixed investment that includes structures and intellectual properties contributed 0.64 percentage points to growth.

726,MMM,"Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) forecasts new civilian-use single engine helicopter shipments of 4,000 to 4,200 over the next five years on the back of strong global economic conditions, potential positive impact of the U.S. tax reform and lower volatility in oil and gas-related markets. The forecast is in line with its earlier five-year forecast done in 2017.  Honeywell’s Aerospace unit anticipates 5.3% to 10.5% rise in helicopter shipments till 2022 compared with 3,800 deliveries made between 2013 and 2017. Helicopter sales had reached its peak at $6.1 billion in 2013 amid a frenzy of drilling activities. Crude along with other commodities began to weaken in the second half of 2014 after soaring to more than $100 a barrel. Oil prices plummeted to below $30 a barrel in 2016. Helicopter sales are likely to climb for the second year after hitting a low in 2016. Also, Honeywell has reorganized its operating segments by merging Transportation Systems segment with the Aerospace segment to leverage on the shared business models and the engineering and technology similarities.The company expects helicopter fleet utilization to increase significantly in North America with a modest increase in Europe and Latin America over the next 12 months. It expects a stability in purchase-plan rates for civil helicopters in North America, Europe and Asia which is consistent with its 2017 survey. The company hints that the light single-engine helicopter models will be the most-desired product over the years as flying taxis are being contemplated as an urban commute by tech startups and companies.Share Price MovementHoneywell shares gained 0.9% following the news and the trend is expected to continue.

727,MMM,"Pratt & Whitney, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), has acknowledged technical glitches with respect to its newly modified turbofan jet engine. The discovery of these problems has caused the delivery of latest Airbus aircraft to come to a standstill. Taking the event into account, Europe’s air safety regulator issued an emergency warning to the company about inflight shutdown of such engines as these could lead to fatal consequences.Pratt & Whitney reported that the issue affects 43 engines on A320neo aircraft and believes it to have occurred from an engineering change made to knife-edge seal in the high-pressure compressor near the rear of aircraft’s engine.           United Technologies shares fell 3% last week following the news but has since recovered. The stock has outperformed the industry in the last three months, with an average return of 7.3% against a loss of 3.7% for the latter.The incident hurt the company’s reputation as some investors were reluctant to park their money with it. Moreover, it hindered the growing demand for Airbus jet engines internationally as the deliveries were not made to the clients on time. Further, investors seem to be worried as to how the company would fix the relevant technical issues, come up with remedial measures and checks to avoid repetition of such incidents. Moving forward, Pratt & Whitney ensured Europe’s air safety regulator of its sheer determination to find and present a solution for the highlighted issue at the earliest. An early fix to these problems, as suggested by Pratt & Whitney, will likely help the company to mitigate risks related to its future revenue-generating potential and bottom-line growth.United Technologies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report) and Raven Industries, Inc. (RAVN  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report), carrying Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

728,MMM,"The Dow experienced a mixed week, losing momentum over the first few days before rebounding over the next two. Bond yields spiked following improved inflation and rate hike prospects leading investors to switch from equities to bonds.

Financial blue-chips gained as a result, which, along with bullish earnings numbers helped the index gain over the latter half of the week.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 0.8% last Friday following better-than-expected earnings from Intel Corporation INTC. Additionally, the Dow posted a rise of more than 220 points. Meanwhile, U.S. GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017, following gains of more than 3% in the two previous quarters.This marks the economy’s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid-2009.

The ICE U.S. Dollar Index fell 1.5% for the week to settle at 89.07, following Mnuchin’s comments.The index gained 2.2% over last week.

729,MMM,"On Dec 27, we issued an updated research report on industrial goods manufacturer, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report).United Technologies serves various end markets such as aerospace, defense and commercial construction, which move according to their own cycles. This business mix and diversification allows the company to remain profitable even during tough economic times, delivering consistent earnings and dividend growth. United Technologies also has a strong aftermarket business. The company not only manufactures and sells primary products such as elevators, aircraft engines and helicopters but also sells spare parts and offers related services to keep the primary products running. The company’s aftermarket services business is relatively stable compared to new product delivery, and it helps offset the negative impact of downturns in the new products market.In order to fuel its growth momentum, the company remains focused on four key priorities — flawless execution, innovation for growth, structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation. United Technologies has also revamped its aerospace unit. These include an overhaul of its organizational structure in the aerospace business along with some key changes in the leadership positions within it. United Technologies anticipates that the streamlined organizational set-up would enable it to better serve its customers. In addition, the company expects that the strategic moves will further ensure a successful entry and production ramp-up of its Geared Turbofan engines to thwart intense competition from peers like General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) and Rolls Royce.With a diligent execution of operational plans, the company has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 16.4% against a decline of 4.5% for the latter. Moreover, the acquisition of Rockwell Collins is likely to create an industry behemoth with an unrivalled competitive advantage. The transaction is expected to offer United Technologies a bigger clout in the industry and increase its bargaining power as it would emerge as one of the largest aircraft equipment manufacturers in the world. The combined company would be better suited to meet the evolving global customer needs. With complementary products, the combination is likely to yield operating synergies through lower operating costs and more opportunities to cross sell the products. United Technologies expects the merger to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share after the first full year of combined operations with synergies to the tune of more than $500 million.Incorporating its improved expectations for organic sales growth in the near future, United Technologies raised its earlier guidance for 2017. Adjusted earnings are currently anticipated to lie within the $6.58-$6.63 per share range compared with the previously estimated range of $6.45-$6.60. Additionally, the company raised its revenue guidance for 2017 from $58.5-$59.5 billion to $59-$59.5 billion (estimating an organic growth of 3-4% year over year). Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment and continued investments in the aerospace segment, the company expects to generate significant cash from operations to reward shareholders with a risk-adjusted return through share repurchases and dividends.However, with more than 8,000 employees, United Technologies has a considerable presence in the U.K. Consequently, the company is susceptible to high operating risks following the Brexit referendum. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also affect the company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause instability in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. Furthermore, United Technologies relies on suppliers, including third-party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems. This exposes the company to market price volatility and availability risks. A disruption in deliveries from suppliers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price changes, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities is likely to have an adverse effect on its ability to meet delivery schedules and thereby increase operating costs. These headwinds look all the more potent with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. A better-ranked stock in the industry is 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report), which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3M has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.2%.

730,MMM,"General Electric Company’s (GE  -  Free Report) leading gas turbines in Pakistan produced power way below the maximum capacity this summer. Several power executives and officials of the country mentioned that the turbines had operational issues like long outages and production delays.Over the last month, General Electric’s shares lost 5.3%, wider than the 0.5% loss incurred by the industry.The company is currently plagued by headwinds such as unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchanges, lower demand for locomotives and volatility in oil prices. However, General Electric is undergoing elaborate restructuring moves in order to battle such issues. The company is trimming down cost by lower overhead expenses and conducting certain simplification initiatives. Notably, General Electric has decided to focus on just three core segments — power, aviation and health-care equipment and gradually exit all other businesses, in order to boost its shrinking shares.Inside the HeadlinesPakistan is currently recognized as a prime growth market for power turbine markers because this booming economy has a well-developed gas infrastructure.General Electric’s 9HA-Class turbines were installed in Pakistan’s Balloki, Bhikki and Haveli power plants. These efficient turbines are the company’s latest products and have secured place in the Guinness World Records of 2016, on grounds of the amount of electricity produced by the same in Bouchain, France power plant. Moreover, the company’s 7HA and 9HA turbines give tough competition to the ones offered by other companies like Japan's Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems.However, Pakistan's Central Power Purchasing Agency’s report proved that General Electric’s 9HA-Class turbines had mutually produced only half of full capacity this August. The outcome turned out to be a severe problem in the country where temperature shoots up more than 40 degrees Celsius during summers.However, against all contentions, General Electric stated that each of the three turbines is performing fairly good in terms of both efficiency and output at present. The company noted that the operational issues noticed this summer are often found during the initial operational phase and commissioning of such large power plants. The company affirmed that these three flagship turbines will supply adequate power in almost 7.3 million homes of Pakistan in the near term.Zacks Rank and Other StocksGeneral Electric currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

731,MMM,"General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) recently landed a locomotive manufacturing order with Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report)) for an undisclosed amount. The Class I railroad will buy 200 new locomotives manufactured by GE transportation — one of the operating segments of GE.GE will manufacture Tier 4 ET44ACs and Tier 3 ES44ACs (Tier 4 certified) locomotives of its Evolution Series as part of the order. The Evolution Series are some of the best-selling and most successful freight locomotives in the U.S. history. Most Class I railroads of North America have ordered the Tier 4 locomotives from the company. These are well known for producing significantly less particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen, and meet the stringent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency emission standards.The manufacturing of the locomotives will be done at the Fort Worth, TX facility — GE Manufacturing Solutions. The production and delivery of these locomotives are expected to be done over the next three years beginning 2018.Earlier, CEO, John Flannery was considering divesting the Texas facility as the company intends to concentrate on strengthening its core segments of power, aviation and healthcare equipment and exit all other businesses. This was part of a larger plan by the company to divest $20 billion in assets in an effort to simplify it. This has resulted in uncertainty for the more than 400 employees of the facility and bring the deal into jeopardy.Shares of GE have underperformed the industry year to date, with an average loss of 44.8% significantly wider than a decline of 4.6% for the latter.The company is currently undergoing drastic portfolio restructuring initiatives to revive its fortune and even halved its dividend to improve its liquidity.GE currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

732,MMM,"U.S. equity market has had a stellar return so far this year. In fact, since the financial crisis in 2009, investors have pocketed stupendous returns. In those nine years, a $9,000 investment in the S&P 500 has turned into $49,200.However, recently, a number of market pundits are concerned that the bull runs that have sent the bourses to record highs might soon come crashing down. And why not? Rise in interest rates, likelihood of a new tech bubble and a pricey stock market are potential bottlenecks to investors’ hard-earned money. Valuation measures such as price-earnings ratios are increasing caution.Amid such uncertainty, investing in dividend aristocrats seems prudent, as they provide higher total returns with lower volatility, which are undoubtedly the ‘holy grail’ of investing. Such companies are also likely to make the most of the tax reform legislation and a steadily growing economy.Will You Have Money in Your Pocket as Fed Raises Rates?As widely expected, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the third time this year. The benchmark lending rate was hiked by a quarter percentage point to the range of 1.25-1.5%. In fact, Fed officials expect to raise rates at a steady pace in the coming years. The median expectation for rate hikes next year is pegged at three, at least two in 2019 and two more in 2020 (read more: Fed Hikes Rates: Top 5 Winners for 2018).Looming interest rate hikes mostly spell bad news for stock markets. Given that a rate hike will force consumers and business houses to pay more to borrow money it will eventually leave them with less money to spend.Tech Bubble, Overvaluation ConcernsThat said, a possibly bigger threat to the stock market is the bubble developing in the tech space. Silicon Valley’s major players including Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) are currently the three largest companies in the world in terms of market capitalization.Even though stellar growth of Apple, Microsoft and Amazon have given a boost to the stock market, their sheer size is a threat to the market if they start faltering. Moreover, experts believe that chances of these declining in the near future are a lot higher, as most technology stocks including these are priced too high compared to what they earn. This replicates the late Nineties, when the stock market was plagued by the so-called ‘dotcom’ bubble burst.In fact, two-third of the money managers finds the U.S. stock market’s recent record run unsettling. The gains in the current nine-year-old bull market are nearly 300%. This is now the second-strongest bull run since World War II, trailing only to a massive gain of 417% during October 1990 and March 2000, per data compiled by LPL Financial and FactSet Research Systems Inc. This year, the 30-stock Dow Jones has set record highs 70 times, the broader S&P 500 hit highs 53 times and the tech-heavy Nasdaq continues to hover near the coveted 7,000 mark.Time to Buy Dividend Aristocrats for 2018Given such an uncertain scenario, if you have money, where should you invest? Buy dividend aristocrats as they have tremendous financial strength and are immune to market vagaries. They reflect solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals. They have also raked in excellent risk-adjusted returns over the last decade.Dividend Aristocrats generated an annualized return of 9.7% in the last 10 years, easily topping the broader market’s 6.3% rate. During this period, dividends accounted for 31% of the market’s total return, highlighting their importance in determining total shareholder return.President Trump, meanwhile, has successfully persuaded Congress to pass the $1.5 trillion tax reform bill that could boost economic output by 3% to 4%. This in turn could act as a catalyst for dividend aristocrats to grow even further (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).               5 Solid ChoicesWe have, thus, selected five such dividend aristocrats to boost your returns. Such stocks also possess a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The favorable Zacks Rank should help these stocks gain further this year.

733,MMM,"As markets approach the end of an extremely successful year, each of the major benchmarks is nearing ever-new milestones. Currently up more than 25% year to date, the Dow is on course for its best yearly performance since 2013. If the blue-chip index maintains its current trajectory and gains more than 26.5%, it will have registered its best annual performance since 1995. During that year, the Dow had gained 33%.The index’s blue-chips have not looked this attractive for some time now. And fueling these gains has been a combination of strong earnings and steady economic growth, factors which are likely to hold good in 2018. Adding strong performers from the Dow to your portfolios could help you garner handsome profits in the year ahead.Benchmarks Near Multiple MilestonesThe other major benchmarks are also well on course to create milestones of their own. For instance, the S&P 500 has increased more than 20% this year and is on course to registering its highest gains in four years. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq has surged ahead, gaining almost 30% during a year when tech stocks really came into their own.Such stellar gains came amid an atmosphere of relative calm. Notably, the S&P 500 has not suffered even a 3% decline at any point since Trump won the presidential elections. Not only is this the longest such period ever recorded, it has come at a time when the market’s fear gauge, the VIX, has plummeted to record lows.Strong Economy, Bullish Earnings Boost BoursesPowering this extended stretch of furious gains has been a combination of steady economic growth and impressive earnings results. According to the Department of Commerce’s third and final estimate, U.S. GDP increased by 3.2% in the third quarter, the best pace recorded since the first quarter of 2015.Meanwhile, the economy added an impressive 228,000 new jobs in November even as the unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low. These readings indicate that the labor market is at its strongest since the start of the 21st century.And accompanying this strong set of economic indicators have been stellar earnings results, a trend which is also likely to continue. Currently, total Q4 earnings are expected to be up 8.8% from the same period last year on 6.8% higher revenues, which would follow the 6.9% earnings growth on 6% higher revenues in Q3. Also, for the full-year 2017, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 7.5% on 5% higher revenues. (Read: What Will the Q4 Earnings Season Bring?)Could Tax Cuts Actually Spoil Markets’ Party?With Trump scoring his first legislative victory, investors are now looking at tax cuts to provide a further fillip to the bourses. The exact earnings impact of the tax legislation is yet to become clear, but preliminary estimates suggest a material earnings boost. S&P 500 earnings in 2018 are already expected to be up +11.8%, with the growth pace expected to roughly double as a result of the tax legislation. (Read: Earnings Boost from the Tax Legislation)But a section of market watchers feel that additional stimulus could actually be counterproductive for an economy which is almost at full capacity and is experiencing near-full-employment levels. Such a scenario has been maintained in an ultra-low rate environment characterized by steadily sluggish inflation.However, tax cuts could finally trigger higher inflation, which in turn could force the Federal Reserve to initiate faster and sharper rate hikes. Such an outcome would end the goldilocks style phase which the economy has been enjoying, making 2018 a much tougher year than was earlier hoped for. Critics of such a view point out that marginally higher inflation could actually be more beneficial for growth and provide the economy with further room for expansion.5 Dow WinnersThe Dow is on course to record its best yearly performance since 2013. Powering this stretch of gains have been strong earnings results and steady economic growth, factors which remain firmly in place. Meanwhile, recently enacted tax cuts are likely to boost fourth quarter earnings even higher.Investing in select Dow stocks looks like a smart option at this point. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics. Each of these stocks has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) has recently delivered strong third quarter earnings results.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 0.8% over the last 30 days.

734,MMM,"A week out from Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis, with much of the football world beginning to descend upon Minnesota, businesses around the Twin Cities hope to experience an economic boost.Estimates regarding the economic impact of hosting a Super Bowl vary widely. But after Minneapolis was awarded the big game, which is set to be held in the new $1.13 billion U.S. Bank Stadium, Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton proclaimed that the 10-day event would lead to a $500 million win for the state.A more updated impact forecast from the Minnesota Super Bowl Host Committee notes that the game will generate more than $400 million and attract more than one million visitors. Still, even if these lofty monetary goals aren’t met, some major companies poured money into the committee’s efforts to bring the Super Bowl back to Minneapolis.These companies include 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), U.S. Bank (USB  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), and an array of other publicly traded firms that pledged to help stir up economic growth as part of Minnesota’s “Bold North” push.With that said, let’s take a look at three great stocks from Minnesota-based companies that helped bring Super Bowl LII to Minneapolis.1.       Polaris Industries Inc. (PII  -  Free Report)This Medina, Minnesota-headquartered maker of off-road recreational vehicles instantly conjures up pictures of rugged northern landscapes. Polaris is also one of Minnesota’s biggest companies and has facilities located throughout the state.

On top of that, Polaris is set to sponsor snowmobiler Levi LaVallee’s backflip attempt over Nicollet Mall the night before the big game.Polaris is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports “A” grades for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system.2.       Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report)Minneapolis-based Target is an active part of the Twin Cities community, with a substantial presence in the professional sports world. Target currently owns the naming rights to the Minnesota Twins’ ballpark, and the NBA’s Minnesota Timberwolves play their home games at the Target Center. And aside from selling TVs, party favors, and Super Bowl LII gear, Target hopes the culmination of the NFL season shines a positive long-term light on the city it calls home.Target is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and boasts an overall “B” VGM score.3.       H.B. Fuller Company (FUL  -  Free Report)This adhesive technology giant’s world headquarters are located in St. Paul. H.B. Fuller is also an official member of the Minnesota Super Bowl Host Committee.

736,MMM,"Thursday, January 25, 2018Along with a new full slate of Q4 earnings results ahead of today’s opening bell, we also see Initial Jobless Claims reported for last week. The headline number of 233K is higher than the previous week by 17K claims (the previous week itself was revised down to 216K from 220K originally reported), but falls nicely within the comfortable range between 225K-250K jobless claims we’ve largely seen over the past couple years.Continuing claims fell last week to 1.937 million from an upwardly revised 1.965 million the previous week. The 4-week moving average now sits at 240K initial jobless claims per week, which smooths out a bit of the week-to-week volatility we’ve seen recently, going back to the hurricanes that ripped through the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico late last summer. In fact, claims numbers in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands indicate that a full recovery in those areas has not yet been realized.Two Dow components reported solid Q4 earnings results in today’s pre-market, as well — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)-rated Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated 3M Corp. (MMM  -  Free Report) both outperformed expectations, and are sending the Dow 30 index up more than 100 points ahead of the market open.Heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar posted a 22% positive earnings surprise when it put up $2.16 per share, breezing past the $1.77 in the Zacks consensus estimate. Revenues in the quarter of $12.9 billion beat estimates by a cool $1 billion, and continues its impressive string of bottom-line beats — now 12 straight quarters. Full-year guidance also looks robust, now at a range of $8.25-9.25 per share; the Zacks consensus estimate had been $8.02 per share. For more on CAT’s earnings, click here.3M also outperformed expectations on its top and bottom lines this morning, with $2.10 per share on $7.99 billion in revenues outpacing the $2.03 per share and $7.88 billion we were looking for. Full-year guidance was also ratcheted up significantly to $10.20-10.70 per share; the previous Zacks consensus was $9.83 per share. MMM shares are up 2.5% in the pre-market. For more on MMM’s earnings, click here.More airlines companies have also posted new earnings results: American (AAL  -  Free Report) posted 95 cents per share for a 2-cent beat on $10.6 billion in revenues that squeaked out a beat over the $10.58 billion expected. Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report) beat by a penny to 77 cents per share, and revenues of $5,274 million topped the $5,242 million in the Zacks consensus.Defense companies also hit the tape ahead of the bell: Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) surpassed expectations to $2.82 per share versus the $2.75 expected, with revenues of $6.63 billion easily beat the $6.37 billion we were looking for. Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report), however, although it beat bottom-line estimates by a penny to $2.03 per share, missed its top-line estimate when it posted $6.78 billion as opposed to the $6.83 billion estimate.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

737,MMM,"According to a Reuters report, General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is seriously contemplating to spin off its operations to maximize shareholder returns after taking a hit of $6.2 billion in the fourth quarter from the legacy insurance business. Following the news, the stock fell 2.9% to close at $18.21 yesterday.The insurance problems for the beleaguered industrial goods manufacturer have largely stemmed from its presence in the long-term care policy market that caters to healthcare costs related to nursing homes and assisted living. Although GE has mostly exited its financial businesses in the aftermath of recession, it has continued with this reinsurance business albeit without any new insurance policy since 2006. Estimates reveal that GE will require capital contributions to the tune of $15 billion over seven years due to an increase in the life expectancy of the aging population. These long-term care policies usually date back to decades and have grossly underestimated projected healthcare costs and life spans, hurting the exchequer of companies like GE.This has also severely impaired CEO John Flannery’s plans to script a turnaround in the company, with 2018 being termed as a “reset year”. Flannery had earlier disclosed his plans to focus on just three core segments — power, aviation and health-care equipment — and gradually exit all other businesses to plug the downtrend. In addition, GE aimed to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. The company further intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve its liquidity.Also, the company halved its quarterly dividend to 12 cents per share — the first dividend cut since 2009 at the peak of the recession. For 2018, the dividend allocation will be $4.2 billion, down from more than 100% of free cash flow to 60-70% while the dividend yield will be trimmed from 4.7% to 2.3%. A healthy dividend yield was one of the strongest enticements for GE investors and the dramatic plunge in share prices are testament to the fact that shareholders have been very critical of the turnaround plan.For 2017, the company has lowered its adjusted earnings guidance to $1.04-$1.12 per share from $1.60-$1.70. For 2018, GE expects adjusted earnings to be further down to $1.00-$1.07 per share and free cash flow at significantly reduced levels of $6 billion to $7 billion.The company further intends to lay off 12,000 employees across the globe in its GE Power business, as part of its corporate objective to lower operating costs and improve profitability. The drastic steps seem to be the call of the hour as the company aims to restructure its business in tune with the evolving market conditions.Incidentally, GE was the worst performer of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2017, tanking 44.8% in the year. Shares of GE have also underperformed the industry in the last three months, with an average loss of 21.4% against a gain of 1.1% for the latter. Whether a radical spin off for smaller nimbler entities can actually be beneficial to shareholders remains to be seen.GE has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Raven Industries, Inc. (RAVN  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and Leucadia National Corporation , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Raven has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10%. It surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 25.8%.3M has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.2%. It delivered earnings beat thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 2.5%.Leucadia has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 18%.

738,MMM,"On Jan 16, we updated the research report on Leucadia National Corporation .Leucadia operates through numerous financial services businesses and merchant banking investments across the globe. As each of these businesses operates according to their own cycle, it leads to well diversified revenue streams for the company. Stronger results from some businesses help to offset weaker results in others, making the company relatively immune to individual business performance.Leucadia seems poised to benefit from the pro-growth business environment coupled with a lower corporate tax structure. President Trump’s plans of spending $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over an extended period of 10 years, along with regulatory rollbacks to aid profitability of small and medium-sized companies, bode well for Leucadia.Leucadia's businesses appear favorably positioned, particularly Jeffries. Jeffries’ performance has improved from the recent past, when it was affected by volatility in oil prices and oil-related junk bonds. Companies like National Beef have also had a difficult period in the past years as Americans have switched to healthier eating habits causing the cattle industry to go on a decline. But the fundamentals seem to be improving at present. Profit margins of National Beef have recently improved as the demand for beef has picked up. Investors now have a more optimistic outlook on these companies.However, Leucadia has a significant exposure to the European market. In light of the Brexit referendum, the European economy is faced with uncertainties, making the company’s revenues unpredictable. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering the productivity of the company.Nevertheless, we maintain a bullish outlook on this stock as it remains well positioned to grow. The company’s shares have outperformed the industry in the last three months with an average return of 8.6% compared with a gain of 1.9% for the latter.Leucadia currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other stocks worth considering in the industry include Raven Industries, Inc. (RAVN  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and ITT Inc. (ITT  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Raven has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 10%. It exceeded estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 25.8%.3M has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 10.2%. It exceeded estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2.5%.ITT has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 12.5%. It exceeded estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 8.1%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

739,MMM,"Benchmarks closed mostly in the red on Monday with both the Dow and S&P 500 declining, while the Nasdaq increased over the day. Ever since President Trump imposed fresh levies on steel and aluminum imports investors have been concerned over prospects of a trade war. Fears of this nature dragged industrials lower during the session, a decline which weighed on the broader markets. However, tech-heavy index Nasdaq managed to end at new highs for second straight day following an investor friendly jobs report on Friday.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 0.6%, or 156.64 points, to close at 25,178.61. The S&P 500 fell 0.1% to close at 2,783.02. However, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,588.33, gaining 0.4%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 7% to close at 15.67. A total of 6.52 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.2 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.22-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.Trump’s Tariff Law to Initiate Trade War?On Mar 8, President Trump signed his tariff plan into law, which will come into effect from Mar 23. Per this law, fresh levies have been imposed on steel and aluminum imported from other countries. However, the plan excludes countries like Canada and Mexico, offering Trump a chance to renegotiate terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the two countries.However, Trump’s protectionist stance raised concerns over a possible retaliation by other countries with similar kind of moves. This in turn had a negative impact on the Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI) which declined 1.2%, becoming the biggest loser among the S&P 500 sectors. Three Dow components from this sector, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) declined 1.9%, 0.6% and 2.9%, respectively.Nasdaq Hits All-Time High For Second Straight DayThe tech-based index hit an all-time high for the second consecutive trading day. Shares of Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) rose 3.6% after a statement from the White House stated that the “proposed takeover” of QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) by Broadcom “is prohibited.” President Trump signed an Executive Order late on Monday, which ordered both the companies to ""immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover.""Broadcom was the second best performing stock among the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK). The sector rose 0.3% with two of its key holdings, Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) increasing 1% and 0.4%, respectively. Both the tech giants possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Moreover, President Trump’s new tax code has boosted broad based gains for the markets. Such enthusiasm in investors over-shadowed the mass shooting incident at Las Vegas on Sunday evening — described by Trump as an act of “pure evil.” Meanwhile, Fed Presidents Neel Kashkari and Rob Kaplan cautioned the Fed to wait until inflation rate touches the 2% level, before hiking interest rates.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,557.60, gaining 0.7%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.4% to close at 2,529.12. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,516.72, increasing 0.3%.

Meanwhile, Nasdaq advanced almost 21 points to close in the positive territory.Trump Criticizes the Shooting at Las VegasIn an address to the country from the White House, President Trump detested the mass shooting at Las Vegas on Sunday evening, terming it an “act of pure evil”. Trump also ordered that flags be flown at half-staff and expressed his gratitude to first responders for saving innocent lives.Late on Sunday evening, a gunman later identified as a 64 year old man named Stephen Paddock, opened fire from the 32nd floor of a hotel on the crowd attending a country-music concert at Mandalay Bay Casino in Las Vegas. This incident has been described as the worst shooting incident in the history of the United States since the terror attacks of September 11, 2001.Gun stocks surged following such an incident. Shares of Sturm Ruger (RGR  -  Free Report), American Outdoor Brands (AOBC  -  Free Report) and Olin (OLN  -  Free Report) rose 4%, 3% and 6%, respectively.Expectation of Trump’s Tax Reforms Keep Investors EnthusedIn an announcement last week, Trump and his aides unveiled new reforms in tax policies which effectively lower taxes on businesses and individuals. The proposal seeks to decrease the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%. Moreover, the pass-through business taxes — currently categorized under the individual tax code — would be slashed to 25%.Subsequently, the plan also revealed that the current seven personal tax slabs would be reduced to only three at 12%, 25% and 35%, respectively. This boosted gains for the broader markets as investors remained highly hopeful about the new tax code to be signed into law. This overshadowed the effect of the mass shooting incident at Las Vegas.Neel Kashkari Warned Fed not to Hike RatesOn Monday, the Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, cautioned the Fed not to be hasty in raising interest rates. He opined that Fed should wait until inflation reaches the targeted 2% level, before the rates are hiked. Kashkari happens to be one of the voting members of the Fed’s interest rate policy committee and had demurred Fed’s two rate hike this year, citing the same reason.Moreover, in a Q&A at the Fed’s El Paso branch, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan also commented that the Fed should not hurry in raising interest rates and instead wait for the inflation rates to go up.Economic Data Construction Spending surged 0.5% in the month of August, surpassing the consensus estimate of an increase of 0.2% for the period. With this, the index gained 2.5% from last year. Meanwhile, the ISM manufacturing index for September rose to 60.8 — hitting its highest level since 2004 — from 58.8 in August.

741,MMM,"On Oct 2, we issued an updated research report on industrial goods manufacturer, 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report).3M continues to witness sustainable increase in earnings and free cash flow, benefiting from its long-term strategy of accelerating investment in high-growth programs. The company’s ability to convert high R&D spends into up-cycle market share gains and strong pricing powers are the reasons for its success. Organic growth remains the first priority of the company as it continues to invest in infrastructure and commercialization capability.Growth DriversPortfolio management, investment in innovation and business transformation are the three key areas on which the company intends to focus moving forward. 3M also intends to continue investing in capital expenditures and R&D to support organic growth as it targets a prudent capital structure strategy and increased capital deployment. The company’s global footprint, diversified product portfolio and the ability to penetrate in different markets are its forte.With core business focus, 3M has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 17.6% as against a decline of 1.7% for the latter. The company raised its earlier guidance for 2017 on strong quarterly results and improved business outlook. 3M anticipates 2017 GAAP earnings in the range of $8.80 to $9.05 per share, up from prior projection of $8.70-$9.05. This represents year-over-year growth of 8-11%, up from 7-11% expected earlier. Organic local-currency sales are expected to be 3-5%, up from 2-5% expected earlier.For the five-year period of 2016-2020, 3M expects 8-11% growth in earnings per share driven by an organic sales growth of 2-5%. The company expects about 20% return on invested capital during this tenure with a free cash flow conversion rate of 100%. Furthermore, 3M is standardizing its business processes through a new, global ERP system. The company expects these efforts to result in $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and an additional $500 million reduction in working capital. Such focused attempts to maintain growth momentum is commendable.Potential HeadwindsHowever, given its international presence, adverse foreign currency translations are likely to affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause instability in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. These undermine its long-term growth potential to some extent.In addition, 3M is facing increased pension expenses as its workforce begins to retire. The related extra costs would be a drag on the company’s bottom line. Also, as exports are a significant part of the company’s operations and growth prospects, the sustained strength in U.S. dollar will continue to negatively impact the company’s earnings in the short-term.Zacks Rank & Key PicksNevertheless, we remain impressed with the long-term growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report), Crane Co. (CR  -  Free Report) and Barloworld Limited (BRRAY  -  Free Report), each carrying Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Federal Signal has beaten earnings estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 9.5%.Crane has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.1%. It has beaten earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 4%.Barloworld has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 17.3%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

742,MMM,"(0:40) - Trends in Newly Launched ETFs(2:20) - What Is The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)?(6:10) - First Trust Dow 30 Equal Weight ETF: EDOW(8:05) - The Bottom Line: Podcast@Zacks.comOver 150 new funds have launched in the first three quarters of 2017, but which is the best?Sure, there have been plenty of novel products that have come out to give investors exposure to fresh market areas, while there has been great progress on the cost front as well. However, in today’s podcast, I discuss what I think is the best idea of the group, and one that has been long overdue as well.The ETF I take a look at in greater detail is the First Trust Dow 30 Equal Weight ETF (EDOW  -  Free Report). This is by no means the ‘sexiest’ fund to launch this year, but it is important nonetheless. You can begin to understand why this is the case by taking a closer look at the index it is based off of, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the issues that are present in that popular benchmark.Dow in FocusIn the podcast, I discuss a bit about the history of the Dow, and the most important thing about the index that some investors still don’t know. That is, of course, its price weighting.Price weighting is a method where the stock’s price per share is used to weight securities, as opposed to market cap or any actual indicator of a company’s size. While this might not have mattered too much when the Dow was first created and the benchmark traded in the double digits, the modern world (with the Dow over 22,000) has produced some wide variations in various component stock prices.For example, Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) at close to $250 a share is one of the top components, and that is juxtaposed with General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) which is at just $25/share. But while GE is actually a much larger company than Boeing (by market cap), the aerospace giant receives a considerably larger allocation in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and ETFs tracking the benchmark such as the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA  -  Free Report).That is why gigantic companies like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Exxon Mobil (XOM)—the three biggest companies by market cap in the index—make up half the allocation that Boeing, Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), and 3M (MMM  -  Free Report) combined do!And despite holding just 30 stocks in total, the price-weighted average puts just 15% of its assets into the bottom 10 components. This includes less than 1% for GE, the company that has survived on the Dow for the longest, and with a market cap over $200 billion.A Better Way?Does that make sense as a way to track the U.S. market? Of course not. Stock prices are more-or-less arbitrary and the Dow is a relic of a different time in American finance.That is where EDOW comes in. The fund takes the same 30 stocks that we see in the ‘regular’ Dow, it just weights them equally. So, the bottom 10 companies actually receive about one-third of the exposure (unlike the 15% they get in DIA), while no company gets more than 4% of the assets. So, each quarter, GE and BA will have the same weight, regardless of what happens to their share price. Meanwhile, companies like 3M and Goldman will see their weights roughly halved in EDOW when compared to DIA, while firms like Cisco, Pfizer, and Intel will see a sizable boost in their representation.Now, this shift produces some other interesting trends, but check out the podcast for additional information on how EDOW is different from its DIA cousin, and what the impact is on key items like cost, average market cap, and dividend yield too.In the end though, I hope you’ll agree that this equal weight technique makes a whole lot more sense than price weighting. It gives you broad exposure across the U.S. economy to 30 blue chip stocks in an equal fashion, ensuring that the success or failure of one company doesn’t dominate.Isn’t part of the point of the Dow in the first place to represent the American economy and not a single company or two? The Dow Jones Index is an average after all, so why not average things out and give all the components the same exposure? It might not be a perfect way of doing it, but it sure makes a whole lot more sense than just going by price per share!More than anything though, I am absolutely shocked it took so long to see this product come to market, but check out the podcast for an even closer look at this new fund, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average as well!Bottom LineBut what do you think about EDOW and the Dow Jones Industrial Average? Do you agree that the Dow is outdated?

743,MMM,"United States manufacturing survey, initiated by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), jumped to a six-year high in August. ISM stated that the U.S. manufacturing activity increased to 58.8 in August compared with 56.3 in July. A figure above 50 indicates expansion.Of the 18 industries, 15 registered expansion, while apparel, primary metals and furniture contracted.OutlookGiven the strong dependence of American manufacturers on overseas customers, a weaker dollar coupled with strong global growth bode well for the U.S. manufacturing sector, as goods were cheaper for international customers. Although, consumer confidence in the country is strong, high political uncertainty and poor jobs data have been weighing on the greenback.However, Hurricane Harvey is expected to have short-term impact on U.S. manufacturing, as the economy is greatly dependent on exports from Texas (read: Auto ETFs and Stocks to Ride Out Harvey Disaster).   Increasing geopolitical uncertainty relating to North Korea has increased investor demand for safe havens. North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test, that of a hydrogen bomb, which can be mounted on an Inter Continental Ballistic Missile, on September 3, 2017. Not only did it trigger an artificial earthquake of magnitude 6.3 but also rattled the markets, with Asian stocks falling while yen, euro and gold surging (read: What Lies Ahead for Gold ETFs?).Trump ImpactGiven the high political uncertainty, U.S. equity funds have been losing favor.However, there have been certain developments which might have a great impact on U.S. manufacturing. Trump’s most-recent activity includes his investigation into if China is violating international trade laws relating to intellectual property rights. American businesses operating in China are forced to hand over key technological advances to China, while operating their businesses abroad (read: Trump Takes First Step Toward Trade War? ETFs to be Impacted).Moreover, Trump’s latest threat includes stopping business with any country that trades with North Korea (read: Forget Geopolitics, Large-Cap Growth ETFs Still Strong Buys).Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. Industrial equities.Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report)This fund is one of the most popular United States equity ETFs and focuses on providing exposure to the U.S. industrial sector.It has AUM of $11.62 billion and charges a fee of 14 basis points a year.

From an individual holdings perspective, the fund has high exposure to General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Boeing Co (BA  -  Free Report) and 3M Co (MMM  -  Free Report) with 7.22%, 6.28% and 5.56% allocation, respectively (as of September 1, 2017).

XLI currently has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.Vanguard Industrials ETF (VIS  -  Free Report)This fund has AUM of $3.4 billion and charges a fee of 10 basis points a year. From a sector look, Aerospace & Defense , Industrial Conglomerates and Industrial Machinery take the top three spots, with 21.5%, 17.2% and 10.6% allocation, respectively (as of July 31, 2017). From an individual holdings perspective, the fund has high exposure to General Electric, Boeing Co and 3M Co with 8.1%, 5.1% and 4.4% allocation, respectively (as of July 31, 2017). The fund has returned 15.31% in the last one year and 7.49% year to date (as of September 1, 2017). VIS currently has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.iShares U.S. Industrials ETF (IYJ  -  Free Report)This ETF is a relatively costly bet on the U.S. industrial sector.It has AUM of $944.05 million and charges a fee of 44 basis points a year.

744,MMM,"Benchmarks closed in the red for the third consecutive trading day on Wednesday following concerns over a possible trade war between the U.S. and China. President Trump is expected to levy fresh tariffs on Chinese imports and announced that U.S.’s trade deficits with China will be reduced significantly. Shares of Dow component Boeing declined after investors fretted that a possible trade war between the two biggest economies may push China to retaliate, which may adversely affect the company. Boeing’s performance weighed on broader markets, with the Dow registering a one-day decline of around 250 points.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 1%, or 246.74 points, to close at 24,758.12. The S&P 500 fell 0.6% to close at 2,749.48. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,496.81, losing 0.2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 3.9% to close at 16.99. A total of 6.53 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.14 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.35-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.53-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Trump To Initiate Trade War With China?Per U.S. Census Bureau data, the United States posted a trade deficit of $375 billion with China last year, which was two-thirds of the economy’s trade gap of $566 billion. In contrast, China registered trade surplus of $276 billion during the same period, which was also two-thirds of the second biggest economy’s trade surplus of $422.5 billion.Last Wednesday, President Trump tweeted that the U.S. is looking to reduce its trade deficit by $1 billion.  A White House spokesperson later clarified that the exact amount was around $100 billion. Additionally, Trump reportedly said that the U.S. is looking to impose “tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports,” with Chinese telecommunications, apparel and technology sectors likely bearing most of the brunt.Following this development, a trade war is likely to break out between the United States and China. Investors fear that The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) might be the primary target of Chinese retaliation. The aircraft manufacturer projected last September that China may invest about $1 trillion over the next 20 years to acquire aircraft from the company.Any hostile move from China will jeopardize Boeing’s performance, which is why its shares fell 2.5% on Wednesday, weighing on the Dow and the industrials sector of the S&P 500. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI) declined 1.1%, becoming the second biggest loser among the S&P 500 sectors. Some of its key holdings, including 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) fell 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively.Additionally, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) decreased 1.3% and was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500. Two of its main components, DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report) and Praxair, Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) declined 2.2% and 1.8%, respectively. Praxair has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.PPI Increase Less Than January’s, Retail Sales FallIn economic news, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) for finished goods increased 0.2% in February. This increase was slightly higher than the consensus estimate of 0.1%, but fell short of January’s rise of 0.4%. Core PPI rose 0.2% in February, in line with January’s movement. Subdued PPI number along with in line consumer price inflation data reduced concerns over the pace of Fed rate hikes this year.Additionally, the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that retail sales fell 0.1% last month, in contrast to the consensus estimate of 0.4% increase. Retail sales fell for third straight month, indicating that consumer spending will fall in the first quarter of this year. However, core retail sales increased 0.1%, which are closely correlated with the consumer spending component of the GDP.Stocks That Made HeadlinesV.F.

745,MMM,"On a whole, 2017 proved to be good year with the equity markets scripting some of their best performance. The benchmark S&P 500 index is up 20% year to date and is on the course to record its best performance in four years while Nasdaq has surged nearly 30%. Buoyed by a healthy economic growth and tax overhaul euphoria, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up an impressive 25% year to date and is close to hitting the historic figure of 25,000.However, not everything is perfect among the elite list of 30 stocks that comprise the Dow and the worst performing constituent among all the members happens to be the lone surviving component of the venerable blue-chip index that debuted in 1896. Industrial goods manufacturer General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) has tanked 45% year to date — the worst performance by a Dow constituent by a huge margin while its peers like 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) boast a return of 31.5% and 16.1%, respectively. (Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)What Ails GE?With about $27 billion revenues in 2016, GE Power was the largest business segment of the company in terms of corporate revenues. However, the business has been a drag on earnings in the last few quarters as global demand waned with increasing popularity of renewable energy sources, overcapacity, lower utilization and fewer outages. Industry experts opine that the acquisition of Alstom’s assets for $10 billion in 2015 further compounded the problems for GE, as it increased the employee count by approximately 65,000 with the addition of several field offices and manufacturing sites across the world. It seemed as if GE erred in its judgment about market demand and gambled on an industry that was on a decline.This led to higher operating costs and contracted margins. The Industrial segment’s operating profit decreased 7% year over year in third-quarter 2017 to $3,501 million, with a decline in profits in Power (down 51%), Oil & Gas (down 35%) and Transportation (down 11%). GE also missed on third-quarter earnings while cash from operating industrial activities (excluding deal taxes and pension plan) declined 40% year over year to $1,740 million.The Knee-Jerk ReactionsIn order to boost its sagging shares, CEO John Flannery has decided to focus on just three core segments — power, aviation and health-care equipment and gradually exit all other businesses. At the same time, the company halved its quarterly dividend to 12 cents per share — the first dividend cut since 2009 at the peak of the recession. For 2018, the dividend allocation will be $4.2 billion, down from more than 100% of free cash flow to 60-70% while the dividend yield will be trimmed from 4.7% to 2.3%. A healthy dividend yield was one of the strongest enticements for GE investors and the dramatic plunge in share prices are testament to the fact that shareholders have been very critical of the turnaround plan.For 2017, the company has also lowered its adjusted earnings guidance to $1.04-$1.12 per share from $1.60-$1.70. For 2018, GE expects adjusted earnings to be further down to $1.00-$1.07 per share and free cash flow at significantly reduced levels of $6 billion to $7 billion.The company intends to lay off 12,000 employees across the globe in its GE Power business, as part of its corporate objective to lower operating costs and improve profitability. The drastic step seems to be the call of the hour as the beleaguered company aims to restructure its power business in tune with the evolving market conditions. In addition, GE aims to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the beleaguered power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) firm further intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve its liquidity. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bumpy Road AheadFlannery has termed 2018 as “a reset year” and expects the company to stage a turnaround to reward its shareholders with risk-adjusted returns. Critics, however, have widely raised concerns about the efficacy of such steps. Although the dividend cut was expected, the proposed exits from other businesses surprised the investor community, who argued how a much smaller and more focused GE could actually be beneficial with lower revenue-generating opportunities. Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets observed, “The company’s turnaround will now be more protracted than previously anticipated.”The drastic fall in share prices has mostly strengthened this opinion. Although some optimists would like to view this scenario as glass being half full rather being half empty, investors should rather remain cautious and weigh in their options for future.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

746,MMM,"ITT Inc. (ITT  -  Free Report) has managed to impress investors with its recent winstreak, as earnings have trumped estimates in the four trailing quarters. The company expects to continue earnings momentum on the back of strong productivity, business streamlining and cost containment measures.ITT’s performance has reflected well on share price, exhibiting investor optimism. The company’s shares have appreciated 35.8% in the last six months, against the industry’s average decline of 6.2%. We believe ITT, which enjoys a strong foothold in an expanding automotive market has several growth drivers working in its favor, in the quarters to come. Read on to find out the key drivers at the moment.Factors at PlayITT’s focus on business streamlining, cost controls and efficiency continues to prove beneficial to financial performance. The integration of its Interconnect Solutions and Control Technologies businesses into the Connect and Control Technologies segment is expected to enhance focus on target markets, streamline operations and leverage shared infrastructure as well as end markets. Its simplified operational framework will help unlock growth opportunities, as well as drive long-term growth in the global aerospace and industrial markets.The company’s three-pronged strategy to drive growth through optimizing execution, effective capital deployment and market expansion is one of the company’s biggest strengths. The Motion Technologies continue to witness exceptional operational effectiveness that is proving conducive to operating income growth. Moreover, its Industrial Process has also been performing well, owing to growth in short-cycle pumps and aftermarket service and parts. This apart, the company’s intense restructuring actions, along with intensified operational focus are expected to generate gross productivity savings.We are highly optimistic about the company’s market expansion strategies which are anticipated to act as key catalysts going forward. In the upcoming quarters, the company expects its rail and auto businesses to act as major growth drivers, fueled by an increase in acquisitions and growth in the aftermarket brake pad business. Further, the company’s diversified operations across key end markets, geographies and business cycles, reduces the company’s dependence on any single market, consequently playing a significant role in maintaining operational performance.However, the company faces risks from uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment, especially weakness in industrial markets. Also, pricing pressure on large projects and lesser petrochemical and mining project activity are anticipated to aggravate the decline in the petrochemical business in North America and China.Moreover, sharp decline in oil and gas as well as chemical markets poses a concern for the company. Based on unfavorable oil price movements, the company anticipates decline in revenues of oil and gas segments, going forward. The company projects revenues to drop mainly due to project delays, lower capital expenditure on part of clients, high cost of projects and pricing pressures.Considering growth drivers and the risks that it faces, we have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) on the company.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks worth considering are Leucadia National Corporation , 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and Raven Industries, Inc. (RAVN  -  Free Report). While Leucadia National sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 3M Company and Raven Industries carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Leucadia National has surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 21.2%.3M Company has surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.5%.Raven Industries has outpaced estimates thrice in the preceding four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 25.8%.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

747,MMM,"The euphoria over the Republican-led tax overhaul policy helped the Dow persistently hit record highs and book back-to-back weekly gains. This epic Dow rally is likely to get a boost from a stellar Q4 earnings season. Strong guidance and an upbeat economic scenario are cited to be some of the primary reasons that will help earnings pick up steam.Given the positives, investing in blue-chip stocks that are likely to make the most of the Q4 earnings season seems judicious. Such stocks, moreover, are positioned to report promising earnings results as they have strong balance sheets and solid cash flow.Dow Jones to Hit Record High Post HolidayDow futures soared triple digits on Jan 15, when the U.S. stock market was closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Dow has already booked two straight weekly gains, as well as registered seven positive weeks in the last eight. The Dow jumped almost 4.4% and posted its best start to a year since the first nine trading sessions of 2003.The 30-stock index demonstrated mostly nothing in the way of gyration or market pullbacks. In fact, the broader market shrugged off uncertainty over the past 12 months. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), quiet remarkably, registered 47 lowest closings last year, out of a total of 56 since its inception in 1990.Tax Package: A Boon for Blue ChipsThe enthusiasm over tax cuts fueled a strong rally in blue-chip stocks. The corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented this year, instead of being delayed till 2019. At the same time, any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8-15.5%, instead of the current 35%.A one-time low tax rate on foreign profits will help blue chips bring funds held overseas back to the United States. This will help such companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, dividend payments and M&A activities. They also face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).Q4 Earnings Growth Expected to be StrongerSuch blue-chip stocks’ stupendous start could get even more wings as the Q4 earnings season kicks off. Q4 earnings among all sectors are expected to be up 9.2% from the same period last year on 7% higher revenues. This would follow 6.7% earnings growth recorded in the Q3 of 2017 on 5.9% higher revenues (read more: JPMorgan's Positive Kick-off to Bank Earnings).Q4 earnings estimates for most of the sectors are expected to be positive, with Energy, Industrial Products, Basic Materials and Technology poised to post strong gains. An uptick in oil and gas output is expected to benefit the energy sector, while an increase in sales from housing demand post-hurricanes will drive manufacturing activities. Tech, in the meanwhile, will make headway from substantial growth in cloud computing, the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence (read more: 5 Best Stocks to Buy Ahead of Q4 Earnings Season).Healthy Economic DataA sound economy is further likely to support earnings growth. Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), a diversified financial services company, has predicted that the U.S. economy will expand an average 2.5% each quarter this year and the next.The unemployment rate, in the meanwhile, is at an ultra-low level of 4.1% and lifted consumer confidence to a 17-year high set in November 2017. Lest we forget, workers’ pay has also increased 2.5% from December 2016 to December 2017, up from 2.4% in the prior month.Such low jobless level, rise in income and more confident consumers increased spending further at both online and bricks-and-mortar stores and restaurants (read more: Retailers Cap a Robust Holiday-Shopping Season: 5 Must Buys).4 Blue Chips to Buy NowThanks to the bullish factors, there has been a particularly sharp run up in the 120-year-old index of 30 stocks.

749,MMM,"Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report) recently raised its outlook for first-quarter fiscal 2018. Following the news, shares were up about 3.1% at one point in pre-market trading, reflecting investors’ bullish sentiments surrounding the latest guidance.Danaher managed to impress investors in fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 as well, wherein its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.6%.For first quarter fiscal 2018, the company anticipates its adjusted earnings per share to be higher than the range of 90-93 cents projected previously. The raised guidance was owing to better-than-anticipated performance in its Life Sciences and Diagnostics platforms, particularly at its acquired unit, Cepheid. Danaher has scheduled its first-quarter 2018 conference call on Apr 19, 2018.Our TakeDanaher has had an impressive run over the past few quarters, consistently surpassing earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 2.8%. Also, Danaher has successfully repositioned itself as a healthcare company, gradually broadening its presence in the healthcare and dental markets. These markets are expected to benefit from rise in the aging population and increased spending on healthcare and fitness. Also, lucrative prospects in pharma and clinical end-markets bode well for the company.Meanwhile, the company’s Life Sciences unit has successfully enhanced its growth trajectory with new product launches. Notably, it has introduced over 20 new products in the last three years. Overall, Danaher is witnessing compelling secular market drivers across each of its platforms and believes that rapid market traction of the newly launched products will supplement sales performance. Furthermore, the company remains optimistic about earnings growth owing to improving order trends and its operating culture — Danaher Business System (“DBS”).Additionally, Danaher’s recent acquisitions have helped it to enhance productivity and drive growth. Going ahead, these factors are expected to have a positive impact on the company’s results. Also, it anticipates core growth rate to accelerate on account of the improving order trends and acquisitions like Cepheid and Phenomenex. In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has gained 8.2% against the industry’s loss of 4%.Despite these positives, slowdown in the company’s academic business in Europe and stunted revenue growth in the Dental business remains concerns for the company.

This apart, Danaher remains highly vulnerable to adverse foreign currency translations as a significant portion of its revenues is derived from regions outside the United States.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Potlatch Corporation (PCH  -  Free Report), Leucadia National Corporation  and 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report).

Flannery has led complex financial and industrial businesses of General Electric across the world and is likely to capitalize on his rich experience to fuel its growth engine.General Electric also completed the merger of its Oil & Gas business with Baker Hughes Incorporated to form an industry leader with an unrivalled mix of service and equipment capabilities. Under the terms of the agreement, GE Oil & Gas and Baker Hughes formed a new entity (the “New” Baker Hughes – a General Electric company) using a partnership structure, following which both the parties contributed their operating assets to the newly formed partnership.

752,MMM,"GE Aviation, one of the operating segments of industrial goods manufacturer General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report), recently procured a $9.7 million contract from the U.S. Navy. The contract entails the aviation division to obtain conversion kits for the Australian government’s F/A-18 aircrafts.Manufactured by The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), the F/A-18 aircraft is a state-of-the-art tactical aircraft in the U.S. Navy inventory. It offers cutting-edge multi-role strike fighter capability and flexibility to perform virtually every mission in the tactical spectrum. These include day/night strike with precision-guided weapons, fighter escort, close air support, suppression of enemy air defenses, maritime strike, reconnaissance, forward air control and tanker missions.Australia has a fleet of more than 70 1980s-era F/A-18 Hornets and 24 F/A-18F Super Hornets, which are essentially a new model of aircraft. GE Aviation makes electric power generators and related systems for military and civilian aircraft. This will help the Australian government to gradually phase out the F/A-18 with F-35 aircrafts.The contact will be executed by GE Aviation’s Vandalia facility in Dayton region. GE Aviation has three plants in Dayton with 1,300 employees combined and such contracts will keep the business humming in the region. Additionally, the deal is likely to augment the revenues of the company as it aims to script a turnaround in 2018.Shares of GE have underperformed the industry year to date, with an average loss of 44.8% significantly wider than a decline of 4.1% for the latter. In order to boost the company’s sagging shares, CEO John Flannery has decided to focus on just three core segments — power, aviation and health-care equipment — and gradually exit all other businesses.GE further intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve liquidity and reduce overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the beleaguered power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. In addition, GE has also halved its dividend. Flannery has termed 2018 as a reset year and expects the company to stage a turnaround to reward its shareholders with risk-adjusted returns. Critics, however, have widely raised concerns about the efficacy of such steps.GE currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and Raven Industries, Inc. (RAVN  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

754,MMM,"The Dow enjoyed a strong week of gains, riding on stellar earnings results. The index declined on Monday due to a spike in bond yields, which dimmed the attraction of such safe haven stocks as telecom and utilities. But the index closed in the green on each successive day, closing Thursday at a record level. The Fed’s decision to refrain from raising rates at the end of its two-day policy meeting also lifted investor sentiment.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow lost 0.2% last Friday after General Electric Company GE posted a decline in second-quarter earnings and revenues. Furthermore, decline in oil prices adversely affected energy shares, which in turn weighed on the broader markets. As per Petro-Logistics, OPEC is expected to increase crude production by 145,000 barrels per day (bpd) this month. Such expectations of an increase in production level amid oversupply concerns dragged oil prices lower.The index declined 0.3% over last week. Dismal performance by IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs GS weighed on the Dow. Again, the Amazon-Sears deal adversely affected Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), which in turn weighed on the Dow.

Also, shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) fell 1.5%, dragging down the blue-chip index. This was largely due to the fact that Merck and Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) together with its South Korean partner Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd has started selling Renflexis, a less expensive alternative version of Johnson & Johnson's rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade in the United States.The index gained 0.5% on Tuesday following stellar earning results from McDonald's Corp. MCD and Caterpillar Inc. CAT. Oil prices rose following Saudi’s decision to curb oil exports to the US.

757,MMM,"President Donald Trump’s proposal of imposing tariff on imported steel and aluminum saw domestic steel stocks rally on Thursday. Although certain quarters feel that this might spark a trade war and disbalance the global economy, eventually affecting profits of exporters, the proposal has been cheered by U.S. steel and aluminum manufacturers.Domestic steelmakers see this move as Trump’s initiative to revive the steel and aluminum industry that has been declining over the last few decades. Tariff on imported steel and aluminum also makes manufacturers hopeful of more employment in the sector. So it obviously makes good sense now to add stocks from the sector to your portfolio.Domestic Steel Stocks Rally on Trump’s Announcement Trump announced on Mar 1 that he would impose hefty tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. An executive order on the proposed tariff of 25% on imported steel and 10% aluminum would be signed in the coming days. The President believes that such a move will help in rebuilding the U.S. steel and aluminum industry that has been treated unfairly by other countries for decades. The announcement may have sparked a debate on a possible trade war but it gave the share price of U.S. steelmakers a shot in the arm.Close on the heels of the announcement, shares of major steel manufacturers rallied. On Mar 1, shares of AK Steel Holding Corp (AKS  -  Free Report) rose 9.5% and U.S. Steel Corp (X  -  Free Report) jumped 5.8%. Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) and Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) jumped 3.3% and 4.0%, respectively. Shares of aluminum producer Century Aluminum Company (CENX  -  Free Report) climbed 7.5%, while Alcoa Corp. (AA  -  Free Report) increased 1%.While the decision was well received by domestic steel manufacturers and lawmakers, it drew flak from other quarters that fear damage to the U.S. economy. The big fear among investors is that other countries might now take similar retaliatory steps, which will hurt the global economy and trade, eventually affecting profits of U.S. exporters.As a result, shares of manufacturers that utilize a significant amount of imported steel declined. Shares of major automakers, which were already suffering due to lower vehicle sales in February, declined further on the announcement. Shares of General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) fell 3.97%, while Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCAU  -  Free Report) plunged 3% and 2.8%, respectively.Moreover, shares of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) declined 2.9%. United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA) and 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) dropped 3.3%, 3.5% and 1.8%, respectively.Trump Keeps Key Campaign PromiseThe United States has been suffering from manufacturing employment decline for decades now. Before getting elected, Trump campaigned heavily on his America First trade policy. The proposed imposition of a respective 25% and 10% tariff on imported steel and aluminum is a big step in this direction.However, Trump hasn’t taken enough measures to implement that policy since taking office. His tariff announcement could mean that he is finally keeping is election campaign promise of reviving the steel and aluminum industry in the Rust Belt, that helped him win the 2016 election.Many of the workers form states in this area, who had voted for Barrack Obama, surprised the country by swinging toward Trump. However, Trump’s support in this area has been waning since then, and this announcement comes as a move to keep his promise and of course win back support before the 2020 election.Will Import Tariff Really Create Steel Jobs?Trump’s announcement comes with the objective of protecting the domestic steel and aluminum industry by increasing production, which will eventually help in creating more jobs. Trump has constantly been stressing on the need to save these industries, which he feels were not treated fairly by other countries. U.S. steelmakers lost three fourth of their jobs between 1962 and 2005.However, a study by American Economic Associations shows that this has been primarily because of improved production technology. Most steelmakers over the last few decades have increased the level of automation on their production lines, which has increased the output per worker to five times, consequently taking a toll on workforce. Hence analysts believe that despite this announcement, the impact on employment may be far less than what one hopes.Our ChoicesTrump’s America First policy has made domestic steelmakers optimistic about the future of the industry. Such a move hints at increasing domestic steel and aluminum production, which is expected to result in higher employment. Moreover, Trump’s announcement saw shares of domestic steel and aluminum makers rally immediately.Adding domestic steel stocks to your portfolio looks like a smart option at this point. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.United States Steel Corporation is an integrated steel producer with major production operations in the United States and Central Europe. United States Steel Corporation has expected earnings growth of more than 100% for the current year.

758,MMM,"On Mar 5, we updated the research report on diversified industrial goods manufacturer, 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report).3M remains focused on three key metrics namely, portfolio management, investment in innovation and business transformation. For portfolio management, 3M intends to concentrate on its most profit-making and fastest-growing businesses. To this effect, the company has taken steps to prune its businesses from 40 to 24. Since 2012, 3M had done significant portfolio restructuring — divesting assets that no longer fit in its strategy and making newer investments in more lucrative markets.The company is also investing in capital expenditures and research and development to support organic growth as it aims at a prudent capital structure and increased capital deployment. 3M's global footprint, diversified product portfolio and the ability to penetrate in different markets have been its forte. For the five-year period of 2016-2020, 3M expects 8-11% growth in earnings per share driven by an organic sales growth of 2-5%. The company expects about 20% return on invested capital during this tenure with a free cash flow conversion rate of 100%. Furthermore, 3M is standardizing its business processes through a new, global ERP system. It expects these efforts to result in $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020, and an additional $500 million reduction in working capital. Such focused attempts to maintain growth momentum is commendable.Driven by broad-based organic growth across all segments and geographies, 3M reported strong fourth-quarter 2017 results with healthy year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings and revenues. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $2.10, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03. Net sales were record high for the fourth quarter at $7,990 million, up from $7,329 million in the year-ago quarter. The top line also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,878 million. Foreign currency translation impact increased sales by 2.7%, organic local-currency sales improved it by 6% and acquisitions (net of divestitures) increased sales by 0.3%.With a diligent execution of operational plans, 3M has outperformed the industry in the last six months with an average return of 14.6% against a decline of 6.6% for the latter.Moving forward, 3M raised its earlier guidance for 2018 on strong quarterly results and improved business outlook. The company anticipates 2018 GAAP earnings in the range of $10.20 to $10.70 per share, up from prior projection of $9.60-$10.00. Organic local-currency sales are expected to be 3-5%.We remain bullish on such healthy growth outlook.3M has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other stocks worth considering in the industry include Crane Co. (CR  -  Free Report), Bunzl PLC  and Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Crane has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 13%. It exceeded estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2.6%.Bunzl PLC has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 2%.Federal Signal exceeded estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 16.5%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

759,MMM,"Benchmarks closed in the red on Thursday after President Trump said that new tariffs will be imposed on aluminum and steel imports by the U.S. next week. After this development, all the three key indexes started this month with heavy losses following concerns over a possible trade war and aggravated worries over higher inflation.The market’s fear gauge rose to its highest level since early February, moving above 20. A reading above 20 is considered alarming and indicates that the broader market is in turmoil. All the three indexes continued to decline for three consecutive trading days with the Dow down 0.4% for the year. However, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are still up 0.4% and 4%, respectively, for 2018.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 1.7%, or 428.21 points, to close at 24,608.98. The S&P 500 fell 1.4% to close at 2,677.67. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,180.56, losing 1.3%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 11.7% to close at 22.17. A total of 9 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 8.4 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.47-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.42-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Markets Stumbles for Three Straight DaysOn Thursday, President Trump said the U.S. will announce new tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports next week. He added that this move will come as the U.S. will be “going to build our steel industry back and our aluminum industry back.” Following this announcement, fears of a possible retaliation from countries like China and Canada and the European Union heightened. Additionally, worries over inflation arose following this development as such tariffs might lead to an increase in prices of imports. This in turn may raise the overall price level. Investors switched from equities to bonds on Thursday, following which bond prices increased. Rise in bond prices weighed on the yield of 10-year Treasury note, which fell from 2.870% Wednesday to 2.802% on Thursday, its worst fall in six months.The Dow lost more than 420 points on Thursday. For the S&P 500 index, 10 of the 11 sectors finished in the red with industrials and financials emerging as the biggest drag on the S&P 500. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI) decreased 2%, becoming the worst performer among the S&P 500 sectors. Consumers of steel and aluminum registered sharp declines following Trump’s announcement of new tariffs. Dow components, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) fell 3.3%, 3.5% and 1.8%, respectively.Additionally, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) declined 1.8% and was the second biggest loser among the key S&P 500 sectors. Some of its key holdings including, Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) slumped 2.4% and 1.8%, respectively. Both the companies have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

760,MMM,"Big moves from giants such as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) helped lift the market and boost investor confidence on Monday.But despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding nearly 400 points and the S&P 500 climbing over 1.18%, investors shouldn’t assume that the recent extended sell-off is completely over. This means investors should remain aware of the most recent analyst sentiment, and as always, focus on stocks that are likely to top earnings estimates.Finding stocks that beat analysts’ expectations is a great and proven way to beat the market. With that in mind, one way for investors to try to make solid returns—especially during somewhat volatile times—is to pick stocks expected to beat earnings estimates.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.With all of this said, we are giving our readers a free look at five strong stocks in order to help them identify a handful of companies that seem ready to top earnings estimates this week.1.      Builders FirstSource, Inc.

761,MMM,"Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report) inked a definitive agreement to acquire Integrated DNA Technologies (“IDT”) to help expand into the genomics research market. The terms of the transaction were kept under wraps. Danaher’s stock rose 2.1% following the news, indicating that the investors are encouraged by the deal.The deal is expected to be completed in mid-2018, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.Post-completion, IDT will operate as a stand-alone operating company and brand within Danaher's Life Sciences platform. The platform also includes Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, Pall, Molecular Devices, SCIEX and Leica Microsystems. IDT’s operations will be in sync with the Danaher Business System.IDT deals in consumables for genomics applications in molecular biology, qPCR, next-generation sequencing (NGS), gene editing, synthetic biology and molecular diagnostics. Primarily, it makes custom DNA and RNA oligonucleotides which are used in genetic analysis and functional genomics. The firm caters to clients in end markets ranging from biopharmaceutical, academic research and agriculture to biotechnology, clinical diagnostics and pharmaceutical development.IDT has a large client base (more than 100,000 customers worldwide) and it boasts promising gene correction technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 in its product arsenal. With the deal, Danaher will hold an industry-leading asset to pursue the burgeoning genetic-research and treatment markets.In fact, per a market research report by MarketsandMarkets, the global oligonucleotide synthesis market is expected to be worth $2.46 billion by 2022, which indicates a CAGR of 10.9% from 2017. The expanding demand for genetic research into treatments for disease conditions, synthetic genetics, developing next-generation sequencing methods and diagnostics are likely the primary drivers for this market.Danaher believes that the genomic market holds impressive potential and the acquisition of IDT will play a vital role in accelerating customers’ research and time to market, as users develop critical diagnostic tests and therapies. Also, the timing of the deal seems sensible as the demand for IDT’s products is expected to grow dramatically in the near future.Danaher has successfully repositioned itself as a healthcare company in recent times, gradually broadening its presence in the healthcare and dental markets. These markets are expected to benefit from the rise in aging population and increased spending on healthcare and fitness. Also, lucrative prospects in pharma and clinical end-markets bode well for the company. In six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has gained 19.3% against the industry’s loss of 1.1%.Additionally, Danaher’s acquisitions have helped it to enhance productivity and drive growth. Also, it anticipates core growth rate to accelerate on account of improving order trends and acquisitions like Cepheid and Phenomenex.Despite these positives, the slowdown in the company’s academic business in Europe and stunted revenue growth in the Dental business remain concerns for the company. Moreover, softness in industrial markets of China, North America, Latin America and the Middle East has been severely impacting the company’s business.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Potlatch Corporation (PCH  -  Free Report), Leucadia National Corporation  and 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report).

762,MMM,"U.S. equities have had a stellar run on robust growth and rising optimism around President Donald Trump’s tax reform.Senate Passes GOP Tax BillThe Senate passed the GOP tax bill just after midnight in Washington on Wednesday. The bill passed 51 to 48 and will be sent to the House for a final vote before it can be signed by Trump. The final vote in the House is required as three provisions were stripped from the bill, owing to Senate rules. However, this vote is considered a formality.The corporate tax rate will be cut to 21% from the current 35%. Moreover, repatriating foreign earnings is expected to get cheaper, as the proposed version would tax companies' overseas income held as cash at 15.5%, while non-cash holdings will be taxed at 8%.  Individual income taxes will be cut but will expire in 2025, unlike corporate taxes. Although seven tax brackets are maintained, various analyses predict that few middleclass earners might have a higher tax bill.Tax Bill ImplicationsPer a Financial Times article citing a Barclays analysis, it has been estimated that average earnings per share will be increased by 6.3% in 2018 owing to tax reform savings.However, in the long run, major concerns remain around the deficit the tax bill will add. The Treasury department suggested that GDP will grow at 2.9% in the next decade and will raise $1.8 trillion in the period, which will provide an additional $300 billion over and above the tax revenue deficit. However, this is in stark contrast to other analyses that suggest a more conservative growth estimate and an addition to the deficit ranging from $448 billion to more than $1 trillion over the next decade.As of now, analysts predict that the markets have not yet fully priced in the tax reform. Let us now discuss a few leveraged ETFs focused on providing exposure to the large-cap U.S. equity space.ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF (TQQQ  -  Free Report)This fund is a popular ETF that provides 3x leveraged exposure to large-cap U.S. companies.  However, it should be noted that the fund’s leverage is reset on a daily basis, which results in compounding of returns when held for multiple periods.

From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Information Technology, Consumer Discretionary and Health Care with 59.3%, 21.1% and 11.5% allocation, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017).

763,MMM,"The Industrials sector has been attracting a lot of investor attention lately. Strong manufacturing sector jobs and growing investor optimism has contributed to the success of this sector.Economic ScenarioThe Institute for Supply Management’s Manufacturing PMI declined to 58.2 in November compared with 58.7 in October. Manufacturing slowed from the 13-year high of 60.8 reached in September. However, per a CNN article, the sector has added about 138,000 jobs in the first 10 months of this year against a loss of 34,000 jobs in the prior-year period.Manufacturing has benefited from a weaker greenback. The manufacturing industry depends greatly on exports and a weaker dollar provided support to the sector. However, strong imports from China led to a record monthly trade deficit of $48.7 billion in October. Higher price for imported crude oil also contributed to the widening gap.The Senate passed its version of the tax reform. The Senate voted 51-49 in favor of the tax reform. Although there are still multiple hurdles to the tax reform becoming a law, Trump called the Senate vote a major victory and the Republican Party unbeatable. The primary concern weighing on the timely passing of the tax reform is that the House and Senate’s respective versions vary significantly. This might then pose some challenges in the passing of the reform without a few key changes.Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sector.Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to industrial stocks and tracks the Industrial Select Sector Index. It has AUM of $12.9 billion and charges a low fee of 14 basis points a year. It has 68 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as more than 45% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Aerospace & Defense, Industrial Conglomerates and Machinery, with 24.9%, 18.2% and 17.4% exposure, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Boeing Co (BA  -  Free Report), 3M Co (MMM  -  Free Report) and Honeywell Intl Inc (HON  -  Free Report) with 6.8%, 6.1% and 5.1% allocation, respectively (as of Dec 7, 2017).  The fund has returned 18.4% in a year and 19.5% year to date (as of Dec 7, 2017). XLI has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.iShares U.S. Industrials ETF (IYJ  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to industrial stocks and tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Industrials Index. It has AUM of $1.2 billion and charges a fee of 44 basis points a year. It has 204 holdings and bears concentration risk as more than 33% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Capital Goods, Software & Services and Transportation, with 57.1%, 13.5% and 12.6% exposure, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Boeing, General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) and 3M Co with 4.7%, 4.6% and 4.3% allocation, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017). The fund has returned 20.1% in a year and 20.4% year to date (as of Dec 7, 2017). IYJ has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook.Bottom LineXLI is more popular than IYJ, as is evident from its higher AUM. Moreover, XLI may also be more appealing to investors owing to its cheaper expense ratio.  However, IYJ has a more diversified exposure in terms of number of holdings and has been the better performer.At the same time, both the funds have had relatively similar year-to-date performance. IYJ has returned a mere 0.9% more than XLI so far this year, whereas in a year, it outperformed XLI by 1.7%. Global manufacturing activity has been picking up owing to stronger demand; hence these ETFs are poised to benefit the investors in the long run. Moreover, if the tax reforms are enacted, companies will be able to repatriate a significant amount of profits back into the United States at relatively low tax rates.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

764,MMM,"Confirming industry wide speculations, General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) unveiled its plans to lay off 12,000 employees across the globe in its GE Power business, as part of its corporate objective to lower operating costs and improve profitability. The drastic step seems to be the call of the hour as the beleaguered company aims to restructure its power business in tune with the evolving market conditions.With about $27 billion revenues in 2016, GE Power was the largest business segment of the company in terms of corporate revenues. However, the business has been a drag on earnings in the last few quarters as global demand waned with increasing popularity of renewable energy sources, overcapacity, lower utilization and fewer outages. Industry experts opined that the acquisition of Alstom’s assets for $10 billion in 2015 further compounded the problems for GE, as it increased the employee count by approximately 65,000 with the addition of several field offices and manufacturing sites across the world. It seemed as if GE erred in its judgment about market demand and gambled on an industry that was on a decline.GE intends to execute the job cuts over the next 18 months, with about half of them taking place in Europe, namely France, Germany and Switzerland. The strategic move is also in tune with the broader goal of the industrial goods manufacturer to integrate the energy connections and power businesses with GE Power, seeking to save about $1 billion in costs in 2018 and an additional $500 million in 2019. The latest layoff follows a similar exercise last month, when GE trimmed staff at its interim corporate headquarters in Boston and eliminated about 100 sales positions within the GE Digital division. According to Bloomberg, GE has announced a total of 19,242 job cuts in 2017 — the most by any U.S. company in the year.     The continued reduction in employee headcount is aimed at scripting a turnaround for the 125-year-old conglomerate by reducing operating costs and strengthening its liquidity. Shares of GE have underperformed the industry year to date, with an average loss of 43.9% compared with a decline of 5% for the latter. In order to boost the company’s sagging shares, CEO John Flannery has also decided to focus on just three core segments — power, aviation and health-care equipment — and gradually exit all other businesses. In addition, GE aims to improve its profitability by reducing overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the beleaguered power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. GE further intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve its liquidity. Flannery has termed 2018 as a reset year and expects the company to stage a turnaround to reward its shareholders with risk-adjusted returns. Critics, however, have widely raised concerns about the efficacy of such steps.GE has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and Leucadia National Corporation , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

767,MMM,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because 3M Company is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MMM in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.07 per share for MMM, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for MMM, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.72% heading into earnings season.3M Company Price and EPS Surprise 3M Company Price and EPS Surprise | 3M Company QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that MMM has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for 3M Company, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

768,MMM,"Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) has announced that it will provide United Airlines with key cockpit avionics for more than 150 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. The delivery of these technologies will take place in April 2018.Honeywell's SmartRunway and SmartLanding software will be included as part of the deal. These are expected to greatly decrease the risk of long landings, hard landings, tail strikes and runway excursions, especially since majority of aviation accidents occur during aircraft approach and landing. Honeywell's IntuVue RDR-4000 3D Weather Radar System will also be included.The first of its kind, IntuVue RDR-4000 with its superior technology to combat weather hazards, aims to help the aerospace industry and the U.S. economy save billions of dollars in annual expenses caused by weather related delays and cancellations. Integrated Multi-Mode Receiver, a fully digital navigation receiver is the industry’s only receiver to combine satellite-based and ground-based navigation systems into one. These technologies are expected to help increase passenger comfort and safety.By providing these technologies Honeywell will help United Airlines meet the upcoming Federal Aviation Administration regulations.Honeywell's Aerospace unit develops innovative technologies designed to make aircraft safer and more fuel-efficient. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Aerospace unit for fourth-quarter 2017 is $3,873 million, which is relatively higher than the year-ago figure of $3,666 million. The increase in revenues can be attributed to a recent increase in demand of Aerospace’s products and services by aircraft manufacturers, airlines and the U.S. military.Since revenues from the Aerospace business constitute the majority of total revenues for the company, this can spell good news for its profitability. Shares of the company have outperformed the industry in the last three months with an average return of 9.8% against a decline of 1.9% for the latter.Honeywell has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

769,MMM,"Investors in 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 19, 2018 $90 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for 3M Company shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, 3M Company is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Diversified Operations industry that ranks in the Top 35% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.01 per share to $2.02 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about 3M Company right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

770,MMM,"On Jan 15, we updated the research report on diversified industrial goods manufacturer 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report).The company’s brands like Nexcare, Post-it, Scotch, Scotch-Brite, ScotchBlue and Filtrete are well recognized names in each household while being market leaders in their respective product categories. With continuous product innovations and investments in R&D, 3M aims to maintain a healthy organic growth. The company’s ability to convert high R&D spends into up-cycle market share gains and strong pricing powers determine its success. In 2018, the company plans to invest approximately $1.9 billion in R&D.At present, the company is focused on three key metrics namely, portfolio management, investment in innovation and business transformation. For portfolio management, 3M intends to concentrate on its most profit-making and fastest-growing businesses. To this effect, the company has taken steps to prune its businesses from 40 to 24. Since 2012, 3M had done significant portfolio restructuring — divesting assets that no longer fit in its strategy and making newer investments in other more lucrative markets.With a diligent execution of operational plans, 3M has outperformed the industry in the last three months with an average return of 11.8% compared with a gain of 1.9% for the latter.Moving forward, 3M is standardizing its business processes through a new, global ERP system. The company expects these efforts to result in $500 to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020, and an additional $500 million through reduction in working capital requirements.3M has continually delivered sustainable increase in earnings and free cash flow, benefiting from its increasing investments in high-growth programs. However, the market acceptance of these new product offerings will determine the success of its growth objectives. It also remains to be seen how well the company can keep churning out these new and improved products at acceptable prices for the market.3M's strengths include its global footprint, diversified product portfolio and the ability to penetrate in different markets. The company expects 8-11% growth in earnings per share from 2016 to 2020 driven by an organic sales growth of 2-5%. We remain bullish on such healthy growth outlook.3M currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other stocks worth considering in the industry include Raven Industries, Inc. (RAVN  -  Free Report), Bunzl PLC  and Leucadia National Corporation  each carrying a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Raven has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 10%.

771,MMM,"In a concerted move to augment its leading position in the market and capitalize on higher revenue-generating potential, 3M Company’s (MMM  -  Free Report) Filtrete Brand has launched the industry’s first Bluetooth-enabled HVAC (heating, ventilation and cooling) home air filter named Filtrete Smart Air Filter.The Filtrete Brand focuses on developing products that improves air quality indoors. Filtrete Filters are meant to have an average duration of about three months. If not changed in time, they lose effectiveness. However, it has been found that since each home is different, determining the exact duration of a filter often becomes a difficult proposition. So, Filtrete’s new product is designed to help customers by doing away with the guesswork.The new Filtrete Smart Air Filter has several features specifically designed to help customers. It comes with a special Bluetooth-enabled pressure sensor and Smart App which will notify users when it’s time to replace the filter. By connecting iOS or Android mobile devices via Bluetooth, filters no longer have to be replaced when the customary three months are over, rather the air flow and usage of the particular home will determine its longevity.Since customers often forget the filter specifications like size and type, the Filtrete Smart App suggests online retailers who carry filters of similar specifications. Outdoor air quality information in the area and other areas will be similarly visible. The app will also display information on indoor air quality if used with a separate air quality monitor.Filtrete Smart Air Filters will be available in the market from spring 2018.3M intends to invest more on product innovations and research and development that will continue to support its organic growth in the future. The company’s ability to convert high R&D spends into up-cycle market share gains and strong pricing powers determine its success. Organic growth remains the first priority of the company as it continues to invest in infrastructure and commercialization capability. The company also remains focused on three key metrics namely, portfolio management, investment in innovation and business transformation.3M's global footprint, diversified product portfolio and the ability to penetrate in different markets have been its key strengths as evidenced by its share price movement. Shares of 3M have outperformed the industry in the last three months with an average return of 10.6% against a decline of 0.6% for the latter.3M currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

772,MMM,"The materials sector is attracting a lot of investor attention lately. Industrial Metals have been rebounding on greater global optimism. This is primarily due to robust global growth cues and strong demand.However, the relation between the United States and its trade partners is not so sweet right now, with fears of a potential trade war looming large. “We’ll be imposing tariffs on steel imports, and tariffs on aluminum imports. And you’re going to see a lot of good things happen,” Trump said. Trump’s America First agenda has sparked fears of a trade war, as he told steel and aluminum industry executives in a meeting about his intention to implement a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports.Trump's tariff plan ""is bad policy at a bad time and will only add to the risk of a trade war,"" per a New York Times article citing Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital.Into the HeadlinesTrump said the tariffs will be introduced as early as next week. However, it is not yet clear if any specific product or country will be excluded from the arrangement. American stocks for companies that use the metals took a beating as a result of this announcement.The U.S. measures “overturn the international trade order,” per a Bloomberg article citing Wen Xianjun, vice chairman of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association. “Other countries, including China, will take relevant retaliatory measures,” Wen added.Japan voiced its concerns too. “Steel and aluminum imports from Japan, which is an ally, do not affect U.S. national security at all,” Japan’s Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko told reporters in Tokyo. “I would like to convey that to the U.S. when I have an opportunity,” Seko added.American companies have for long criticized Chinese practices, as they complain that Chinese companies dump their products at below-market prices, thanks to the state subsidy they receive. However, America can expect retaliatory measures from China, as the emerging market nation is the largest producer of steel and aluminum. Amongst the biggest concerns, China is evaluating trade of soybeans and other farm products with the United States, which might weigh on American famers and ultimately on Trump’s support among rural Americans and Republican strongholds.Adding to the agony, if the tariffs lead to an increase in raw material cost for manufacturers who use these metals, they might have to pass on a certain percentage of the rise to consumers. This in turn will add on to inflationary pressures, at a time when Wall Street is already worrying about the impact that rising inflation will have on the markets.The S&P 500 entered correction territory, as it declined more than 10% from the record high set in January. Strong wage growth and jobs data introduced fears of inflation making a comeback and led investors to bet on aggressive rate hikes. Therefore, at an already shaky time for Wall Street, Trump’s tariffs do no good to alleviate investor concerns about the markets (read: 5 ETFs to Bet on Post Fed Minutes).Let us now discuss ETFs that are expected to be impacted because of this announcement.Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLB  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to materials’ stocks and tracks the Materials Select Sector Index. It has AUM of $5.1 billion and charges a moderate fee of 13 basis points a year.

(DWDP  -  Free Report), Monsanto Co.  and Praxair Inc (PX  -  Free Report) with 22.7%, 8.2% and 6.4% allocation, respectively (as of Mar 1, 2018).  The fund has returned 12.8% in a year. XLB has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold), with a Medium risk outlook.Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report)This fund focuses on providing exposure to the U.S. industrial sector.

773,MMM,"The S&P 500 has gained about 20% in 2017, and several other notable indexes have hit new all-time highs throughout the year. This movement can be attributed in large part to the continued rise of household technology powers, including the likes of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report).Along with these two tech giants, instantly recognizable companies such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) also surged in 2017. These big name, big-revenue companies often drive indexes higher and can become very attractive to investors as they are covered on a nearly constant basis.Of course, just because a company has a name people know, or a product they might recognize, does not mean it is a good stock to buy. Nevertheless, well-known companies, with brands that can be seen all over the world, are always popular picks.With that said, let’s take a look at three iconic companies that also have high Zacks Ranks and solid fundamentals:1.     3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report)The maker of products such as Post-it notes and Scotch tape, which also boasts thousands of other SKUs across an array of fields, is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system.Looking ahead, 3M is projected to see its current full-year earnings jump by 11.48% to hit $9.10 per share, based on current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The conglomerate’s full-year sales are expected to reach $31.54 billion, which would mark nearly 5% growth—a solid rate for a company of its size and age.3M’s current cash flow growth rate outpaces its industry’s average and could help the company innovate further. Looking farther down the road, the company expects strong sales growth in 2018. More specifically, 3M expects to grow its business in China and expand its self-driving car portfolio, all while continuing to streamline its product offerings.Shares of 3M popped over 33.50% in 2017, including 12.97% in the last 12 weeks. Yet, 3M’s shares currently rest below their 52-week high, which could give investors the chance to buy at a potentially discounted price ahead of the fourth-quarter earnings season.2.       Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report)This manufacturer of desktops, laptops, tablets and powerful processors just closed at a new 52-week high of $47.56 per share on Wednesday. Before today’s gains, shares of Intel had surged 29.69% in 2017. Intel is also currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and rocks a “B” grade for Value in our Style Scores system.The tech giant is currently trading at 14.47x earnings, which marks a major discount compared to the “Semiconductor – General” industry average and looks even better compared to rival Nvidia’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) 46.82 P/E ratio.Intel’s CEO recently spoke about the need for his company to take more risks, where change will become the ""new normal."" In a memo to employees, Intel’s chief executive wrote: ""Anything that produces data, anything that requires a lot of computing, the vision is, we're there.""Looking ahead, Intel is projected to see its full-year EPS climb 19.51% to hit $3.25 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company has also received 15 upward earnings estimate revisions against no downgrades for its current full-year, all of which came in the last 60 days. Intel also earned a 14 to zero upgrade ratio for its fiscal 2018.3.       Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report)This Japanese automotive giant, which helped kick off the modern sustainable vehicle revolution with its Toyota Prius, is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). On top of that, Toyota earned an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system, helping the company score an overall “B” VGM grade.Toyota is currently trading at only 10.61x earnings, which fairs well compared to the “Automotive – Foreign” industry average and marks a discount against the S&P 500. The company’s 0.73 P/S ratio and P/B ratio of 1.11 also help demonstrate Toyota’s current value to investors.Shares of Toyota have gained about 4.68% in the last 12 weeks and currently sit near their 52-week high. However, the company made announcements recently that could help sends its shares even higher.Toyota just announced that it sold 10.35 million vehicles this year—up 2% year-over-year— putting it close to last year’s top seller Volkswagen AG (VLKAY). Toyota now expects to sell 10.49 million vehicles in 2018 and plans to roll out 10 fully electric vehicles by the early 2020s.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

774,MMM,"Shares of industrial goods manufacturer United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) scaled a new 52-week high of $126.44 during Friday’s trading session, before closing a tad lower at $126.17 for a healthy year-to-date return of 16.5%. Barring minor hiccups, United Technologies’ share price has steadily been on an uptrend since mid-September.Despite its strong price appreciation, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has the potential to continue its upward trend with long-term earnings growth expectation of 8.4%.Growth DriversUnited Technologies serves various end markets such as aerospace, defense and commercial construction, that move according to their own cycles. This business mix and diversification allow the company to remain profitable even during tough economic times.In addition, United Technologies has a strong aftermarket business. The company not only manufactures and sells primary products such as elevators, aircraft engines and helicopters but also sells spare parts and offers related services to keep those primary products running.The company’s aftermarket services business is relatively stable compared to new product delivery. It further helps offset the negative impact of downturns in the new products market. With a diligent execution of operational plans, the company has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 15.1% against a decline of 4% for the latter.United Technologies has also revamped its aerospace unit. This included an overhaul of its organizational structure in the aerospace business along with some key changes in the leadership positions within it. United Technologies anticipates that the streamlined organizational setup would enable it to better serve its customers. In addition, the company expects that the strategic moves will further ensure a successful entry and production ramp-up of its Geared Turbofan engines to thwart intense competition from other players in the market.Incorporating its improved expectations for organic sales growth in the near future, management has raised its guidance for 2017. Adjusted earnings are currently anticipated to lie within the $6.58-$6.63 per share range compared with the previously estimated range of $6.45-$6.60.  Additionally, the company raised its revenue guidance for 2017 from the previous projection of $58.5-$59.5 billion to $59-$59.5 billion (estimating an organic growth of 3-4% year over year). Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment and continued investments in the aerospace segment, the company expects to generate significant cash from operations to reward the shareholders with a risk-adjusted return through share repurchases and dividends. This represents improving business conditions and strong operating fundamentals of the company.All these measures for a healthy near-term growth probably raised investor confidence and drove the shares to a 52-week high.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are Danaher Corp.

775,MMM,"Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report) recently initiated outlook for 2018, ahead of its annual investor and analyst meeting scheduled to be held in New York City. The company projects diluted net earnings per share in the range of $3.50 to $3.60.Danaher currently expects 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the band $4.25–$4.35, assuming non-GAAP core revenue growth in the range of 3.5-4%. The company is enjoying meaningful growth and margin expansion opportunities across its portfolio, along with solid momentum in its recent Cepheid, Pall and Nobel acquisitions. Danaher’s results should benefit from these factors in 2018.The company reported robust third-quarter 2017 results, primarily owing to its Danaher Business System (“DBS”) that focuses on three critical areas -- quality, delivery, and cost & innovation.The company has had an impressive 2017 so far, delivering core growth acceleration, operating margin expansion as well as double-digit growth in earnings. Moreover, the company’s recent acquisitions continue to perform impressively, which have helped it improve productivity and drive growth. These factors should have a positive impact on the company’s operations, going into 2018.Our TakeLeveraging on DBS, the company has consistently driven gross and operating margin growth, lower general and administrative expense, and higher investments  in Research & Development along with sales and marketing. Notably, the company has returned 9.9% in the past six months, against the industry’s loss of 8.8%.In third-quarter 2017, DBS contributed significantly to the company’s year-over-year core revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share improvement, strong margin expansion and robust free cash flow. In the reported quarter, gross margins were up 70 basis points to 56%. It also helped to drive share gains in a number of operating units and reinvestment in strategic businesses to boost long-term growth. Going forward, the company remains confident that DBS will unlock multiple opportunities to bolster margin growth.The company has successfully repositioned itself as a healthcare company, broadening its presence in the healthcare and dental markets, which are expected to benefit from the rise in the aging population and increased spending on healthcare and fitness. Additionally, lucrative prospects in pharma and clinical end-markets bode well.During 2016, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company closed eight acquisitions across all five platforms for nearly $5 billion, which has contributed significantly to Danaher’s growth this year. We believe that strategic buyouts and positive industry trends will unlock a host of opportunities for Danaher, going forward. For instance, the company expects core growth rate to accelerate going forward, in light of improving order trends and recent acquisitions like Cepheid and Phenomenex.Other Stocks to Consider Some other top-ranked stocks from the same space include Hitachi Ltd.

776,MMM,"3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) recently inked a definitive agreement with Corning Incorporated to divest its Communication Markets business for $900 million. Corning is a premier manufacturer of glass, ceramics, and related materials for industrial and scientific applications. The transaction is expected to be completed in 2018, subject to mandatory closing conditions and regulatory approvals.The held-for-sale business is part of 3M’s Electronics and Energy segment and offers a wide array of optical fiber and copper passive connectivity solutions for the telecommunications industry. These include closures, connectors, splices, modular cabinets and structured cabling systems for copper fiber optic networks and wireless media. The business employs approximately 500 employees and generates annual global sales to the tune of $400 million. Post divesture, these employees will be absorbed by Corning Incorporated. 3M expects to realize a gain of approximately 40 cents per share from the deal.3M decided to divest the business to focus on its core businesses. Over the years, the diversified industrial goods manufacturer has continuously pruned its businesses to improve customer relevance, productivity and speed through a leaner operating structure. At the same time, 3M has maintained a steady investment in R&D to develop innovative products.3M expects to deliver sustainable increase in earnings and free cash flow, benefiting from its long-term strategy of accelerating investment in high-growth programs. The company’s ability to convert high R&D spends into up-cycle market share gains and strong pricing powers determine its success. Organic growth remains the first priority of the company as it continues to invest in infrastructure and commercialization capability. With a diligent execution of operational plans, 3M has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 34% against a decline of 4.6% for the latter.3M's global footprint, diversified product portfolio and the ability to penetrate in different markets have been its forte.

It expects about 20% return on invested capital during this tenure with a free cash flow conversion rate of 100%. Furthermore, 3M is standardizing its business processes through a new, global ERP system. The company expects these efforts to result in $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020, and an additional $500 million reduction in working capital.3M presently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

777,MMM,"Corning Incorporated (GLW  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has agreed to take over 3M Company’s (MMM  -  Free Report) Communication Markets Division completely in an all-cash deal for approximately $900 million. The acquisition is expected to be completed during 2018, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.Headquartered in Austin, TX, 3M’s Communication Markets Division provides optical fiber products and high bandwidth connectivity solutions for the telecommunications industry. The company has annual worldwide sales of approximately $400 million.This strategic move is in line with Corning's plan to invest $1-$3 billion in acquisitions. Moreover, the company expects the deal to add 7-9 cents to 2019 earnings.Post the deal, 3M’s unit will be a part of Corning`s Optical Communications segment. The acquisition will result in adding around 500 3M’s employees to Corning.This acquisition will strengthen Corning’s Optical Communications worldwide market access. We believe that 3M’s high bandwidth and optical fiber products combined with Corning’s global optical passive components and solutions will enable the latter to expand its broad portfolio of high-bandwidth optical solutions. This in turn will enhance customer experience resulting in additional revenues for Corning.Considering growth witnessed by the Optical Communications market in the last few years, this deal will boost Corning’s revenues and increase overall market share. In the recently reported third-quarter 2017 results, Optical Communications segment generated 35.3% of total revenues. Reported segment revenues increased 15.3% year over year and 4% on a sequential basis to $917 million on the back of strong demand for both enterprise and carrier products.Share Price Momentum to ContinueCorning has outperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. While the industry gained 21.4%, the stock returned 37.1%.Last WordCorning is a worldwide provider of connectivity solutions. The company has been supplementing its portfolio with various acquisitions.We believe that growing demand for Corning’s fiber optics products, as reflected by the Verizon Communications Inc (VZ  -  Free Report) deal, which was signed in April.  Moreover, strong demand for Gorilla Glass 5 (GG5) is a key catalyst.These along with strategic acquisitions like SpiderCloud, Gerresheimer’s Pharmaceutical Glass Tubing Business, Alliance Fiber Optic Products and STRAN Technologies will aid the stock sustain its momentum in the rest of 2017.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderCurrently, Corning carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

778,MMM,"According to a Reuters report, General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is likely to lay off about 4,500 employees in Europe as part of its corporate objective to lower operating costs and improve profitability. Although the company spokesperson declined to comment on the grapevine, an unnamed union source confirmed the veracity of the news.The job cuts are mostly centered on the power and grid businesses that GE bought from Alstom in 2015 and will affect employees in Switzerland, Germany and Britain. Billed as one of the largest acquisition by GE at about $10 billion, the transaction increased the employee count of the company by approximately 65,000 with the addition of several field offices and manufacturing sites across the world. This significantly increased the operating costs of the company and eroded margins as demand for new power plants waned due to competition from cost-competitive wind and solar systems and higher inventory in the market. Consequently, management was forced to initiate some drastic steps and eliminate redundant positions in order to improve profitability.The strategic move is also in tune with the broader goal of the industrial goods manufacturer to integrate the energy connections and power businesses with GE Power, seeking to save about $1 billion in costs in 2018 and an additional $500 million in 2019. The latest layoff follows a similar exercise last month, when GE trimmed staff at its interim corporate headquarters in Boston and eliminated about 100 sales positions within the GE Digital division.    The continued reduction in employee headcount is aimed at scripting a turnaround for the 125-year-old conglomerate by reducing operating costs and strengthening its liquidity. Shares of GE have underperformed the industry year to date, with an average loss of 44.1% compared with a decline of 5% for the latter. In order to boost the company’s sagging shares, CEO John Flannery has also decided to focus on just three core segments — power, aviation and health-care equipment — and gradually exit all other businesses. In addition, GE aims to improve its profitability by reducing overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the beleaguered power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. GE further intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve its liquidity.Flannery has termed 2018 as a reset year and expects the company to stage a turnaround to reward its shareholders with risk-adjusted returns. Critics, however, have widely raised concerns about the efficacy of such steps.GE has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and Leucadia National Corporation , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

779,MMM,"We issued an updated research report on Crane Co. (CR  -  Free Report) on Jan 8. A well diversified business portfolio, synergistic benefits from acquired assets and priorities of rewarding shareholders handsomely will prove advantageous for the company. However, headwinds related to regulatory compliances, industry competition and segmental weakness might restrict its growth momentum in the near term.Crane currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its market capitalization is approximately $5.4 billion.The company’s financial performance was better than expected in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.40%. The stock’s Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $5.00 for 2018, representing growth of 1 cent from the tally 60 days ago.Also, market sentiments have been positive with the stock yielding 13.1% return in the last three months. This gain is above 0.3% decline of the industry it belongs to.Below we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring CraneBusiness Diversification a Boon: Crane serves customers in various end markets like aerospace, electronics, hydrocarbon processing, petrochemical, chemical, power generation, automated merchandising, transportation and other markets. Such diversification prevents the company from losses in the event of loss of business from any particular customer. Furthermore, international diversity has played a major role in Crane’s profitability over time. The company primarily operates in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia.The company businesses are carried out through four reportable segments — Fluid Handling, Payment & Merchandising Technologies, Aerospace & Electronics and Engineered Materials. The company anticipates increase in demand for productivity solutions in Payment & Merchandising Technologies segment, high growth programs in Aerospace & Electronics, recovering of orders in Fluid Handling and strengthening of end markets in Engineered Materials in the long run. Average organic growth will be at least 2-4% for Fluid Handling, 3-5% for Payment & Merchandising Technologies, 3-5% for Aerospace & Electronics, and equal to GDP growth for Engineered Materials.Inorganic Initiatives Drive Growth Opportunities: Acquired assets have over time helped Crane leverage benefits from easy penetration into unexplored markets and expanded product offerings. In this regard, the acquisition of Westlock Controls — specializing in manufacturing and distribution of switchboxes, position transmitters and other solutions for use in networking, monitoring and controlling process valves — in May is worth mentioning.In addition, in December, it agreed to acquire Crane Currency, which designs and manufactures secure and highly-engineered banknotes as well as engages in substrates manufacturing and providing advanced micro-optic security technology to its customers. This buyout, when completed, will strengthen the company’s foothold in the currency and payments market as well as add roughly 15 cents to earnings per share in the first year post completion. This accretion is projected to increase to $1 by 2021. Further, the company believes that this transaction will enable it to grow its earnings per share by more than 10% in the years ahead.Shareholders’ Return and Promising Guidance: Share buybacks and dividend payments are the prime means of returning value to shareholders for Crane. In the first nine months of 2017, the company paid dividends totaling $58.8 million and repurchased shares worth $25 million. Over the long term, the company targets achieving a total payout ratio of 40-50%.For 2017, Crane anticipates adjusted earnings guidance to be $4.45-$4.55 per share. It predicts 2018 earnings, excluding the impact of Crane Currency buyout, to be within the $4.85-$5.05 per share range. Core sales are estimated to increase in the 2-4% range.Over the long run, the company aims at achieving 10% average annual earnings per share growth. Free cash flow conversion will likely be 100% or more of net income.Factors Working Against CranePoor Valuation & Fourth-Quarter Weakness: On a P/E (TTM) basis, Crane’s shares look overvalued compared with the industry with respective tallies of 20.9x and 19.5x in the last three months. Also, the stock is trading above the median of last three-months P/E multiples of 19.3x. This makes us cautious on the stock.The company predicts sequentially lower sales in Fluid Handling and Payment and Merchandising Technologies segments in the fourth quarter. Also, the ebbing impact of unfavorable foreign currency movements is predicted to be offset by higher commodity and input costs.Threat From Domestic Compliances and International Expansion: Crane has to comply with many governmental regulations in its homeland, especially in the Aerospace & Electronics and Fluid Handling segments. Any failure to meet the requirements can attract penalties, denting the company’s profitability.In addition, business expansion in foreign nations has exposed it to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies and geo-political issues.Threat From Industry Competition: Crane faces active competition from other players in the industry due to its wide diversity of products and vastness of the markets it serves. Difficulties or delays in research & development or production and services, apart from failure of new products and technologies in the market, may hurt the company’s competitive position.Some better-ranked stocks in the industry are 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report), Carlisle Companies Incorporated (CSL  -  Free Report) and ITT Inc.

780,MMM,"With the Dow breezing past the 25,000 milestone, President Trump believes even 30,000 is possible. The blue-chip index has relentlessly soared to record highs in the past year and has nearly quadrupled in value from the financial crisis in 2009. Enthusiasm over the Republican-led tax cut, which can boost corporate profits this year, and a series of strong economic reports helped the index move north by leaps and bounds.Given the positives, investing in blue-chip stocks seems tempting at the moment. Such companies are slated to gain further in the near term as they have large market capitalization, strong balance sheets and solid cash flow.Dow Bursts through the 25,000 Point MarkThe Dow kicked off 2018 with sizeable gains. The 30-stock index topped the coveted 25,000 mark and notched its biggest weekly gain since the period ended Dec 1, 2017. It just took 35 calendar days for the Dow to jump from 24,000 to 25,000, its fastest 1,000-point climb.The Dow has now extended its last year’s gain of 25%, helping the Bull Run that began in 2009, to post its second-longest run in Wall Street history. In fact, the index hit 71 record closing highs last year, the highest since the blue-chip index’s creation in 1896.Several gurus, who until recently called for a stock market correction, are now turning super bullish. They are predicting the Dow to hit 30,000 in the near term. Also, Trump said, “I guess our new number is 30,000.” He has already taken credit for Dow 25,000 and has become the first ever President in the history to have spoken so much about the U.S. equity market.Is Dow 30,000 Possible in Trump’s First Term?The recent tax code overhaul and a strengthening economy could certainly help the Dow breeze past 30,000 and help American blue-chip companies make more money.Republican-Backed Tax Package Republicans efficaciously defied opposition from Democrats to pass the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code that will trim corporate taxes and provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle-class Americans. The corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented this year, instead of being delayed till 2019. At the same time, any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8-15.5%, instead of the current 35%.A one-time low tax rate on foreign profits will help blue-chips bring funds held overseas back to the United States. Bringing back overseas cash pile will help such companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, dividend payments and M&A activities. They also face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. The tax bill, in the meanwhile, will provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle-class Americans. This in turn will increase discretionary income that may give a boost to the demand for consumer goods and services (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).Strong Economic GrowthU.S. manufacturing surged in December, touching the second-highest reading of 2017. Increase in sales from housing demand post-hurricane and a general uptick in the economy gave a boost to manufacturing activities. Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), a diversified financial services company has predicted that the U.S. economy will expand an average 2.5% each quarter this year and the next.Economic recovery worldwide also gave a boost to profitability of American blue-chip companies, reduced the jobless rate to 4.1% and lifted consumer confidence to a 17-year high set in November. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, added that “consumers’ expectations remain at historically strong levels, suggesting economic growth will continue well into 2018.”Some pessimists may argue that job addition numbers last month came in below expectations. However, the average over the past few months continues to show that the labor market remains strong, while workers’ pay has also increased 2.5% from Dec 2016 to Dec 2017, up from 2.4% in the prior month. The National Employment Law Project, in fact, showed that minimum wage is poised to increase in 18 states and around 20 cities in the United States. This will result in inching employees wage closer to $15 an hour, which is known as “living wage.”5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Ride Dow’s Stellar RunThanks to the aforesaid bullish factors, there has been a particularly sharp run up in the 120-year-old index of 30 stocks. This calls for investing in some fundamentally sound blue-chip companies which can make the most of this bullish run. We have, thus, zeroed in on five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The firm, founded in 1801, is anticipated to generate $500 million revenues in 2017, with roughly one-third sourced from the U.S. operations and rest internationally.

782,MMM,"As the third-quarter earnings season heads to its last lap, various analysis and comparisons are being done by industry peers to gauge the underlying metrics and relative performance. Let us perform a similar comparative analysis among leading players in the Diversified Conglomerates sector to pick the best investment option based on third-quarter earnings scorecard.Third-Quarter Earnings3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) reported strong third-quarter 2017 results with healthy year-over-year increase in earnings and revenues. GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were $1,429 million or $2.33 per share compared with $1,329 million or $2.15 per share in the year-earlier quarter. The year-over-year improvement in earnings was largely due to higher sales.The reported earnings for the stock comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.21. Net sales were record high for the third quarter at $8,172 million, up from $7,709 million in the year-ago quarter and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,908 million.Foreign currency translation impact increased sales by 0.6% while organic local-currency sales improved 6.6%. 3M carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of $1.75 a share in the third quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 by 0.6%. Notably, adjusted earnings increased 4.8% on a year-over-year basis.Third-quarter revenues for this Zacks Rank #2 stock inched up 3.2% year over year to $10,121 million and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10,056 million with solid performance in all segments except Performance Materials and Technologies.Leucadia National Corporation  reported relatively healthy third-quarter results with net income of $99.4 million or 27 cents per share compared with $154.4 million or 41 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease in earnings was due to unrealized pre-tax mark-to-market gain of $91.8 million in the third quarter of 2016.However, earnings comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 17 cents. Total revenues for the reported quarter increased to $2,896.5 million from $2,676.4 million in the prior-year period due to solid organic growth. Revenues for this Zacks Rank #2 stock also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,655 million.GuidanceBuoyed by strong quarterly results and favorable growth dynamics, 3M raised its earlier guidance for 2017. The company anticipates 2017 GAAP earnings in the range of $9.00 to $9.10 per share, up from prior projection of $8.80-$9.05. This represents year-over-year growth of 10-12%, up from 8-11% expected earlier. Organic local-currency sales are expected to be 4-5%, up from 3-5% expected earlier.Incorporating its improved expectations for organic sales in Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies segments, Honeywell raised its 2017 sales guidance to a range of $40.2 billion to $40.4 billion (up 3-4% organic and up 2-3% on a reported basis). The company also reaffirmed its full-year earnings guidance of $7.05 to $7.10 per share, up 9-10% year over year.Leucadia did not offer any guidance for 2017.Price PerformanceFrom earnings release to date, 3M has outperformed the industry with an average loss of 2% compared with 2.1% decline for the latter. Honeywell has also outperformed the industry since third-quarter earnings release with an average return of 1.2% as against a decline of 3.4% for the latter. Leucadia has outperformed the industry post its earnings release, with an average gain of 0.5% as against a loss of 0.7% for the latter.Estimate RevisionsOver the last month, 3M’s current-quarter estimates remained stable at $2.01 per share while that for the current year increased from $8.64 to $8.91.Honeywell’s current-quarter estimates decreased a penny to $1.85 during the last month while current-year estimates increased a penny to $7.10 per share. Leucadia’s current-quarter estimates decreased a penny to 27 cents during the last month while current-year estimates increased to $1.39 per share from $1.31. With positive estimate revisions, investor sentiments clearly appear to be bullish on 3M compared to Honeywell and Leucadia.To Sum UpBased on the current scenario, although there is not much difference among the industry peers, 3M seems to have trumped Honeywell and Leucadia on most fronts and stands out as a better investment proposition.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

783,MMM,"Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of 99 cents per share in second-quarter 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents by 2.1%. Moreover, adjusted earnings rose 10.0% on a year-over-year basis.The bottom line also steered past the company’s guided range of $0.95–$0.98.The upside in the company’s bottom line can be attributed to its effective Danaher Business System (“DBS”), which provides a set of philosophies, processes and toolsets to drive improvement. Moreover, a decent top-line performance supplemented earnings rise.Revenues by SegmentDanaher reported total sales of $4,510.1 million, reflecting an increase of 6.3% year over year. In addition, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,496 million.Improvement in second-quarter revenues was due to positive contributions from both non-core and core businesses. While acquired businesses contributed 6.0% to overall growth, core businesses contributed 2.0%, both on a year-over-year basis. The company’s recent large acquisitions, Pall and Cepheid, contributed significantly toward the top-line increase.Life Sciences segment revenues rose 4% year over year to $1,384 million. Operating margin for the quarter expanded 150 basis points (bps) to 16%. Sales growth of this segment was driven by robust market traction of mass spectrometers, microscopy, flow cytometry and genomics products. Impressive rise in the operating margin was driven by higher sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with restructuring actions.Revenues at the Diagnostics segment increased 14.5% year over year to $1,440 million. Impressive performance of clinical business in China and robust performance of acute care diagnostic and pathology diagnostics business proved conducive to growth of this segment. However, operating margin at the segment contracted 760 bps year over year, to 10.9%. The fall is attributable to higher costs associated with new product development and higher restructuring and impairment charges.Revenues at Dental came in at $703 million, falling 1.5% on a year-over-year basis. Operating margin rose 30 bps to 15.6%. Lower demand for dental consumable product lines in North America and Western Europe proved to be a drag on the top line of this segment. Also, price decreases impacted this segment negatively. Rise in operating margin is attributable to incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions.At the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, revenues were up 4.5% year over year to $983 million. Solid performance across all the business lines, namely, water quality, analytical instrumentation, chemical treatment solution and ultraviolet water disinfection in end markets drove growth for this segment. Operating margin rose 70 bps to 23.9%. Cost savings associated with restructuring actions benefitted operating margin.On a year-over-year basis, operating profit margin contracted 150 bps to 15.2%. Gross margins were down 110 bps to 55.0%. Both operating and gross margin decline is attributable to restructuring and impairment charges, which completely offset benefits of higher sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings.Danaher Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Danaher Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Danaher Corporation QuoteLiquidityDanaher exited the second quarter of 2017 with free cash flow of $891.9 million compared with the year-ago figure of $835.7 million.GuidanceConcurrent with the earnings release, Danaher provided its guidance for third-quarter 2017. The company projects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.92–$0.96.Furthermore, Danaher raised its full-year 2017 adjusted earnings guidance. It now expects adjusted net earnings per share to lie in the range of $3.90–$3.97 compared with the earlier guided range of $3.85–$3.95. Overall, the company reported impressive key metrics largely driven by its effective business model, the DBS. The model focuses on three critical areas – quality, delivery, and cost & innovation.Our TakeDanaher continued its impressive growth momentum, with both top- and bottom-line beats during the second quarter. DBS continues to be its biggest strength. The company’s tried and tested business model has proved to be the fundamental growth driver, fueling revenue, margins, cash flow and earnings improvement.  Furthermore, two most recent large acquisitions – Pall and Cepheid – are proving to be major profit churners.Danaher remains confident about the uptick of its order, which will eventually accelerate its core revenue growth. Furthermore, positive industry trends like new regulations from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration are expected to act as tailwinds. The upward guidance revision, which is likely to go down well with investors, signals bright days ahead for the Zacks Rank #3 (hold) company.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are Crane Co. (CR  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and ITT Inc. (ITT  -  Free Report). Each stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

784,MMM,"Industrial goods manufacturer General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 21. In the last reported quarter, the company’s operating earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, General Electric reported an average positive earnings surprise of 9.4%, beating estimates thrice and matching them once. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors in the QuarterWith a reshuffle in its top management, General Electric is aiming to focus on its core industrial operations after completing the GE Capital exit plan. John Flannery, the current President and CEO of GE Healthcare would take the helm as the CEO from Aug 01, 2017, and Chairman and CEO effective Jan 01, 2018, replacing Jeff Immelt. Flannery has led complex financial and industrial businesses of General Electric across the world and is likely to capitalize on his rich experience to fuel its growth engine. Although the change in top management is yet to be materialized, it is likely to create a buzz in the market and attract favorable deals for the company, thereby improving its long-term growth.   At the same time, the company is selectively acquiring assets to boost its Industrial Internet vision and improve the top line. General Electric is also focusing on the commercialization of the Predix software through periodic updates and new capabilities to augment its revenues. Predix is designed to add intelligence to the Internet of Things applications. It helps companies to connect their machines, data and people and run industrial-scale analytics. The combination of machine connectivity with a data lifecycle management platform powered by engineering simulation helps diverse firms design their products for the Industrial Internet in the best way possible. Consequently, it is likely to generate incremental revenues for the company.Further, the merger of General Electric’s Oil & Gas business with Baker Hughes Incorporated is likely to improve segment sales with a complementary portfolio of operating assets and integrated offerings. While General Electric possess unique capabilities in fullstream oil and gas manufacturing and technology solutions spanning across subsea & drilling, rotating equipment, imaging and sensing, Baker Hughes has proven expertise in drilling & evaluation and completion & production services. However, Baker Hughes has a significantly lower operating margin than General Electric, which can act as a big deterrent to its plans to improve overall operating earnings.  Despite prudent steps to limit its financial exposure by divesting GE Capital assets, General Electric is still susceptible to various market risks. The company’s objectives of simplification and productivity improvement pose operational execution risks as well. For a company as large as General Electric, the additional revenues needed for growth are quite large, posing a challenge to developing businesses on such a vast scale.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that General Electric is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00% as both are currently pegged at 25 cents.

788,MMM,"Danaher Corp. (DHR  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 earnings results before the opening bell on Jul 20.The company hasn't missed estimates in the trailing sixteen quarters, which is an impressive feat.  Last quarter, it posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.2%. The stock boasts an average positive surprise of 5.7% over the past four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIn the past few quarters, Danaher has faced stunted revenue growth in its dental segment, mainly attributable to weakness in higher-margin traditional consumables business. We believe the weakness will continue to mar the second-quarter results as well. Moreover, unfavourable product mix and incremental costs associated with various new product developments, particularly in the dental segment, are expected to hurt the margin performance for the soon-to-be-reported quarter.This apart, sluggishness in some of Danaher’s key end markets, including Latin America and some European regions, are likely to impact growth. A significant portion of its revenues is derived from regions outside the U.S., which makes it vulnerable to currency fluctuations. Over the past few quarters, Danaher has been suffering from strengthening of both the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus other currencies.Also, the company has been witnessing relatively smaller organic growth over the past few quarters. We believe Danaher's Life Science portfolio lacks a significant upstream product offering, which has been restricting growth. A decelerating organic growth is likely to affect the company’s overall top-line performance for the second quarter.Despite these negatives, Danaher’s acquired businesses, namely Pall and Cepheid, are expected to act as key growth drivers for the quarter to be reported. Also, the company’s robust operating culture, DBS, is likely to act as a catalyst.

789,MMM,"We’ve already got a busy day of Q3 earnings reports to sift through, and market participants should take heart that, by and large, most major companies reporting before the opening bell have outperformed expectations — in some cases by a wide margin. After today’s market close, we expect another wave of Q3 reports from companies such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report). But let’s dig in with the breakfast portion of earnings results:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) is up 7% in pre-market trading following its blowout results in Q3 earnings and revenues. Its bottom line of $1.77 per share amounts to a 45% positive earnings surprise over the $1.22 in the Zacks consensus, and miles ahead of the 85 cents per share in CAT’s fiscal Q3 2016. Sales reached $11.4 billion, far surpassing the $10.6 billion expected and $9.2 billion a year ago. Construction growth in China and on-shore oil & gas businesses in North America drove quarterly growth most notably.Remarkably, CAT’s 45% earnings surprise is roughly in-line with the heavy machinery manufacturer’s trailing four quarters of earnings beats, bolstered by a Q1 2017 surprise of more than 100%. Caterpillar has also upped full-year guidance to around $6.25 per share; $5.26 was the previous Zacks consensus estimate. CAT also carries a Zacks Style Score of A.General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) also outperformed expectations this morning: its $1.32 per share easily outperformed the $1.07 expected — though results are still down more than 20% year over year — on quarterly sales of $33.62 billion — well beyond the $31.6 billion we had been looking for. GM looks to bring two electric cars to market in the next year and a half. It also has posted a positive earnings surprise for at least the past five straight quarters, with a trailing 4-quarter average of 14.7%. Shares of GM are up 3% at this point in today’s pre-market.Defense and aerospace major United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) topped expectations on earnings, revenues and guidance. This is the third straight earnings beat for the parent company of Pratt & Whitney, Otis Elevators, and many other companies: $1.73 per share beat the Zacks consensus by 5 cents, whereas the top-line actual of $15.1 billion outperformed the $14.9 billion we had been looking for. Full-year guidance was also raised from $6.45 - 6.60 per share to $6.58 - 6.63.Industrial supply giant 3M (MMM  -  Free Report) also beat top and bottom-line estimates prior to Tuesday’s open, with earnings of $2.33 per share and revenues of $8.17 billion surprising the $2.21 per share and $7.91 billion expected. Full-year guidance was also ratcheted up notably, from the previous Zacks consensus estimate of $8.95 per share to $9.00 - 9.15 as of its Q3 report. Shares of 3M are up 1.6% thus far in today’s pre-market.McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) posted a mixed Q3 earnings report this morning, beating earnings estimates by a penny to $1.76 per share on $5.76 billion, which was a bit shy of the $5.80 billion expected. The Zacks ESP called this one-cent beat exactly, even as the negative impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit same-store sales in Texas and Florida from Q3 2016. In fact, U.S. comps were up 4.1% in the quarter, and International was up 6%. Shares are currently up 1.3% in early trading.Other companies this morning to have surpassed expectations and also raised full-year guidance are Stanley Black & Decker (SWK  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Polaris (PII  -  Free Report).

As far as Alphabet is concerned, investors will be looking for signs that anti-trust cases like the one that resulted in the GOOGL settlement with the EU was a simple anomaly or a sign of things to come for the search giant.McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) kept its impressive streak of positive earnings surprises alive with an 11-cent beat to $1.73 per share, on quarterly sales of nearly $6.05 billion, higher than the $6 billion expected.

792,MMM,"GE Healthcare, an operating unit of General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report), has entered into a partnership with Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report), to create a new digital platform aimed at providing improved healthcare services.GE Healthcare and Roche are two big names in the healthcare industry. Roche is the world’s leading biopharmaceutical and in-vitro diagnostics company. It has also made a name for itself for research in the field of medical science, and cancer research and treatments.The strategic partnership is aimed at developing software that will facilitate diagnosis in a speedier and more accurate manner.  The primary focus will be on providing personalized treatment to cancer and critical care patients. Improved products for treating such individual cases will be developed initially. Thereafter, using advanced analytics, in-vivo data provided by GE’s equipment and in-vitro data provided by Roche, will be integrated.With the help of advanced technology, data about individual patients will be collated from various sources like vivo diagnostics, lifestyle sensors, labs, electronic records, clinical trial data, genomic data, physicians and also from patients themselves. The data will include a complete history of the patient’s medical records and treatments undergone along with the latest research and practices in medical science.

Meanwhile, President Trump nominated Jerome Powell for the post of Fed Chief which led to broad based gains for the markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 23,516.26, gaining 0.4%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.1% to close at 2,579.85. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,714.94, decreasing 0.1%.

On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by a 1.29-to-1 ratio. The CBOE VIX decreased 4.1% to close at 9.78.House Passes the Tax BillRepublicans of the House finally unveiled a detailed tax cut policy under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which seeks to reduce corporate and revoke the taxes paid by large businesses. The Bill has not been formally signed into law but a detailed framework has been laid out.The tax bill reduces the corporate tax rate to 20%, making it the permanent rate. The Joint Committee on Taxation stated that this is by far the most exorbitant facet of the tax reform policy, amounting to a whopping $1.46 trillion over the next decade.Subsequently, tax rate on pass-through businesses would be reduced to 25%. Furthermore, the individual tax rate would apply to other income, with the top rate being 39.6%. Effectively, this means that businesses such as ‘personal-service’ companies would hardly benefit from such rates.Moreover, the framework also stated that repatriated cash would be taxed at 12% and repatriated profits at 5%. Finally, the deduction on domestic production stands abolished and this would help accumulate over $100 billion in as many as 10 years. Such a detailed framework offered a sense of assurance to the investors following which the markets gained traction.Trump Nominates Powell as New Fed ChiefIn a much anticipated move on Thursday, President Trump appointed member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Jerome Powell to be Yellen’s successor post the expiration of her term as the Fed Chief in February. Investors view him to be someone who would be fairly judicious in his approach toward monetary policies.

801,MMM,"Diversified electronics manufacturer Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 26. In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings comfortably exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. Amphenol surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 5.6%. Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Key Factors in the QuarterAmphenol’s top-line growth is expected to benefit from improved end-market demand, new product rollouts and market share gains. Demand continues to be strong in automotive industrial, mobile networks and military markets. The diversification in end markets with a consistent focus on technology innovation and customer support through all phases of the economic cycle is likely to help the company achieve solid top-line growth.Amphenol remains encouraged by its expanding presence in the fast-growing commercial aerospace market and is well positioned to capitalize on the proliferation of electronics content on next-generation planes. These advanced electronic systems require new higher technology interconnect solutions to enhance fuel efficiency and improve passenger experience, all of which create excellent opportunities for Amphenol.In order to fuel further growth, Amphenol aims to make acquisitions on a global basis in the high-growth segments that have complementary capabilities from a product, customer and/or geographic standpoint. Amphenol also expects to leverage on the solid growth potential of the acquired companies to drive robust performance. A balanced organic and inorganic growth model, a lean and flexible cost structure, and an agile and entrepreneurial management team augur well for the company. For the to-be-reported quarter, Amphenol expects adjusted earnings of 70–72 cents per share on revenues of $1.580–$1.620 billion. We expect the company to record year-over-year growth of 10.3% and 3.6% in earnings and revenues, respectively, in the second quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Amphenol is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

802,MMM,"The earnings season is in full swing with about 183 S&P 500 companies reporting this week. About 97 S&P 500 companies have already released their results till Jul 21, reconfirming broad-based expectations of better-than expected earnings. Total earnings for these 97 companies (accounting for 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization) are up 8.4% year over year on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% beating earnings estimates and 72.2% surpassing top-line expectations. Based on the hitherto observed pattern, the second quarter is anticipated to register high single-digit percentage earnings growth on a year-over-year basis.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall second-quarter earnings for all the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up 8.6% on 4.7% growth in revenues. Although it represents a slightly tempered growth projection compared with the double-digit growth rate of the first quarter, the dollar amount of the total earnings is likely to be on par or even better than the all-time high achieved in fourth-quarter 2016. The relative improvement in the quarterly performance is largely due to a turnaround in the economy, better job market scenario and rising oil prices. Experts widely believe that earnings growth is likely to be in double digits in 2018 and beyond.For the second quarter as a whole, about five of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to witness an earnings decline, with Autos, Conglomerates and Utilities being the biggest drag.The Conglomerates sector appears to be a major decliner. For the sector, earnings are expected to decline 19.2% year over year while sales are touted to fall 6.1% due to a likely disappointing performance by some of the leading players in the industry.Let’s have a sneak peek at three major Conglomerates scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings tomorrow to see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results before the opening bell. 3M expects to deliver sustainable increase in earnings and free cash flow, driven by benefits from long-term strategy of investment in high-growth programs.

804,MMM,"Leading business service provider Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results after the closing bell on Jul 20. In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $1.09 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08, is +0.93%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Cintas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cintas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cintas Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: Cintas currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. This combined with a positive ESP increases the predictive power of ESP and makes an earnings prediction likely.  Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Key Factors in the QuarterWith continued focus on core businesses, Cintas recorded industry leading revenue growth over the past few quarters. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is commendable.Cintas has completed the acquisition of rival, G&K Services Inc. With annual revenues of approximately $1.0 billion, G&K Services has over 170,000 customers in the U.S. and Canada. The successful integration of G&K Services is likely to expand Cintas’ customer profile and augment its revenues. The combined company is likely to cater to over one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity.Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings and the transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas’ earnings in the full year of its operation. Although the transaction is not likely to have any direct impact on the impending quarterly results, it is likely to attract favorable contracts from existing as well as new customers and improve the top line.Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry.In order to enhance shareholder value, Cintas has modified its share repurchase program. Under the new share repurchase program, the company doubled its share authorization tally to enable the repurchase of an additional $500 million worth of stock over a period of time. The additional shares over its existing $500 million share repurchase authorization could be repurchased through a slew of open market transactions. All these factors bode well for the financial stability and expansion plans of the company.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:United Technologies Inc.
