10,AJG,"Most -- but not all -- low-volatility ETFs focus on U.S. large-cap stocks. An exchange traded fund with steadily growing appeal targets midcaps with the steadiest price action.Investors piled into these low-volatility investing strategies -- including a small-cap one -- in a remarkably choppy first quarter. Low-volatility stocks tend to be more stable and mature businesses. These companies have the deep financial pockets to better weather market downturns. They tend to provide better risk-adjusted returns over the long term.PowerShares S&P MidCap Low Volatility (XMLV), an ETF showing market leadership, hit a new 52-week high of 36.27 Tuesday.XMLV invests in roughly 80 of the least volatile midcap stocks in the S&P MidCap 400 Index. Stocks with the lowest price volatility get the highest portfolio weighting, according to industry monitor ETF.com.The portfolio includes IBD 50 stock Sovran Self Storage (SSS), a real estate investment trust that owns and operates self-storage facilities in 25 Eastern and Midwest states. Sovran has grown revenues an average 17% over the past three years. An attractive income stock, it yields 3%.Other stock holdings include RenaissanceRe Holdings (RNR), Aspen Insurance (AHL) and Arthur J. Gallagher (AJG). Almost half the portfolio assets are in financial services and real estate -- sectors that are sensitive to shifts in interest rates.XMLV surged 7.2% in the month ended March 21 as it continued to rally off its Feb. 11 interim low. It has gained 6.4% year to date.By comparison, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) has advanced 5.3% in the past month and 4% so far in 2016.PowerShares S&P SmallCap Low Volatility (XSLV) is up 5.5% and 2.4% over the same periods.The midcap ETF's superior price performance vs. both its large-cap and small-cap siblings reflets its proprietary IBD ratings. It earns a solid Relative Strength Rating of 83. That means it has outperformed 83% of all stocks and ETFs in the IBD database over the past 12 months.A strong Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A- shows that XMLV has been winning over large institutional investors. That compares with a relatively weak C rating for SPLV and B+ for XSLV.XMLV holds $294.3 million in assets and has an 0.25% expense ratio.The ETF broke out of a 14-week cup-shaped base March 8 and has advanced 2% from its 35.45 buy point in 11 days. Not every stock breakout is successful, but some can and do lead to powerful gains in short order.XMLV's 50-day moving average is sloping upwards, a bullish technical sign. In another sign of strength, the 50-day line appears poised to cross over the longer-term 200-day moving average.However, low-volatility ETFs generally haven't been tested by major market slumps. Even the oldest funds launched right around the time of the European sovereign debt crisis in 2011. They may also lag their peers during strong bull markets.XMLV nosed up a fraction on the stock market today.

17,AJG,"AXA Group has inked an acquisition deal to buy XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) for $15.3 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to conclude in the second half of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and an approval pending from XL Group’s shareholders.The purchase is likely to help AXA Group emerge a leader in the bracket of global Property and Casualty Commercial lines insurers based on gross written premiums.Following this announcement, shares of XL Group have surged 31.06% in the pre-market trading session.The Purchase ConsiderationValued at $15.3 billion or €12.4 billion, the deal translates into a 33% premium to XL Group’s closing price of $43.30 on Mar 2. Therefore, shareholders of the company to be acquired will now be entitled to receive $57.60 per share.Financing the DealAXA Group will utilize €3.5 billion cash in hand, €6 billion from the planned initial public offering in the United States and €3 billion subordinated debt. The acquirer already has €9 billion of backup bridge financing in place.Acquisition RationaleFrench insurer AXA Group is primarily focused on Life and Saving insurance business. This acquisition is in sync with its strategy to intensify focus on Property and Casualty insurance business. The company has also filed for an initial public offering in the United States for its US business and is already a leading life insurance and annuity company in the region.With $15 billion of gross written premiums in 2017, XL Group scores as a premier provider in P&C Commercial and Tier 1 specialty lines with its solid presence across North America, Europe, Lloyd’s platform as well as the Asia-Pacific zone.Shares of XL Group have rallied 23.2%, outperforming the industry’s nearly 1% gain year to date. While AXA Group’s reinsurance business provides key access to its diversification and alternative capital, it has robust links to the large and mid-market segments. Thus XL Group’s integration into the acquirer’s portfolio is a strategic fit for the company.Additionally, XL Group is anticipated to leverage AXA Group to build scale, widen its geographic exposure as well as expand its product portfolio.AXA Group estimates pre-tax annual savings of about $0.4 billion consisting of $0.2 billion from cost synergies, $0.1 billion from revenue synergies and $0.1 billion through reinsurance net of additional reinsurance bought to align with AXA Group’s risk appetite.The buyout is cash accretive with more than 80% remittance ratio drawn from XL Group and the same will possibly dilute the impact for IPO in 2018 itself. Also, once complete, the acquisition is expected to lower sensitivities to financial markets, reduce beta and cost of equity, enhance cash remittance potential and accelerate the company’s growth profile. Return on investment is estimated to be 10%.AXA Group reaffirmed its Ambition 2020 target to grow earnings by 3-7%.Zacks RankXL Group carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

21,AJG,"Strong sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of potential winners in the stock market. The companies that put emphasis on sales management have a competitive advantage, as strong sales are generally converted into growth.Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings while assessing the growth of a business. This is because investors want to make sure whether a business has the capability to generate more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base.Stable or declining sales growth reflects obstacles at the company and offers limited scope for sustained growth. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Without solid top-line growth, bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable over the longer term. While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses, a sustainable bottom-line recovery usually requires robust sales growth.However, sales growth in isolation doesn’t indicate much about a company’s future performance. Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power, a huge sales number is not necessarily translated into profits.Therefore, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Most importantly, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

23,AJG,"Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (AJG  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 25 after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.85%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterArthur J. Gallagher is likely to witness a noticeable rise in expenses, primarily due to higher compensation and operating expenses. This increase in expenses can restrict operating margin expansion, thereby hurting the company’s overall performance.Also, with the insurance broker’s slew of strategic buyouts, the company has incurred one cent per share as integration costs in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Nonetheless, Arthur J. Gallagher is likely to report bottom-line growth in the fourth quarter, mainly owing to a strong performance by its Brokerage and Risk Management businesses as well as higher revenues. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 earnings is pegged at 75 cents per share, representing a rally of 13.6% from the prior-year quarter.Additionally, the company anticipates improved organic growth at its Brokerage segment in the period. To top it all, the company expects an impact from forex with a tailwind of about $10 million to its brokerage segment revenues in the fourth quarter.Employee benefit consulting operations are estimated to have registered organic growth on new business opportunities.Top-line growth has likely been fueled by organic sales as well as strategic mergers and acquisitions. To that end, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter of 2017 is $1.5 billion, representing an increase of 7.1% from the prior-year quarter.    Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Arthur J. Gallagher is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Arthur J. Gallagher has an Earnings ESP of -1.01%.

Price and EPS Surprise | Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Quote Zacks Rank: Arthur J. Gallagher holds a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around are as follows:The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Jan 24.

30,AJG,"The third-quarter earnings season is gaining pace with 87 members of the elite S&P 500 index having already reported quarterly numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, the performance of these index members (accounting for 24.7% of the index’s total market capitalization) indicate that total earnings have increased 9.4% on 7.3% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 71.3% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 70.1%, outperforming on the top-line front.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. About 50.7% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index that have reported results so far shows 7.8% earnings growth on 3.3% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 71.4% for the bottom line compared favorably with that of the S&P 500. However, the beat ratio of 50% for the top line is lower than the same of the S&P 500.  Insurance industry, an integral part of the Finance sector, will witness soft results this yet-to-be-reported quarter. A soft performance from the insurance industry will drag the Finance sector’s third-quarter results. Per our Earnings Preview, earnings of the Finance sector will decline 1.5% though revenues will increase 1.1%.The third quarter witnessed a slew of catastrophes, which will weigh on underwriting profitability as well as the bottom line of insurers. Per the catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide, the insured loss estimates from Irma could range between $25 billion and $35 billion and between $40 billion and $85 billion from Maria. Moody’s Analytics earlier estimated economic losses from Irma to come in the $58-$83 billion band while that from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion. Mexican tremors have all the more added to the woes.Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in underwriting results, we expect prudent underwriting practices and capital reserve piled up on a benign catastrophe environment to withstand the loss to some extent.We do not expect pricings to have been strong in the third quarter.However, net investment income, an important component of an insurer’s top line, is likely to witness improvement courtesy three rate hikes approved since December 2016. Though rate environment is improving at a very slower pace, the impact of rate increase is clearly visible in the insurer’s investment results. The third quarter will also not be an exception.Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers, which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to continuous low rates. Annuity sales should have also benefited from higher rates. However, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.With more than 700 companies (180 S&P 500 members) set to report results this week, let’s find out where the following insurers stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Oct 25.Chubb Limited’s (CB  -  Free Report) third-quarter underwriting results will be affected by a string of cat events. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for combined ratio is currently pegged at 101%, a deterioration of 980 basis points from the year-ago quarter.Premiums earned likely have reduced the company’s inability to generate enough underwriting returns. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net premiums earned is currently pegged at $7.2 billion, reflecting a decline of 2.8% on a year-over year basis.However, higher net investment income and continued share buybacks have likely cushioned the company’s bottom line. The company expects its quarterly investment income run rate to range between $830 million and $840 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss is 26 cents per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter, reflecting a 108.9% year-over-year slump. Chubb currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP. Further combined with an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, makes surprise prediction difficult.

The company estimates between $102 million and $114 million in cat losses in the third quarter, thereby deteriorating the combined ratio by 860-960 basis points.However, higher premiums earned and investment income likely have driven the top-line growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2017 is $1.4 billion that represents an increase of 3.5% from the prior-year quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 53 cents for the yet-to-be-reported quarter, down 38.4% year over year.  Cincinnati Financial also currently has a bearish Zacks Rank of 4 along with an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

31,AJG,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc (HIG  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the U.S. group life and disability business of Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) for a cash consideration of $1.45 billion. The transaction is expected to culminate in November 2017.This buyout aims to expand Hartford Financial’s Group Benefits distribution capabilities and ramp up its technology strategy.Transaction DetailsThe purchase consideration of $1.45 billion comprises a ceding commission which will be paid by Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Company, the primary Group Benefits insurance operating subsidiary of Hartford Financial.The transaction also includes an exclusive, multi-year collaboration deal per which Aetna will be offering Hartford Financial’s group life and disability products through its medical sales team.Aetna’s book of group life and disability insurance, which had premiums of approximately $2 billion in 2016 will be reinsured by Hartford  Financial on an indemnity basis. Post takeover, most of the Aetna Group Insurance employees across the country will be transferred to Hartford Financial.    Financing the TransactionHartford Financial intends to finance the cash consideration by deploying dividends from its insurance affiliates and holding company resources, including $273 million under its 2017 share repurchase plan. The company does not expect any share repurchase authorization in 2018.Hartford Financial does not expect to issue any debt or equity for financing the buyout.Rationale of the TransactionThis transaction will help Hartford Financial to emerge as the second-largest group life and disability insurer. Group life and disability, banking on its stable risk profile, lucrative returns and strong long-term growth prospects, is a significant business for Hartford Financial.Joining forces with Aetna will strengthen Hartford Financial’s foothold as a leader in the large employer market and expand its presence among midsize employer clients. Moreover, Hartford Financial will be able to grab new opportunities to distribute complementary products to a customer base of more than 20 million to be insured by the combined business.This transaction will also be beneficial to both entities’ shareholders and customers, and help them focus in a personalized manner to improve member health. The transaction will be accretive to Hartford Financial’s 2018 earnings per share.With this acquisition, the acquirer will be able to leverage the industry-leading digital assets and an integrated absence management platform to improve customer experience.Aetna, on the other hand, intends to utilize the sale proceeds for various purposes, including but not restricted to internal investments, share repurchases and debt repayment. Though the transaction will not affect its 2017 bottom line, it will be slightly dilutive to the 2018 bottom line.Hartford Financial continues to utilize data and advanced analytics across workers’ compensation and disability to drive better results for clients across group life and disability lines. As the nation’s second-largest workers’ compensation insurer and group disability insurer, this buyout improves Hartford Financial’s competitive position in the market and enhances its capabilities for future product offerings in the line of absence management.A.M. Best Jumps Into ActionFollowing the announcement of the acquisition, A.M. Best commented that the credit ratings of Hartford Financial and its affiliates remain unchanged.The rating agency expects the financial leverage and coverage measures at the holding company to remain within levels that support the current ratings. Further, it expects the risk-adjusted capitalization of the entities to remain at adequate levels.Insurers Opting the Inorganic RouteMergers and acquisitions not only add capabilities to a portfolio but also expand geographical footprint of companies, thereby expanding their growth profile. Hence, acquisitions rage the insurance space. Earlier this month, White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd.

32,AJG,"Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (AJG  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.98%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterArthur J. Gallagher is likely to witness a noticeable rise in expenses, primarily due to higher compensation and operating expenses. The increase in expenses can restrict operating margin expansion, thereby hurting the company’s overall performance.Also, with the insurance broker’s string of strategic buyouts, the company has incurred 1 cent per share in integration costs in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Nonetheless, Arthur J. Gallagher is likely to report bottom-line growth in the third quarter, mainly owing to a strong performance by its Brokerage and Risk Management businesses as well as higher revenues. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2017 is 78 cents that represents an increase of 1.9% from the prior-year quarter.The company expects adjusted margin at Brokerage segment to be in line with year-ago figure.Employee benefit consulting operations are likely to have registered organic growth owing to new business opportunities.Top-line growth likely has been fueled by organic sales as well as strategic mergers and acquisitions. To that end, the Zacks Consensus Estimate with respect to revenues for the third quarter of 2017 is $1.6 billion that represents an increase of 5.1% from the prior-year quarter.    Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Arthur J. Gallagher is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

63,AJG,"The first-quarter earnings season is in full swing with already 267 members of the elite S&P 500 index having reported financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances of these index participants indicate a 25.1% increase in total earnings on 10% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 76.8% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and a 73.8%, outperforming on the top-line front, bearing testament to a solid start.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. Per Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to rise 26.4% on 5.7% more revenues.Integral to the Finance sector, the insurance industry is likely to witness better results this yet-to-be-reported quarter on the back of an improving rate environment, tax cuts, a favorable operating environment and a better domestic growth scenario.A progressing interest rate environment is likely to have driven higher net investment income, an important component of an insurer’s top line. Though the same is far from hitting a historical high, it nevertheless shows an upward trend. Notably, the Fed has hiked interest rate five times since December 2015 on the back of a thriving economy and has hinted at two more raises this year, followed by three in 2019 and a couple of in 2020.Although insurers have lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines to withstand the low rate environment, they look to benefit from the increasing rates as investment yield improves.The first quarter is likely to benefit from the tax cut.  Per the enforcement of the new tax rate effective January 2018, the tax incidence has been reduced to 21% from 35%. This rate slash will possibly lend an extra boost to insurers’ bottom line.Although the to-be-reported quarter encountered a California mudslide as well as the northeast winter storms, the disasters might still leave the company’s underwriting profitability unhurt. Insurers having already suffered the perils of cat loss last year, should have managed to endure the shortfalls in first-quarter 2018. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates global insured cat loss between $5 billion and $10 billion. Underwriting profitability is also slightly pressed.Nonetheless, improved pricing, prudent underwriting practices, portfolio repositioning as well as resorting to reinsurance covers are likely to have cushioned insurers to survive the deficits.A wide-ranged product portfolio, expanded global footprint and tactical M&A activity might have aided insurers’ performance in the quarter to be reported.About 900 companies (142 S&P 500 members) will report quarterly results this week. Let’s take a look at how things pan out for the following insurers ahead of their quarterly releases on May 1.Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.’s (AJG  -  Free Report) top line is expected to have gained traction from organic sales as well as strategic mergers and acquisitions. Brokerage segment will be benefitted from a favorable forex impact while Employee benefit consulting operations are estimated to have registered organic growth from new business opportunities. Lower tax rate is likely to boost the companies’ bottom line and margin growth directly. However, a projected rise in expenses will likely limit the operating margin expansion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects a substantial 277.5% year-over-year increase. Arthur J. Gallagher carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes our surprise prediction difficult as the company requires a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. (Read more: Arthur J.

Nevertheless, net premium has been declining at Encompass for the past two years. Decline in premium and policies in force in states with inadequate returns have impacted the overall top-line trends, to some extent.             The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.48 for the soon-to-be-reported quarter, up 51.2% year over year. Allstate’s favorable Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of +3.55% make us confident of an earnings surprise in the first quarter.

Riding on prudent underwriting, solid persistency and favorable benefit ratio trends, margins are anticipated to have strengthened in core business segments. However, volatility in Unum U.K. seems to have persisted due to the  Brexit buzz, which probably induced an unreliable business environment. Although persistency is likely to have remained soft, an increase in force is but expected to have driven premiums.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25 per share for the last completed quarter translates into a 22.5% year-over-year rise. Unum carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. Nonetheless, its combination with an Earnings ESP of -0.14% leaves our surprise prediction inconclusive.

66,AJG,"As the year 2018 set in, the insurance industry started to witness the wheel of fortune turning in its favor with the rising interest rates, improving economy, lower-than-expected catastrophe loss (as compared to 2017, which emerged as the costliest year in terms of cat loss) as well as a noteworthy tax reform effective Jan 1, 2018. Hence, the industry is anticipated to deliver better-than-expected results and continue the momentum in the near term as well.Even though the insurers will be faced with challenges to counter in 2018, their primary focus remains on achieving two important objectives — top-line sales growth while bolstering bottom-line profitability.Some of the concerns such as weather-related events and political turmoil are beyond the insurers’ control. Despite these trials, we expect some insurers to generate desirable results and keep the optimism alive among investors on the stock.Here, we will talk about a few driving factors that might help insurers perform well in the near future, allaying apprehensions among investors.Rising Interest Rates: Is it a Blessing?The gradually improving interest rates have been a boon for insurers, who are major beneficiaries of the rising interest rates. The FOMC meeting on Mar 21, 2018, which also marked Jerome Powell’s first Fed meeting as chairman, further strengthened the insurers’ confidence in the regulatory body’s promise to deliver three rate hikes in 2018. The first hike announced at the meeting has put the current interest rate in the range of 1.50–1.75%. In fact, the Fed indicated that there can be a fourth rate raise this year and three more in 2019 (one more than the previously announced two hikes), hinting at an aggressive path of rate hikes.A progressive rate environment will ultimately benefit the insurance industry with regard to insurers’ investment income (forming a major portion of their revenues), thereby accelerating their overall growth in the future. For instance, life insurance companies will get a relief from the operating pressures, resulting from tight credit spreads that the low-rate environment has exerted for a considerable period of time. Rising interest rates as well as increase in bond yields will provide the required relief to insurers to maintain decent margins.Better Underwriting Performance: An Ambitious Hope?Although the California mudslides and the northeast winter storms are likely to impact first-quarter 2018 results with Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) projecting a total catastrophe loss of $305 million after tax, the insurers are not expecting a huge impact on their underwriting results. Thus, the positivity surrounding a better underwriting performance remains intact, despite such massive inclement weather-oriented losses being incurred.In fact, per a report by Fitch Ratings, the insurance industry is expected to regain substantial underwriting profitability in 2018, albeit at a slower pace, after being badly hit by the unprecedented hurricane activity and earthquakes in 2017. Moreover, combined ratios are likely to improve and might come close to a break-even point.Capital strength displayed by the insurers will assist them to counter near-term volatility and the effects of adverse events.Other High Points for a Winning PerformanceThere are a few other factors poised to boost the insurance industry this year. The unemployment rate is projected at 3.8% in 2018 while the gross domestic product is likely to grow 2.7% (an increase from the earlier estimate of 2.5%). Both represent a bullish economic outlook, further picking pace in the recent months.This apart, a recovering housing market looks set to enhance insurable exposures and premiums written.Moreover, the tax cut, which reduced the tax rate to 21% from 35%, is an attractive option for most corporates including insurers, as it will aid the companies’ bottom-line, boosting margins directly.A strong liquidity profile, attributable to continued capital inflow into the industry, will not only back the insurers to counter near-term volatility and impact of hostile occurrences but will also keep the industry’s growth trend alive.Key PicksDespite a slew of headwinds posing a threat to insurers this year, tailwinds like rising interest rate environment, better underwriting results and steadily thriving economy will probably cushion the following stocks to raise the performance bar and yield profits through an underlying strength and business modification.We have zeroed in on four stocks outperforming despite all odds.

68,AJG,"The U.S. Insurance Industry faced challenges in 2017 that put pressure on the deal-making environment to a large extent. Starting from a tepid economic environment to extremely unpredictable weather conditions, the insurance industry bore the brunt of all. Despite these trials, the industry still managed to complete 350 mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the year per a report by the London-based law, firm Clyde &Co. Even though the above-mentioned deal volume was considerably lower than the previous year, the same is anticipated to rise in 2018.Interestingly, the last couple of years has set the stage for insurers to take an aggressive and positive approach toward the deal-making environment in 2018, mainly driven by an evolving industry and M&A environment.With the gradually stabilizing economy and rising interest rates along with a buoyed investor and consumer confidence, the insurance industry has been putting in conscious efforts to complete a greater number of consolidations this year. This in turn will also help insurers achieve strategic objectives, more so because the M&A route essentially paves the way for attaining growth.Driving Factors for a Positive M&A LandscapeThe recent tax reform, effective Jan 1, 2018, reducing the tax rate to 21% from 35% and thus calling for a $1.5-trillion tax cut, is expected to benefit the insurance industry to a large extent. Besides redesigning taxation to make U.S. insurers more competitive globally, the tax overhaul provides a few changes to make the M&A environment more conducive.Further, technology will provide an impetus to insurers to likely drive M&A growth in 2018. Technology will also help the insurance companies develop new products, enhance client base and loyalty, boost distribution strategies as well as propel efficiencies. Considering the strategic need for technology investments, InsurTech has risen to prominence in the industry. Hence, acquiring technology assets is set to be a tactical driver for deals in 2018, despite the small size of such deals.On the back of continued capital inflow, the insurance industry’s available capital resource remains at an all-time high, which has helped insurers build a strong liquidity profile. A robust capital position will lend enough support to insurers to pursue bigger and important deals in the near term, also keeping the industry’s growth trend alive.Also, with the probability of alternative sources of capital flowing into new areas, beyond the traditional business lines, there will be additional pressure on pricing leading to some businesses available for sale.Additionally, divesting noncore assets for competitive and regulatory concerns, is being considered by many insurers. Through this process, the strategies of such companies will come into focus, resulting in shedding of more business lines this year.A Few Noteworthy Deals So Far This YearThe insurance industry witnessed some high-profile deals being announced and accomplished in the past couple of months. For instance, on Jan 22, 2018, American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) decided to buy reinsurer Validus Holdings, Ltd. (VR) for $5.6 billion in cash. The buyout is anticipated to be immediately accretive to American International Group’s earnings and return on equity (ROE).This apart, a milestone decision was taken by AXA Group on Mar 5, 2018 to acquire 100% of XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) for $15.3 billion and creating the leading global property and casualty (P&C) Commercial lines insurer based on gross written premiums.Another such deal refers to Fidelity National Financial, Inc.’s agreement (FNF  -  Free Report) to acquire Stewart Information Services Corporation (STC) for $1.2 billion in a cash-stock deal on Mar 19, 2018. The transaction is expected to culminate in the first or second quarter of 2019, subject to closing conditions.Stocks in FocusThe insurance industry is pretty certain that the M&A activity will be back in form this year, mostly attributable to the factors discussed above as well the concerns regarding a soft economic climate and fast-changing regulations starting to diminish.We have zeroed in on four outperforming stocks in the thriving insurance industry with a promise to generate better returns despite all odds based on price performance, positive estimate revisions, a favorable Zacks Rank and an impressive Growth Score of A or B.

69,AJG,"The U.S Insurance Industry battled a plethora challenges in the form of a tumultuous 2017 — a year plagued with weather-related events, regulatory upheavals as well as political turmoil. However, the U.S. insurers have entered 2018 with renewed confidence and are anticipating improved performance as the year rolls on.Although there will be challenges to counter in 2018, the insurers remain focused on achieving two important objectives — growing top-line sales while bolstering bottom-line profitability.With a rapidly-changing regulatory climate, unpredictable nature of the occurrence of natural calamities and a volatile operating environment, we expect some of the insurers to face these challenges head on and remain optimistic about the operational performance of such insurance companies in 2018.We will discuss some driving factors that should help insurance companies to perform better this year, raising optimism and allaying apprehensions among investors.Potential Impact of Rising Interest RatesThe insurance industry as a whole has been positively impacted by rising interest rates. With the Fed delivering with its promise of hiking interest rates thrice in 2017, the insurers remain hopeful for the same number of rate increases in 2018 and two more in 2019. The anticipation of the first rate hike in March as indicated by the Federal Reserve in Jan 31 meeting has restored hope. Currently, the interest rate ranges between 1.25% and 1.50%, which is expected to boost the insurance industry’s prospects.If we view the life insurance industry separately, we can identify its connection with interest rates, given the high sensitivity of the players’ business models to interest rates. Consequently, the life insurers will get a relief from the operating pressures resulting from tight credit spreads that the low-rate environment has exerted for a considerable period of time. But the insurers will not see a significant benefit due to the substantial reduction of their interest-sensitive product lines in the low-rate era. Nonetheless, rising interest rates as well as increase in bond yields will provide required relief to insurers to maintain margins.Meanwhile, property and casualty (P&C) insurance industry holds a significant amount of bonds that would decrease in value with interest rates rising steadily going forward. This will lead to capital volatility in the industry.However, the rising rate environment would keep easing the pressure on P&C insurers’ investment income, and thus their earnings. Moreover, a higher rate environment would make the pricing environment more competitive, inducing growth in carriers.Overall, a progressing rate environment will ultimately benefit the insurance industry, with regard to their investment income (which forms a major portion of their revenues), thereby accelerating the insurance companies’ overall growth in the future.Better Underwriting Results – A Possibility?The insurance industry was hit badly by the unprecedented hurricane activity and earthquakes in 2017, which hurt the underwriting performance to a great extent. Per a report by Fitch Ratings, the insurance industry is expected to return to substantial underwriting profitability in 2018 at a slow pace. Moreover, combined ratios are likely to improve and might come close to break-even.The capital strength displayed by the insurers will help them to counter near-term volatility and the effects of adverse events.Other Factors Resulting in Favorable PerformanceThere are a few other factors that are likely to impact the insurance industry positively this year. The unemployment rate is projected to stay below 4% in 2018 and the gross domestic product is expected to grow 2.5% for the same period — both of which are considered good for the economy.This apart, a recovering housing market is anticipated to enhance insurable exposures and premiums written.Further, the recent tax cut, which reduced the tax rate to 21% from 35%, is expected to benefit the insurance industry to a large extent. A lower tax rate would aid the companies’ bottom-line, boosting margins directly. Additionally, the tax cut is anticipated to make U.S. insurers more competitive globally.Key PicksDespite some of the challenges raising concerns for insurers this year, positives like rising interest rate environment, better underwriting results and gradually improving economy will help the following stocks perform well and yield profits through an underlying strength and business modification.We have zeroed in on four stocks that have outperformed despite all odds based on price performance, positive estimate revisions, favorable Zacks Rank and Growth Score of A or B.

72,AJG,"Selecting stocks from the vast investment universe is not an easy task. For this, one has to understand the company fundamentals and try to place them against the present economic background to figure out how it may fare as an investment.One way to cut this task out is to follow broker recommendation. Brokers have more insight into what’s happening in a particular company as they directly communicate with management. Also, they have a deeper understanding of the overall industry.Brokers research on a company’s publicly available financial statements, listen to conference calls and engage in talks directly with top management. At times, they even talk with customers to gauge what they like or dislike about the products and services offered by the company.Therefore, after thorough research, brokers decide to rate that particular company’s stock. Naturally, when an analyst upgrades a stock, one can easily depend on it.But solely depending on analysts’ upgrades is not the right way to build investment portfolio. One should also take into consideration other factors to ensure solid returns.Choosing the Winning StrategyWe have a screening strategy that will help in your search for potential winners:Broker Rating Upgrades (4 weeks) of 1% or more: The screen selects stocks that have witnessed broker rating upgrades of 1% or more over the last four weeks.Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must be trading above $5.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: A large trading volume guarantees that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank equal to #1 or #2: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) have a proven record of success.

73,AJG,"eHealth, Inc. (EHTH  -  Free Report) has announced its preliminary results for the fourth quarter and 2017. The company expects to incur loss for both the time periods. Shares of the company lost about 0.34% at the trading session on Jan 16.eHealth projects net loss between $22.5 million and $23.5 million for the fourth quarter on revenues of $39 million to $40 million. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be negative, in the range of $18.3 million to $19.3 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate loss is pegged at $1.24 on revenues of $37.5 million. Both the bottom and top line translate into a year over year decrease of 57% and 14% respectively. Revenues fell shy of the company’s expectations.For the full year, eHealth tightened the revenue guidance to a range of $172.5 to $173.5 million from $165 to $175 million guided earlier.  Net loss is expected to be in the range of $27 million to $28 million compared with prior guidance of loss of $27.8 million to $28.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be negative, in the range of $14.5 million to $15.5 million. The company earlier projected Adjusted EBITDA to be negative, in the range of $14.1 million to $16.1 millionOn its third-quarter earnings call, the company stated that as the fourth quarter is considered a primary selling season, it expects improvement in Medicare submitted application. The company noted that the submitted applications for all its Medicare products grew 16% year over year in the fourth quarter. For 2017, the same increased 10% year over year, falling shy of the management’s expectation of growth in high-teens, attributable to slower-than-expected roll-out of selected partner relationships relative to plan.The company noted that submitted applications for individual and family plan products declined 23% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017 while for 2017, the same decreased 51% year over year. This downside was attributable to the challenging individual and family market during the Open Enrollment Period of the fourth quarter.Shares of eHealth have outperformed the industry in a year.  While the stock has surged 42.4%, the industry has rallied 17.3%. However, the company has not witnessed any earnings momentum for 2018 estimates. Also, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise only in one of the last three reported quarters.  eHealth is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Mar 1. Our proven model does not conclusively show that the company is likely to beat estimates. This is because a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP, combined with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. Note that we always need a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank to be confident about an earnings surprise.eHealth focuses on shifting business mix toward a higher percentage of long-term value. Its Medicare customers will ensure a better future cash-flow generation and will position the company well for long-term growth.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Brown & Brown Inc.

82,AJG,"AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (AXS  -  Free Report) has raised the offer price for buyout of Novae Group plc through its whole owned subsidiary, AXIS Specialty UK Holdings Limited.The insurer has made a final offer of 715 pence in cash per Novae share, up from 700 pence in cash per share of the same, offered earlier. The final offer price thus comes to $611.6 million (£477.6 million).Earlier on Jul 5, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurer had announced to purchase Novae Group for $605 million in cash. This acquisition is expected to ramp up the acquirer’s Lloyd’s presence. (Read: AXIS Capital to Buy Novae & Consolidate Lloyd's Presence).The new offer price translates to a premium of about 23% to the closing price of 581 pence per Novae share on Jul 4 or 31% to the volume weighted average closing price per Novae share for a month-long period up to and including Jul 4.The purchase consideration of £477.6 million equals 1.5x Novae’s reported net tangible book value of £318.8 million as of Dec 31, 2016 or 1.6x Novae’s reported net tangible book value of £300.6 million as of Jun 30, 2017.

86,AJG,"The second-quarter earnings season is picking up pace with 26% members of the elite S&P 500 Index having reporting quarterly numbers already. Per the latest second-quarter scorecard, the performance of 128 index members (accounting for 36.1% of the index’s total market capitalization) that have already reported their financial numbers this quarter, indicate that total earnings have increased 7% on 4.2% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 77.3% companies surpassing the bottom-line expectations and 70.3% outperforming on the top-line front. (For more information, please consult our Zacks Earnings Analysis).The Finance sector’s results (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) have not been very impressive, but aren’t too disappointing either. Of the sector’s total market cap in the S&P 500 index, 54.1% that have reported quarterly results show 7.4% earnings growth on 5.4% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 82.9% for bottom line and 68.6% for top line is higher than the beat ratio of the S&P 500.  The insurance industry is part of the broader Finance sector. Let’s see how the second quarter has turned up for insurers.Results of insurers exposed to catastrophe losses will witness a dent in underwriting margins on account of several catastrophe losses that occurred during the quarter under review. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON), catastrophe losses suffered globally is estimated at $53 billion in the first half of 2017.  Some insurers have estimated catastrophe losses in the second quarter stemming from severe wind and hail catastrophe events during April and May in the U.S.The Allstate Corp. projects $627 million (pre-tax) in catastrophe loss while Kemper Corporation estimates the same between $32 million and $38 million.Another component of insurer’s top line, net investment income, has witnessed improvement, but still remains below historical levels, owing to still-low interest rates.Nevertheless, the recent increase in interest rates by the Fed should offer some respite to life insurers that suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates. Annuity sales too should benefit from higher rates. Nonetheless, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Top line may also benefit from an improving economy and revived consumer sentiments which may lead to increased demand for insurance products.On the flip side, pricing woes linger. Insurers having fat capital reserves are fighting hard to gain business in a highly competitive environment and one of the most common ways to achieve underwriting targets is by lower pricing. Certain lines of insurance – commercial property, workers’ compensation and general liability are mostly experiencing soft pricing.Nonetheless, core business growth, geographic expansion, mergers and acquisitions and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase are like to benefit insurers.Let’s peek into these five insurance companies that are gearing up to report their second-quarter results on Jul 27.Aflac Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.63 is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

The company will, however, incur high cost on account of its Japan branch conversion (read more: Will Changing Business Strategy Aid Aflac Q2 Earnings?).Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Aflac Incorporated QuoteThe Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.

In two of the last four quarters, Hartford Financial missed expectations. It has an average negative earnings surprise of 9.41% of the last four quarters.We expect Hartford Financial’s results to be supported by improved performance of its Personal Auto business. Commercial Lines in small and middle markets are likely to perform well, boosting both the top and the bottom lines, continuing the previous quarter’s trend. The Group Benefit and Mutual Funds segment will likely deliver a solid performance, reflecting the company’s claims expertise and improvements made in its book of business over the years (read more: Hartford Financial Q2 Earnings: What's in the Offing?).Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
