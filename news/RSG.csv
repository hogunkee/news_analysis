0,RSG,"Key U.S. stock indexes were modestly higher in the stock market today, led by techs and financials. Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) were the biggest advancers on the Dow Jones industrial average.XPowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) rose 0.4%, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) gained 0.1% and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) was fractionally higher.Small caps also outperformed with iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) up 0.6% and iShares Core S&P Small Cap (IJR) up 0.5%. The Dow Jones industrials and Russell 2000 index hit new highs Tuesday.Banks, chips and retail led the upside among sector funds, while gold, real estate and utilities underperformed. SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) gapped up and rose 1%, as did SPDR S&P Bank (KBE). Both ETFs have been consolidating since early March.Gold futures fell more than 1% to $1,285.90 an ounce. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) lost 0.9% each. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) and VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) dropped 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively.When it comes to stocks, do you prefer high or low volatility? Two plays that are at the opposite ends of the volatility spectrum are curiously near buy points. Which will win?PowerShares S&P 500 High Beta (SPHB) climbed past a 38.93 flat-base buy point early Wednesday, after trading between 35 and 39 for much of the past 10 months. After an 18% run from a November bounce off the 50-day moving average, the fund cleared a flat base in mid-February and edged higher before forming the current pattern.The 6-year-old fund, which tracks the S&P 500 High Beta Index, has gathered $152.9 million in assets. It invests in the 100 highest beta (or most volatile relative to the S&P 500) stocks in the S&P 500, which can lead to bigger swings in the fund's returns vs. the broader market.Industrials accounted for the biggest sector weighting as of Sept. 25, at nearly 24% of assets. Financials, at 23%, was next; information technology and energy weighed in with a respective 18% and 11%. Top holdings included construction gear provider United Rentals (URI), metal ores miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and chip designer Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).SPHB has lagged the S&P 500 this year through Sept. 26, according to Morningstar Direct, with a 7.2% year-to-date return vs. 13.2% for the benchmark index. Its average annual return of 15% over the past five years, however, leads the S&P 500's 14% gain. It carries a 0.25% expense ratio.IBD'S TAKE: Advanced Micro Devices is a big chip designer, but how do its fundamentals and technicals rank in its industry group? Find out now at IBD Stock Checkup.SPHB has a Relative Strength Rating of 62, higher than the 51 RS of its counterpart that was launched the same day: PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV). The $7 billion fund, which tracks the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index, provides exposure to large-cap stocks with — you guessed it — low volatility. Shares are near a 45.79 flat-base buy point initially cleared Sept. 11.SPLV was featured in this ETF column July 13 as it found support at its 50-day line. It climbed 3% from the support line to a Sept. 12 intraday high. Before that, shares rose 5% from a May bounce off the 50-day.SPLV takes the 100 least volatile S&P 500 stocks and weights them so those with the lowest volatility get the biggest weighting. Financials made up the biggest sector weighting as of Sept. 25 at 21%; industrials were at 18%, utilities at 17% and consumer staples at 12.5%. Information technology represented 11%. Top names included Republic Services (RSG), Coca-Cola (KO) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB).The fund has returned 12% YTD and averaged a 12.9% annual return over the past five years. It also bears a 0.25% expense ratio.SPHB is likely to outperform if the market takes off on the wings of high-beta growth stocks. SPLV is likely to do better if the stock market heads lower and low-volatility stocks fall less than high-octane growth stocks.Tuesday's picks, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU), gave up some ground along with gold prices. Both held above their respective 50-day lines.RELATED:Apple Leads Dow; FANG Gains Fade; Did Gold Flash A Buy Signal?Apple, Techs Weigh On Stocks; Bitcoin Jumps; Time To Buy Gold?What An ETF For Extreme Stock Market Bulls Is Saying About Investors

1,RSG,"Taxes: Many of the ideas that emerge from Washington are stale, unimaginative and unworkable. Not so the latest pitch from a group of conservative congressional Republicans: Eliminate the IRS.This goes beyond some kind of political revenge fantasy. It's time to consider the damage that the IRS does both to Americans' freedoms as individuals and to the costs it imposes on the economy as a whole, argue the 151 members of the Republican Study Group, an in-house conservative think tank, in their newest budget proposal.The proposal, an alternative to the House Budget Committee's official 2018 budget, comes as part of a much broader tax reform plan that would leave taxes flatter and fairer for both corporations and individuals than is currently the case.""At its worst, the IRS has shown a capacity for outright corruption and political targeting,"" the group's budget, released late last week, argued. ""Under the Obama administration, the IRS illegally targeted conservatives. It has channeled millions of taxpayer dollars away from taxpayer assistance for employee bonuses. It has allowed taxpayer information to be compromised in a data breach. The IRS has even intentionally leaked confidential taxpayer information. This is a blatant breach of trust. The American taxpayer deserves better.""Indeed. But even many conservatives concede that getting rid of the IRS would be difficult, if not impossible. So how would the RSG accomplish its goal?It would move tax collection duties to ""new, smaller and more accountable departments"" within the Treasury Department. There would be a tax unit for businesses, one for individuals and families, and another for dispute resolution.Again, this is not just about ""going after the IRS."" But when the nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimates that, in 2016 alone, total U.S. tax compliance costs were nearly $409 billion, it's pretty clear that something has gone awry with our tax code and how we collect our taxes.That can also be seen in a study by the National Taxpayers Union, using a slightly different methodology. For 2016, that group estimates that ""Based on the most current public estimates, the value of the time (6.1 billion hours) plus out-of-pocket costs expended annually on complying with the individual and corporate Tax Code amounts to an economic loss of $234.4 billion.""In short, our current system imposes major costs in both time and money while often punishing people randomly for noncompliance in a tax code that now runs to more than 74,000 pages.Knowing this, it becomes clear that to either abolish or shrink the IRS will require tax reform itself.The RSG would accomplish this by letting the tax code ""sunset"" in 2021, and then replace it with a much simpler system that would include just three, simple low rates of 12%, 25% and 33% or, better, a flat tax. They would get rid of the death tax, but also eliminate most itemized deductions — the kind that now clutter up our tax forms. These deductions, which only about 30% of taxpayers use, require legions of IRS agents — the IRS now has roughly 80,000 employees — to administer.This isn't some pie-in-the-sky proposal by a group of extremists. Of the 240 Republicans in the House, 151 are members of the RSG, so there's a good chance that some of its proposals will end up in a tax reform package, as Lifezette noted this week. Prominent Republicans in the Senate, including Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, support the idea of radical simplification.Eliminating the IRS isn't some kind of bureaucratic punishment, but a necessity to reclaim our economic vitality. But it can't be done in isolation; it will require deep, broad-based tax reform.Time is running out. Congress should stop kicking the can down the road and pass a sweeping, big-bang tax reform that will make taxes much flatter and fairer, and also get rid of the costly and oppressive IRS behemoth — while they still have the political clout in Congress to do so.RELATED:Never Mind The Gimmicks, We Need Real Tax ReformWith Trump, Millennials Finally Get Their Tax CutThe Democrats' Desperate Ploy To Block Tax Reform

"
9,RSG,"For a No. 2 player in a slow-moving industry, trash hauler Republic Services (RSG) has been generating a steady stream of recent news.Investment firm Cascade Investment, controlled by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, reported last month that it bought 1.4 million shares of Republic from June 12 to June 18. Imperial Capital launched coverage on Republic on June 5, with an outperform rating and a 12-month price target of 41.A few days earlier, Republic stirred in new executive blood. The company hired Robert Maruster, former chief operating officer of JetBlue Airways, as its chief operating officer.Among the drivers for Republic's rating and price target, Imperial Capital analyst Scott Levine cites consistent earnings growth generated by Republic's long-term emphasis on operational execution and capital returns.Margins have recently been range-bound because of price resistance and a slow industry recovery, Levine says.But ""we expect fortunes to improve going forward,"" Levine wrote, ""as economic and market conditions strengthen and as its cost-savings programs begin to bear fruit.""One example is Ypsilanti, Mich., which last month opted out of its seven-year relationship with Waste Management after Republic underbid the industry's top dog by more than 20% per year.The town will save $1 million over the next five years, according to the Ypsilanti Courier — a serious chunk of change for a community of around 20,000 residents.Waste Management rules the garbage-collection heap. But Republic has consistently loomed large in second place, thwarting a takeover attempt by Waste Management and instead acquiring heavyweight competitor Allied Waste in 2008.Republic's annualized dividend yield is 2.7%. EPS slipped in 2012 and rose 3% last year. Earnings are expected to dip 1% for 2014, then recover to a 10% gain next year.

10,RSG,"Waste Management (WM) will sell trash-to-energy subsidiary Wheelabrator Technologies for $1.94 billion to private equity firm Energy Capital Partners as part of an all-cash deal as it reported mixed second-quarter results.Excluding restructuring costs, asset write-downs and other items such as the divestiture of its Puerto Rico operations, Waste Management earned 60 cents a share, up 11.1% from a year earlier and a penny above estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 1% to $3.56 billion but missed views of $3.61 billion.The nation's largest trash hauler said that it expects to meet or exceed its 2014 EPS guidance of $2.30-$2.35. Wall Street analysts see EPS of $2.36.Shares rose 3% to 45.30 on the stock market today, hitting the highest level in eight months.The sale of Wheelabrator, which owns or operates 17 waste-to-energy facilities and four power-producing facilities in the U.S., will provide Waste Management the capital it needs for future acquisitions as well as share buybacks and debt repayment, the company announced.Waste Management will also enter into a long-term agreement to supply waste to certain Wheelabrator facilities after the closing of the sale to the Short Hills, N.J.-based Energy Capital Partners.The deal is subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval and is expected to close late this year.Last week, Republic Services (RSG), the second-largest trash hauler in the U.S., reported that its EPS rose 18.6% to 51 cents in Q2, beating views, while revenue rose 5.4% to $2.2 billion, also beating views.
"
11,RSG,"Trash collector and recycler Republic Services (RSG) rose sharply Friday after reporting better-than-expected earnings and raising its dividend.The U.S. No. 2 trash hauler after Waste Management (WMT), Republic reported earnings of 51 cents a share vs. estimates of 49 cents. That's a 19% increase from a year ago. Revenue was $2.23 billion, a 5% increase. The company attributed the earnings boost to productivity gains and the revenue to more volume hauled.The company serves 13 million customers nationwide, including residences, businesses, industries and municipalities.Republic was incorporated in 1998 and grew through acquisitions and mergers as well as organically. The stock also came public in 1998. The stock lost more than half its value in the 2008 financial crisis, but has worked its way back to just above its former high. The last few years has seen spotty EPS growth and mostly a sideways stock. Revenue growth has been low single digits.The Pollution Control industry group is ranked No. 127 out of 197 industry groups. Republic is ranked 8th out of 33 by Composite Rating.The company also raised its quarterly dividend from 26 to 28 cents. That works out to an annual yield of 3%. The dividend will be paid Oct. 15 to shareholders of record Oct. 1. The company has a history of raising its dividend. It was paying 6 cents in 2003.The company has a five-year annualized EPS growth rate of 7% and an Earnings Stability Factor of 6 on a 0 to 99 scale, where low numbers correspond to stable earnings growth.Analysts expect a 4% decline in earnings in the next report and a 1% decline overall for the year. They expect 10% growth in 2015.Investment firm Cascade Investment, controlled by Bill Gates, bought 1.4 million shares of Republic stock in June.

13,RSG,"These days it's tougher to find a competitive yield without taking on too much risk. Waste collectors Waste Management (WM) and Republic Services (RSG) carry above-market yields and offer lower volatility.Waste Management currently pays 36.5 cents a share each quarter or $1.46 on an annual basis. It yields about 3.3%, compared to 2.41% for the S&P 500. The company has steadily increased its shareholder dividend over the years. Waste Management's dividend has nearly doubled since 2004.Republic Services pays stockholders 26 cents a share each quarter or $1.04 annually. The company last bumped up its dividend by 11% to the current rate in July. The current yield is 3%. The firm's dividend has sharply increased from just 4 cents a share about 10 years ago.Both are among the highest-yielding stocks in IBD's Pollution-Control group. Waste Management has the second highest, while Republic Services has the third-best yield.Both stocks have betas below 1, meaning they have fewer ups and downs than a general market index such as the S&P 500, which has a beta of 1.0.Revenue growth at both companies accelerated in recent quarters. Waste Management's sales growth has picked up to 5% in Q3 from 1% in Q1, helped by, in part, higher fuel surcharges and higher collection yields. Republic Services' top-line growth climbed to 6% in the third quarter, lifted by higher yields and fees. That marked its biggest gain in years. Sales edged up 1% in Q1 and 2% in Q2.Waste Management has pulled back into buying range from a 43.69 buy point in a flat base. It retreated in some heavy volume, which is not ideal. But the stock went through a solid period of accumulation from late October to late November.Republic Services has shaped a saucer-with-handle-like base with a 35.39 buy point.

Bitcoin climbed 2.4% to $13,601.77, according to CoinDesk, off slightly from an earlier high of $14,095.06. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) bounced 13%, on track to snap a four-session losing streak, after finding support near its 50-day line Thursday.Facebook (FB), down 4%, weighed on the tech-heavy Nasdaq. The social network said Thursday it would change its News Feeds to give precedence to friend and family posts. Analysts say the move could affect Facebook's ad revenue.Want to own Coca-Cola (KO), American Express (AXP) and other holdings similar to those of billionaire investor Warren Buffett?PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV) could fit the bill. The ETF is in a potential buy range from a rebound off its 50-day moving average. It advanced 7% from an early September bounce off the line to its Dec. 4 intraday high. SPLV was featured in this ETF column, which was published Sept. 27.The fund, which launched in May 2011, has gathered $7.5 billion in assets. It tracks the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index, which comprises the 100 least volatile S&P 500 stocks over the past 12 months. The index also has the ability to respond dynamically to market conditions. So unlike some other low volatility indexes, it can move into better-performing sectors when deemed necessary.Financials account for the biggest sector weighting at nearly 21% of assets. Utilities make up about 20%, industrials 19%, and information technology and consumer staples roughly 10% each. The top 10 holdings as of Jan. 10 included Honeywell International (HON), Coca-Cola, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), PepsiCo (PEP) and Republic Services (RSG).Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett's holding company, owned Coca-Cola as one of its biggest positions in Q3. Other Buffett names in the ETF include American Express (AXP), U.S. Bancorp (USB), Moody's (MCO), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Visa (V).IBD'S TAKE: Making money catching ETF uptrends requires knowledge about how to read charts. You can learn how at IBD University.Buffett tends to own some big dividend payers. For instance, Coca-Cola yields an annualized 3.2%, P&G offers 3.1%. SPLV's 12-month dividend is just north of 2%, above the S&P 500's average 1.7% payout. And it has a dividend growth rate of 7% vs. SPDR S&P 500 (SPY)'s 12%.SPLV is up 0.2% this year through Jan. 10, lagging the S&P 500's 2.9% gain. Its average annual returns of 10.2% and 13.6% over the past three and five years also slightly trail the benchmark index, which returned a respective 12.7% and 15.7%.Generally, SPLV tends to perform better if the stock market declines and low-volatility stocks fall less than growth stocks. It carries a 0.25% expense ratio.Thursday's pick, Robo Global Robotics & Automation (ROBO), hit a new high but remains in a buy zone from a 42.69 flat-base entry. Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence (BOTZ) made a similar move.RELATED:Apple Rises While Bitcoin Dives; Time To Buy Nvidia, AI Stocks?China Hits Stocks; Buffett Vs.
