43,HBI,"As retailers endure more pummeling, Amazon (AMZN) is said to be putting more high-end brands on sale for Prime Day this year, including Under Armour (UAA) and Adidas (ADDYY).X""Preannounced promotions for footwear and apparel appear to be deeper than last year, with more preannounced premium branded offers; specifically, we highlight athletic apparel (30% off both adidas and Under Armour apparel),"" noted Berenberg analyst Corinna Freedman in an early Tuesday report.Currently, only a handful of Nike (NKE) products appear to be listed in Amazon's annual sales event, including several belts and wallets. The company, which recently announced that it had embarked on a pilot test to sell certain products directly on Amazon, has not yet introduced its branded shop on the e-commerce site.Adidas and Under Armour both sell directly on the site through their own branded pages. Nike is currently sold through third-party sellers on Amazon.For the major athleticwear companies, an Amazon team-up raises the possibility of a big sales boost. Amazon indicated that it sold over a million pairs of shoes on Prime Day last year, Freedman said.An official sales agreement with Amazon would also give Nike more control over which products show up on the site, and a way to push back against unauthorized or potentially counterfeit listings, Bloomberg said last month.However, forging a deeper relationship with Amazon also raises concerns that Nike and its rivals could lose control over how those products are actually sold and marketed.""Amazon would be the only customer that Nike wouldn't have significant leverage over given Amazon is about three times larger than Nike from a sales perspective,"" Susquehanna said in a research note quoted last week by MarketWatch. ""So if Nike ever felt that Amazon was not presenting its brand properly, Nike would have very little ability to apply pressure in order to force Amazon to improve presentation.""Nike, Adidas, Hanesbrands (HBI)-owned Hanes and Under Armour are the most frequently bought brands on the site, said Morgan Stanley in April.Nike management made clear on its June earnings call, however, that it would be keeping most of its inventory guarded from the online behemoth.""It's really a small pilot and we have a very tailored assortment for Amazon, so that we can actually learn as we go through this,"" Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards said then.Nike (NKE) slipped 0.9% to 58.18 in the stock market today.

44,HBI,"Like a pro athlete, Nike (NKE) knows that it needs to tweak its strategy from time to time to stay competitive.XOn its fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, Wall Street will likely be looking for more commentary on the athletic footwear and apparel maker's new consumer-focused initiatives intended to keep it in sync with a digitally driven retail environment and ahead of rivals Adidas (ADDYY) and Under Armour (UAA). Nike's recent sales arrangement with Amazon (AMZN)? Expect questions about that too.For the quarter, Wall Street expects flat year-over-year per-share earnings of 49 cents on 4.5% revenue growth to $8.61 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. That would mark a second flat Q4 for EPS and a slight slowdown in sales growth.The results will come roughly two weeks after Nike announced a new ""consumer direct offense"" alignment. That effort reorganizes Nike's leadership and geographic structure and tightens its focus on a dozen key cities across the world that are expected to account for 80% of its projected growth through 2020.Part of Nike's new game plan also involves what it calls a ""triple double"" goal to double innovation, speed to market and direct engagement with customers. The plan also includes laying off 2% of its global workforce. Nike shares fell more than 3% on June 15, the day of the news.Nike and other major athletic apparel and footwear brands are all developing manufacturing and supply-chain technologies to get on-trend products on shelves faster. Under Armour this week also announced a leadership shuffle of its own, reviving its COO position.The sluggish retail environment has raised questions about how and where individual brands will sell their products, as brick-and-mortar stores like Macy's (M) and J.C. Penney (JCP) struggle to shore up store traffic amid competition from Amazon and off-price chains.Nike will reportedly sell footwear directly on Amazon in an attempt to combat the sale of knockoff goods at the e-commerce giant. That could spell trouble for J.C. Penney and Kohl's (KSS), Gordon Haskett analyst Charles Grom said last week.Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Foot Locker (FL) immediately took a hit on news of a possible Nike-Amazon team-up — perhaps not without reason. Nike, Adidas, Hanesbrands (HBI)-owned Hanes and Under Armour are the most frequently bought brands on Amazon, Morgan Stanley said in April.As Nike dials down the emphasis on its self-created ""futures orders"" — a metric designed to reflect retailer demand — it is dialing up its own in-house manufacturing and selling capabilities, with aims to halve its product-creation cycle and streamline its brick-and-mortar and online retail experiences.Still, Cowen this month trimmed its price target on Nike to 53 from 54 on increased promotional activity amid its rivalry with Adidas and Under Armour, and JPMorgan downgraded the stock to neutral from overweight.Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole said earlier this month that the market is expecting Nike to guide fiscal 2018 profit below consensus for $2.52 per share — Zacks currently puts consensus at $2.44 — but that those expectations have already been priced into the stock. He has an equal-weight rating on the stock.Given ""poor"" sentiment and high short interest in Nike, Sole sees bulls snapping up shares of the athletic brand after the market digests the company's full-year guidance on Thursday.Nike shares closed up 0.8% at 53.36 on the stock market today, hitting resistance on the underside of their converging 50-day and 200-day lines. The stock is up less than 5% so far in calendar 2017, underperforming the S&P 500.

45,HBI,"Amazon's (AMZN) Whole Foods (WFM) acquisition, the launch of Prime Wardrobe, and Nike's (NKE) decision to sell directly on the e-commerce site have shaken up the grocery and broader retail space, but recent sell-offs could actually prompt ""more investable"" opportunities in retail, says one analyst.X ""Although it may take time for investors to be willing to re-enter the space, we believe this may actually have made the 'winners' within our retail/brands coverage (which have already been coping through the Amazon threat) more investable,"" wrote Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel on Monday, arguing that apparel ""is no 'deader' than it was two weeks ago.""Who are the Amazon-resistant names on his list? Ulta Beauty (ULTA), TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST), Nike and Signet Jewelers (SIG). Ralph Lauren (RL) is also seen potentially benefiting.""With fewer 'safe havens' across the broader consumer landscape, multiple premiums around anything thought to be 'safe' will likely be reinforced,"" he said.Amazon closed down 1% at 993.98 in the stock market today. Ulta finished 1.8% higher, TJX added 1%, Ross gained 0.7%, Nike rose 0.8%, and Signet climbed 3.2%.And while Amazon's foray into ""try before you buy""-style at-home shopping with Prime Wardrobe treads further onto department store and apparel retailers' turf, Siegel wonders if the offering could actually be a boost for brands, given the number of store closures happening on the brick-and-mortar level.The additional distribution provided by Amazon, of all places, could help offset lost distribution at department stores, he said.IBD's TAKE: Meanwhile, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos and other tech heads met with India Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of Modi's meeting with President Trump on Monday. For the latest on FANG stocks, check out IBD's hub on all things Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Nike, Under Armour (UAA), Adidas (ADDYY), PVH (PVH), Ralph Lauren, and Hanes Brands (HBI), which have wide wholesale distribution to department stores ""could stand to gain the most from syncing up with the Amazon machine, as the site's success could provide a new form of wholesale distribution, offering some protection from the structural challenges facing the current establishment,"" Siegel added.Furthermore, he said wider apparel distribution on Amazon would actually help to bolster full-price retail and thereby protect off-pricers like TXJ and Ross Stores.RELATED:Wal-Mart Is Not Mulling A Rival Bid For Whole Foods: ReportHere's The Latest Group Having An Amazon-Induced Anxiety Attack

46,HBI,"Word on the Street is that Nike (NKE) will start selling its wares directly on Amazon (AMZN). That means shares of sports stores Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Foot Locker (FL) are taking their turn at having an Amazon-induced anxiety attack Wednesday.X ""Our channel checks indicate that NKE could be close to finalizing an agreement to sell directly on Amazon.com as a wholesaler,"" wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Lindsay Drucker Mann in an early Wednesday note to clients.By midday, Bloomberg had reported, citing a source familiar with the matter, that Nike would sell footwear directly on Amazon through a brand-registry program in a bid to combat knockoff Nikes from appearing on the site.Nike, Adidas (ADDYY), Hanes (owned by Hanesbrands (HBI)) and Under Armour (UAA) are the most frequently bought brands on the site, per an April report from Morgan Stanley, which means Amazon is already a hot destination for customers looking for athleticwear.For Nike specifically, that could bring in an extra $300 million to $500 million in wholesale revenue from Amazon alone, estimated Goldman Sachs, which also said that such a partnership could allow Nike better control over its brand and inventory on the site, as well as access to coveted millennial shoppers.But that could mean fewer ring-ups at the cash register for sports apparel and equipment retailers. Foot Locker shares sank 5% to close at 47.82 in the stock market today, hitting a three-year low. Foot Locker is down more than 20% so far in June after crashing 23% in May.Dick's Sporting Goods tumbled fell 3.8% to the lowest in more than a year. Finish Line (FINL) lost 4% and Hibbett Sports (HIBB) shed 4%, with both falling to their worst levels since 2010.Nike did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Its shares finished 2% higher. Under Armour fell 0.8%, and Amazon rose 1%.It is worth pointing out that if such a deal were indeed to happen, it is not clear whether that would open Nike's entire arsenal of popular apparel and footwear brands to Amazon's reach — an important distinction when it comes to discussing the impact of a potential team-up on Nike's brand image and on sporting goods retailers.We do not know the scope here— Matt Powell (@NPDMattPowell) June 21, 2017Morgan Stanley, in a separate note from earlier this month, had already surmised that athletic apparel brands would sell directly to Amazon (instead of avoiding it altogether, like some retailers), but that they would have an ""appropriate-sized presence there,"" with products and price points that ""won't compromise the integrity of the offering elsewhere.""Nike is notably building out its own direct-to-consumer shops and online platform — so much so that it has muted the importance of its retailer-based ""futures"" metric —  and all the major athletic brands are developing their supply chain and manufacturing technology to increase speed to market.""The big athleticwear brands will offer much better product on non-Amazon channels,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analysts on June 6. ""If consumers want the hot fashion or the personalized products, they won't be able to get it on Amazon.""Notably, however, smaller rival Under Armour already sells direct on Amazon and through licensed dealers on Amazon Marketplace, said Goldman Sachs, an aspect which gives the Baltimore-based brand ""a clear edge over (Nike) in how fresh product was presented on Amazon.com.""Some worry about what Nike sales on Amazon would mean for the e-commerce giant's development of its own private apparel labels.Would signal Nike's death as Amazon is launching private labels and Nike would supply them with the data needed to build their athleisure.— Chris Burns (@archbyccb) June 21, 2017But Morgan Stanley's analysts said — at least, prior to Wednesday's chatter — that ""no private label maker will likely have a supply chain as fast that can deliver as much fashion newness, and this would be a major roadblock for Amazon because it too aims to move to a fast fashion model.""RELATED:Nike To Shrink Workforce As Stores Seen 'Canceling' Under ArmourNike, Adidas Have This 'Major Roadblock' Against Amazon

Overall, last year's holiday retail sales disappointed with only 3% growth, said the NRF, less than expected.Holiday 2016 should prove to be a little less dire. The NRF predicts a 3.6% retail gain in November and December to $655.8 billion; online sales are seen rising 7%-10% to $117 billion. And retailers are feeling bullish. Target (TGT), Macy's and Nordstrom (JWN) all raised guidance going into the all-important shopping season.Predictably, online sales continue to eat into brick-and-mortar market share. Traditional stores are again gearing up to do battle with Amazon and friends.Wal-Mart (WMT) is pushing up its ""Cyber Week"" deals from Monday to Friday so that they start essentially the minute Thanksgiving Day is over. Target's ""10 Days of Deals,"" which include both in-store and online promotions, already started on Saturday.""If you look at the companies that reported earnings, it's e-commerce that's driving a significant amount of the growth,"" said Weishaar. ""What's unique in it is mobile is becoming a higher penetration of the digital section, so that would be something new. I don't think a lot of the companies have figured out how to convert the sales on mobile.""Shopping via smartphone is the next frontier. Thanksgiving Day and Christmas are projected to be the biggest mobile-shopping days of the year, said Adobe.One consequence of a ramp-up in retail digital wars, however, is that fewer people head into brick-and-mortar shops.Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins says the industry could see a ""significant slowdown"" in Black Friday foot traffic.Traffic fell in the mid-single to high-single-digits on Black Friday 2015, and retailers could see an equal or even greater decline this time around, he said, particularly as other shopping events during the year dilute the impact of the post-Thanksgiving sales day.Besides Cyber Monday and Super Saturday, the menu of existing shopping holidays has grown to include Amazon's Prime Day and even China-based Singles Day, among others.Foursquare's data are a little more optimistic; the company predicts a 3.5% year-over-year slide in Black Friday foot traffic, which would be ""far less severe"" than the prior year's figures.""The importance of Black Friday from a traffic (perspective) to brick-and-mortar stores is going to continue to decelerate,"" said Weishaar. ""With more people shopping online, the one specific day becomes less important.""IBD'S TAKE: Adobe data indicate that Black Friday sales will be the ""biggest ever,"" growing 11.3% from last year to $3.05 billion in sales. For a look at what else is happening this week, check out IBD's Investing Action Plan. Broadly speaking, inventory levels are cleaner in Q4, which translates to more targeted, strategic discounting instead of promotional wars, said Weishaar. But even in the absence of ""everything must go""-type sales, that doesn't mean that consumers shouldn't expect to see a whole lot of deals floating around.Which retail names will be winners this year?Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel pointed out in a recent note that execs at various retailers have alluded to a challenging, promotional holiday season. But there are gems to be found.""Although the election triggered a surprising sense of hope (and short squeezes), we believe much uncertainty remains and would rather buy quality companies that have lagged,"" he wrote, calling out Ulta Beauty (ULTA) as his top pick and noting that the recent Lululemon Athletica (LULU), HBI and Kate Spade (KATE) sell-offs look ""interesting.""Still shining is the off-price sector, as consumers remain hesitant about paying full retail for products and stores have a tough time escaping the ""always-on-sale"" cycle. Athletic wear also continues to dominate street fashion.Nike (NKE), TJX (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST) remain Siegel's long-term choices.Holiday shoppers, unconcerned about the fate of retail stores, will continue to like what they like.Millennials, who favor experiences over tangible goods, may not be retailers' favorite customers. But PwC research found that the teen set, Generation Z, likes ""stuff — and shopping in stores.""""To them, stuff matters,"" said the report. ""Stuff like personal electronics, clothes, shoes, and toys. Which is what they're hoping to receive this holiday season.""RELATED:Black Friday Is The New Cyber Monday: Wal-Mart Pushes Up Sale

96,HBI,"Apparel company Hanesbrands has found its comfort zone. The maker of underwear, socks and T-shirts benefits from a string of intersecting trends: consistent demand for undergarments and other everyday apparel, a shift toward activewear clothing, strong brand recognition, its own low-cost production platform and a series of strategic acquisitions that have helped it bolster sales, analysts say.
"
97,HBI,"""There's a lot to like here,"" Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar told IBD.After Hanesbrands (HBI) reported in April that its first-quarter adjusted earnings per share rose 16% from a year earlier to 22 cents on net sales that climbed 14% to $1.21 billion, the Winston-Salem, N.C.-based outfit raised its guidance for the full year. It forecast net sales of $5.9 billion to $5.95 billion for 2015, up from previous guidance of $5.78 billion to $5.83 billion, and adjusted EPS of $1.61 to $1.66, up from $1.58 to $1.63.2015 Gains In SightThe guidance represents an increase over 2014 results of 10.9% to 11.8% for net sales and 13% to 17% for adjusted EPS.The company, which sells its products wholesale to department stores and mass retailers, is cash-rich and expects to remain so, forecasting net cash from operating activities to total between $550 million and $600 million this year.Hanesbrands' stock is up 24% so far in 2015.Its strong financial performance and stock price appreciation help it earn an IBD Composite Rating of 95, meaning it outperforms 95% of stocks in the market as measured by fundamental and technical factors.The company belongs to IBD's Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing group. Hanes ranks third in the group by Composite Rating, behind G-III (GIII) and Carter's (CRI).The group's largest name by market cap is VF Corp.VFC, which owns 7 For All Mankind, Lee and Wrangler jeans among its brands, which also include activewear names Lucy and The North Face.Second in the group by size isUnder Armour (UA), a big beneficiary of the activewear trend, along with Nike (NKE), in the Apparel-Shoes & Related Manufacturing group.Knights Apparel For SchoolsHanesbrands' elevated outlook reflected a solid start to 2015 and the anticipated impact from its latest acquisition, it said. Early in the second quarter Hanesbrands closed its buy of Knights Apparel, which sells clothes such as t-shirts and sweatshirts with licensed college logos.The deal amplified two key trends for Hanesbrands: ongoing growth in activewear and related clothing, and expansion via acquisitions.Hanesbrands' product lines include Hanes and Playtex. The Knights Apparel acquisition complements its Gear for Sports operation, as well as its prominent Champion brand.""They are riding the athletic apparel cycle for sure,"" John Kernan, an analyst at Cowen & Co., told IBD.Analysts say that popular fashion has in recent years moved away from the likes of skinny jeans and toward activewear and sports-themed clothing, including workout pants, bolstering Hanesbrands' fortunes. On top of this, as consumers discard former fashion preferences for newer ones, they often also buy new undergarments that mesh with their newer designs, analysts say, and this too benefits Hanesbrands' core Hanes innerwear business.Acquiring The GoodsThe company in 2013 bought Maidenform Brands, a seller of bras and other undergarments for women, and in 2014 bought DBApparel, a marketer of intimate apparel and hosiery in Europe.Those two deals bolstered sales last year and Hanesbrands' bottom line, with fourth-quarter profit more than doubling.Morningstar's Weishaar said Hanesbrands produces most of its merchandise in-house and uses its massive scale to keep costs relatively low. When it looks at acquisitions, it typically eyes targets that outsource at least some of their production work. After closing a deal, it then brings the acquired company onto its own manufacturing platform, lowering expenses and boosting profits, she said.""So I think that the M&A play just continues on for them,"" Weishaar said. ""I think that's going to be one of their biggest growth drivers.""Cowen's Kernan agreed. ""They are going to make more acquisitions for sure,"" he said.""They do a really good job rolling up companies and putting them on their platform.""In a report, Kernan estimated that Hanesbrands could reach a run rate of $700 million in annual free cash flow next year, bolstering its ability to pursue more deals.""With only 6% of sales in Europe, we see opportunity for HBI to acquire brands in a fragmented market,"" he wrote in the report.Kernan projected that Hanesbrands could complete an additional $1.7 billion in deals over about five years. That, he noted, would leave the company generating double-digit earnings growth for years even if expansion in its core innerwear business were modest.But the core business, Kernan added, is on solid ground. The company's brands, he wrote, are ""enduring and powerful.""Within the $20 billion U.S. innerwear market, Kernan estimates that Hanes holds an 18% share at retail.Weishaar noted that innerwear is still Hanesbrands' biggest business. That, she added, is a good thing because it infuses reliability.She said most of the innerwear business consists of ""very basic"" undergarments. People tend to know their size and what brand works for them. Most don't want to try on undergarments at stores, so tend to go with a familiar brand. Hanesbrands is familiar to a big share of them. ""They just want to pick it up and go,"" she said.New Socks And UnderwearUnlike other lines of clothing, consumers need to regularly replace their supplies of apparel such as underwear, t-shirts and socks.""It's a replenishment business, so demand is steady,"" Weishaar said. ""It's a really great space to be in.""Hanesbrands declined IBD's interview request, citing a customary quiet period ahead of reporting second-quarter earnings.While speaking at a May conference, CEO Richard Noll acknowledged that Hanesbrands' business may fluctuate quarter to quarter ""as retailers can adjust their inventory levels up and down."" But over the course of a typical full year, ""our business is remarkably stable due to the replenishment nature of most of our categories.""That, along with boosts from acquisitions, makes him confident in Hanesbrands' long-term growth.""I feel really good about our ability to drive EPS up double digits for many years to come,"" he said.

178,HBI,"Vipshop (VIPS), which started in 2008 and went public in March 2012, is somewhat of a rare breed among retail websites. It sells quality branded apparel, accessories, home goods and other lifestyle products at a 30% to 70% discount to the original retail price using a ""flash sales"" model. Every morning at 10 Beijing time, it launches new flash sales on a finite quantity of products or services online for a limited time.
"
179,HBI,"To provide shoppers with a greater opportunity to buy featured discounted products, each customer is limited to purchasing two pieces of the same item and each shopping cart can hold only 20 items at one time, except for food products.
"
180,HBI,"As with other popular flash-sale sites, which sell everything from high fashion to hotel rooms, the idea is to create an impulse-driven shopping experience while helping to move excess inventory sourced from a variety of vendors.
"
181,HBI,"As of the end of 2012, Vipshop had an impressive lineup of goods with exclusive rights to sell selective products from more than 700 brands.
"
182,HBI,"Preferred Products
"
183,HBI,"Vipshop features products from more than 5,800 brands, including international labels such as such as Nike (NKE), Disney (DIS), Hanesbrands (HBI) and Lee (owned by VF Corp. (VFC); and domestic brands like Hstyle. Its top three selling brands are Adidas, Nike and Kappa, a domestic sporting goods brand.
"
184,HBI,"Vipshop's approach has played well with customers. In 2012, sales more than tripled to $692 million. It ended that year with close to 27 million registered users.
"
185,HBI,"It has also scored a big hit with investors. Vipshop's stock price has rocketed nearly 450% over the past 12 months to around 100.
"
186,HBI,"Vipshop has been profitable the past five quarters. It earned 26 cents per American Depositary Share (ADS) in the most recent third quarter, up from one cent a year earlier. Sales rocketed 146% to $383.7 million as it saw a 132% rise in active customers to 4 million and a 116% rise in total orders to 11.7 million.
"
187,HBI,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year 2013 earnings to reach $1.04 per ADS, up from a 4-cent loss in 2012. They see a 107% surge in 2014 and a 59% rise in 2015.
"
188,HBI,"China-based UBS analyst Erica Poon Werkun forecast a 62% revenue compound annual growth rate from 2012 to 2017, driven mainly by growth on active customers, in her January initiation note on Vipshop, which she rates a buy.
"
189,HBI,"Why the bright prospects?
"
190,HBI,"""We believe VIPS addresses issues on the supply side, namely excess inventories in distribution channels and the difficulty in penetrating lower-tier cities,"" noted Werkun.
"
191,HBI,"It also addresses the consumer's demand for ""superior product value proposition, newness and convenience in shopping,"" she added.
"
192,HBI,"Vipshop's main growth drivers are its discounts and product selection, adds Kelland Willis, an associate analyst at Forrester Research.
"
193,HBI,"She says Vipshop offers access to brands at affordable prices that for the most part aren't available on other websites in China.
"
194,HBI,"""Vipshop has hit that niche in China's mass market with mid-range name brands like Adidas and Puma that are considered luxury products among this consumer group in China,"" she said. ""They've really done a great job catering to middle-income consumers age 18 to 35 by offering them name-brand products that they wouldn't otherwise be able to afford. The consumers they target are brand-conscious and are excited to be able to shop for those products at price points they can afford.""
"
195,HBI,"Three Growth Drivers
"
196,HBI,"In an initiation report, China-based HSBC analyst Chi Tsang cites three growth drivers for Vipshop. No. 1 is the fact that ""the market is large and growing rapidly.""
"
197,HBI,"Tsang estimates the market for discount retail in China is $40 billion, growing at over 50% a year, and Vipshop has a 4% market share. The company's other growth drivers are ""limited competition"" from traditional discount retailers and ""substantial potential upside to customer numbers.""
"
198,HBI,"Among Vipshop's strengths is its mix of international and domestic brands in its flash sales, says Willis. She says not many websites in China offer the mix of both. And the sites that do offer that mix, she says, don't do as good a job presenting the brands as Vipshop does. Vipshop does a ""good job highlighting"" whether a brand is international or domestic in its flash sales, ""whereas other multibrand retailers tend to sell products by category and you don't know the actual brand name,"" she added.
"
199,HBI,"Competitive Environment
"
200,HBI,"Still, overall industry rivalry in China is ""intense,"" says Tsang, and Vipshop competes with both dedicated flash-sale players and online marketplaces. Its primary rivals include business-to-consumer e-commerce firms that sell similar products and services online, such as Tmall, 360Buy and Dangdang (DANG), and other online flash sales firms, says a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
"
201,HBI,"Marketplaces ""dominate"" the e-commerce scene in China, writes Willis in her China online retail forecast report for 2013 to 2018.
"
202,HBI,"The biggest marketplaces in the country include Taobao, Tmall, Suning and Jingdong as well as Amazon.com (AMZN). But Vipshop has some advantages over rivals, says Tsang. They include ""customer loyalty, driven by a high-quality product selection chosen by what is considered to be the largest team of buyers in China and a dedicated customer service organization; and effective operational management and financial controls.""
"
203,HBI,"Meanwhile, online shopping in China is growing faster than most anyone originally expected, Willis noted in her report. In 2013, China's online retail market — which includes business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer sites — surpassed $300 billion, Willis says.
"

It's extended well above its 50-day and 200-day averages.Earnings reports from Ralph Lauren (RL) and Hanesbrands (HBI) on Wednesday will give investors a clearer picture of how premium apparel retailers fared during the holiday selling season.Ralph Lauren is expected to report a 17% jump in EPS as sales edged up 2.2% to $2.45 billion when it reports fiscal third-quarter earnings before the market opens.Leather goods maker Coach (COH) and Tiffany & Co.

Revenue, however, is forecast to grow a mild 0.6% to $1.152 billion from $1.145 billion.In December, Hanes used cash to buy back $250 million in bonds to reduce debt, and it plans to cut interest expense further this year by repaying half of its remaining $500 million of 8% senior notes due in 2016, a year earlier than expected. The clothier is trading just 2% off its all-time intraday high of 38.80 set on Jan. 28.Hanes sees EPS of $3 to $3.25 for the full year 2013.

351,HBI,"Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 1. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters. Well, it has been battling higher cost of sales and marketing expenses, thanks to a challenging U.S. wholesale landscape. On a positive note, rising organic sales and strong international performance has been a boon to Hanesbrands’ top line. Also, the company’s acquisitions and cost-reduction efforts have been positively impacting performance. With these in mind, let’s see what to expect from Hanesbrands when it reports results this time.International Business & Buyouts Bode WellHanesbrands has long been benefiting from the solid performance of its international segment, driven by store openings, robust consumer demand and extensive online sales. In fact, the segment accounted for nearly 33% of the company’s net sales in fourth-quarter 2017. Driven by such upsides, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $524 million from this segment, depicting a growth of almost 9.9% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.  Moreover, management is focused on making investments and innovations, internationally, to sustain growth in this segment. This is evident from its recent buyout of intimate apparel seller Bras N Things that operates in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.Speaking of buyouts, the company has long been gaining from contributions from Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia that were acquired in 2016. Moreover, Hanesbrands acquired Alternative Apparel in 2017, which boosted sales at the Activewear segment by 5 points. Management anticipates approximately $180 million in sales from the buyouts of Alternative Apparel and Bras N Things in 2018. Hanesbrands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Hanesbrands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hanesbrands Inc. Quote Organic Sales & Other Factors Aiding PerformanceHanesbrands organic sales has been gradually picking pace, evident from 3% and 1% rise witnessed in the preceding two quarters, respectively. In fact, management is optimistic about sustaining organic sales growth in the forthcoming periods and envisions it to grow roughly 1% on a constant-currency basis in 2018.Additionally, Hanesbrands’ online sales have been growing at a solid rate and formed about 11% of the company’s total sales in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, online sales surged 22% year over year, fueled by growth across several channels. Hanesbrands, which is a global partner for Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), is focused on making incremental investments in its online business to keep pace with consumers’ evolving shopping patterns. That said, management is committed toward growing its online sales to 15% of net sales in the coming years.Buoyed by the aforementioned efforts, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,431 million for the first quarter, reflecting a rise of almost 3.7% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. This expectation also falls within management’s forecast of net sales in the band of $1.42-$1.44 billion for the impeding quarter.Hurdles in the PathHigher cost of sales and SG&A expenses have been dragging the company’s performance lately. Further, management continues to be cautious about the challenging U.S. wholesale landscape in 2018. Also, rising input costs and increased marketing investments to support new innovations are likely to affect margins. Incidentally, management expects operating margin for the first half of 2018 to be hurt by escalated marketing and distribution costs. Such headwinds have also kept investors on the side lines, evident from the stock’s 20.1% fall in the past six months, versus the industry’s gain of 15.3%.  Moreover, such factors have negatively impacted the consensus marks for earnings for the first quarter. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 24 cents, representing a 17.2% decline from the year-ago quarter. The projection, which has remained stable over the past 30 days, lies within management’s projected range of 23-25 cents for the first quarter.All said, lets now take a look at the picture unveiled by the Zacks Model for the upcoming quarterly announcement.Zacks ModelOur proven model doesn’t show that Hanesbrands is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

This, in turn was backed by solid International sales that represented nearly 31% of the company’s top line.International sales were fueled by strength in Hanes Europe Innerwear; Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia, with global Champion sales growing 16% in the quarter. Notably, sales at the International segment jumped 14% on a currency neutral basis. Apart from the aforementioned factors, extensive online sales growth also bolstered sales improvement at the segment. Management expects the fourth quarter to mark another quarter of organic sales growth. Also, we expect the International segment to continue being a major driver in the fourth quarter. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for International sales is pegged at $551 million, representing a 9.1% rise from the year-ago period.While these factors are likely to drive the top line, focus on Project Booster program should help the company generate cost savings and aid the bottom line. Notably, by 2019, this project is anticipated to produce nearly $150 million of annualized cost savings, out of which roughly $50 million will be reinvested in targeted growth avenues.Factors Raising ConcernsHowever, a tough retail landscape has been hurting Hanesbrands’ brick-and-mortar performance. Evidently, this marred Hanesbrands’ domestic sales in the quarter. Further, the company’s Innerwear segment has been delivering soft results for a while now on account of soft brick-and-mortar performance stemming from sluggish traffic. In third-quarter 2017, sales at this unit declined 5.2% in the quarter to $644.1 million, as the apparel category bore the brunt of a tough back-to-school retail landscape.Management expects the soft retail U.S. trends to linger in 2017, which raises concerns over its fourth-quarter performance. Incidentally, for the fourth quarter, the consensus mark for Innerwear sales stands at $594 million, down 2.8% from the year-ago period.  Also, the fourth quarter is likely to be impacted by additional marketing investments; the recently announced buyout of Alternative Apparel and effects of Sears Canada bankruptcy.Q4 Expectations in NumbersConsidering all factors, the company projects fourth-quarter net sales in a band of $1.63 billion to $1.65 billion, with the mid-point depicting an increase of nearly 3% on an organic basis. This outlook is based on a conservative view for the U.S. sales landscape; sales of roughly $15 million expected from Alternative Apparel and negative effects from Sears Canada bankruptcy. Adjusted earnings are envisioned in a band of 51 cents to 53 cents, while GAAP earnings per share are projected to range from 47-49 cents.The earnings estimate (both GAAP and adjusted) includes 5 cents from higher marketing investment, greater mix of International sales and the expected adverse impact from Sears Canada bankruptcy somewhat negated by greater-than-expected buyout synergies.  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 53 cents, which is in line with the year-ago period. This estimate has witnessed an uptrend over the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,631 million, up 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclude that Hanesbrands is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

356,HBI,"A tough retail environment and new outside competition have left traditional apparel makers in a tight battle for whatever is left of brick-and-mortar clothing sales. Unfortunately, we have seen even some of our most recognizable brands—like Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report)—struggle to keep up.Hanesbrands is a leading marketer of innerwear, outerwear, and hosiery apparel under strong consumer brands, including Hanes, Champion, Playtex, Bali, Just My Size, barely there, and Wonderbra. The company designs and sells T-shirts, bras, panties, men's underwear, children's underwear, socks, hosiery, casual wear, and active wear.In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Hanesbrands management lowered the upper end of its sales and earnings guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2017, leading to a plethora of negative estimate revisions and helping the stock earn its Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Latest Earnings and OutlookHanesbrands most recently reported earnings on Nov. 1. The company posted adjusted earnings of $0.60 per share, which was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and about 7% higher than the year-ago quarter. Total revenues of $1.8 billion fell short of our consensus estimate and advanced just 2% year-over-year.Strong international sales helped the company grow its top and bottom line, but Hanesbrands is growing increasingly worried about weak results in North America. Management has blamed soft store traffic and a tough retail landscape, along with the impact of U.S. hurricanes and the bankruptcy of Sears Canada, for this weak domestic performance.Hanesbrands expects the fourth quarter to be impacted by additional marketing investments, the recently announced buyout of Alternative Apparel, and effects of Sears Canada’s bankruptcy. The company now projects revenues of $6.45 - $6.48 billion, compared with $6.45 - $6.55 billion expected earlier. Earnings are now expected to fall in a range of $1.93 - $1.95 per share, down from the previously announced range of $1.93 - $2.03.Estimate Revisions This is estimate revision snapshot is clearly less than ideal, but what is most concerning is that analysts seem to be recently cooling off on the company’s upcoming fiscal year. Based on management’s warning in November, we already knew that Q4 would be difficult—an extension of those challenges into 2018 is not a good sign.Other OptionsInterestingly, HBI’s “Textile – Apparel” industry is actually sitting in the top 31% of the Zacks Industry Rank right now. Investors looking for a stronger pick in this industry could look at stocks like Crocs, Inc. (CROX  -  Free Report), G-III Apparel (GIII  -  Free Report), and Perry Ellis International (PERY  -  Free Report), all of which currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want more analysis from this author?

357,HBI,"A prudent investment strategy not only means buying promising stocks, but also selling the ones that can dent your portfolio. Unfortunately, Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) has been facing multiple challenges from rising competition and evolving trends in the apparel space and is a risky bet.Notably, shares of this designer and manufacturer of apparel essentials for men, women and children have lost around 4.5% in the past year compared with the industry’s rally of 10.2%. In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock tumbled nearly 9.7%.What’s Troubling Hanesbrands?Hanesbrands has been struggling against weak domestic performance, due to soft store traffic and a tough retail landscape.

Prior to this, sales for the segment fell 2.5% in the second quarter of 2017, 6% in the first quarter of 2017 and 8% in the fourth quarter of 2016.Notably, the Intimate Apparel/Innerwear industry is highly competitive and extremely price sensitive. Hence, the company’s ongoing strategy to focus more on premium brands and increase prices in these categories comes with the inherent risk of consumers shifting to other competitively-priced brands, offered by competitors.  This may, in turn, hurt Hanesbrands’ market share along with profits.Moreover, to add to investor’s disappointment in the stock, management continues to expect effects of the aforementioned adverse environment conditions and a difficult retail sales environment to linger in 2017.

358,HBI,"There seems to be a lot of cheer in the Textile-Apparel industry with many companies putting up a stellar show — driven by favorable economic indicators and strategic growth endeavors. Ranked among the top 13% out of more than 250 Zacks industries, the industry has gained 11.1% in the past three months.On the contrary, we have Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) which has lost 10.8% in the same time frame, thereby being a drag on the otherwise buoyant space. Notably, other players like Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report), Lululemon Athletica (LULU  -  Free Report) and PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) have contributed to the industry’s rally, keeping pace with the evolving consumer trends, international expansion and brand enhancement efforts. While all these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Hanesbrands carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So, let’s delve deeper into the factors that have caused Hanesbrands to be the odd one out and see if there’s any scope for turnaround.Why is Hanesbrands the Odd One Out?Hanesbrands has been struggling with its domestic performance, owing to soft store traffic and a tough retail landscape. Evidently, these headwinds hurt the company’s back-to-school selling season performance, which along with the U.S. hurricanes and earthquake in Mexico have affected the company in third-quarter 2017.Apart from this, Hanesbrands is also battling soft sales at its Innerwear segment for quite some time now on account of soft brick-and-mortar performance stemming from sluggish traffic. In the third quarter, sales at this unit declined 5.2% to $644.1 million as the apparel category bore the brunt of a tough back-to-school retail landscape. Prior to this, sales for the segment fell 2.5% in the second quarter of 2017, 6% in the first quarter of 2017 and 8% in the fourth quarter of 2016.Well, the Intimate Apparel/Innerwear industry is highly competitive and extremely price sensitive. Therefore, the company’s strategy to focus more on premium brands and increase prices in these categories come with the inherent risk of consumers shifting to more competitively-priced brands. This, in turn, is a threat to Hanesbrands’ market share.Unfortunately, management expects the effect of the aforementioned natural disasters and a difficult retail sales environment to linger in 2017 as well. Moreover, it anticipates the fourth quarter to be impacted by additional marketing investments to capture market share, the recently announced Alternative Apparel buyout and effects of Sears Canada bankruptcy.Considering all the above factors, Hanesbrands had lowered the upper end of its sales and earnings guidance for 2017 during the third quarter earnings announcement. The company now projects net sales in the band of $6.45-$6.48 billion and adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the $1.93-$1.95 per share range.  Consequently, estimates for the fourth quarter and 2017 have moved south by a notch to 52 cents and $1.94, respectively, since the earnings announcement.Any Scope for Revival Ahead?Nevertheless, Hanesbrands’ international segment has been gaining from its focus on acquisitions, particularly Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia. On a currency-neutral basis, sales at the International segment jumped 14% in the third quarter, wherein Hanesbrands posted organic sales growth for the first time in eight quarters. Apart from the aforementioned factors, extensive online sales growth also bolstered sales improvement at the segment. Going forward, management expects organic sales growth to remain positive as it anticipates the fourth quarter to mark another quarter of organic sales growth.While these factors and cost savings from Project Booster make us hopeful about Hanesbrands’ revival prospects, it remains to be seen if these drivers can actually place the company in tandem with the other industry gainers.  Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius. Click for details >>

However, Hanesbrands domestic operations have been soft owing to a tough retail landscape.Let’s now delve into the factors impacting Hanesbrands performance of late.International Business Aids Organic Sales After reporting bleak performance for eight straight quarters, Hanesbrands posted organic sales growth for the first time during third-quarter 2017. The upside can be attributed to solid International sales, which represented nearly 31% of the top line. Extensive growth in online sales contributed toward the international segment’s performance. Moreover, management expects organic sales to continue gaining from international business in the upcoming periods.Strategic Acquisitions & e-commerce Bode Well Hanesbrands undertakes strategic acquisitions to strengthen portfolio and increase infrastructural capabilities. The company has been gaining from the buyouts of Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia. In October, the company announced the buyout of Alternative Apparel which is expected to generate net sales of roughly $70 million in 2017 and boost the Activewear business.Apart from strategic takeovers, Hanesbrands also relies on online business to drive top-line performance. The company’s online sales were impressive during third-quarter 2017, as sales growth from global online channels was in the high 20s range. Going ahead, Hanesbrands is focused on making incremental investments in online business to keep up with consumers’ evolving shopping patterns.Factors Denting Performance Recently, Hanesbrands performance in the United States has been dismal owing to a tough retail landscape and adverse weather conditions. Further, increased marketing investments in the region may also hamper the company’s profits.  Apart from this, the company has also been facing troubles in innerwear segment due to intense competition and soft brick-and-mortar performance.

363,HBI,"(0:30) - Berkshire Hathaway Buys Pilot Flying J(2:40) - 3 Lessons To Learn From Warren Buffett's Recent Interview(8:00) - Tracey's Top Stock Picks(15:45) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome to Episode #62 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.Warren Buffett was recently giving television interviews because Berkshire Hathaway bought a 38.6% stake in Pilot Flying J travel centers, which is the largest travel center company in North America, with 750 locations and 27,000 employees.When you heard the news, you might have been thinking, “travel centers? That’s so boring.”After all, this is a world filled with electric cars, 1-hour home delivery, ride-sharing, Airbnb, AI and social media.What are the lessons value investors can learn from what Warren Buffett is buying?3 Investing Lessons Learned from Warren Buffett1.     Boring is beautiful. Sometimes the “ho-hum” companies are what turn out to be the cash-generating superstars. Take Pilot Flying J, for instance. It’s not just a travel center, but it also operates 279 restaurants making it the 10th largest restaurant franchise in America.2.    Buy companies that are profitable. Sounds simple, right? But many don’t do it.3.    Buy building block companies. Buffett likes to buy companies that operate in the shadows that few people give a second thought to. Travel centers is one of those. A railroad is another.Tracey thought about these lessons and then wondered, what stocks fit into these parameters right now?There’s not really a screen for stocks Warren Buffett would like that are building block companies, profitable and boring.But she did find 5 stocks that have Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong  Buy), #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold) that fit into the parameters. Not all are classic value stocks, however, but they each fit into Buffett’s lessons.5 Stocks That Are Buffett-Like1.     Parker Hannifin (PH  -  Free Report) has been in business 100 years.

It has a 30 billion market cap and pays a dividend yielding 2.5%.3.    Casey’s General Stores (CASY  -  Free Report) operates small town convenience stores that sell gas and food in the Midwest. Because it operates in towns under 5,000, it often is the only pizza provider in town. As a result, it’s now the 5th largest pizza chain in the country.4.    Hanesbrands, Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) has been in business 116 years. It makes basic apparel such as bras, socks and underwear. It has a forward P/E of just 12.5.    Ryder System (R  -  Free Report) operates one of North America’s largest truck fleets.

364,HBI,"HanesBrands (HBI  -  Free Report) has recently appointed a new chief financial officer, Barry A. Hytinen, who will succeed Richard D. Moss, effective Oct 16, 2017. Notably, the existing chief financial officer, Richard D. Moss, who has served HanesBrands for 12 years, will cater to the company as an advisory officer until he retires at the end of 2017.Before joining HanesBrands, Hytinen was working in Tempur Sealy International, Inc. (TPX  -  Free Report) — a publicly traded bedding manufacturer — as a chief financial officer. Prior to this, Hytinen has also served Fogbreak Software, which is a venture-backed software company.With around 20 years of experience in financial matters, we believe his significant skills will aid HanesBrands to gain competitive advantage in various areas along with capitalizing on growth opportunities.HanesBrands’ PerformanceArmed with a well-managed brands’ portfolio, HanesBrands has been gaining from its Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia buyouts. Additionally, the company’s e-commerce platform has been reaping benefits from growing popularity of online shopping. Furthermore, management has been focusing on supply chain optimization and investing in domestic distribution center network.Meanwhile, the company has also been benefiting from sequential rise in organic sales. Also, the Project Booster cost savings along with working capital initiatives are estimated to produce an additional annual run rate of $300 million of cash from operations by the end of 2019.Consequently, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have rallied 18.3% in the last six months, faring better than the Zacks Textile - Apparel industry’s gain of 5.4%. Currently, the industry is placed at the top 30% of the Zacks classified industries (76 out of 256). However, HanesBrands’ top line has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six of the past seven quarters, probably due to soft sales at its brick-and-mortar stores. The company also expects back-to-school shipments to fall in the third quarter. Further HanesBrands’ performance is challenged by currency fluctuations and low international penetration.We expect the new chief financial officer to focus more on the company’s strategic efforts to lift HanesBrands’ performance to become investors’ favorite.Two Stocks to Steal the ShowSome better-ranked stocks in the same industry are Crocs, Inc. (CROX  -  Free Report) and G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (GIII  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The year-over-year increase was driven by acquisition related synergies that contributed approximately $220 million in net sales. The benefits from acquisitions were mainly related to Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia that had been completed in 2016. Sales from online channel globally increased 25%. Online sales mainly benefitted from an increase of 7% in Global Champion Activewear.However, the quarter witnessed a decline of 3% in organic sales owing to lower sales in Innerwear, domestic manage-for-cash businesses and the timing shift of sports apparel sales to the third quarter. Although organic sales had decreased, it was narrower than the decline of 4% and 5% during the first quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.Hanesbrands' adjusted gross profit improved 16% to $646 million on the back of higher sales.

Operating profit declined 7.6% to $164.3 million owing to Project Booster expenses and lower sales. Activewear: Sales rose 1% to $379.6 million owing to acquisition related benefits, growth from Hanes retail and online channels.

366,HBI,"Shares of Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) have rallied 25% over the past month, outperforming the industry’s gain of 15%. The company, which has been gaining from its international strength, strong online business and impressive organic sales, has rallied 19.1% since the release of first-quarter 2018 results.During the first quarter, Hanesbrands continued with its organic sales growth, which helped fuel the company’s overall top line. Organic sales climbed 1% on a currency-neutral basis, thereby marking Hanesbrands’ third straight quarter of organic sales increase.Organic sales were fueled by better-than-expected Champion sales across all regions, including solid online sales. In 2018, organic sales growth is still envisioned to be roughly 1% on a constant currency basis.Also, the company has long been gaining from solid performance of its international segment that constituted nearly 39% of the company’s net sales in the first quarter. Sales for the segment improved 19.4% to $569.9 million, backed by favorable currency movements, acquisition synergies (including old and latest buyout of Bras N Things) and organic growth.Moreover, organic consumer-directed sales ascended 22% and represented about 28% of International sales. Hence, management remains focused on making investments and innovations.Hanesbrands is also expected to keep riding on benefits from acquisitions, which remains one of its core strategies for long-term growth. To this end, Hanesbrands acquired Alternative Apparel last year, which witnessed sales growth of 8% in the first quarter. Also, the company bought Bras N Things recently, and is on track with its integration. Markedly, contributions from acquisitions (Bras N Things and Alternative Apparel) played a solid role in augmenting Hanesbrands’ first-quarter sales. Evidently, acquisitions contributed $32 million to the top line. Apart from this, the company has largely been gaining from contributions from Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia that were acquired in 2016.However, the company is battling raw material inflation, which hurt the company’s margins in the first quarter of 2018. During the quarter, the company was hit by raw material inflation to the tune of about $14 million. Unfortunately, management expects these hurdles to persist in 2018. It presumes higher commodity and marketing expenses this year. These factors remain a threat for margins.Apart from this, the company has been struggling soft sales at its Innerwear segment for quite some time now. Nevertheless, we expect the aforementioned growth drivers along with strong online sales and Hanesbrands’ Project Booster program to offset these hurdles. Incidentally, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company launched the multiyear Project Booster program in the first quarter of 2017 to drive investment for growth, minimize costs and increase cash flow.This program, which is well-positioned for the next five years, is likely to boost the company’s Sell More, Spend Less, Generate Cash strategy for additional gains. By 2019, this project is anticipated to produce nearly $150 million of annualized cost savings, out of which roughly $50 million will be reinvested in targeted growth opportunities. The company is progressing well with its Project Booster plan, which should help it achieve margin expansion in the second half of 2018.Looking for More Apparel Stocks?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the second quarter and the fiscal 2017 have remained stable over the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53 cents in the said quarter reflects a year-over-year growth of 3.4% and is also within the management’s guided range of 51–54 cents of adjusted earnings. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 for fiscal 2017 reflects year-over-year growth of 6.7%.Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.65 billion for the quarter under review, an increase of 11.7% from the year-ago period.  The same for fiscal 2017 is pegged at $6.5 billion.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hanesbrands is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Hanesbrands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hanesbrands Inc.

Such factors have been pulling down the stocks of the company. Its shares have underperformed the broader Consumer Discretionary sector over the past one year.  In the said time frame, Hanesbrands’ shares have declined 10.3% while the sector depicted  growth of 16.9%. Although the company’s recently launched Project Booster Program is expected to drive investment for growth and minimize costs, benefits from the same are not anticipated in the near term.Still Interested in Consumer Discretionary Stocks?

368,HBI,"Retailers are helping the market get back some of yesterday's losses, including today's Zacks #1 Rank top performer Jones Apparel Group, Inc. (JNY), which is chiming in with a double-digit advance.   
"
369,HBI,"Shares of the apparel, footwear and accessories retailer are up more than 10% on Thursday afternoon with volume at about 1.5 million. The company's average daily volume is in the neighborhood of 2.35 million.   
"
370,HBI,"Earnings estimates are moving in the right direction for JNY, which is understandable since the company has put together an impressive streak of meeting or beating Wall Street's quarterly expectations.  
"
371,HBI,"Most recently, JNY earned 28 cents per share, excluding items, in its first quarter. The result fell short of the year-ago performance of 37 cents, which isn't a surprise given the difficult environment. More importantly though, EPS was able to easily surpass the consensus of 10 cents by 180%.  
"
372,HBI,"Including that healthy difference, JNY has now put together an average surprise of 71% over the past 4 quarters.   
"
373,HBI,"Revenues declined 8.6% to $891 million from $975 million. However, its wholesale jeanswear was a bright spot with revenues that advanced 3.4%.  
"
374,HBI,"JNY stated that it was ""satisfied"" with its first-quarter results in this difficult environment, and analysts seem to share that assessment. Earnings estimates for this year are up almost 49% over the past month to 58 cents, as 6 out of 8 covering analysts revised higher.  
"
375,HBI,"More of the same for next year as expectations have climbed 51% to 74 cents on the back of 4 out of 6 analysts. Furthermore, this data suggests that next year's profit would jump by more than 27% from this year.  
"
376,HBI,"JNY is part of the Textile-Apparel industry. On today's 227-stock Zacks #1 Rank List, the only other company from that industry is Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report). 
"
377,HBI,"The Q1 earnings season has crossed the halfway mark, with earnings and revenue growth well on track to mark the highest in seven years.However, two factors are dampening the optimism for this reporting cycle. First, estimates for the quarter under review have remained stagnant, as was the case at the start of the season. Second, though the positive surprises are trending beyond historical levels, they have so far failed to beat the previous earnings cycle, especially with respect to revenue surprises.Per Earnings Preview dated Apr 27, the total earnings for the S&P 500 index in the first quarter are projected to improve 22.6% year over year on revenue growth of 8.4%. In fourth-quarter 2017, earnings and revenues have increased 13.4% and 8.6%, respectively.The first-quarter 2018 earnings season has seen releases from nearly 267 S&P 500 members as of Apr 27. Per the latest report, the scenario looks compelling, with 76.8% of the members delivering positive earnings surprises and 73.8% trumping top-line expectations. In fact, the proportion of companies pulling off earnings and revenue beats is a stellar 61.4%. Also, earnings for the companies that have reported their financial numbers advanced 25.1% from the year-ago period, with revenues up 10%.The performance of the index is not restricted to a single sector, and of the 16 Zacks sectors, only the Autos space is expected to witness an earnings decline in the reporting season. While textile-apparel stocks like — Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) and Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) — form part of Consumer Discretionary sector, Tapestry, Inc. (TPR  -  Free Report) belongs to Retail/Wholesale sector.According to the above report, total quarterly earnings for the Consumer Discretionary sector are likely to grow 12.1% year over year, with revenues expected to increase 6.6%. In fact, margins are also estimated to edge up 0.6% year over year. This bullish projection can be attributed to gain from a buoyant U.S. economy characterized by rising consumer confidence, improving consumer spending and an accelerating labor market.Meanwhile, Retail/Wholesale sector has long been witnessing an evolving environment where retailers are adhering to various omni-channel techniques for providing a seamless shopping experience. Impressively, total earnings for the sector are likely to increase 17.8% year over year in Q1, courtesy of revenues growth of 7.8%. The sector’s margins are also expected move up 0.4% year over year.Our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock is combined with a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.All said, let’s find out where Under Armour, Hanesbrands and Tapestry stand ahead of their earnings releases on May 1.Key Predictions for UAA and HBI Under Armour has pulled off a positive earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 10.2%. However, the company missed the earnings estimate in the last reported quarter. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter of 2018 is pegged at a loss of 5 cents, wider than the loss of a penny reported a year ago. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.12 billion, almost flat with the year-ago quarter figure. Per management, revenues are likely to decline or remain flat year over year in Q1. Also, it envisions loss per share in the range 6-7 cents due to adjusted operating loss of nearly $15 million.Under Armour, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Under Armour, Inc.

However, sustained focus on brand development, restructuring plans, expansion of direct-to-consumer and technology-based fitness businesses remain encouraging.

378,HBI,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 3.3% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is HBI due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Hanesbrands Q1 Earnings & Sales Beat EstimatesHanesbrands released first-quarter 2018 results, wherein the company posted adjusted earnings of 26 cents a share that came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents, while tumbling 10.3% year over year. Nevertheless, adjusted earnings came ahead of management’s guided range of 23-25 cents. On a GAAP basis, earnings from continuing operations jumped 16% to 22 cents per share. The year-over-year earnings comparison was impacted by greater corporate tax rate in 2018, stemming from recent tax reforms.Net sales rose 6.6% to $1,471.5 million and also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,431 million. This marked Hanesbrands’ second consecutive sales beat. Sales growth was driven by contributions from acquisitions (Bras N Things and Alternative Apparel) as well as solid organic sales, which in turn was backed by solid customer base. This in turn compensated for the softness in U.S. brick-and-mortar channel. Acquisitions contributed $32 million to the top line.Organic sales climbed 1% on a currency-neutral basis, following an increase of 3% in the previous quarter. However, this marked Hanesbrands’ third straight quarter of organic sales increase. Organic sales were fueled by better-than-expected Champion sales across all regions as well as solid online sales. Notably, Global Champion sales soared 22% year over year, while it increased 17% on a currency-neutral basis.Further, the company’s Global consumer-directed sales (including retail and online networks) jumped 23% year over year and formed 21% of its overall sales. Delving deeper, we note that retail sales grew 24%, whereas online sales saw a surge of 20% — courtesy of growth across all regions.Hanesbrands' adjusted gross profit improved 6.2% to $589.7 million, while the adjusted gross margin fell 10 bps to 40.1%. Adjusted operating profit grew 0.5% to $165.7 million in the reported quarter, with the margin contracting 60 bps to 11.3%. This stemmed from escalated SG&A costs (also as a percentage of sales). Also, management stated that operating profit improvements in the International region was countered by softness in U.S. operating profit.Segment DetailsInnerwear: Sales fell 2.8% in the quarter to $491.1 million owing to softness across both Innerwear Basics and Innerwear Intimates. Operating profit tumbled 13% to $101.4 million on account of soft volumes and raw material inflation.Activewear: Sales advanced 5.7% to $346.1 million, while organic sales rose 1%. Sales were backed by gains from Alternative Apparel’s buyout. Champion sales remained robust, as it jumped at a high-single-digit rate. Online channel sales surged 26% during the quarter. Operating profits slumped 11.7% to $38.3 million accountable to raw-material inflation and escalated distribution expenses.International: Sales for the segment improved 19.4% to $569.9 million, backed by favorable currency movements, acquisition synergies (including old and latest buyout of Bras N Things) and organic growth. Organic sales jumped 7% on a currency-neutral basis, on the back of a double-digit growth in Champion sales across Europe and Asia. Organic consumer-directed sales ascended 22% and represented about 28% of International sales. Operating profit at this segment soared 46.3% to $77.1 million in the quarter.Other: Sales declined 8.5% to roughly $64.4 million in the quarter. The segment posted an operating profit of $2.6 million, almost flat year over year.Other Financial DetailsThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $373.7 million, long-term debt of $4,185.3 million and equity of $705.7 million. Hanesbrands used $128.1 million in net cash from operations during the first quarter of 2018, in comparison to using $22.8 million reported in the prior-year period.In the first quarter, the company paid dividends worth nearly $54 million.  GuidanceHanesbrands remains impressed with its first-quarter show and expects organic sales to grow year over year in 2018, backed by strength in online, global Champion, and International sales. However, the company remains cautious about a challenging consumer environment and brick-and-mortar store closures. It also expects witnessing higher commodity and marketing expenses to support innovations.All said, Hanesbrands retained its outlook for 2018, alongside providing a fresh view for the second quarter.For 2018, management still projects net sales in the band of $6.72 million to $6.82 billion. Adjusted operating profit is expected to range between $950 million and $985 million. Effective tax-rate for 2018 is projected to be toughly 16%.Further, it continues to envision adjusted earnings in the range of $1.72-$1.80 per share. The company’s GAAP EPS is projected in the band of $1.54 to $1.62.

379,HBI,"Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) has been facing multiple challenges from rising competition and evolving trends in the apparel space. This has dampened investors’ sentiments, which is evident from the stock’s 10.2% decline against the industry’s rally of 26.1%. In fact, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company hit a 52-week low of $17.94 during the trading session on Apr 2, eventually closing at $18.18.On the flip side, other players like Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report), Lululemon Athletica (LULU  -  Free Report) and PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) have been delivering stellar performance and contributing toward the industry’s rally on the back of well-chalked strategies to stay competitive.  Let’s take a closer look at the factors that have made Hanesbrands the odd pick and see if there’s any scope for a turnaround.What’s Pulling Hanesbrands?After posting in-line earnings in the preceding two quarters, the company succumbed to a negative surprise in the fourth quarter of 2017. Moreover, earnings fell year over year, thanks to higher cost of sales and higher SG&A expenses as well as interest expense. An improvement in the top line failed to cushion the downtrend. Further, adjusted operating profit slipped 7.7% with the operating margin contracting 180 bps, due to higher SG&A expenses.  Apart from this, we note that the Intimate Apparel/Innerwear industry is highly competitive and price sensitive. The company’s strategy to focus more on premium brands and hike prices in these categories come with the inherent risk of consumers shifting to more competitively-priced brands offered by competitors. Thus, failure to offer high-quality distinguished products at competitive price may hamper Hanesbrands’ market share, resulting in lower earnings and sales.Moreover, to add to investor’s disappointment, management continues to be cautious about 2018, given a challenging U.S. wholesale landscape. Also, rising input costs and increased marketing investments to support new innovations are likely to affect margins. Incidentally, management expects operating margin for the first half of 2018 to be hurt by escalated marketing and distribution costs.  Any Hopes of a Turnaround?We are hopeful about the company’s focus on buyouts, evident from its recent acquisition of Bras N Things that is likely to augment earnings in 2018. In this regard, the company has been gaining from contributions from Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia that were acquired in 2016.Additionally, the company has long been benefitting from the solid performance of its international segment, driven by store openings, robust consumer demand and extensive online sales. Moreover, management is focused on making investments and innovations, internationally, to sustain growth in this segment. Also, Hanesbrands’ organic sales growth during the fourth quarter has been encouraging. For 2018, the company projects organic sales growth at roughly 1% on a constant-currency basis.While the aforementioned factors make us hopeful about Hanesbrands’ revival, it is to be seen if these drivers can actually place the company in tandem with other industry gainers.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

380,HBI,"Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 results wherein both top and bottom lines grew year over year. Moreover, the company posted organic sales growth for the first time in eight quarters, thanks to robust International sales growth. Domestic sales, on the other hand remained soft on account of a tough back-to-school selling season. While earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, sales missed the same. Also, management provided a bleak outlook, which weighed upon investors’ sentiment.Evidently, shares of Hanesbrands dropped 4.6% during yesterday’s after-market trading hours. This took Hanesbrands’ past three months performance to a decline of 7.1%, wider than the industry’s dip of 1.5%.Q3 HighlightsThe company posted adjusted earnings of 60 cents, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while it jumped 7.1% year over year. Including pre-tax acquisition and integration charges, earnings came in at 55 cents, depicting an increase of 22% from the year-ago period.Hanesbrands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Hanesbrands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hanesbrands Inc. QuoteNet sales of $1,799.3 million climbed 2.2% from the year-ago period, though it fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,805 million. The year-over-year upside was backed by double-digit sales growth at the company’s International region, somewhat offset by soft domestic sales that stemmed from weak apparel sales in the back-to-school selling season.Notably, the quarter witnessed a rise in organic sales (on a reported and currency neutral basis) on the back of solid International sales that represented nearly 31% of the company’s top line. This, in turn was backed by strength in Hanes Europe Innerwear; Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia, with global Champion sales growing 16% in the quarter. Clearly, the company is benefiting from its geographic expansion and acquisition related synergies.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s online sales also remained strong in the quarter, as sales growth from global online channels remained in the high 20s range. Notably, online sales formed about 9% of the company’s total sales, driven by growth across all regions and product categories.Hanesbrands' adjusted gross profit improved 2.7% to $680.7 million on the back of higher sales. Adjusted gross margin expanded 20 basis points (bps) to 37.8%. However, adjusted operating profit slipped 0.3% to $270.2 million in the reported quarter, with the operating margin contracting 40 bps to 15%. This stemmed from escalated SG&A costs (also as a percentage of sales).Segment DetailsInnerwear: Sales declined 5.2% in the quarter to $644.1 million, as the apparel category bore the brunt of a tough back-to-school retail landscape. Sales for the segment have been declining for a while now, as it fell 2.5%, 6% and 8% in the preceding three quarters, respectively. Operating profit also dropped 4.7% to $141 million owing to lower sales. Nonetheless, the company retained its market share in the basics category and online Innerwear sales surged more than 20% in the quarter.Activewear: Sales inched up 0.5% to $519.5 million, as contributions from GTM Sportswear’s buyout and online sales growth of more than 30% offset the adverse impact from a subdued back-to-school season.  Also, sales from the Champion brand rose by double-digits in the midtier, college bookstore and sporting goods networks. Operating profits jumped 8.3% to $79 million, buoyed by higher sales and savings from Project Booster.International: The third-quarter sales for the segment improved 16.4% to $556.7 million, while currency neutral sales grew 14%. The growth was driven by strong Champion sales in Asia and Europe, along with intimate apparel and underwear sales growth in Latin America and Australia. Moreover, extensive online sales growth bolstered sales improvement at the segment. Notably, operating profit surged 25% (up 23% on a currency neutral basis) in the quarter.Other: Sales declined 9.3% to roughly $79 million in the quarter. The segment posted an operating profit of $10.2 million, up 10.5% year over year.Other Financial DetailsHanesbrands ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $400 million, long-term debt of $3,566.5 million and equity of $1,231.2 million. Net cash from operations during the first three quarters amounted $331.1 million. This marked a 59% jump from the year-ago period, thanks to working capital improvement initiatives.The company paid dividends of $165.2 million, while it repurchased shares worth roughly $300 million during the first three quarters of 2017.2017 GuidanceHanesbrands remains optimistic about its organic sales growth in the fourth quarter. The company also remains impressed with the benefits from buyouts and its efforts to keep pace with the evolving consumer environment. However, management expects the fourth quarter to be impacted by additional marketing investments; the recently announced buyout of Alternative Apparel and effects of Sears Canada bankruptcy. Considering all factors, the company lowered the upper end of its sales and earnings guidance for 2017.Hanesbrands now projects net sales in the band of $6.45-$6.48 billion, compared with $6.45-$6.55 billion expected earlier. Further, it now envisions adjusted earnings from continuing operations in a range of $1.93-$1.95 per share, compared with $1.93-$2.03 guided earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is currently pegged higher than the projected range, at $1.99.The company’s GAAP EPS for continuing operations is now projected in the band of $1.68-$1.70, compared with $1.70-$1.82 forecasted earlier.Net cash from operations is now anticipated to be in line with or surpass the mid-point of its previously projected band of $625-$725 million.The company expects to incur around $95 million as pre-tax charges associated with Alternative Apparel’s acquisition and integration. It also envisions capital expenditures of approximately $90 million, while interest and other costs are expected to amount to $180 million on a combined basis. Management now expects synergy cost benefits of more than $20 million as in 2017, compared with $15 million anticipated earlier.Q4 OutlookFor the fourth quarter, management projects total net sales in a band of $1.63-$1.65 billion, with the mid-point depicting an increase of nearly 3% on an organic basis. This outlook is based on a conservative view for the U.S. sales landscape; sales of roughly $15 million expected from Alternative Apparel and negative effects from Sears Canada bankruptcy. Adjusted earnings are envisioned in a band of 51-53 cents, while GAAP earnings per share are projected to range from 47-49 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is currently pegged quite higher, at 57 cents.The earnings estimate (both GAAP and adjusted) includes 5 cents from higher marketing investment, greater mix of International sales and the expected adverse impact from Sears Canada bankruptcy somewhat negated by greater-than-expected buyout synergies.   Looking for More?

381,HBI,"Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this apparel manufacturer and designer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company has a very mixed record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Hanesbrands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Hanesbrands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hanesbrands Inc. QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 61 cents, which reflects year-over-year growth of 8.9%. Also, the earnings estimate has trended upward in the last seven days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,806 million, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayHanesbrands reported preliminary numbers for third-quarter 2017 last week, when it also announced the buyout of Alternative Apparel. Hanesbrands further stated that it anticipates net sales for the quarter to come in at roughly $1.8 billion, which marks a year-over-year increase of 2.5%. Also, the bottom line is envisioned to be approximately 60 cents per share, showing growth of 7.1% from the prior-year period. These projections fall within management’s previously guided range. Notably, both top and bottom lines for the quarter are likely to be fueled by robust growth at the company’s international segment. Also, management earlier predicted more back-to-school shipments to fall in the third quarter versus a year ago, which should lead to higher sales.A Look Back at Q2 & Estimates for Q3Well, the international segment largely drove Hanesbrands’ results in the last quarter, which broke the company’s negative sales surprise trend of five quarters. During the quarter, both sales and earnings jumped year over year, mainly backed by acquisition related synergies. The benefits from acquisitions were mainly related to Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia that had been completed in 2016. Moreover, sales from online channel globally increased 25%, majorly benefitting from strength in Global Champion Activewear.Looking at segments, the international segment witnessed a substantial 76% surge in sales that came in at $475.2 million. The growth was primarily driven by acquisitions and strong results in Asia. In fact, European acquisition synergies led to a 152% increase in the operating profit of the segment. Turning to the Activewear segment, sales climbed 1% to $379.6 million, though the operating profit tumbled 10% due to higher Project Booster expense and retailer bankruptcies. In fact, Project Booster expenses also marred operating profit at the Innerwear segment, wherein sales declined 2.5% to $719 million. Nevertheless, the rate of sales decline decelerated from the previous two quarters.Clearly, the international segment appears to be the driving factor for Hanesbrands’ top and bottom lines in the quarter to be reported. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for international revenues is currently pegged at $502 million for third-quarter 2017, showing a 5% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus estimates for Activewear and Innerwear revenues are pegged at $530 million and $689 million, reflecting year-over-year advancements of 3.7% and 0.1% respectively.Possible DeterrentsWhile online sales grew year over year, it only formed 9% of the company’s total sales. Thus, the company still generates a major chunk of sales from brick-and-mortar operations, which have been pressurized owing to an evolving retail landscape. Also, the retail landscape has been highly competitive and promotional, which may also weigh upon Hanesbrands’ performance. Some analysts also perceive the company’s North American operations to be troubled, on account of such headwinds. However, we expect growth in the international segment, benefits from buyouts and focus on Project Booster to drive Hanesbrands’ performance this quarter. Notably, the company’s shares have gained 7.7% year to date, surpassing the industry’s rise of 4.6%.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hanesbrandsis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

382,HBI,"American consumers are gaining confidence in the economy. Consumer confidence crushed expectations and soared to the highest level in October since 2004.  A decline in gas prices, record low jobless rate and series of highs for the stock market buoyed optimism on household finances and the economy.The economic expansion, after eight years, is finally noticeable. The U.S. economy has started to expand close to the range expected by President Trump and some other Republicans, while both manufacturing and service sectors accelerated at a record pace last month.Since Americans gained optimism on the economy, things have been looking up for consumer stocks. Stocks of consumer discretionary companies are poised to grow on the signs of renewed consumer spending strength.Confidence in American Economy Highest in 13 YearsAccording to the University of Michigan, the U.S. consumer sentiment index touched 101.1 in October, up from 95.1 in September. The key economic indicator that measure attitudes on future economic prospects reached its highest level since 2004.Americans think the economic scenario right now is “as good as it gets”. There were big gains in both the index for present economic conditions and consumer expectations. The index for current economic conditions rose to 116.4 from 111.7, while the index of consumer expectations increased to 91.3 from 84.4.Here’s how all the three major indices performed on a year-over-year (Y-Y) basis:IndexesOct 2017Oct 2016Y-Y ChangeIndex of Consumer Sentiment101.187.2+15.9%Current Economic Conditions116.4103.2+12.8%Index of Consumer Expectations91.376.8+18.9%(Source: University of Michigan)What Drove the Confidence?Household optimism was largely driven by falling gas prices, labor market health and the U.S. stock market’s record-breaking run.  The average price of a gallon dropped by 43 cents over the last five weeks after it had climbed after Hurricane Harvey impacted the Gulf Coast refinery outlets.A clearer view of last month’s labor market data, in fact, showed that keeping the effects of the hurricane aside, the U.S. employment scenario is continuing to tighten. The unemployment rate declined to 4.2%, the lowest since February 2001 and wages increased 0.5% to an average of $26.55 an hour, per the Labor Department data. In fact, in the last 12 months, hourly pay increased 2.9%, up from 2.7% in the prior month and also in line with a post-recession high.U.S. stocks, in the meanwhile, continue to extend their winning streak, with the Dow and the S&P 500 rising for five straight weeks. So, what has driven the indices higher? Investors cheered the first step toward enacting major tax reforms later this year after the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives approved a 2018 budget resolution.The House of Representatives, led by Speaker Paul Ryan, passed a $4.1-trillion budget legislation that paved the way for them to rewrite the much-awaited tax code later this year. The budget aims to repeal Obamacare and also contains $1.1 trillion in non-entitlement outlays, including nearly $622 billion for defense. The far-reaching plan will trim taxes for corporates as well, which will offset the revenue loss and not add to national debt that is now above $20 trillion.Solid second-quarter earnings also provided a fillip to the U.S. equity market despite political turmoil, both at home and abroad. Meanwhile, a similar shot in the arm is expected in the third-quarter earnings season (read more: Q3 Earnings to Work Magic for Wall Street: Top 5 Picks).Why Does Consumer Confidence Matter?Such a record consumer confidence number is a significant reading since it has been, historically, good at predicting consumer spending for the next three to six months. More the confidence households generate, the more will they spend. Notably, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of the U.S. economy, which isn’t a petty number.These numbers influence companies’ production schedule, particularly big-ticket items like cars, appliances, etc. In fact, the consumer discretionary sector is mostly affected as spending plays a major role in determining revenues. Automobile stocks often track these numbers and so do appliance manufacturers, retailers, consumer discretionary manufacturers, big-ticket entertainment providers, jewelry retailers and cruise line operators, to name a few.5 Stocks to Gain as Consumers Gain ConfidenceSince the aforementioned sector is positioned to benefit from this stellar reading on confidence level, picking stocks from the same will be a smart move. We have, thus, selected five consumer discretionary stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Such stocks also boast of a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.Guess’, Inc.

These benefits were mainly related to Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia that had been completed in 2016. Also, during the first quarter, buyouts contributed approximately $210 million toward net sales.

By 2019, this project is anticipated to produce nearly $150 million of annualized cost savings, out of which roughly $50 million will be reinvested in targeted growth opportunities. Notably, this reinvestment should generate approximately $100 million in a run rate of net annualized savings that will begin by the end of 2019.Also, the Innovate-to-Elevate strategy (which focuses on value-added, higher-priced and high-margin items that can be supplied at lower costs) continues to drive the company’s adjusted operating profit margin and generate significant cumulative cash from operations.Bottom Line Hanesbrands’ organic sales have been declining at a decelerating rate and are expected to turn positive in the second half of the year.

The year-over-year increase was driven by acquisition related synergies that contributed approximately $220 million in net sales. The benefits from acquisitions were mainly related to Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia that had been completed in 2016. Sales from online channel globally increased 25%. Online sales mainly benefitted from an increase of 7% in Global Champion Activewear.However, the quarter witnessed a decline of 3% in organic sales owing to lower sales in Innerwear, domestic manage-for-cash businesses and the timing shift of sports apparel sales to the third quarter. Although organic sales had decreased, it was narrower than the decline of 4% and 5% during the first quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.Hanesbrands' adjusted gross profit improved 16% to $646 million on the back of higher sales.

Operating profit declined 7.6% to $164.3 million owing to higher Project Booster expenses and lower sales. Activewear: Sales rose 1% to $379.6 million owing to acquisition related benefits, growth from Hanes retail and online channels.

386,HBI,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Hanesbrands has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.7x, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 19.8x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Hanesbrands’ current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 17.2x over the past five years. In fact, the current level stands closer to the lows for the stock, suggesting that it could be a solid entry point.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Computer Discretionary sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 23.4x. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Hanesbrands’ forward PE is roughly same as its trailing twelve months value, so we might say that the forward earnings estimates are incorporated in the company’s share price as of now. We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Hanesbrands has a P/S ratio of about 1.4x. This is way lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.1x right now. This makes the stock undervalued from this aspect too.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Hanesbrands currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Hanesbrands a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Hanesbrands is just 1.2, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1.4. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, HBI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?While Hanesbrands might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of C. This gives HBI a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen one estimate go lower in the past sixty days compared to no upward revisions, while the full year estimate has seen two upward and one downward revision in the same time period.This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has slipped by 1.6% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0.5%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Hanesbrands Inc. Price and Consensus  Hanesbrands Inc. Price and Consensus | Hanesbrands Inc. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineHanesbrands is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Despite a Zacks Rank #3, the company has a solid Zacks Industry Rank (Top 20% out of over 250 Zacks industries) which hints at favorable broader factors.So, value investors might want to wait for estimates to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

387,HBI,"Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) has been successful at boosting investor’s confidence with its well planned acquisitions, strong e-Commerce platform and its Project Booster Program to improve investments. Most importantly, acquisition related synergies contributed to the company’s recently reported second-quarter 2017 results. Evidently shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have surged 20% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 11.3%. Further, shares also depicted a 2.7% growth since the second-quarter results.Let’s now delve deeper into some of the factors that have been contributing towards the performance of Hanesbrands in the recent times.Acquisitions Driving Q2 Sales During the second quarter, net sales of $1.65 million grew 12% from the year-ago period and came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The year-over-year increase was driven by acquisition related synergies that contributed approximately $220 million in net sales.  The benefits from acquisitions were mainly related to Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia that had been completed in 2016. In effect of the top-line improvement, adjusted earnings also depicted a 4% rise from the prior-year quarter.Acquisitions and strong results in Asia and Europe were also seen to positively impact the company’s International Segment, which rose 76% during the second quarter.Sturdy Online Platform Customers are increasingly resorting to online shopping to save time. Hanesbrands is reallocating its personnel and marketing resources to capture this trend among consumers. The initiatives of the company in this respect also benefitted the company’s second-quarter results, wherein online channel sales increased 25%. The sales of Global Champion Activewear in the online segment were particularly strong during the second quarter season. Further, the management plans to utilize its size and scale to boost supply chain optimization along with the investment in its domestic distribution center network in order to cater to the online channel efficiently.Project Booster Program Hanesbrands launched a multiyear program in the first-quarter 2017 to drive investment for growth, minimize costs and increase cash flow. This program, which is well positioned for the next five years, is likely to boost the company’s Sell More Spend Less and Generate Cash strategy for additional gains, mainly from the global commercial and supply chain scale through acquisitions.By 2019, this project is anticipated to produce nearly $150 million of annualized cost savings, out of which roughly $50 million will be reinvested in targeted growth opportunities. Additionally, this program, including the headcount reductions, is anticipated to be cost neutral for 2017 and cost savings would mainly be realized in the second half of the year.Improvement in Organic SalesDespite a decline in organic sales, the company has witnessed its trends to improve sequentially. Organic sales decline of 3% during the second quarter was narrower than the decline of 4% and 5% during the first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. Moreover, the company continues to expect organic sales to turn positive and contribute to growth in the second half. Bottom-LineAlthough Hanesbrands’ strategic initiatives are worth applauding, its performance is exposed to certain headwinds such as the company’s over reliance on premium brands, soft sales in the brick-and-mortar stores as well as unfavorable foreign currency translations. However, Hanesbrands’ efforts are well placed to override these challenges and sustain the growth momentum.Moreover, the company has a long term growth rate of 10.7% and a VGM Score of ‘B’, indicating its inherent strength.Do Consumer Discretionary Stocks Interest you?

(HBI  -  Free Report) shares have been in a beautiful up trend for most of 2008, advancing from less than $22 in January to their current price of $35, an impressive short-term return of more than 50%. This surge comes after the company was spun-off from Sara Lee in 2006. Hanes has been aggressively pursuing cost cutting measures and paying down its debt in order to drive its profits, which were up 300% compared to last year in its most recently reported quarter.    
"
389,HBI,"Hanesbrands Inc. is a consumer goods company that specializes in the design, manufacturing and sale of apparel essentials for men, woman and children both domestically and internationally.  Hanesbrands carries a market cap. of $3.35 billion and is head-quartered in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. 
"
390,HBI,"Strong First-Quarter Results
"
391,HBI,"Hanes reported solid first-quarter results on Apr 21 in which is profit almost tripled from the same period last year. In spite of the fact that total sales were down 5% from last year, to $987.8 million, net income grew sharply, to $36 million, up from $12 million in the same period last year. International sales were up 15% due to the weaker dollar and currency translations.  
"
392,HBI,"Excluding one-time items, this produced earnings of 42 cents per share, well ahead of analysts estimates of 28 cents per share. Hanes has definitely developed a knack for surprising and beating analyst estimates, having done so by an average of seven cents, or 24.18% over the last four quarters. 
"
393,HBI,"Debt Reduction, Cost Savings
"
394,HBI,"The company said that it was able to drive its profits through cost reductions, noting that its cost of sales dropped to $643 million from $700 million last year. Chief Executive Richard Noll said, ""Clearly our strategy of spend less is working even in this challenging environment."" Hanes has also used $8.3 million to buy back some of its shares, at an average price of $24.69.
"
395,HBI,"Estimates Rising
"
396,HBI,"Hanes is operating in a fairly stable and mature market, which means its revenue and growth trajectory will be more tempered than younger companies in emerging markets. But none the less, analyst estimates are rising. Within the last 90 days, the current-year estimate has tacked on 29 cents, advancing to its current projection of $2.29 per share. 
"
397,HBI,"Based upon these earnings projections, share of HNI look attractively valued, carrying a P/E multiple of 15X, slightly below the overall market reading. 
"
398,HBI,"The Chart
"
399,HBI,"On the chart, the 52-week and all-time high just above $36 is the key level. Shares have traded above this area but have yet to log a higher close. The up trend that began early in the year is still very much in play and will continue to support prices in the upward ascent. Take a look at the chart below. 
"
400,HBI,"Every week, I usually either outline a unique way to screen for stocks or go over a proven, profitable trading strategy. 
"
401,HBI,"But this week, I'm starting at square one and going over why screening is so crucial. Even more importantly, though, I'll cover why backtesting is the most important step of all. Why Should I Use a Stock Screener?
"
402,HBI,"The short answer is: 
"
403,HBI,"""Because there are over 10,000 stocks out there and you need a way to find the good ones"". 
"
404,HBI,"The longer answer is: 
"
405,HBI,"Other than buying the stocks that are talked about in the media or recommended by friends, how else are you going to find stocks that meet certain fundamental characteristics? 
"
406,HBI,"Even if you don't use a screener now, most people do their own 'screening' one way or another. They may hear that a stock has a certain Growth Rate, or a certain P/E Ratio or Sales Surprise, for example. They then find themselves listening for or reading about stocks that meet this criteria. 
"
407,HBI,"Well if you want to find stocks that meet certain criteria, you can find them quickly and easily with a stock screener. 
"
408,HBI,"But, just because you narrow 10,000 stocks down to a handful, doesn't necessarily mean that you've picked the best ones. 
"
409,HBI,"You might have picked the worst ones.  
"
410,HBI,"But how will you know? Backtesting!
"
411,HBI,"Once you've created a screen, you can then backtest it and see how your screening strategy has performed. 
"
412,HBI,"In other words, does your screen generally find stocks that go up once they've been identified? Or does your screen generally find stocks that get buried once they've been identified? 
"
413,HBI,"This is good stuff to know. 
"
414,HBI,"With backtesting, you can see how successful your stock-picking strategy has performed in the past, so you'll have a better idea as to what your probability of success will be in the future. 
"
415,HBI,"Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future results, but what else do you have to go by? 
"
416,HBI,"Keep in mind, a screening and backtesting program isn't a 'box of magic'.  
"
417,HBI,"But it is a great way to see what works and what doesn't BEFORE you put your money at risk! 
"
418,HBI,"But remember, a great strategy for picking winning stocks doesn't exclude you from ever having another loser. On the contrary, even some of the best strategies 'only' have win ratios of 70% or 80%. (NOT 100%.) 
"
419,HBI,"If your strategy picks winners far more often than losers, though, you can feel confident that your next pick will have a high probability of success. 
"
420,HBI,"And don't be the guy who 'accidentally' gets into one or two good stocks and thinks he's the next Warren Buffett. If your stock account is important to you, test your stock-picking strategies to see if your method for finding winners is a repeatable one. 
"
421,HBI,"And that's why someone should use a Screener and a Backtester. 
"
422,HBI,"As usual, I'll close with a few new picks from some of my favorite backtested screening strategies for the week of 04/28/08:
