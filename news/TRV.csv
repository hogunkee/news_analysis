15,TRV,"After some disappointing economic reports over the past week, the stock market welcomed news of jobless claims tumbling to a 14-year low.Bijan Moazami, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, says the nation's improving unemployment rate, 5.9% as of September's end, is helping to boost profit and lower workers' compensation losses for AmTrust Financial Services (AFSI). As one of the largest U.S. workers' comp insurance providers, it collected about $1.6 billion in related premiums last year.More people working means fewer staying at home collecting workers' comp benefits, Moazami says. That lowers AmTrust's loss ratio, or the percentage of the premium it collects that goes toward paying workers' comp claims.People tend to get back on the job sooner in a strong labor market that ensures they've got work to return to when able, Moazami says, while a poor jobs market can lead to longer claim periods.""You always make more money keeping your job than getting workers' comp benefits,"" he said. ""People going back to work sooner and faster decreases the loss for the insurance company.""Lots Of LinesBesides workers' compensation insurance, AmTrust provides extended-warranty coverage on everything from electronics to cars, specialty middle-market property and casualty insurance and several related products and services, for which fee income has been growing.Thanks in part to rising investment and fee income, coupled with a lower tax rate, AmTrust sports the highest return on equity ratio in its industry. The measure of company net income divided by the money shareholders have invested averages 10% for its peers, according to JMP Securities analysts Matthew Carletti and Christine Worley.""(AmTrust's) return on equity is well in excess of 20%, which is basically unheard of in the insurance business,"" Moazami said.AmTrust shares have defied the stock market's recent swoon. They have outpaced the S&P 500 by a wide swath this year, rallying 37% vs. 2% for benchmark. The company also outperformed all of its peers in IBD's Insurance-Property/Casualty/Title industry group, which is up 3% year-to-date.AmTrust primarily insures a small-business niche concentrated around low-hazard, low-risk industries in which people work in offices, shops and restaurants. It doesn't compete with bigger names like Travelers Cos. (TRV), Liberty and American International Group (AIG), which target large businesses. Its average-size policy covers nine full-time employees at an average premium cost of $9,000.By not insuring against natural disasters, AmTrust avoids the risk of major losses from one-off catastrophes that hangs over its competitors. Its client businesses have a habit of renewing their policies year after year, providing AmTrust a very stable earnings stream. What's more, workers' comp premiums have grown in California, New York and Florida.""And they're growing gangbusters, faster than any other company I follow,"" Moazami added.The company passed a milestone of $1 billion in total revenue for the first time in the second quarter, AmTrust CFO Ron Pipoly noted on a recent conference call.Looking at the past four quarters, earnings have grown between 30% and 79% year-over-year each period, while revenue has soared between 56% and 89%.In response to better-than-expected second-quarter results, analysts raised their full-year 2014 and 2015 estimates by 10% and 9%, respectively, as of Sept. 30. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average anticipate that earnings will climb 44% in 2014 and 9% next year.How The Business GrowsGrowth has come organically and from merger and acquisition activity involving warranty providers, insurance firms, related-service providers and renewal rights.Pipoly counts 33 acquisitions since 2001. That includes the buyout this month of Comp Options Insurance (a Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Florida subsidiary) and acquiring, in mid-September, the renewal rights to Tower Group International's (TWGP) commercial policies. ""We think (Tower) is going to be a $500-million-a-year premium opportunity for us and we integrated that premium onto our book already,"" Pipoly told IBD. ""Comp is expected to be a $40-million to $45 -million-a-year premium acquisition.""AmTrust owns 14 companies but is hungry for more buyout targets. With a market value of $3.3 billion — vs. $35 billion for ACE (ACE), the largest name in its industry group — AmTrust has plenty of potential for growth or to be acquired itself.""We will look at opportunities to hopefully ferret out transactions that are below the radar, in which we have the opportunity to maybe be the only one involved in looking at an acquisition,"" Pipoly said. ""Our ability to find those M&A opportunities, execute on those M&A opportunities, and also integrate successfully those acquisition opportunities, served us very well over the past 14 years.""AmTrust also owns five foreign companies and operates in 13 countries with 95 offices worldwide, deriving about a third of its business overseas. It recently bought a warranty administrator in Malaysia to offer extended warranty products in Southeast Asia, home to a rapidly growing middle class.Interest Rate RiskOne of the biggest risks hanging over the insurance industry is the prospect of rising interest rates.The Federal Reserve is expected to influence rates upward in 2015, and rising rates would erode prices of insurers' fixed-income investments. However, most of AmTrust's $5.08 billion investment portfolio is in short-duration bonds of about five years, which are less sensitive to interest-rate changes than are longer-duration government bonds.Investors must consider that the insurance industry is highly regulated and failure to comply with government codes could lead to massive fines and suspension of business. It's also very prone to adverse court decisions, says Ken Billingsley, an analyst with Compass Point Research & Trading.""Future court decisions could have a material impact on policies written in the past,"" Billingsley wrote of the industry in a client note Aug. 7. ""Even after claims have been settled, adverse court rulings could expose insurers to additional and unintended risk.""

16,TRV,"A nascent market uptrend gained traction Thursday as major averages once again scored strong percentage gains. The bullish session resulted in plenty of strong movers in the new-high list. The Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts group was one of the day's best performers after O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) reported strong earnings. The retailer surged to a new high, rising 10.08 to 167.44.

"
20,TRV,"The top-line number in the Commerce Department's May durable goods report showed a 1.8% decline and a downward revision to April's number to minus 1.5%. Economists had forecast a more mild 0.6% slip. The bulk of the miss was apparently due to a sharp decline in aircraft orders during the month. Minus transportation, durable goods orders rose 0.5% — in line with expectations. So far this year, durable goods orders are running 2.2% below last year's January to May period.
"
21,TRV,"Housing prices improved steadily in May, lifting the Federal Housing Finance Agency's House Price Index 0.3%. That increase was equal to March's increase but just below consensus forecasts for a 0.4% gain. Year over year, the index is up 5.3%.
"
22,TRV,"New home sales popped in May to an annualized rate of 546,000, according to the Commerce Department. That was up from April's (upwardly revised) 534,000 pace, well above consensus expectations of 525,000 and the strongest number since Feb. 2008.
"
23,TRV,"A bit less rosy was the preliminary June manufacturing estimate from researcher Markit. Its Purchasing Managers Manufacturing Index was at 53.4, down from May's 53.8 number and below forecasts for an increase to 54.2. The number points to a third month of slowing activity and is the gauge's weakest gain in 18 months.

The stock popped to a new high, paring some gains but holding just above a cup-base buy point of 70.48.
"
26,TRV,"Citrix Systems (CTXS) pecked out a 2% gain, the best increase among Nasdaq 100 stocks. The Fort Lauderdale-headquartered software developer is still in buying range, 4% above a 69.33 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.
"
27,TRV,"Among leaders, most of the IBD 50 list posted modest gains and losses — with a couple of dramatic exceptions.
"
28,TRV,"Ambarella (AMBA) led the list with a 9% rebound. The stock tumbled 21% Monday, following a short-seller's report on Friday that questioned the stock's valuation. The stock remains extended after a mid-May rebound from 10-week support and is well above its 10-week moving average.
"
29,TRV,"At the bottom of the group, burger joint Sonic (SONC) dived 11% in massive trade. Fiscal third quarter sales and profits met consensus expectations, but full-year earnings guidance didn't.

When you have a double-digit gain and the chances are high that all of those gains are wiped out, it's better for individual investors and small investment advisors to gut the position entirely and salvage at least a small gain. That way, you prevent a total loss.

Revenue increased 3.6% to $7.45 billion, which surpassed analyst estimates of $7.1 billion.Net written premiums, a key revenue metric, rose by 6% to $6.42 billion. The firm attributed this to factors including strong retention and an increase in new business in domestic management liability.The company's fourth-quarter net income included a charge of $129 million related to the Trump administration's tax law reforms.Travelers' combined ratio, an important measure of profitability, increased by 5.5 percentage points to 95.5% compared with the equivalent 2016 quarter due to higher catastrophe losses, meaning payouts for claims took up a higher share of premium revenue. Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed due to the wildfires, which also claimed the lives of more than 40 people.Shares of Travelers were up 5% at 146.26 on the stock market today, now extended from a 138.05 buy point in a flat base cleared on Monday. Rival insurance giant Allstate (ALL) was down about 3% to 101.25, while Progressive (PGR) fell 2% to 57.05.Chairman and CEO Alan Schnitzer was confident the firm will continue to grow, and highlighted commitment to improving productivity and efficiency.""We are encouraged by the pricing environment, the opportunities afforded by a more level playing field for domestic insurers as a result of corporate tax reform, and the prospect of a strengthening economy,"" he said in a statement.The results come after the insurer also beat expectations for the third-quarter. This was despite core earnings plunging 62% to 91 cents a share, which the company said was primarily due to significantly higher catastrophe losses from major hurricanes.

128,TRV,"U.S. stock indexes sauntered to small gains midday Friday, with only small caps holding a losing hand for the week. Volume was running higher on the NYSE but flat on the Nasdaq.X The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 added 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively, while the Dow Jones industrial average sagged 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000, which was on track for a loss for the week, rose 0.8%.Breakouts midday Friday in strong volume included Signature Bank (SBNY), up 3% in volume 78% above average, and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGFA), up 3% in volume 330% greater than usual. Lions Gate has been rallying on word that the company is in buyout talks.Investors also might want to monitor stocks that are either in buy zones or close to buy points. For example, despite rising 25% last year and 5% year to date, the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average still has some potential buy opportunities.Stocks in their 5% buy zones include Goldman Sachs (GS), 3M (MMM), Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and DowDuPont (DWDP).Dow stocks in bases and not far from potential buy points include Coca-Cola (KO) and Travelers Companies (TRV).Of the above seven Dow stocks, four are expected to accelerate earnings growth in 2018. The four are Apple, Travelers, DowDuPont and Coca-Cola. Each has a base that is either first or second stage.As a stock advances, it pauses to consolidate. Breakouts from the first two bases are more likely to work than those from later stages.The base count is one reason why Apple may have more left as an investment. Also, Apple grew earnings 11% in fiscal 2017 ended in September, and the Street expects growth to pick up to 24% in fiscal 2018. While the 24% growth may be priced into the stock, earnings surprises offer the potential for additional thrust.Meanwhile, among IBD's 197 industry groups, three groups have shown uncommon strength this week.Over the past five sessions, the chip equipment group jumped 7% (think of stocks such as Applied Materials (AMAT)), while the commercial document group popped 4% (think label company Multi-Color (LABL)) and the hotel segment rose 3% (think La Quinta (LQ)). The biggest loser for the week was office supplies, down 5%.RELATED:Schlumberger Is Bullish Oil-Patch SpendingRetirement: Changes In The Roth IRACan This Great Stock Lead Again?

The Dow was fractionally lower and the S&P 500 eked out a small gain. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking very close to Monday's levels in the stock market today.X Travelers (TRV) was a big winner in the Dow, up 5% on strong earnings. It cleared a 138.05 flat-base entry Monday ahead of the results. But Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) underperformed on earnings, slumping nearly 4%. The consumer products firm is below a 144.45 buy point but still holding above the 50-day moving average.Netflix (NFLX) was a big gainer, up 9% to 248.50, after reporting bullish earnings and sales late Monday. Headed into earnings, Netflix was extended from a 204.48 entry. Among the other FANG names, Facebook (FB) and Leaderboard name Amazon.com (AMZN) rose more than 1%, while Alphabet (GOOGL) added 0.7%.Among China names, Alibaba (BABA) enjoyed a nice bounce off the 50-day moving average, rising 4% to 191.45 in heavy volume. It's working on a later-stage base with a 191.85 buy pointAmong breakouts, enterprise software name Workday (WDAY) cleared a 114.98 cup-with-handle buy point (seen on the day chart). In early December, Workday hit an intraday low of 95.35, undercutting the low of a prior base. This served to reset the base count. Workday's weekly chart shows an alternate entry at 116.99.In the biotech space, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) rose to the top of a six-month consolidation that shows a conventional entry at 167.95. Shares jumped nearly 3% to 166.29. Vertex owns a Composite Rating of 98 thanks in part to big earnings and sales growth in recent quarters.Meanwhile, President Trump's decision to impose new duties of as much as 30% on foreign-made solar equipment fueled a big early gain for First Solar (FSLR) but shares reversed lower. After rising nearly 9% intraday, shares were down 1%.

133,TRV,"U.S. stocks got off to a riveting start to the new year, particularly in the tech sectors, as Apple (AAPL) behaved the way one would expect for a leading stock that is testing support at a key technical juncture.X Apple, the global consumer electronics and digital services play, rose more than 1.7% to 172.36 and bounced off its rising 50-day moving average.The 50-day line, which graphs a stock's average closing price over the trailing 50 trading sessions, has been rising ever since the stock edged slowly after a key breakout from an early-stage base at 118.12 on Jan. 6, 2017. Gains from that breakout from a solid cup with handle reached nearly 50%.More recently, Apple on Oct. 27 cleared a new second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 and volume was brisk, 64% above the stock's 50-day average turnover.Apple and fellow Nasdaq tech giant Alphabet (GOOGL) (up 1.9% to 1,073.21, now extended past a recent flat base entry at 1,006.29) helped lead the Nasdaq composite up 1.5% by day's end. The Nasdaq soared 28.2% in 2017, its best annual gain in four years.The Nasdaq 100 rallied nearly 1.8%; the index-tracking PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), also up almost 1.8%, is now 28 cents below the all-time high of 158.77.The S&P 500 rallied more than 0.6% as investors also scooped up shares in infrastructure and building materials firms (please see the prior Stock Market Today column for more details), top Chinese company ADRs that are highly profitable and growing strong revenues, steel, automaker and generic drug groups.The Steel-Producers group is shaping up as Tuesday's top performer among the 197 groups tracked each day by IBD (see the entire list by going to Data Tables within the Stock Lists section of Investors.com).Strength in Apple, Chevron (CVX) (extended after a December breakout past a base on base at 120.99) and Walt Disney (DIS) (forming a new base) helped the Dow Jones industrial average edge 0.2% higher, overcoming a sell-off in insurance titan Travelers (TRV).Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) got off to a great start in 2018, rising at one point 15% to an intraday high of 2,320 in dull trading. At the end of 2017, even after a deep four-session plunge that took the Bitcoin-tracking ETF from as high as 3,522 to as low as 1,155, Bitcoin Investment still finished the year with a 1,556% return.It's likely that interest in Bitcoin is set to only rise, given the growing acceptance of e-commerce, digital transactions, concerns over the unusual gains in U.S. and other equities in 2017, and the relative ""newness"" of the alternative currency. The fact that both the CME Group and Cboe now conduct futures trading in Bitcoin is one of this currency's greatest accomplishments over the past few months.Watch to see how Bitcoin Investment acts around both the 10-day and 50-day moving averages. The latter has been catching up some, now well above 1,400. But the 50-day moving average, which usually acts as an excellent defense-oriented sell signal when a growth stock torpedoes through it in huge volume, has not been an effective timing indicator for this ultrahot ETF.Going back to Apple, amid all the speculation that the iPhone marketer is going to go on a huge shopping spree, investors should continue to simply monitor the price-and-volume action on a daily or weekly basis. And so far, the action remains healthy. One big reason is the possibility for further double-digit top and bottom line growth.Two, earnings growth may accelerate.The Street sees earnings rising 24% in the current fiscal year ending in September to $11.46 a share, up from an 11% jump in FY 2017 (ended in September that year). Services revenue is one big part of that picture. New products or new editions of the iPhone, MacBook and Apple Watch form another big part.Apple's ratings on Stock Checkup remain good, including a 90 Composite Rating and a decent B- grade for Accumulation/Distribution, which hints that fund managers are net buyers over the past 13 weeks of trading. The Accumulation grade goes from The C rating is neutral.In the medical sector, heart pump innovator Abiomed (ABMD) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) continue to show leadership.The former rose more than 3% to 192.49, retaking its 50-day moving average in quiet yet rising turnover. Watch for a potential new flat base to form, possibly presenting a 200.38 entry.Abbott, a diversified pharmaceuticals, medical products and diagnostic systems giant, rallied more than 3% to 58.79 and new highs in steep turnover. Shares are still in buy range after clearing a narrow and shallow flat base with a 56.79 buy point.The 5% buy zone for Abbott, which has scored three quarters in a row of double-digit top and bottom line growth (EPS up 17%, 13% and 12% while revenue is up 30%, 24% and 29%), goes up to 59.63.Abiomed is a member of IBD's Sector Leaders growth stock screen.Investors dumped utility stocks as interest rates rose.The Dow utility average fell nearly 1.1% as the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note jumped sharply to 2.47%. The yield is near last month's peak of 2.49%. On Dec. 13, the Federal Reserve hiked the fed funds rate on overnight bank loans for the fifth time since December 2015.

134,TRV,"The final trading session of 2017 turned mixed just after the open, as big tech names dragged on early trade.X The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 opened less than 0.1% higher. The Nasdaq Composite fought to remain in positive territory as Apple (AAPL) slipped 0.6% and Amazon.com (AMZN) dropped 0.5%.The Dow entered Friday's session up 0.3% for the week, compared with a 0.2% gain for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq's 0.1% decline.For 2017, the Nasdaq is up 29.1% through Thursday, the Dow has a 25.7% gain, vs. a 20% gain for the S&P 500.

Apple (AAPL) soared nearly 48%, just ahead of a 47% jump by Visa (V) and Wal-Mart's (WMT) advance of almost 44%.General Electric (GE) closes the year at the bottom of the list, with its shares down 45% year-to-date at Thursday's close.Travelers (TRV) led the Dow in opening trade, up 0.4% and edging the stock closer to its Dec. 4 high.Among FANG stocks, Netflix (NFLX) opened 0.1% higher, remaining positive after a 3.5% jump in strong trade Thursday.  The company is changing its pay structure for a number of top executives, converting cash bonuses into salaries due to revamped tax rules, according to Bloomberg. The stock enters Friday's session with a 56% gain for the year, and working to secure support at its 10-week moving average, below a 204.48 buy point.For the year, Netflix and Amazon.com took the FANG stock prize, each rising a bit more than 58% through Thursday. Netflix' advance included powerful breakouts in July and October. Amazon started the year with a breakout in January, then posted another, stronger break in October.Floor & Decor (FND) fell 1%, Daqo New Energy (DQ) jumped nearly 3% at the start of trade. Two of the week's front runners among IBD 50 stocks, Daqo is up nearly 15% for the week, extended and trekking to new highs after an October breakout.  Floor & Decor has a 10% gain in the holiday-shortened week, putting it 7% above a 46.34 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Telecom gear maker Adtran (ADTN) dived 13% before the open. The company warned its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue would come in far short of analyst expectations, due to a ""merger-related review"" and by a spending slowdown by a key customer.

135,TRV,"U.S. stock indexes posted solid gains midday Friday, as the Republicans scrambled to make final adjustments to the tax-cut bill. Volume was running higher on both major exchanges.X The small cap Russell 2000 led the way up with a 1.2% pop. The S&P 500, which struck a new high, and the Nasdaq advanced 0.8% and 0.9% respectively. Blue chips trailed the leaders as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.6%.Volume in the stock market today is likely to be higher because of expirations. Friday is a quadruple witching day, which involves the expiration of stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single stock futures.If the Republicans wrap up the tax-cut bill today, a vote could come early next week. This would give President Trump a chance to sign the bill into law before Christmas, the New York Times reported.For the stock market, the tax-cut legislation could be a driver in 2018. JPMorgan's top strategist Marko Kolanovic said in a note that ""The upcoming reduction of U.S. corporate tax rates may be one of the biggest positive catalysts for U.S. equities this cycle."" Kolanovic is convinced that ""little is priced into the market.""The big question now is sector rotation. There are several ways to scan for sectors rising and falling. A thorough check might involve looking at which sectors are providing the most new highs; the industry group tables; sector rankings in IBD's stock tables; and breakouts.Blue chips were up, except for IBM (IBM) which fell 1% in strong volume. In the Dow Jones industrial average, leaders included drugmaker Pfizer (PFE), up 1.8%; insurer Travelers (TRV), up 1.8%; and money center JPMorgan Chase (JPM), up 1.5%.In the S&P 500, apparel stock the class C shares of Under Armour (UA) gapped up 11% as it reclaimed its 50-day line.

136,TRV,"The Dow Jones industrial average edged nearly 0.2% higher in afternoon trading Monday, thanks in part to strength in 3M (MMM), Home Depot (HD) and insurance giant Travelers (TRV), all of which rose 1 point or more. The other major indexes showed tiny pullbacks after nifty advances during Thanksgiving Week.X Meanwhile, the IPO market continued to bolster investors' returns as streaming video hardware pioneer Roku (ROKU) surged more than 10% to 44.71. The small-cap member of IBD's Consumer Products-Electronics industry group is up 49% since charging out of a first-stage IPO base at 29.90 on Nov. 10.Roku has lost money in all but one of the past 11 quarters, but sales have been brisk, rising 17%, 28%, 19% and 40% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. The Street sees the Los Gatos, Calif., firm losing 10 cents a share in Q4 vs. a 3-cent profit in the year-ago quarter.At 2:45 p.m. ET, the S&P 500, up nearly 1% during last week's four-day session, was virtually flat as gains by consumer electronics retail, homebuilder, solar, internet content and select food stocks offset declines in the oil and gas, cement, metal ores, generic drug, outpatient and home care, and long-term medical care industries.The small-cap S&P 600 lost 0.4%; it was down nearly 0.6% in the early going. The Nasdaq composite was virtually flat after lifting more than 1% last week.Volume is running higher on both main exchanges following Friday's half-day session.On the NYSE, Square (SQ) slid more than 11% to 43.44 in massive turnover. At 2 p.m. ET, more than 49 million shares had already changed hands, vs. its 50-day average turnover of 11.5 million and running at more than six times the usual pace. The midcap tech has a market value of $16 billion and a float of 255 million shares.The 5.42-point drop in heavy volume is Square's largest in a single session since the stock initially broke out in late February. That stands as a mid- and near-term sell signal. (On the IBD daily chart, the red line running across the volume bars is the 50-day moving average.)As noted in a Big Picture column last week, Square has been a truly outstanding performer in 2017. Briefly noted on IBD Leaderboard, the point-of-sale, data analytics and financial services firm for small and midsize businesses has climbed as much as 75% since breaking out of a nearly seven-week flat base with a 28.07 entry in September.However, the rally gained a near-vertical slope in recent weeks, and a 42% jump over just 10 sessions (from the Nov. 9 intraday low of 34.83) was one sign of climax-run-type action.Notice how on Friday, despite the market being open just 3-1/2 hours, Square saw heavy turnover but failed to make further headway. Such stalling action indicated that some institutional investors were selling into strength.Shareholders who prefer to make short- or midterm trades may decide to sell, especially if Square closes below its short-term 10-day moving average. (The IBD Leaderboard charts show the 10-day line in green.)Others with more conviction may decide to be patient and see if a new base will form. Meanwhile, the 50-day moving average is still trying to catch up, currently near 34.72. A drop to the 50-day line's current level from a 49.55 high would be equal to roughly a 30% correction, and that's not out of line for a new base to form after such a powerful advance.On Feb. 23, Square bolted out of a first-stage flat-base pattern with a 15.59 buy point in massive volume after the hardware and software tech play posted Q4 earnings of 5 cents a share, its best quarterly result ever, and a 21% jump in revenue to $452 million.The Street sees earnings rising 40% to 7 cents in the fourth quarter this year. Square currently gets a top-notch 99 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup and a 99 for Relative Price Strength on a scale of 1 to 99; but keep in mind that the Composite, EPS, RS, SMR and Accumulation/Distribution ratings are best used to determine which stocks to buy, and not when to sell.Elsewhere, Dow Jones industrial components Microsoft (MSFT) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) also showed healthy action, with the former rallying nearly 0.5% to 83.78 and keeping a healthy upward price gap that it produced four weeks ago.

165,TRV,"The stock market reversed lower in afternoon trading Wednesday, in another sign that volatility and uncertainty remain issues for investors.X The Nasdaq erased moderate gains and was down 0.6%. Semiconductor stocks performed worse than most sectors, weighing on the technology-heavy composite.The S&P 500 reversed to a 0.2% loss and was pulled back just as it tried to rise back above its 50-day moving average. The Russell 2000 was up 0.1%. Volume was lower compared with the same time Tuesday. The reversals come as the broad market is still staggering from its sharpest sell-off in many months.The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 0.1% but well off session highs that took it near a 1% increase. The Dow had climbed back above its 50-day moving average before gains receded.Some of the 30 stocks in the average are trying to rally from their 50-day lines. Walmart (WMT) is making an impressive bounce off the 50-day moving average and can be considered to be in a buy zone. The stock is finding support at the 50-day line, which is near Walmart's 100.23 buy point from its Jan. 8 breakout.United Technologies (UTX), Nike (NKE), Home Depot (HD) and Travelers Cos. (TRV) are other Dow components that are rising from pullbacks to the 50-day line. But while they may be in buy areas, remember that market risk is higher now.While breakouts have dried up, there are quite a few leading stocks in a different type of buy area, namely the 50-day moving average.In the IBD 50, study the charts of Nvidia (NVDA), Charles Schwab (SCHW), FleetCor (FLT), E-Trade Financial (ETFC), Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), SVB Financial (SIVB) and Adobe Systems (ADBE).

166,TRV,"January's stock market performance reinforced fund manager expectations that economic growth abroad will be stronger than in the U.S.X ""Many investors believe that Europe and Latin America and places like Japan have the potential for even stronger earnings growth than the U.S. in coming quarters,"" said Tom Galvin, lead manager of $4.3 billion Columbia Select Large Cap Growth (ELGAX). ""That has led to some allocation shifts to non-U. S. stock names.""U.S.-focused Columbia Select Large Cap Growth is capitalizing on the trend in another way. ""Our fund contains many U.S. multinationals, which in aggregate obtain nearly half of their revenues from outside the U.S., so we benefit from the synchronized global recovery that way,"" Galvin said.And January's stock market showing was itself clear cut and upbeat — a fast start for the new year. The S&P 500 rocketed up 5.73%, pulling U.S. diversified stock mutual funds up 4.37% on average. That was the S&P 500's 15th straight monthly gain and its best monthly gain since March 2016's 6.78% jump. For U.S. diversifieds, it was the fifth monthly gain in a row and their best since November 2016's 5.19% climb.The broad market got a lift last month from such Dow Jones industrial stocks as Boeing (BA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Travelers Companies (TRV) and Walmart (WMT).World equity mutual funds did even better than U.S. diversified stock funds, rising 5.66%.""The gains are evidence that economies in the U.S. and around the world are doing well,"" said Stephen DuFour, manager of $1.7 billion Fidelity Focused Stock Fund (FTQGX), which topped 86% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Direct last month. ""When I talk with people producing tractors, combines, I hear about growth in areas where it hasn't been seen in years. In the U.S., unemployment is low, wages are rising and corporate earnings were very strong the last couple of weeks. And earnings projections are rising, getting a boost from lower tax rates.""The solid gains in January came amid month-end market softness. The market was rattled by rising bond yields, the prospect of new pricing pressure on health care providers and rising oil production, Galvin said. Rising bond yields fueled fears of a rotation from dividend paying stocks into fixed income.Countering with some upward pressure were strong corporate profit reports and job gains, as well as the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.By Thursday, though, there was enough downward pressure for IBD to read the market's direction as uptrend under pressure. Three out of four stocks follow the market's direction, according to IBD research, so stock mutual funds are likely to have more difficulty generating gains.With a 7.99% gain, large-cap growth funds paced all U.S. diversified stock fund categories in January. Global science/technology funds topped all sector categories by advancing 8.27%.Latin American funds led world equity fund groups with a 9.9% burst.U.S. taxable bonds eked out a 0.05% gain amid expectations of three Fed interest rate increases this year.Going forward, the technology, health care and consumer sectors look like the most fertile grounds for investment opportunities to Galvin, whose fund outperformed 72% of its peer group in the 12 months ended Jan. 31.The consumer sector is still showing strength after a strong holiday shopping season, he says. In health care, recently announced mergers have fueled anticipation of more consolidation, he says. ""Coupled with the benefits of offshore cash coming home due to tax reform, that's added to investor interest,"" he said.He notes a wave of tech companies are due to report earnings in February. ""I look at tech stocks as industrials on steroids,"" he said, ""with better corporate profits and benefits from lower corporate tax rates. We should see stronger capital spending, which will likely lead to greater spending in IT (information technology). Those factors should sustain strong gains by tech in 2018.""Amazon.com (AMZN), his largest holding, after the close Thursday reported Q4 earnings that smashed expectations amid strong sales growth.Looking beyond the near term, Galvin said, ""Despite its spending, Amazon has a long runway. It continues to grow its presence in a variety of sectors. This week's announcement about a health care partnership with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) (to form a new health care company) is another reminder that Amazon has a presence not just in pure retail.""Galvin likes Alibaba Group (BABA) because it benefits from the fast growth of online commerce in China. ""It's the largest e-commerce retailer in China,"" he said. ""And China continues to show strong economic growth. And the accelerating preference for online spending there should power strong double-digit earnings growth in coming quarters.""Alibaba on Thursday reported that fiscal Q3 earnings rose 25% on a 66% sales increase, but earnings were below expectations.IBD'S TAKE: See how Alibaba's strengths — like four consecutive years of annual earnings per share growth and being ranked No. 1 in IBD's Retail-Internet industry group — stack up against its peers at the stock's easy-to-read IBD Stock Checkup page.And he likes the prospects for Priceline (PCLN). ""It's been a laggard, but it's a leader in online travel. Consumer spending will strengthen because of growth in wages, lower taxes and (younger generations looking for novel travel experiences). It should be a midteens earnings grower, although there are some questions about margin pressure in the near term.""Tech names that Fidelity's DuFour likes include tax- and accounting-software provider Intuit (INTU) and Microsoft (MSFT).Like Adobe, Intuit is shifting to a subscription model for cloud-based software from sold-in-stores software packages. ""They've got stronger growth because the (new model) lets them produce their programs for different countries by adding new language versions,"" DuFour said.Microsoft's Azure, a cloud computing competitor for Amazon Web Services, ""let's Microsoft cope with a changing world."" Growth in online gaming is one aspect of that, he added.And Walmart (WMT) is a newcomer to his top 10. ""Walmart has the size and capability to actually take on Amazon,"" he said. Walmart is learning how to compete online with Amazon from its acquisition of Jet.com, a low-cost online sellers of a wide range of goods.One example of how Walmart can leverage its existing assets is by having store employees deliver goods to customers on their way home from work, DuFour said.Charles Shriver, lead manager of T. Rowe Price's $2.4 billion Personal Strategy Balanced (TRPBX) and $344 million Global Allocation (RPGAX) funds, says his funds have shifted to overweight in foreign stocks. Many Japanese and eurozone stocks offer better valuations than many U.S. stocks, he says. Those markets have accommodative monetary policies at a time when the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising rates. And those stocks provide exposure to markets growing faster than in the U.S.Among Global Allocation's holdings, Japan's Sumitomo is a diversified conglomerate that trades goods and services. Shares were up 33% in the 12 months ended Jan. 31. ADRs for car and truck maker Toyota Motor (TM) were up 19% in those 12 months.ADRs of Bayer (BAYRY), a German-based maker of drugs, chemicals and agricultural treatments, are up 18% in the past 12 months. Earnings per share were flat in Q3 after two quarters of decline.ADRs of drugmaker Novartis (NVS), whose Swiss headquarters is not in the eurozone, were up 22% in the past 12 months. EPS grew 0%, 5% and 8% the past three quarters.RELATED:2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Gains, With A Foreign Tilt

Airline stocks plunged as United Airlines (UAL) said it would expand rapidly, setting the stage for a renewed price war.X The S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq all rallied solidly to hit fresh record highs as earnings season heated up. The falling dollar, which has acted as a tailwind for U.S. multinationals' stocks and profits, rebounded from three-year lows Thursday as President Trump said he expects a stronger greenback. Netflix (NFLX) was a big earnings winner. Intel (INTC) also did while after Texas Instruments (TXN) and Lam Research (LRCX) were among several leading chip stocks to struggle on earnings. Airline stocks plunged on United Airlines (UAL) while Apple (AAPL) and iPhone-related stocks sold off as several analysts cited evidence of weaker iPhone X demand.Shares rocketed to record highs as Netflix (NFLX) added 8.33 million streaming subscribers worldwide, crushing its fourth-quarter target of 6.3 million. The Internet TV streaming giant ended 2017 with 117.58 million total streaming subscribers, with one analyst predicting 200 million Netflix subscribers in 2020. The gains came despite Netflix implementing price hikes to its service plans in the U.S. and Europe.

For the March quarter, Netflix is predicting it will add 6.35 million net new subscribers.Chipmakers Intel (INTC), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) beat their December-quarter targets, but got mixed reviews from investors.

Celgene's acquisition comes as it prepares to lose exclusivity for cancer drug Revlimid in 2022. Juno rivals Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in making CAR-T drugs to treat blood cancers. Sanofi's deal follows two failed mergers in 2016 and 2017.Early Wednesday, Novartis (NVS) reported core earnings of $1.21 per share on $12.92 billion in sales, up a respective 6% and 2% on a constant-currency basis, and easily beating the consensus.

AbbVie (ABBV), on Friday, topped expectations with adjusted profit up 23% and sales climbing 14% to $7.74 billion in sales.United Airlines (UAL) sent airline stocks into a tailspin after the carrier told analysts that it planned to expand flight coverage through 2020. Investors fear the move, done in part to regain relevance in the smaller cities United once abandoned, risks more competition and cheaper fares, helping passengers but threatening profits. American Airlines (AAL), during its Q4 earnings call, signaled that it wouldn't change its profit and growth targets based on United's ambitions — for now. Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK) also reported.General Electric (GE) missed on earnings and disclosed an SEC probe, though core units did well and GE kept its 2018 outlook. Three industrial members of the Dow industrials, Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX), reported strong earnings and guidance. Insurer Travelers (TRV) and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also beat on earnings views.

The tax on washing machines decreases and then expires after three years, while the duty on solar cells and modules phases out after four years. Solar technology providers Suniva and SolarWorld charged that China was providing unfair subsidies and financing to its solar producers. Whirlpool (WHR) complained that Korean makers were dumping washing machines in the U.S. at excessively low prices.Whirlpool, which also reported quarterly earnings, rallied 11%.

Specialty steel producer Allegheny Technologies (ATI) nearly doubled profit estimates. Revenue grew 14% to $910 million, fueled by its high-performance materials for jet engines. Freeport McMoRan (FCX) benefited from higher copper prices, boosting Q4 earnings by 104%, ahead of estimates. Revenue grew 15% to $5.0 billion. Negotiations with Indonesia about ownership of its massive Grasberg mine are progressing but haven't erased uncertainty about the company's outlook.Casino operators Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) both put up Q4 results that beat on the top and bottom line, helped by the rebound in Macau, the world's largest gaming market.

172,TRV,"The major indexes cut early losses Thursday to practically negligible size, a sort of victory for a stock market uptrend that remains under pressure. The Nasdaq composite whittled a morning drop of nearly 0.6% to close less than 0.1% lower for the day. Ditto for the S&P 500 (down 0.1%) and the Russell 2000 (off 0.2%). Sharp losses by Travelers[ticker…
"
173,TRV,"Stocks overcame mild selling pressure at the open and traded nearly break-even in late-morning trade Wednesday. The initial sell-off came amid a negative preannouncement of quarterly results by data network security firm Fortinet (FTNT), bringing down its peers in the software field. Yet Apple (AAPL) rose 0.7% to 117.13 and continued to draw demand in the wake of a colossal failure in one of its rival Samsung's key wireless products and is perhaps offering an additional entry point.Meanwhile, Tesla Motors (TSLA) continued to defend the 200 level, rising 1% to 202.30 in heavy turnover. Analysts on consensus see the EV maker posting a profit of 8 cents a share in the third quarter despite controversy over whether the company, which plans to merge with SolarCity (SCTY), needs to raise cash in the fourth quarter to keep up with investing for the scheduled rollout of the Model 3 entry-level sedan in late 2017.The Nasdaq composite, down 0.2% at the open, was flatlining while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials edged roughly 0.1% higher. Gains by Apple and fellow Dow 30 components Travelers (TRV), Nike (NKE) and Home Depot (HD) offset the 1-point loss by Chevron (CVX) as crude oil prices retreated 1%.Alibaba (BABA), down 2.9% on Tuesday, sank another 1.2% to 103.91, but the decline appears normal. Notice on a daily chart how the stock still maintains a thick air pocket above its fast-rising 50-day moving average — a sign of strength. The e-commerce behemoth is also still up 22% past an 85.10 entry in a long cup with handle pattern — this means an investor who bought correctly may still take at least some profits at 20% to 25%, which in this long-in-the-tooth bull market run going back years could be considered as executing the ""platinum rule"" of selling right.Also in big cap land, Apple is already extended more than 5% past a 110.33 buy point in a bottoming-style cup with handle that formed from April 15 to Sept. 9. Yet sometimes, stocks can reflect multiple patterns simultaneously, and such is the case with the largest company on the U.S. equity markets.As seen in either a daily or weekly chart, Apple has formed another handle that began with a Sept. 16 pullback, generating an additional pivot point at 116.28 — 10 cents above the handle's intraday high of 116.18.Keep in mind that Apple had peaked with an all-time high of 134.54 back in the spring of 2015. So while there may be some ""overhead supply"" of disgruntled shareholders itching for the stock to rebound so they can close their positions with small losses or at break-even, that price peak is now more than 18 months in the past. This means the price levels carry less psychological relevance for today's traders.Apple's RS Rating continues to improve, now at 76 as seen in IBD Stock Checkup; five weeks ago it was at a lowly 26 out of a maximum 99. A 76 rating means Apple is outperforming 76% of all companies in terms of 12-month price performance within IBD's database.Are there other ""bottoming bases"" in the works? Yes.Alaska Air Group (ALK), which led the airlines during an extraordinary run by the industry group from December 2012 to the start of 2015, rallied 1.2% to 70.16. The highly profitable airline is trying to clear its 200-day moving average for the second time in as many months.Good stocks trade above this long-term support line en route to building a solid base, holding near 52-week or all-time highs, then breaking out to lead the market and produce tradable rallies. Alaska Air holds a poor 36 RS Rating for now, but watch to see if it improves over the next few months.Last week, Alaska reported a 7.4% jump in September revenue passenger miles despite a dip in the load factor -- a gauge of how full are planes -- to 81.6% vs. 84.1% a year ago. The revenue passenger count rose 5.4% while capacity in the form of available seat miles grew 4.2%.Wall Street sees Q3 earnings down 4% to $2.08 a share; the estimate incorporates a tough year-over-year comp as Q3 profit jumped 47% in the year-ago quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Want to master how to time purchases of excellent growth stocks to maximize potential gains?

That was enough to close above the 23,000 mark as IBM soared 9% on a turnaround earnings report. Goldman Sachs (GS) also had its shoulder to the wheel, with Intel (INTC) and Travelers (TRV) also posting gains of better than 1%.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 held to the recent trend, each ending a fraction higher. That was enough for new  high on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.IBM was the story of the day, vaulting 8.9% to its best session since January 2009.  Analysts immediately began ratcheting price targets higher after the company reported better-than-forecast earnings and revenue in its third quarter, and guided Q4 expectations toward the company's first revenue gain in at least four years.The stock's gain hoisted shares back above their 40-week moving average and left them 12% below their February high.Goldman rose 2.5%, recovering the ground lost on Tuesday following its earnings report. The stock is forming a cup with handle with a 247.17 buy point.Chevron (CVX) notched the Dow's biggest decline, dropping 1.7% as details emerged on another fire damaging the company's El Segundo refinery in Southern California. Brokerages BMO Capital and Societe Generale downgraded the stock, while Morgan Stanley maintained its overweight rating.Shares of Cree snapped 17% higher after the chipmaker and LED lighting leader turned in a just-enough fiscal first-quarter performance last Tuesday, including weak guidance. But new CEO Gregg Lowe's discussion of turnaround plans with analysts during the conference call sparked a rally that sent shares past a 29.94 buy point in a cup-with-handle base formed deep within a multiyear correction.On the IBD 50 list, China's Jupai Holdings (JP) remained unstoppable, soaring more than 6% and giving it a 154% gain following an August breakout.Another China-based name, Autohome (ATHM), hammered out a 4% gain after Credit Suisse initiated coverage on the stock with an outperform rating and a 70.80 price target.

American Express reports earnings Wednesday.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 tried to hold gains of just 0.1% after an early advance faded. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.1%. Its recent rally has stalled as it holds just above the 1,500 level.The relative weakness in the Nasdaq reflected on the market breadth: Nasdaq decliners led advancers by 9-to-7 but were nearly even on the NYSE.Volume was tracking lower compared with the same time Friday.There was no clear leadership in the market today, with an odd combination of consumer, financial, utility and energy industry groups among the top 25 best performers.Adobe Systems (ADBE), the 25th largest Nasdaq component by index weighting, fell 2% to its 50-day moving average in heavy volume.

Adobe's EPS jumped 42% to 47% the past four quarters.The Dow transports lagged badly, off 0.9%. The trucking industry group was one of Monday's weakest.

178,TRV,"The Dow carried another new high through the closing bell on Monday. Apple (AAPL) and JPMorgan (JPM) led the half-dozen blue chips striding to powerful gains during the session.XThe Dow Jones industrial average ended 0.4% higher to end just a fraction below the 23,000 mark; it just passed 22,000 in mid-September. The Nasdaq chalked up a 0.3% gain, and the S&P 500 added 0.2%, each knocking off new highs of their own.The session opened on positive footing after much stronger-than-expected producer price data out of China and a forecast from a central bank governor for the economy's growth to hit 7% in the second half of the year. Another boost before the starting bell came from the New York Federal Reserve, which reported its Empire State Manufacturing Survey spiking to 30.2 for October, up from 24.4 for September and trouncing outlooks for a decline.The combination, along with a positive tone headed into the earnings reporting season, left Six Dow industrials names with gains of better than 1%. JPMorgan (JPM) clocked out with a 2% advance, and Goldman Sachs (GS) rose 1.5% ahead of its third quarter report, due out Tuesday morning.Apple rumbled ahead 1.8%, after its recent move to a segmented revenue strategy earned it an upgrade, to overweight, from equal weight, from Keybanc. The price target held steady at 187. The gain put Apple shares back above their 10-week moving average as the stock continues to build the right side of a new base pattern. The stock also remains in a technical buy range above a 156.75 buy point from a prior base pattern.Travelers (TRV) swung up 1.7% as the insurance sector in general booked a strong session. Travelers is working its way toward a 130.47 buy point in a cup base.General Electric (GE) popped almost 2%, recovering a portion of last week's 6% dive.  At the low end of the Dow, Pfizer and American Express (AXP) each dropped more than 1%.The strong economic news out of China led to a blowout session for China-based names on the IBD 50 list, Jupai Holdings (JP) rocketed 12% higher, China Lodging Group (HTHT) swept ahead 6%, YY (YY) punched out a 4% gain and Tal Education (TAL) climbed more than 2%.

The Nasdaq composite advanced 0.3%, grabbing another new high of its own.Investors were keeping an eye early Monday on fighting between the Iraqi military and Kurdish forces in the northern Iraq city of Kirkuk, and on Israel and Syria, after Israeli forces launched a retaliatory strike against a missile launching facility east of Damascus.The Dow and S&P 500 are both sitting on top of five-week advances. The Nasdaq has climbed for three weeks, and all three closed last week at new highs. This week's outcome is likely to be affected by earnings reports. Netflix (NFLX) reports after today's close, and the pace picks up on Tuesday, with Goldman Sachs (GS), UnitedHealth (UNH), Cree (CREE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) among the names expected to report.On the Dow, Travelers (TRV) led with a 1.5% gain. American Express (AXP) took the hardest early hit, down 0.8%.Apple (AAPL) scaled up 1% in early trade, after KeyBanc Securities upgraded the stock to overweight from sector weight. The note said iPhone X pricing, the increase of iPhone 8/8+ and a change to its storage pricing ""represent a more aggressive strategy to segment its customer base and extract incremental gross profit from its users than we previously expected.""Apple shares rose through resistance at the stock's 10-week moving average. Shares have made themselves comfortable below that line for the past month, but a three-week advance has started the right side of a possible new base.Among the big tech FANG stocks, Netflix gained 0.5% in premarket action ahead of its earnings report due out after the close. The stock ended Friday at the very top of its buy range, a fraction less than 5% past a 190.05 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. Consensus views are calling for a big earnings gain, up 167%, for Netflix' third quarter, on top of a 30% rise in revenue.Biotech Exelixis (EXEL) soared 22% at the open. The company said the Food and Drug Administration granted a priority review of its kidney cancer treatment. Exelixis shares ended Friday pulled back 16% from a late-August high, in a possible six-week cup base.Charles Schwab (SCHW) dropped 0.9%, after narrowly topping earnings targets and narrowly missing revenue growth views in its third-quarter report. The stock ended Friday just above a 44.20 buy point in a three-month cup base.China-based names led the IBD 50 list. Chian Lodging GroupHTHT powered up more than 2%,  YY (YY) jumped 1.7% . Both stocks are extended and near new highs.Tampa, Fla.-based insurance broker Health Insurance Innovations (HIIQ) bolted 8% higher, after clobbering analysts earnings and revenue growth expectations for its third quarter, and announced a $50 million share repurchase initiative. The stock ended Friday still 49% below its Aug. 30 high, but up 50% from a late September low as it rebounds from the selloff that followed Hurricane Irma.Economic news gets off to a positive start for the week, with the New York Federal Reserve Bank reporting a surge in regional manufacturing in October, sending its Empire State Manufacturing Survey to a reading of 30.2, up from 24.4 in September — its best month in three years. That was far above consensus expectations, which called for the index to weaken to a reading of 20.The report showed longer delivery times and a decrease in inventory levels, both negative. But new orders and shipments were sharply higher, pointing to ""ongoing solid gains.""Oil prices traded up 1.4%, with West Texas Intermediate holding above $52 a barrel and approaching its late-September high.

"
180,TRV,"Apple (AAPL) kept its 2017 rally alive, rising more than 1.4% in active trading and hopping back above its 50-day moving average as the major indexes held on to thin gains at lunchtime in New York.XApple, at 159.31, is now back above a prior 156.75 buy point in an 11-week flat base that formed from May 15 to Aug. 1. The iPhone giant broke out on Aug. 2 on bullish fiscal Q3 results (EPS up 18%, the biggest increase in seven quarters, revenue up 7%).Apple is also up nearly 35% since its initial breakout this year, a Jan. 6-9 boost past a perfect cup with handle at 118.12. While the move back above the 50-day line is bullish, the stock also is working on a flat base with a 165.04 buy point.At 12:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite edged 0.1% higher; at one point, the tech-rich market-cap-weighted index was up 0.4%.The Dow Jones industrial average, getting a boost by not only Apple its financial-sector components Goldman Sachs (GS), Travelers (TRV) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), was also up close to 0.2%. The S&P 500 rose just 0.1% as selling in the retail sector weighed.The S&P SmallCap 600 slipped 0.2%. Transport shares cooled off; the Dow Jones transportation average dropped nearly 0.9%, partly due to a jump in energy prices.Crude oil continued to rally, boosted in part by military conflict between Iraq and its Kurdish-occupied northern region, helped commodity stocks lead the upside. WTI near-term oil futures rallied 0.8% to $51.87 a barrel.Biotech, heavy construction, coal, oil drilling, gaming and Southeast banking shares also paced the upside. KBR (KBR), a member of IBD's Building-Heavy Construction industry group, rallied more than 4% to 18.47 in volume jumping more than 80% above average.The stock had trouble making further upside progress since clearing a first-stage bottoming base pattern at 18.05 in early September. However, the stock did not trigger any sell signals and now appears to be finding support at the 18 level.The Houston-based expert in engineering and construction services to government and civil infrastructure, energy and petrochemical clients has strung three quarters in a row of top-line growth (revenue up 10%, 11% and 8% since Q4 of 2016 to Q2 2017) and is slated to post a solid quarter of profit, 30 cents a share, in the just-ended third quarter, vs. an adjusted net loss of 44 cents in the year-ago quarter.For the year, KBR is seen earnings $1.43 a share. It lost 34 cents a share in 2016.Returning to Apple, the reclaiming the 50-day moving average offers long-term holders a chance to consider adding a small portion of shares to a winning position. Those who bought at 156.75 are now back in the black, and the stock had not triggered any defensive sell rule, including the golden rule of selling.Four additional reasons to keep holding Apple include the following:One, fundamentals are set to continue accelerate. As noted in multiple Stock Market Today columns earlier this year, Apple is set to post another quarter of double-digit EPS growth.And in the fiscal year 2018, ending in September that year, earnings are seen rising 22% to $11.03 a share, up from an 8% jump in fiscal 2017. Apple reports fiscal Q4 results on Nov. 2.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Apple's Earnings Per Share Rating is an 85, up from a lowly 45 at the start of the year.Two, the company boasts excellent cash flow. In fiscal 2016, operating cash flow was $10.53 a share, much more than the $8.31 it earned per share in profits. That could help prevent the stock from having to take on more debt to finance future growth. At the end of the latest fiscal year in September 2016, Apple showed a long-term debt to shareholders equity ratio of 59%, up from 26% and 45% in the prior two years.Three, while the total number of mutual funds and hedge funds owning Apple shares dropped on a year over year basis, the decline is minimal: 5,244 funds owned shares as of the September quarter, vs. 5,264 a year earlier.Among highly regarded funds, Oppenheimer Value (CGRWX) increased its stake as a proportion of its fund in the third quarter and has held shares since Q3 of 2012. Fidelity OTC Portfolio (FOCPX), Fidelity Magellan (FMAGX), Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and Columbia Large Cap Growth (LEGAX) also continue to be big holders of Apple shares.Four, technicals remain sound as the stock continues to wage a long-term trend of higher highs and higher lows. The up/down volume ratio of 0.9 is not terrible, given that the stock made a sharp pullback in September. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating of E is poor, though.Elsewhere in the market, coal play Warrior Met Coal (HCC) gained more than 1.5% to 23.97 in volume running more than triple usual levels. The stock undercut its 50-day moving average on Sept. 21 but immediately began a slow rebound. Watch to see if the small-cap energy play can retake its 50-day line.The stock is up 26% since its April debut at 19 a share. Now, the Brookwood, Ala., firm is in Week 6 of a potential new base.Warrior Met, an expert in hard coking coal, has a float of 49 million shares, satisfying the S (supply vs. demand) in IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm, and 53 million shares outstanding. The new company lost money in both 2015 and 2016, but is expected by Wall Street to earn $6.66 a share this year.IBD'S TAKE: Did you know that the flat base, which reflects an unwillingness among large fund managers to dump their shares, often serves as a launchpad for big breakouts and tremendous price gains for many growth stocks?

181,TRV,"Here's Your Investing Action Plan: what you need to know for Wednesday and beyond.Earnings season gets underway in earnest with reports from Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday and banking giants such as Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) later this week.XFor the third quarter as whole, S&P 500 earnings are expected to grow 2% from the same period last year on a 5% revenue gain, according to Zacks Investment Research. That follows double-digit profit growth in the first two quarters of 2017.The technology sector should earnings up nearly 10% as revenue grows 7%. While flagship names Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) will step up to the dock as November dawns, smaller names like Barracuda Networks (CUDA), out Tuesday night, are on tap this week.Estimates for the financial sector have notably worsened over the last two months, as last quarter's back-to-back hurricanes weigh on corporate profits, especially on insurers and reinsurers such as Travelers (TRV), American International Group (AIG), Chubb (CB) and Everest Re (RE).Insurers, who account for a quarter of the finance sector's total earnings, are expected to see earnings decline 25% vs. a year ago, contributing to a dip in Q3 earnings for the broad financial sector, according to Zacks.But both Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are estimated to grow adjusted profits and sales in the September quarter when they report Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.The impact of the storms on insurers may already be priced in, with AIG moving back toward a buy point of 67.57 after bottoming in early September and Progressive (PGR) crossing a 49.11 buy point off a flat base.Transporters and air carriers are also likely to see a hurricane-related knock on profit growth, but Delta Air Lines added 1.9% on the stock market today as the stock moves toward a 55.85 buy point ahead of the carrier's report on Wednesday.Analysts call for Delta earnings to shrink 9% to $1.54 as revenue rises 5% to $11.04 billion, Zacks said. Delta already has reported strong preliminary Q3 unit revenue figures, with United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) following suit on Tuesday.Finally, small-cap companies, which are not part of the S&P 500, should see earnings growth return in Q3. For the S&P 600 index as a whole, earnings are expected to be up 11% vs. a year ago on 5% higher revenue, snapping a run of earnings declines in three of the last four quarters.Small-cap stocks also have been leading in recent months.The finance, technology and energy sectors are likely to drive small-cap growth. Without the finance sector's contribution, small caps' Q3 earnings would drop 0.3%.RELATED:American, United Airlines Jump On Strong Q3 Unit Revenue; Delta On TapWal-Mart Sees 40% Online Sales Jump, Sets $20 Billion BuybackMove Over Techs, There's A New Sector Leader On Wall StreetNvidia Shares Jump As It Debuts Computer For Self-Driving Cars

182,TRV,"Major indexes showed mild yet mixed action with less an hour to go in Friday's session. Volume on both exchanges was tracking lower than Thursday's levels in the stock market today.The Dow Jones industrial average edged around 0.1% higher as five of the 30 components rallied 1 point or more.X The biggest gain among the Dow 30 stocks came from Travelers (TRV), which rebounded more than 4% to 120.53 in heavy volume. The insurer faces the possibility of major liabilities as Houston and neighboring areas recover from Hurricane Harvey and as Hurricane Irma looks set to smash its way through South Florida over the weekend.Travelers is trying to rebound back above its rising 200-day moving average. Shares are 7% below a 52-week high.The insurance giant remains a laggard in the stock market, down nearly 3% year to date. Growth investors should focus their time and money on companies with an IBD Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher. Travelers shows a lowly 26 RS Rating, meaning that it's outperforming only 26% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past 12 months.The Nasdaq composite slid nearly 0.5% as big-cap techs took a break. The S&P 500 fell less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq 100, which includes the 100 largest nonfinancial firms on that exchange, fell 0.8%.The S&P SmallCap 600 inched up almost 0.2% but still hovers below its 50- and 200-day moving averages.Helping lead the market's upside with gains of 1.5% or more were stocks of insurance brokers, property and casualty insurance, and accident insurance firms, as well as lodging, construction materials, and air conditioning and heating products.Top industry groups for the week include home furnishings firms, up nearly 8% and bolstered by a huge gain in RH (RH). The seller of luxury interior and patio furniture edged just 0.6% lower at 71.09 after leaping more than 44% higher on Thursday following strong Q2 results (earnings up 48% to 65 cents a share, sales up 13% to $615.3 million).RH's stock has certainly proved it can trade in a highly volatile fashion. It reinforces the importance of using offense-type sell signals, or capturing gains on the way up. One such strategy is to take at least partial profits when a gain from a proper breakout reaches 20% to 25%.For instance, RH bolted for a fourth week in a row and broke out of a first-stage bottoming base pattern near 40 during the week ended March 31. The stock went on to make 52-week highs and hit the 60 level by early May.Given the choppy record of earnings and sales in recent quarters, it would have made sense to take gains ahead of its quarterly report that came out on June 1. RH reported a turnaround in earnings (from a net loss of 5 cents per share to a 5-cent profit) and a 23% rise in sales, the best result in nine quarters, yet the stock still dove more than 25% and nearly did a round trip of all of those handsome gains.For now, RH is forming the right side of a new cup-type base, but it needs much more time to flesh out the pattern. A good cup base must be a minimum of six weeks but it can form over a span of three to six months or more.RELATED:How To Invest: The Key Elements Of An Excellent Cup With Handle PatternHow To Find Good Breakouts: Check Out IBD's New Highs ListWhen To Sell A Stock: Look For The Biggest Single-Day Point Decline

The Dow Jones industrials fell 0.1%. Decent gains in light volume by Dow 30 components Travelers (TRV) and Wal-Mart (WMT) helped buffer the blue-chip index's slide. The Dow utilities bucked the downdraft, up 0.2%.Volume was running modestly higher in the stock market today on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, due partly to the fact that investors are waiting for news to come out of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates that began this morning. Also a factor was that Monday's turnover was extremely light: On the Nasdaq, the 1.59 billion shares traded was the lowest so far in 2016.Valeant was a highly rated and extraordinary market performer since the March 2009 market bottom. From its October 2008 low of 6.65, the Quebec-based company rallied as much as 3,867%. But in August last year, Valeant flashed a pair of key sell signals for investors.For one thing, it dived 10% in the week ended Aug. 21 and sharply undercut its 10-week moving average in heavy volume, a sign of heavy institutional selling. Second, in that same week, Valeant triggered the 8% sell rule by falling below the 246.11 entry in a late-stage flat base.Today, Valeant shares are 86% off their 263.81 peak. Investors can protect their capital by always limiting their loss in any individual stock or ETF to 8% or less.After a delay, Valeant on Tuesday morning reported dismal fourth-quarter results. Earnings fell 3% to $2.50 on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, missing Wall Street's consensus view of $2.61 and marking the first year-over-year drop in at least four years, even as revenue rose 22% to $2.79 billion. That increase marked the smallest top-line gain in three quarters.Valeant finished the year with long-term debt of $30.3 billion, nearly three times its 2015 sales of $10.5 billion. In 2014, the long-term debt-to-equity ratio was a towering 287%.IBD's CAN SLIM system generally guides against investing in companies that have a  long-term debt-to-equity ratio exceeding 100%, especially in industries that do not necessarily require a lot of infrastructure spending.IBD's ethical drugs industry group was down 9% for the week and reached a nearly two-year low.

195,TRV,"Stocks showed mild losses in afternoon trading Tuesday, recovering a bit after lukewarm retail sales initially spooked the market.The Nasdaq recouped half of a 0.8% intraday decline, falling 0.4%. The S&P 500 eased 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average edged higher. Small caps lagged badly with the Russell 2000 down 1.3%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly higher than Monday's levels in the stock market today.In economic news, February retail sales fell 0.1%, in line with economists’ expectations, but the real story was a sharp downward revision to January data -- to -0.4% from an initially reported 0.2% gain.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell 2% to $36.34 a barrel.Apple (AAPL) was a big gainer in the Dow, rising 2%, after Morgan Stanley (MS) issued a positive note, citing ""surprising upside"" to iPhone demand. Apple has a press event scheduled for March 21.Nike (NKE), Travelers (TRV) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) also outperformed in the Dow with gains of around 1%.Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) crashed 49% after reporting better-than-forecast Q4 revenue, but earnings stopped well short of analyst targets, and management lopped nearly 40% from its Q1 EPS and revenue guidance. Valeant’s shares dived into a deep correction last year after a federal investigation was launched into the company’s drug pricing practices.Inside the IBD 50, retailer Blue Buffalo Pet Products (BUFF) continued to attract buyers. Shares rose another 2% on the heels of a strong earnings report last week. Meanwhile, two REITS made noise. Public Storage (PSA) added 1.5%. It's in the early stages of breaking out of a base with a 258.08 buy point. And Sovran Self Storage (SSS) rose 0.8%. It's vying for a breakout from a cup-shaped base with a 114.09 entry.Also in the IBD 50, lighting products firm Acuity Brands (AYI) added to recent gains as it works on a cup-with-handle pattern with a 222.95 buy point.  Shares rose nearly 2% to 219.63.The two-day Fed meeting started today and concludes Wednesday.

196,TRV,"Stocks rattled off quick early gains Monday, as global markets rallied and initial reports out of Florida suggested damage from a quickly weakening Hurricane Irma may stop short of worst-case scenarios.XThe Nasdaq Composite led, sweeping up 1% as Apple (AAPL) rumbled ahead 1.2% and Netflix (NFLX) led the FANG stocks with a 1.9% gain.The Dow Jones industrial average veered 0.8% higher and the S&P 500 jumped 0.7%.The National Hurricane Center estimated Irma's maximum sustained winds at 70 miles per hour at 8 a.m. ET Monday, weakening to Tropical Storm status as it climbed into Florida's panhandle. More than 4 million Florida residents were reported without power as the state, with heavy damage being reported in the Florida Keys and forecasters warning much of the Gulf Coast remained at risk of a storm surge brought by the second half of the storm.But markets had braced for catastrophic wind damage in the hurricane's initial landing and saw some relief trade early Monday.Insurer Travelers (TRV) led the Dow Jones industrials, up 3.5% and looking to rebound after a five-week decline. Home Depot (HD) dropped 2%, marking the Dow's only early decline as it peeled back from a 6% pre-storm advance last week.Among other insurers, Progressive (PGR) gained 3% and Allstate (ALL) rose 2% in early trade. Tampa-based HCI Group (HCI) vaulted 14% higher, rebounding hard after unraveling 20% in heavy trade last week.Among leaders, IBD 50 stocks were highly active in early action.Corcept Therapeutics (CORT) climbed 1.8% after Stifel Nicolaus initiated coverage on the stock with a buy rating. The Menlo Park, Calif.-based biotech is trading nearly 50% above its breakout past an 11.68 buy point, suggesting investors lock in at least some profit.Apple supplier Universal Display (OLED) jumped 1.6%. The move put the maker of organic light-emitting display chips reported to be used in Apple's new iPhones back above a double-bottom base buy point at 127.87.Kemet (KEM) popped 1.7%, bucking to take back some ground after a heavy volume pullback last week. The stock ended Friday 60% above a 12.75 buy point following a breakout in May.IBD Leaderboard stock Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) grabbed an early 1.7% gain. The China-based diversified internet play is trading below a potential buy point at 177.10 in an unusual chart pattern called an ascending base.Tesla (TSLA) charged ahead 3.5% in opening action. The company released a software upgrade Saturday, reportedly giving Tesla owners in Florida an extra 40-50 miles in range to their battery life to help in evacuating Florida ahead of the storm.  The gain lifted Tesla shares to 4% below a 370.10 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.RELATED:These 6 IBD 50 Growth Stocks Are Near Buys What's Bullish About The Economy?

197,TRV,"Major stock indexes were mixed and not moving much in either direction Friday. The 10-year Treasury yield stabilized, giving a much-needed lift to financials.XThe blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.2%, while the Nasdaq retreated 0.3% and the S&P 500 was mostly flat. The small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.2%. Volume in the stock market today was tracking lower than Thursday's levels.Insurer and Dow Jones industrial average component Travelers (TRV) jumped 4%  to 119.75 after a sharp drop off its recent high of 130.37.Also in the Dow, Morgan Stanley (MS) edged higher as it continued to test support at the 200-day moving average. Morgan Stanley has the highest EPS Rating in its group, a 95. An EPS Rating of 95 means the stock has grown earnings faster than 95% of the stocks in IBD's databaseThe Select Sector SPDR Financial (XLF) outperformed, rising 1%. The exchange traded fund is also battling for support at the 10-week moving average.Inside the IBD 50, Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) was a nice gainer, up about 4%. The Leaderboard name is now extended from a 45.05 buy pointSymantec (SYMC) was a top gainer in the S&P 500. The big cap gapped up as much as 6% before trimming its gain to 4%.

Qualys is extended at this point, but Proofpoint is trying to clear a base with a 94.43 buy point, while Palo Alto Networks is holding gains smartly after recently gapping up over a 144 entry.RELATED:Alibaba Expands Into Groceries To Corral The Digital ConsumerTarget Cheerfully Slashes 'Thousands' Of Prices — And Investors FretKroger's Hurricane-Less Outlook Adds To Amazon, Wal-Mart Fears

199,TRV,"The major indexes slumped in afternoon trading Wednesday as traders and fund managers digested news from the Federal Reserve on its plan to begin reducing its massive balance sheet of bonds and securities.Meanwhile, Snap (SNAP) slumped 4% to 14.13, cutting through its key 50-day moving average for the second time in nearly three weeks. Shares are now 52% below the all-time peak of 29.44, set in the Snapchat operator's second day of trading following a heavily followed IPO at 17 a share.XThe Fed said in a statement that while the fed funds target range is left unchanged at 1%-1.25%, it would now let $10 billion in principal be redeemed in maturing government bonds and agency mortgage-backed securities on a monthly basis. This means that in 12 months' time, it would see its $4.5 trillion assets drop by less than 3%.Techs led the market decline. A 2.3% drop by tech giant Apple (AAPL) helped send the Nasdaq composite nearly 0.7% lower.While Apple is now below its recent flat-base entry of 156.75, watch to see if the iPhone giant can find support near the key 50-day moving average.Shares are still sharply above the Jan. 6-9 breakout point of 118.12 in a first-stage cup with handle. Apple still remains in a long-term uptrend as well.The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, but the Dow Jones industrial average was off just 0.1%; at least four of the Dow industrials' 30 components gained 1 point or more, including Goldman Sachs (GS) and insurance giant Travelers (TRV).At 22,346, the Dow Jones industrials, which has already risen in eight straight sessions, is up 13% since Jan. 1. The small-cap Russell 2000, up 0.3%, is still lagging the large-cap indexes with a 6.5% year-to-date gain.Volume is running higher vs. the same time Tuesday on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.Oil drilling, oil and gas exploration, logistics, airfreight and airline stocks paced the upside on the back of fiscal Q1 results from FedEx (FDX) (EPS down 11%, revenue up 4%), which said that Hurricane Harvey impacted its business. The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil rose about 2% to $50.53 a barrel.FedEx at one point rose more than 3% to an intraday high of 222.71, briefly rolling past a 220.09 entry in big volume.The proper buy zone for FedEx extends up to 5% past the 220.09 entry, or 231.09.The stock's 50-day moving average has been sliding lower since early June, a negative sign. A healthy stock is one that's not only rising but also trading above its 50-day line, which is itself rising.The Fed also indicated that it still plans to raise the fed funds rate charged on overnight loans to banks an additional four times in 2018. Since the end of 2015, the central bank has pushed the fed funds rate from a target range of 0%-0.25% to 1%-1.25%.U.S. government bonds on the long end jumped, leaving the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note at 2.28%, still well below its March peak of 2.62%.Going back to Snap, while there is little doubt that the Venice, Calif., firm is enjoying superlative top-line growth, it still hasn't shown concrete signs that it can make money in the near or medium term.The company lost 16 cents a share in the second quarter, greater than a 9-cent loss in the year-ago quarter, even as revenue rose 153% to $181.7 million. Operating expenses have exploded higher.Snap has 1.18 billion diluted shares outstanding.Meanwhile, the Street estimates net losses of 64 cents a share this year and 50 cents in 2018, bigger than previously expected.While some analysts have recently issued bullish notes on the stock, fund managers have been acting in the opposite direction. Data from William O'Neil + Co. shows that the total number of mutual funds and hedge funds owning shares fell in Q2 to 259 funds vs. 305 funds in Q1.IBD'S TAKE: The recent action in Snap shows why it's so important to wait for a new IPO to establish a true trading range and set up a breakout opportunity before buying any shares.

200,TRV,"Stocks lodged gains Wednesday, as buyers maintained control while markets struggled to value in the effects of rising storm damage in Texas and Louisiana.XThe Nasdaq Composite easily led, soaring 1.1% in above-average trade. Preliminary data showed volume weaker on the NYSE, with the S&P 500 cranking out a 0.5% gain and the Dow Jones industrial average limping to a narrowly positive finish, up 0.1%.Oil and gas drillers and airlines were two of the day's hardest hit industries.Exxon Mobil (XOM) announced it had shut down its 362,000 barrel per day refinery in Beaumont, Texas, following the shutdown Monday of its 560,000 barrels-per-day facility in Baytown. All told, 22% of U.S. refining capacity is now offline, according to estimates from S&P Global Platt's. As a result, gasoline futures rocketed 6% higher Wednesday, putting prices ahead more than 13% for the week. Oil dropped 1%, to below $46 a barrel, down 4% for the week.Houston's two airports and its port, the second busiest shipping hub in the country, remain closed until further notice. The country's busiest port, the Port of South Louisiana, was still reporting status normal as Harvey settled over Louisiana and North Texas.Concrete stocks posted the largest gains among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, as shipping lanes backed up outside Houston interrupted the normally steady supply of cement being imported into the U.S., suggesting at least brief shortages and price spikes due to the storm. U.S. Concrete (USCR) spiked 11%, narrowly clearing an 80.55 buy point in a flat base. Eagle Materials (EXP) and Martin Marietta (MLM) rose 6% each.Trucking stocks also bolted higher as retailers and industries scrambled to reroute supplies of consumer goods and raw materials stalled outside of Houston.  ArcBest (ARCB) surged 6% and broke out above a cup-with-handle buy point of  28.18. Landstar (LSTR) throttled up 5%, topping a 90.55 buy point in a flat base.Property and casualty insurers continued to take a beating. Traveler's Insurance (TRV) took the hardest hit among Dow names, down more than 1%. Non-Dow stock Progressive (PGR) dropped 2%.Cisco Systems (CSCO) topped the Dow with a 1.8% gain. That lifted shares almost 6% above their mid-August low and back above their 10-week moving average. The stock is attempting to start up the right side of a three-month consolidation.Among stocks reporting earnings, drone maker Aerovironment (AVAV) lofted an 18% advance. Its fiscal first quarter report late Tuesday neatly dispatched analysts targets. The surge left the thinly traded shares extended above a 40.20 buy point in a seven week flat base.Chipmaker Analog Devices (ADI) rattled off a 5% gain after a 54% EPS gain and a 65% rise in revenue handily beat expectations.  The gain moved shares up the right side of a 13-week basing effort.Other chipmakers basked in the afterglow: ON Semiconductor (ON) jumped 5%, Qorvo (QRVO) and Silicon Motion (SIMO) each nailed 4% gains.On the downside of the day's earnings news, H&R Block (HRB) tanked 8%, killing a month-long basing effort.

202,TRV,"Property and casualty insurance stocks such as Progressive (PGR), Allstate (ALL), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and AIG (AIG) are on the decline Monday in the wake of Hurricane Harvey's landfall in Texas on Friday.XHarvey has since been downgraded to a tropical storm from Category 4, but acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke told the Washington Post on Monday that ""we are not out of the woods yet,"" and said Harvey ""is still a dangerous and historic storm.""Officials estimate that about 30,000 people will be forced from their homes, said the outlet. The hurricane has so far reportedly resulted in at least five deaths and more than a dozen injuries.Analysts and insurance executives said the industry has enough capital to withstand losses incurred from claims resulting from the storm, according to the Wall Street Journal.On Monday, Hannover Re told Reuters that the damage Harvey has wrought is projected to be well below the impact of 2005's Katrina ($80 billion) and 2012's Sandy ($36 billion).IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.But the Insurance Information Institute said the flood damage caused by Harvey in Texas could match Katrina's impact, according to a separate Reuters story Sunday.Progressive shares were down 2.6% on the stock market today, but remains well above buy range, Allstate fell 1.2% to 90.89, threatening to drop below its buy zone and 50-day average, and Travelers (TRV) dropped 2.7%.AIG lost 0.8%, Berkshire Hathaway dipped 0.5%, and Chubb Limited (CB) fell 1.3%.RELATED:Stock Futures Climb As Houston Flooding WorsensProgressive Joins Rank Of Stocks With 95-Plus Composite RatingBerkshire Hathaway Outbid By Sempra For Oncor Electric Delivery

Other stock groups rallying Monday included automakers, specialty steel makers and chip designers. On the downside, insurers and building stocks retreated.In the Nasdaq 100, electric car maker Tesla (TSLA) leapt 4.5% in strong volume. The company said that it is working to bring supercharger networks to major cities, beginning with Chicago and Boston. Tesla's stock is working on a cup-with-handle base with a 370.10 buy point.The base is second stage. As a stock rises, it pauses to consolidate. Breakouts from the first two consolidations are more likely to work than those from later stages.Blue chips showed broad strength as 26 of the Dow Jones industrial average's 30 components rose. Travelers (TRV), DowDuPont (DWDP) and Apple (AAPL) added 2% each. All three stocks were rising in strong volume.Other stocks showing bullish gap-up action included Mastercard (MA), up 2% to a 52-week high; Visa (V), up 1% to a new high; and National Beverage (FIZZ), up 5% to a new high.RELATED:Apple To Unveil New iPhone on Tuesday5 Ways To Spot This Bullish Pattern

It's trading at its highest level in more than 11 months, after a 9% advance from an early December low.The $12.1 billion fund, which tracks the JPMorgan EMBI Global Core Index, offers market-cap-weighted exposure to U.S. dollar-denominated government bonds that are issued by more than 30 emerging-market countries. Currency risk isn't an issue because it invests only in U.S.-dollar denominated bonds.Mexico accounted for the biggest country weighting as of Sept. 6, at about 6% of assets, followed by 5% each in Indonesia and Turkey. The Russian Federation, Philippines, Argentina, China and Brazil were next at roughly 4% apiece.Some investors favor bond funds because they tend to have high yields. For instance, EMB's annualized dividend of 4.51% is well above the S&P 500's average payout of 1.92%. The ETF carries a 0.39% expense ratio.""We see sustained global growth benefiting EM debt,"" Richard Turnill, BlackRock's Global Chief Investment Strategist, noted in a recent report. ""The asset class tends to perform well in such an environment — even if the Fed is raising rates. We focus on income as high valuations make further capital gains less likely.""PowerShares Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt (PCY) is close to a 30.11 buy point of a yearlong saucer with handle. It's also trading at its best level in about 11 months, after rising 9% off an early December low.The $4.8 billion fund, which tracks the DB Emerging Market USD Liquid Balanced Index, provides equal-weighted exposure to U.S. dollar-denominated government bonds issued by more than 20 emerging-market countries.

Medical software provider Cerner (CERN) broke out in heavy volume, above a 69.38 entry.Among China-based stocks, retail online services provider Baozun (BZUN) surged 8% in a bounce off its 50-day line. Volume was double its average pace.A bounce off the 50-day in strong volume can establish a secondary buy zone.RELATED:What The Long-Term Chart Says About Biotech StocksMastercard Jumps To Record High On Raised 2017 Revenue OutlookA Checklist For Recognizing The Great Stock

The latter, up more than 8% past a 109.52 cup-with-handle breakout point, reported thin gains in Q1 earnings and revenue.Go to a weekly chart of United Tech, and you'll see that the stock can also be seen as still forming an aircraft carrier-sized saucer base stretching to its February 2015 peak of 124.45.From that perspective, one could argue that another handle formed on this extremely long base with an additional buy point of 114.54, 10 cents above the March 1 intraday high.United Tech CEO Gregory Hayes noted that all four main businesses saw top-line growth, driven by 3 percentage points of organic growth and 1 point of net acquisition growth, offset by a 1% drop related to currency flows.

That was the highest quarterly sales since the fourth quarter of 2014. Steel Dynamics is fashioning a new base that shows many jagged edges — one of the telltale signs of investing in commodity-linked companies. In many cases, the right time to buy such a stock is not at the primary breakout but possibly during the first pullback following the breakout.Elsewhere in the market, keep an eye on top names in the gaming industry.

For now, the base shows a 63.48 entry.Sands' arch rival Wynn Resorts (WYNN) saw a 3.5% drop in Q1 revenue from its Macau-related business.

"
233,TRV,"Travelers (TRV), the only property-casualty insurer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, said fourth-quarter profit jumped 8.9 percent as investment income improved and the company recorded a gain tied to the settlement of a risk-sharing dispute.Net income rose to $943 million, or $3.28 a share, from $866 million, or $2.83, a year earlier, the New York-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Operating profit was $3.20 a share, beating the $2.81 average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Travelers was helped by higher returns from private equity, which countered pressure on the investment portfolio from low bond yields.Chief Executive Officer Alan Schnitzer, who took over in December 2015, has been seeking to revive investor confidence after profit declined for four straight quarters through Sept. 30. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Atlantic Equities have all cut their ratings on the insurer to sell this month, citing risks including higher costs from auto policies as more drivers get in car crashes.""While homeowners profitability remains strong, we are disappointed with the underwriting results in personal auto and are taking pricing and other actions to improve its profitability,"" Schnitzer said in the statement. ""In our commercial businesses, we continue to be pleased with the stability of the markets in which we operate and the execution of our strategies.""Investment income climbed 12 percent to $493 million. The contribution from beyond the bond portfolio more than tripled to $96 million, fueled by gains from private equity.The underwriting gain in the business and international segment, the company's largest, climbed 8 percent to $391 million. For personal insurance, which includes both auto and home coverage, the figure plunged 90 percent to $23 million.The one analyst tracked by Bloomberg who upgraded Travelers this year, Macquarie Group Ltd.'s Amit Kumar, advises investors to buy the stock on the prospect that an expanding U.S. economy will increase demand from business clients for coverage. Travelers is one of the largest commercial insurers in the U.S. and offers products including workers' compensation coverage and policies for fleets of vehicles.Policy sales advanced 3.3 percent to $6.06 billion in the fourth quarter from $5.86 billion in the last three months of 2015. The insurer charged domestic business insurance customers 2.5 percent more at renewal in the three months ended Dec. 31, according to a presentation. That compares with a 2.6 percent increase in the third quarter.The fourth-quarter combined ratio was 90 percent, meaning Travelers kept 10 cents of every premium dollar after claims and expenses. That worsened from 86.6 percent in the year-ago period.The stock had declined 3.6 percent this year through Monday in New York trading to $118.04, compared with the 0.2 percent increase in the 30-company Dow Average.Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, slipped to $83.05 a share as of Dec. 31, from $86.04 three months earlier. Bond yields rose after Donald Trump's surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election, pressuring the market value of fixed-income securities. The insurer repurchased $751 million of shares in the quarter.Pretax catastrophe costs jumped to $137 million from $46 million a year. U.S. insurers were pressured in the period by Hurricane Matthew, which battered the Florida coast, and Tennessee wildfires.The gain from reserves was $264 million pretax, narrowing from $292 million a year earlier. Insurers regularly reassess the money they've set aside for future claims and can scale back or raise the amount based on their expectation of losses.""Favorable development has bolstered Travelers' earnings by about 17 percent in last three years, higher than the industry average and all other domestic companies that we cover,"" Morgan Stanley's Kai Pan said in a Jan. 5 note. ""This could pose a risk to future earnings should reserve releases slow.""The company said in November that it would record a pretax gain of about $126 million from a settlement in a reinsurance dispute.Return on equity for the quarter was 15.8 percent, a gain from 14.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015. ROE for the year slipped to 12.5 percent from 14.2 percent. Annual net income fell 12 percent to $3.01 billion.

The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 held 0.4% gains each. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average trailed with a 0.2% pop. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges.In the IBD 50, a proxy for top-rated stocks, only six stocks are small caps. Three showed positive action. Decking, railing and fencing maker Trex (TREX) rose 3% in heavy volume. Electronic-postage provider Stamps.com (STMP) added 1%. Staffing provider AMN Healthcare Services (AMN) gained 1.5%.Stamps.com cleared a 114.70 buy point, but volume was below average. Trex and AMN were approaching buy points.IBD'S TAKE: Look elsewhere: Solar-energy stocks aren't likely to do well in 2017.The three other small caps in the IBD 50 staged negative reversals. BofI Holding (BOFI) advanced about 3% in the first five minutes of trade and then reversed to a 0.4% gain. Chip designer MaxLinear (MXL) roared 3.5% in the first minute of trade and then sank to a 0.2% gain. Cloud storage provider Carbonite (CARB) inched up 0.1% in the first five minutes of trade and then retreated to a 4% loss.In the Dow industrials, a price-weighted index, Goldman Sachs (GS) rose 2% in the first hour of trade and then gave back half the gain. On the downside, Travelers Cos. (TRV) rose 0.5% at the open and then reversed to a 1.4% loss.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, energy stocks did well while utilities sagged. West Texas intermediate crude oil, up earlier, slid 1.3% to just under $54 a barrel.

237,TRV,"U.S. stock indexes strolled to small losses Wednesday in the run-up to the Christmas weekend, but could face a hard test Thursday.The Nasdaq edged down 0.2%, and the S&P 500 echoed the loss. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial eased 0.16%, but the small cap S&P 600 dropped 0.7%. Volume in the stock market Wednesday was below the previous session's pace on both major exchanges.Blue chips tilted to the downside. The Dow has been a leader in the stock market in the current rally. Of the 30 Dow components, about half are at or near a 52-week high. Three scored new highs Wednesday — Chevron (CVX), DuPont (DD) and Travelers (TRV) — though volume was weak and the stocks gave back most of the gains.Wednesday's slow turnover was no surprise, considering the heavy lineup of economic news for Thursday.The biggest item is the third take on third-quarter GDP. The first reading came in at 2.9%. The second reading was 3.2%. Thursday's estimate, which will be released before the stock market's open, is expected to edge up to 3.3%. The range of estimates is narrow — 3.2% for the low guess and 3.4% for the high.Q3 readings have been significantly stronger than in the first two quarters of 2016. In the first half, growth ranged from 0.8% to 1.4%.Another number that sometimes packs a wallop is durable goods orders, which also will be reported before the market's opening bell. The Street's consensus number for new orders is minus 4% for November, down from October's positive reading of 4.8%. The range of estimates for November runs from -6.3% to -2.4%. The Street expects a decline in commercial aircraft orders to weigh on the number.First-time jobless claims also will come before the open. The consensus estimate among analysts is for 256,000. Estimates range from 250,000 to 260,000. Last week came in at 254,000.The Chicago Fed National Activity Index for November is expected before the open. The October reading was -0.08.The Federal Housing Finance Agency will report housing prices for October just after the open. The consensus estimate is 0.5%. Estimates are tight: 0.5% to 0.6%.Personal income and outlays in November will be released at 10 a.m. ET. The Street calls for 0.3% in personal income. The range is 0.1% to 0.4%. Consumer spending is pegged at 0.3%. The range of estimates runs from 0.1% to 0.5%.Leading indicators for November will be posted at 10 a.m. ET. The consensus increase is 0.2%.

"
240,TRV,"Opening gains faded into moderate losses in morning trading on Wednesday with three sessions left in 2016.Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) is taking a well-needed break, but not before showing enough oomph to strike new all-time highs. The graphics-processor expert rushed to as high as 119.93 before pulling back, falling 3% to 113.73.At the intraday low, Nvidia hit 109.27, down nearly 7%. Even after that decline, Nvidia is still up more than 140% past a 33.17 buy point within a cup with handle. Holders who bought at that proper entry could take at least some profits and hold a stake through the next inevitable correction.Volume is running sharply above average in Nvidia so far; its 50-day average turnover is 14.2 million shares, and the stock has already seen more than 30 million shares change hands.The Nasdaq composite erased an opening 0.2% gain to fall 0.3%. At one point, the tech-centered index fell 0.5%. The Nasdaq 100 was also down as much as 0.5%, reflecting a retreat among big-cap techs.The S&P 500 lost 0.3% and the Russell 2000 sank 0.5%. The Dow Jones industrials were off less than 0.1%, bolstered by gains in financial components including Goldman Sachs (GS) (up 0.8%) and insurer Travelers Companies (TRV) (up fractionally).Volume is running sharply higher vs. the same time on Tuesday on both exchanges. However, keep in mind that turnover was well below average on Tuesday.As noted in an earlier Stock Market Today column, Nvidia gushed more than 29% higher amid a 10-day buying streak. That kind of gain, following a strong multimonth advance, usually points to some sort of midterm or ultimate peak, as leading stocks cannot maintain such vertical moves for long.However, the climax run tends to work best when a market is oozing with optimism, such as was displayed during the go-go 1990s that ended with a Nasdaq top in March 2000.While bullishness among newsletter writers polled by Investors Intelligence has jumped to the highest levels since July 2014 and are close to the 60% level that warrants caution, other sentiment indicators — including the put-call volume ratio and growth in margin debt — do not point to bubblelike market conditions.Elsewhere, Apple (AAPL), while joining the market downside, reflected strength as it remained stubbornly near a potential new entry at 118.79 in a base-on-base pattern. The stock was virtually flat at 117.23, keeping the bulk of its recent advance.Go to a weekly chart at either Investors.com or IBD's MarketSmith and you'll see that Apple had cleared a 110.33 cup with handle in mid-September, rallied more than 7%, then pulled back to form a new base. These bases form part of a long bottoming base pattern in which Apple digested past large gains and investors struggled with the fact that the iPhone maker was seeing falling profit for three quarters in a row.While fiscal Q1 earnings are seen falling 2% to $3.23 a share, a big beat would end its streak of shrinking earnings.Intel (INTC) and Applied Materials (AMAT) also are acting relatively well. The former, virtually flat at 37.01, has been building a two-month cup base with a buy point at 38.46 for now. Watch for a potential handle to form; a good handle shows a downward slant along the intraday lows.Intel's base is part of a gigantic saucer pattern stretching back to the end of 2014.Applied, which may play a big role in the future of actuator chips, still traded 6% above a recent 31.17 flat-base buy point, so it's extended. Don't buy leading stocks more than 5% past the proper entry. Actuator chips convert digital signals into physical motion, heat and other forms of analog-based activity.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Did Nvidia Just Signal A Correction Is Near?The Bottoming Base Pattern, Part I: How It Helps Investors Make MoneyThe Bottoming Base Pattern, Part II: Why Apple Formed One In 2009How To Invest: How You Can Profit From Gerald Loeb's Wall Street Wisdom

West Texas intermediate crude prices climbed 0.1% to $44.94 a barrel; gold futures shed 0.4% to $1,274.40 an ounce.IBD 50 stock Priceline Group (PCLN) gapped up and soared 6.5% to a record high in fast turnover. Raymond James raised its price target on the provider of online travel services to 1,700 from 1,560. The company late Monday reported Q3 results that topped views. Its Q4 earnings guidance came in below consensus forecasts. Priceline said interim CEO Brett Keller is taking over as permanent chief executive, effective immediately.Also on the IBD 50, MaxLinear (MXL) surged 10% in quadruple its usual trade, sending shares near a 21.52 buy point of a cup with handle. After the close Monday, the chip designer reported Q3 results that beat forecasts. The midpoint of its Q4 sales guidance is $87 million. Analysts expect $99.2 million.But Momo (MOMO) reversed sharply lower from a new high of 28.44 at the open. The stock fell 13% to 23.16 after the Chinese social network reported Q3 earnings of 24 cents a share, up from 2 cents a year ago and well above estimates. Momo also guided Q4 revenue growth past forecasts. The stock slid below its 50-day line, where it spent much of last week.CVS  Health (CVS) gapped down and sank 13% after the drugstore chain's Q3 earnings topped, but revenue missed Wall Street forecasts.

Walgreens announced plans last year to acquire Rite Aid for $17.2 billion. Rite-Aid vaulted 7% Thursday.American Express (AXP) was the Dow's biggest winner, up 9% in heavy volume.

289,TRV,"Ready feels right. Forward-thinking firms gear up ahead of disaster:• Face the storm. Deadly weather caused more than $8 billion in property damage in 2013 and resulted in 440 weather-related fatalities, according to a National Weather Service report.The hit for businesses? One-in-four affected by weather disasters never reopen. That finding comes from the Insurance Information Institute, which stressed the importance of disaster planning and business interruption coverage in the wake of 2012's Hurricane Sandy.• Respond fast. Last winter, the Atlanta area weathered ice storms. At law firm Deming Parker, Hoffman, Campbell and Daly, the unseasonable cold burst an office pipe, flooding servers. The firm already had a disaster plan in place, and was contracted with Agility Recovery, a vendor that swoops in with resources when disaster strikes.""Within 12 hours from close to open we were back up using their satellite Internet and servers,"" said Rick Campbell, managing partner.• Lay groundwork. A facility fire two years prior got partners at the law firm thinking about rapid recovery. ""It was a small fire ... but one building was completely out of commission for six months,"" Campbell told IBD. Time to gear up. ""These things happen in business, and you have to have a plan in place."" The firm's priority? ""Minimal, if any, disruption to our clients.""• Begin simply. Crafting strategies to deal with wide-ranging catastrophes can feel like a daunting undertaking. ""Start by trying to handle the most likely events first,"" Campbell said, like fire or regional weather events.• Keep it alive. Plans should evolve and periodically be reviewed, fine-tuned and practiced. ""It's always a work in progress,"" Campbell said. ""You can't forget about it. It's just like a fire drill.""• Commit. Many firms have an emergency plan, but only 30% of small-business decision-makers report having a formal business continuity plan, according to the Travelers Business Risk Index.Company chiefs should prioritize such preparation, which protects that bottom line. ""This isn't just a safety function. This is a business operational function,"" said Ken Katz, risk control property director with insurance firm Travelers (TRV).• Cover bases. Travelers' step-by-step approach, called ABC-Go, includes assessing risks, performing a business impact analysis, developing controls for prevention and mitigation, and testing the plan. ""These are mission-critical types of conversations,"" Katz said.• Spotlight it. Company leaders are wise to make the topic a priority and involve personnel from various departments. ""You need that breadth of experience,"" Katz said.• Add accountability.  Formalize the process by setting goals and deadlines. Some companies include disaster preparation as a responsibility within job descriptions. ""Now there's an incentive to keeping that going,"" Katz said.• Run through it. Test that plan. ""There's nothing like doing it"" for finding blind spots, said Katz.

298,TRV,"The Dow opened slightly higher on Wednesday morning as investors look to rebound from a brutal day of trading Tuesday that saw tech stocks drop en masse. With international trade fears cooled for now, the 30-stock Dow fared better during the selloff than the tech-heavy Nasdaq, suggesting that investors might be shifting their sector exposure to favor consumer staples and industrials right now.Tech’s recent volatility seems to stem from a combination of profit taking and new skepticism surrounding internet privacy in the wake of Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) latest data scandal. The famous “FANG” stocks—Facebook, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report)—have been among the worst performers.For those still bullish on tech, the selloff presents an interesting buying opportunity, especially with all signs pointing to another strong earnings season for the sector. However, some might be looking to move some cash out of the tech space and into lower-risk plays.With this in mind, the Dow 30 stocks include plenty of attractive options today. Check out these three Dow stocks to buy now!1.       The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report)This insurance giant has exposure to nearly all of the industry’s key markets, making it one of the largest and most well-known brands in the business. The company is also looking strong on the back of an improving earnings outlook and a solid financial position.TRV’s full-year EPS estimates have trended higher recently, with our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal period gaining $1.00 over the past 90 days. This positive revision activity has earned the stock a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Meanwhile, the company continues to be a cash cow, bringing in about $26 in cash per share right now.TRV uses its financial strength to reward shareholders and offers a dividend yield of 2.1%. Insurance might not be the most exciting industry, but investors might start flocking to cash-heavy income plays like TRV soon. 2.       Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report)This healthcare and consumer goods is likely outside of the problem areas that investors should be most cautious about right now, and its improving earnings outlook and attractive valuation make it an appealing bet right now.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for JNJ’s full-year earnings has gained 26 cents over the past 90 days, lifting the stock to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). JNJ is also trading at about 17x forward 12-month earnings, which represents its lowest earnings multiple over the past year. This company is also an income pick and offers a dividend yield of about 2.6%. 3.       The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report)Boeing was sold off amid concerns that China would target the company for retaliation against Trump’s latest batch of tariffs, but reports that U.S. officials were negotiating with Chinese regulators should cool these fears. With that said, investors can now scoop up this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock at a discount.Boeing owes its strong Zacks Rank to an improving earnings outlook, but the company is also well positioned to benefit from encouraging news. For instance, we recently learned that American Airlines (AAL) dropped its deal with Airbus, meaning that Boeing likely snagged a contract worth up to $8 billion.Boeing has sunk nearly 12% over the past month, but if trade negotiations go well, the stock should rebound just fine. Want more market analysis from this author?

299,TRV,"The Travelers Companies Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 earnings being revised upward over the last 60 days. While current-year estimates moved 0.3% north, the consensus mark for 2019 was nudged up 0.4%. This upward estimate revision reflects analysts’ optimism in the stock.Notably, the company is a leading provider of property-casualty insurance for auto, home and business.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) property and casualty insurer have inched up 1.4% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 1% and the S&P 500 index’s loss of 0.3%.  Travelers carries a favorable Value Score of B. Backtested results have shown that stocks with an impressive Value Score of A or B coupled with a bullish Zacks Rank offer best investment bets.Let’s focus on some factors that make Travelers a lucrative stock for greater returns.Improving Top line: The top line at Travelers increased nearly 18% since the financial downturn owing to higher net premium earned and rise in investment income. Factors such as a compelling product suit, improved scale, efficiencies, high retention rate, pricing gains, positive renewal rate changes will continue to drive premiums higher.Increasing Investment Income: Investment income has been growing over the last few quarters. Higher private equity returns offset fixed income returns due to lower reinvestment rates. Recently, the Fed has hiked the rate to 1.75%, indicating two more raises in 2018 and three in 2019, reflecting a progressing economic backdrop. Given an improving rate environment, we expect the momentum to sustain.  For 2018, Travelers anticipates about $25-$30 million of higher after-tax net investment income on a quarterly basis.Strong Underlying Underwriting Margins Guided: Underlying underwriting margin is a measure to assess the performance of a company or its segments. On the back of inherent strengths, Travelers projects higher underlying underwriting margins in 2018 across its Business Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance than the recorded tally in 2017.Effective Capital Management: A strong capital position helped Travelers hike its dividend at a 13-year CAGR of 9.6%. Also, it has $4.6 billion left under its existing share repurchase authorization.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $10.59 on revenues of 29.4%, representing a year-over-year surge of 45.6% for the bottom line and 2.6% for the top line.  For next year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share stands at $11.27, translating into a year-over-year climb of 4.8%. Revenues are likely to grow 3.9% to $30.5 billion.Travelers has an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 7.5%.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors also interested in other top-ranked property and casualty insurance stocks may check out Alleghany Corporation (Y  -  Free Report), Everest Re Group, Ltd.

302,TRV,"The Travelers Companies, Inc.’s (TRV  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 core income of $2.46 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.68 by 8.2%. However, the bottom line improved 13.9% year over year.The Travelers Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Travelers Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Travelers Companies, Inc. Quote This year-over-year increase in earnings can be attributed to higher net favorable prior-year reserve development along with a solid underlying underwriting gain. Moreover, lower income tax expenses, driven by the reduced U.S. corporate income tax rate also contributed to the upside. However, a benefit of $39 million in the prior-year quarter from the settlement of prior-year tax matters, partially offset this upside. Nonetheless, the bottom line was boosted by share buybacks.Behind the Q1 Headlines Total revenues of Travelers rose nearly 5% from the year-ago quarter to $7.3 billion. Also, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.2 billion. Net written premiums displayed a 5.1% year-over-year increase to $6.8 billion owing to growth in each business segment, namely Business and International Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance. Net investment income slid 1.1% year over year to $603 million on lower private equity returns. Increase in fixed income returns due to higher average level of fixed maturity investments as well as short-term interest rates, led to this downside.Travelers reported an underwriting gain of $258 million, up 22.3% from the year-ago quarter. Combined ratio improved 50 basis points (bps) year over year to 95.5% owing to higher net favorable prior-year reserve development and a benefit derived from catastrophe loss. However, a higher underlying combined ratio partially offset this improvement.At the end of the first quarter, statutory capital and surplus was $20.5 billion and the debt-to-capital ratio (excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains) was 23.4%. This was within the company’s target range of 15-25%. Adjusted book value per share was $84.54, up 3.7% year over year. Segment Update    Travelers’ Business Insurance unit reported net written premiums of $3.9 billion, up 3.6% year over year. A continued strong retention, an improved renewal premium change and a solid new business led to this upside. Combined ratio deteriorated 110 bps year over year to 97.5% due to higher underlying combined ratio as well as catastrophe loss. However, higher net favorable prior-year reserve development partially offset this downside. Segment income of $452 million grew 2.3% on the back of lower segment income before income taxes, which was more than offset by decreased income tax expense. Bond & Specialty Insurance: Net written premiums rose 5.5% year over year to $574 million, primarily driven by improved domestic surety premiums, a sustained solid retention plus an increased new business in domestic management liability. Combined ratio improved 470 bps year over year to 74.7% owing to lower underlying combined ratio as well as catastrophe loss along with higher net favorable prior-year reserve development. Segment income improved 19.3% year over year to $173 million, attributable to higher segment income before income taxes, partially offset by higher income tax expense. Personal Insurance: Net written premiums increased 7.6% year over year to about $2.3 billion. Combined ratio improved 210 bps year over year to 97.5%, backed by a higher net favorable prior-year reserve development and a benefit derived from catastrophe loss, partially offset by a higher underlying combined ratio. Segment income surged 44.9% to $129 million, attributable to higher segment income before income taxes, partially offset by higher income tax expense. Dividend and Share Repurchase Update The property & casualty (P&C) insurer returned total capital of $598 million to shareholders in the reported quarter. This included a buyback of 2.8 million shares worth $401 million. The company is now left with shares worth $4.2 billion for repurchase under its existing authorization at the end of the first quarter. The company’s board announced a quarterly dividend of 77 cents per share in the quarter under review, marking a 7% increase.

304,TRV,"The first-quarter earnings season is in its first leg with 87 members of the elite S&P 500 index having already reported financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances of these index participants indicate 25% increase in  total earnings  on 10.7% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 82.8% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 67.8% outperforming on the top-line front.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a sturdy performance till now with earnings growing 27.8% on 9.1% stronger revenues. The beat ratio is solid with 89.7% companies exceeding bottom-line estimates and 51.7% outpacing the top-line mark. Per Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to rise 27% on 5.4% more revenues.Integral to the Finance sector, the insurance industry is likely to witness better results this yet-to-be-reported quarter on the back of an improving rate environment, tax cuts, favorable operating environment and a better domestic growth scenario.Although the first quarter witnessed a California mudslide as well as northeast winter storms, the calamities still might not heavily weigh on the company’s underwriting profitability. Insurers having already suffered the severities of cat loss last year, should have managed to withstand the first-quarter shortfalls. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates first-quarter global insured cat loss between $5 billion and $10 billion.Improved pricing, prudent underwriting practices, portfolio repositioning as well as resorting to reinsurance covers are expected to have helped insurers survive the deficits.A progressing interest rate environment is likely to have boosted higher net investment income, an important component of an insurer’s top line. Though the same is far from reaching a historical high, yet it is showing an upward trend. With economic growth gaining traction, the Fed has hiked rate five times since December 2015 and has hinted two more raises this year, followed by three in 2019 and a couple of in 2020.The first quarter is likely to benefit from the tax cut.  Per the implementation of the new tax rate effective January 2018, the tax incidence has been lowered to 21% from 35%. This rate reduction will probably provide an additional boost to insurers’ bottom line.Apart from the above-mentioned tailwinds, diverse product offerings, a wide geographic footprint and strategic consolidations are anticipated to have enhanced insurers’ performance in the quarter to be reported.With 682 companies (178 S&P 500 members) set to announce earnings results this week, let’s find out where the following insurers stand ahead of their quarterly releases on Apr 24.Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) has projected catastrophe loss at nearly $125 million while loss from northeast winter storms is estimated at $195 million for the first quarter.Premiums  have probably increased on an improved commercial property and casualty pricing across numerous business lines as well as a compelling product portfolio. Higher net investment income is expected to have cushioned the company’s top line. Chubb expects its quarterly investment income run rate to range between $845 million and $855 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.24 per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects a 9.7% year-over-year decline. Chubb carries a bearish Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which decreases the predictive power of ESP. Further, combined with an Earnings ESP of -0.17%, makes surprise prediction unlikely as the company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.(Read more: Can Catastrophe Loss Mar Chubb's Q1 Earnings Prospects?)Chubb Limited Price and EPS Surprise Chubb Limited Price and EPS Surprise | Chubb Limited Quote You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The Travelers Companies, Inc.’s (TRV  -  Free Report) premiums are predicted to increase on the back of higher retentions and renewals, improving pricing environment, rise in new business as well as an expansive product portfolio. Pricing and underwriting actions implemented are forecast to consistently drive results in auto business.Given a not-so-active catastrophe environment and prudent underwriting practices, underwriting profitability has possibly improved. A lower tax rate provided an additional impetus to the bottom line. Nonetheless, a higher debt-level due to an increase in interest expenses constrain the margin expansion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.68 for the soon-to-be-reported quarter, up 24.1% year over year.  Though Travelers has a favorable Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of -1.21% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.

305,TRV,"The Dow experienced a volatile holiday shortened week, suffering losses during two trading sessions. Investors continued to remain concerned about rising inflation and surging bond yields. Disappointing results from a key component also weighed on the index. At the same time, encouraging jobs data helped the index notch up gains.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased about 0.1% to post its sixth straight session of gains. However, gains were curbed after Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted a group of Russian nationals and a few entities from the country regarding their involvement in the U.S. Presidential Elections of 2016. Meanwhile, housing starts surged to its highest levels since the financial crisis of 2008. Also, building permits rose to a 66-month high.The index gained 4.3% over last week, marking its biggest weekly gain since November 2016. President Trump signed into law a bipartisan budget deal that will provide a massive spending boost to the Pentagon and U.S. infrastructure. This in turn had a positive impact on key indexes.Markets managed to rebound after declining initially following a better-than-expected consumer prices report, a key inflation metric. Strong earnings season and steady economy led all the three key indexes to shrug off their yearly declines to close in positive territory.The Dow This WeekMarkets remained closed on Monday due to the observance of President's Day. The index decreased 1% on Tuesday following a decline in the shares of Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report). Shares of Walmart declined 10.2% after posting fourth-quarter results.Walmart snapped its nine-quarter long trend of posting positive earnings surprises. Also, rate of e-commerce sales growth declined sequentially in the quarter. This was Walmart’s biggest percentage decline in a single day since January 1988.After hitting its highest levels since 2014 last week, the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note surged to 2.9% on Monday. Further, the short-term two-year yield lingered around a nine-year high. Such a spike in interest rates also weighed on equities and led to broad based losses for markets.The index lost 0.7% or 167 points to finish in the red on Wednesday following the release of minutes from Fed’s latest policy meeting. Bond rates surged to a 4-year high following the release of the minutes and weighed heavily on equities. Earlier in the session, major benchmarks had rallied after the minutes expressed concerns about the lack of broad-based wage gains.At the end of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, Fed officials stated that most members had revised their economic growth projections upward from the last meeting in December. Moreover, the minutes also stated that gradually increasing the interest rates would help in sustaining economic growth.The index gained 0.7% on Thursday following encouraging jobs data which helped to detract attention from ongoing concerns surrounding rising inflation and the spike in bond yields. Initial claims for the week ended Feb 17 declined by 7,000 to 222,000, the second lowest level recorded since the end of the Great Recession.The metric also came in well below the estimated level of 230,000. Ultimately, however, stocks slipped from their session highs after healthcare and financials entered the negative zone during the afternoon session. Components Moving the Index Walmart’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.33 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36. Nonetheless, adjusted earnings grew 2.3% from $1.30 reported in the year-ago period. Total revenues advanced 4.1% to $136.3 billion and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of nearly $135 billion.The segment recorded net sales growth of 3.4% to $86.6 billion in the quarter. U.S. comparable-store sales (comps), excluding fuel, jumped 2.6%, compared with 1.8% growth in the prior-year quarter.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Walmart’s earnings for fiscal 2018 came in at $4.42 per share, up 2.3% year over year. However, this came below the consensus mark of $4.44. Net revenues for fiscal 2018 advanced 3% to $500.3 billion, cruising ahead of the consensus estimate of $498.1 billion.Notably, U.S. comps for fiscal 2018 climbed 2.1%, whereas Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales soared 44%.

307,TRV,"The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24 before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 50.00%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Premiums, contributing a lion’s share to the top line are expected to increase on the back of higher retentions and renewals, improving pricing environment, rise in new business as well as an expansive product portfolio. Each segment is likely to have delivered improved premiums. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $6.6 billion, up 1.3% year over year.Commercial businesses are expected to retain the momentum of delivering a better performance. Pricing and underwriting actions implemented are anticipated to consistently drive results in auto business.A gradual rise in interest rates continues to favor insurers. Travelers estimates $25-$30 million of higher after-tax net investment income on a quarterly basis compared with the tally in 2017. This projection is based on the growth of fixed income portfolio size, higher short-term interest rates, the new U.S. Tax reform as well as specific securities, scheduled to mature in 2018.Riding on the strength of improved premiums and net investment income, total revenues in the to-be-reported quarter are estimated to have increased. The Consensus Estimate for revenue is pegged at $7.2 billion, up 4.4% year over year.Given a not-so-active catastrophe environment and prudent underwriting practices, the company is likely to have delivered an improved underwriting profitability in the impending quarterly performance.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for combined ratio in the Insurances segment is pegged at 94%, improving 200 basis points year over year. Travelers estimates underlying underwriting margins in each segment to improve in 2018.A lower tax rate, courtesy of the new tax legislation effective this Jan 1, 2018, reduces tax incidence. This along with share buybacks is anticipated to have provided an additional boost to the bottom line. The consensus mark for the metric stands at $2.71, up 25.5% year over year.Nonetheless, a higher debt-level for an increase in interest expenses weighing on the margin expansion.What Our Quantitative Model StatesOur proven model states that Travelers is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

308,TRV,"The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 17 before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 2.60%.Factors to be Considered This QuarterAn expected increase in premiums, investment income coupled with higher service revenues and fees as well as other revenues are likely to have driven the top line in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the period’s revenues is pegged at $7.34 billion, up 17.1%.Both Personal and Commercial business lines are expected to have been benefited by strong a momentum in both its Vehicle and Property businesses. Thus, solid policies in force are anticipated to have improved premiums in the quarter.A solid retention ratio is attributable to diversified product portfolio as well as competitive pricing. Snapshot, Robinson and Home Quote Explorer programs are estimated to have boosted the business too.However, expenses might have increased due to higher losses and loss adjustment expenses, policy acquisition costs plus other underwriting expenses.Though there were cat events like the California mudslide and the northeast winter storms dominating the start of the year, underwriting results will still not be hampered to a greater degree. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates global insured cat loss in the first quarter between $5 billion and $10 billion, much lower than losses incurred in the past years.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.19 per share, reflecting 77.6% year-over-year growth.With respect to the earnings trend, the company delivered positive surprises in two of the last four quarters with an average beat of 5.01%.The Progressive Corporation Price and EPS Surprise The Progressive Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Progressive Corporation Quote What the Quantitative Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively show that Progressive is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

309,TRV,"In 2017, the insurance industry struggled to survive the wrath of an unprecedented hurricane activity which witnessed the landfall of Irma, Harvey and Maria besides the Mexico earthquakes and the California wildfires. These consecutive calamities resulted in a massive catastrophe loss, catapulting last year to one of the costliest periods ever in terms of such huge deficits. Per a report by Munich Re, overall catastrophe loss amounted to $330 billion with the insured losses coming in at $135 billion (less than half of the incurred losses).The intensity and impact of such catastrophe events shook the insurance industry big time with the losses deeply denting its underwriting results and adversely affecting the insurers’ earnings.The current year kick-started with the early January California mudslides, causing substantial damages to homes and businesses, and the northeast winter storms, which hit the East Coast on Jan 3 and Mar 1, 2018. In fact, among the property and casualty (P&C) insurers, Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) has projected total catastrophe loss of $305 million, which are likely to affect the company’s first-quarter 2018 results. Losses from the California mudslides are anticipated at $125 million pretax while northeast winter storms will account for $195 million in loss.Catastrophe Loss Impact: Still a Silver Lining in the Cloud?Although the calendar year has just crossed its first quarter, we think that there is still no need for insurers to hit the panic button yet. Analysts from Morgan Stanley have estimated global Q1 insured catastrophe loss to range between $5 billion and $10 billion, which is noticeably below the historical average of $14 billion.Per a report by Fitch Ratings, the insurance industry is expected to regain its substantial underwriting profitability in 2018, albeit at a slow pace. Moreover, combined ratios are likely to improve and might come close to break-even. Thus, insurance players can expect a better year in terms of catastrophe losses compared with the tumultuous journey in 2017.Further, catastrophe and rough weather-related events are a necessary evil for P&C insurers to improve their pricing as they eventually reduce competition. Also, occurrence of natural disasters might lead to an accelerated rate of policy renewals.Moreover, the industry has been strengthening its capital position with earnings growth and policyholders’ surpluses. Such solid liquidity profile will help insurers counter near-term volatility as well as the aftermath of adverse events.Given the unpredictable nature of weather-oriented episodes, catastrophe loss will always remain a concern for the P&C insurers and we wait to see how they tackle pressure or buckle under it, as the year progresses.On a positive front, better-than-expected underwriting results, a solid liquidity position and an evolving coverage opportunity should lend the P&C insurers enough support to grow.Interestingly, the industry has outperformed the broader market in the first quarter, evident from a gain of 0.7% against the S&P 500’s decrease of 1.2%. Outperformers in Q1There is a possibility of the catastrophe loss severity negatively impacting the results of insurers from this space in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. However, we expect some insurers to deliver favorable results on the back of a few positive factors.The increase in interest rate in March, which also marks the sixth increase post recession, reflects stability in the economy. Improving rate environment will aid investment income (forming a major portion of their revenues). Fed having promised two more rate hikes in 2018 alone, raises optimism.Lower tax incidence, growing GDP and an improving employment scenario have supported insurers’ performance.This apart, a bullish economic outlook (with the unemployment rate projected to grow at 3.8% in 2018 and the gross domestic product at 2.7%) is likely to add an impetus to the industry.Thus, the aforementioned positives will probably cushion the following stocks to push the envelope and yield profits via an underlying strength and business modification.With the help of our Zacks Stock Screener, we have boiled down to four stocks poised to beat earnings estimate despite all odds. Our parameters include a positive Earnings ESP, a favorable Zacks Rank and price outperformance compared with the industry in the first quarter. Also, these stocks deliver an average four-quarter positive surprise, highlighting operational excellence.Cincinnati, OH-based American Financial Group, Inc. (AFG  -  Free Report) provides property and casualty insurance products in the United States.

310,TRV,"After an exponential rise throughout 2017, the U.S. stock markets are witnessing volatility in 2018 so far. Both the major indexes — Dow 30 and S&P 500 — are in the red at present. Stock markets entered correction territory in February due to high inflationary expectations. Following a short resurgence, stocks continued to suffer in March due to President Trump’s tariff policies and the tech stock plunge, which can be attributed to certain company-specific issues.Moreover, U.S. stock markets plummeted on the first trading day of April. The broad-based market selloff in Apr 1 was the worst start to April since the Great Depression of 1929. However, the markets recovered thereafter primarily on the back of strong expectations from first quarter 2018 earnings results.Despite an overall decline, a strong bunch of 13 stocks out of the total portfolio of 30 stocks in the Dow has provided positive returns so far this year. Consequently, it would be a prudent move to invest in some of these stocks with favorable Zacks Rank at the moment.Dow Meltdown: Temporary PhenomenonU.S. stock markets opened on a positive note in 2018. However, markets took a U-turn in February due to fear of inflation which aggravated in March owing to President Trump’s trade policy.Subsequently, the blue-chip index shed 4.3% and 3.7% in February and March, respectively. On Mar 19, Dow plunged 335.60 points or, 1.35%, and closed at 24,610.91. This was the point when this closely watched equity market index ventured into the negative territory for the first time this year.The blue-chip index recovered in April with a gain of 0.4% so far this month. This occurred after trade war fears declined following conciliatory statements from the United States and China. However, on Apr 11, Dow lost 0.9% again as Trump announced his intent to launch a potential military attack on Syria, which is a close ally of Russia.Notably, the blue-chip index is still down 2.1% year to date. However, a closer look at the index’s composition will portray a different story. In 2017, 21 out of 30 stocks of Dow provided double-digit returns. Year to date, 13 stocks are already in the black while three have provided double-digit returns.Solid Earnings MomentumStrong earnings growth potential of major components is likely to aid the blue-chip index return to positive territory in the near-term. Earnings momentum is expected to continue in the first quarter of 2018 buoyed by strong economic fundamentals. Total earnings of the S&P 500 index is expected to be up 16% from the same period last year backed by 7.4% year-over-year growth in revenues. (Read More: Bank Earnings in the Spotlight)Newly introduced tax reforms and deregulation measures are likely to act as a major catalyst for Q1 earnings momentum.  The corporate tax rate was recently lowered from 35% to 21%. Moreover, repatriation of income will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%. President Trump has also promised removing 75% of the regulations during his tenure, which is likely to help private employers.Robust U.S. EconomyOn Mar 21, the Fed raised GDP growth forecast for 2018 to 2.7% from 2.5% in December 2017. A survey among economists conducted by The Wall Street Journal predicted U.S. GDP would rise 2.8% in 2018.Notably, a strong labor market is acting as the major driver of economic growth. The unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low of 4.1% in March, while workers’ hourly wages rose 8 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.82. In the first quarter of 2018, the labor market added 202,000 jobs on an average per month, better than the Q1 of previous two years.For March, the Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence index stands at 127.7, the second highest since November 2017. Business sentiment also remains healthy. Under Trump’s presidency, the U.S. manufacturing sector is witnessing strong business spending at factories for expensive durable items such as machinery and vehicles.Our PicksStock markets momentum remained largely unhindered despite recent volatility. Steady economic activities and business-friendly policies adopted by the government will pave the way for further stock market growth.At this stage, we narrowed down our search to five stocks within the Dow Jones Industrial Average, each of which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

311,TRV,"After a spell of high volatility driven by uncertainty over global trade policy and the threat of rise in prices of essential commodities, Wall Street is looking for some respite in the upcoming earnings season. Q1 is expected to be one of the strongest in years, both in terms of earnings and revenues. Such solid quarterly profits could provide support to the markets.Earnings expectations are rising of late mostly due to the recently-passed tax reform bill that sharply trims corporate tax rates. Upbeat economic scenario both at home and abroad is also one of the primary factors that will help earnings pick up pace.Given the positive trend, investing in blue-chip stocks that are likely to make the most of the earnings season seems judicious. But, why blue chips? This is because such stocks are positioned to report impressive earnings results as they mostly have a strong balance sheet and solid cash flow.Q1 Earnings Growth Expected to be StrongerBlue chips are expected to soar high as this earnings season unfolds. Total earnings among all sectors are estimated to improve 16% from the same period last year on 7.4% higher revenues. Such an uptick will follow 13.5% earnings growth on 8.5% revenue improvement last quarter, marking the best quarterly performance in more than six years (read more: Q1 Earnings to Take Wall Street by Storm: Top 6 Picks).The gains are likely to be broad-based, with nearly all the sectors expected to report year-over-year earnings growth, except for autos and conglomerates. The energy sector is poised to report highest earnings growth among all sectors. Materials, construction, industrial products, technology, financials, retail/wholesale, and medical to name a few are expected to contribute significantly.Catalysts Behind the Strong ExpectationsThe recent tax code overhaul and a strengthening economy could certainly help blue-chip companies make more money this upcoming earnings season.Republican-Backed Tax PackageRepublicans efficaciously defied opposition from Democrats to pass the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code that trimmed corporate taxes from 35% to 21%. At the same time, any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8-15.5%, instead of the current 35%.A one-time low tax rate on foreign profits will help blue chips bring funds held overseas back to the United States. This will help such companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, dividend payments and M&A activities. They also face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down.Strong Economic GrowthEconomic recovery is also likely to give a boost to profitability of American blue-chip companies. Trump’s economy is in the pink of health, with the unemployment rate remaining at a 17-year low of 4.1% in March, while workers’ hourly wages rose 8 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.82 in the month.The United States at the same time added an average of 202,000 jobs a month in Q1, faster than the average gains in the same period of 2017 and 2016. U.S. consumer sentiment in March reached its highest level since 2004, courtesy of a healthy job market.The global economy too is estimated to expand at a rate of 3.1% year over year in 2018. This comes on top of a promising 3% growth rate in 2017, per the World Bank.4 Blue Chips to Buy Heading into Earnings SeasonBlue chips are poised for a strong earnings season, mostly in response to the corporate tax cut policy and robust economic growth both at home and abroad.This calls for investing in some fundamentally sound blue-chip companies which can make the most of the earnings season. We have, thus, zeroed in on four such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) provides a range of commercial and personal property, and casualty insurance products and services to businesses, government units, associations, and individuals. Considering a more comprehensive earnings history, Travelers Companies has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 43.1%.

If this wasn’t enough, the company has an Earnings ESP of +2.00%. A positive Earnings ESP with a Zacks Rank 2 has resulted in positive earnings surprises 70% of the times over the past decade.

312,TRV,"Riding high on an improving economic backdrop, increasing interest rates and a benign catastrophe environment, the insurance industry seems well-placed to facilitate players in ramping up their growth profile.Recently, the Fed has raised the interest rate by 25 basis points under the new chairman Jerome Powell and the rate now stands at 1.75%. The Federal Reserve has hinted at two more hikes in 2018 followed by three in 2019 and two in 2020, thus pushing up the rate to 3.4%.An increased rate is expected to positively impact the net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line. A broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes are other upsides.Underwriting results — the major indicator of profitability for any insurer — are expected to improve on the back of a favorable catastrophe setting. Though, the first quarter escaped the wrath of Mother Nature, there were a few cat events like California mudslide and northeast winter storms. Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) has estimated $305 million of cat loss for the first quarter of 2018.Nonetheless, price increases by insurers will help generating improved premiums.Also, President Donald Trump’s tax reform policy, an overhaul of tax code after 31 years, lowers the corporate tax burden. The tax rate was slashed to 21% from 35%, calling for a $1.5-trillion tax cut.Interestingly, due to lower tax incidence, net profit available to shareholders will be higher, thereby leaving room for higher dividend payout by the companies.The Property and Casualty Insurance industry is ranked at #200, denoting the bottom half of the Zacks Industry Ranks for 265 plus industries. However, the industry’s registered rise of 1.3% has outperformed the S&P 500 index’s loss of 0.8% year to date. Here we focus on two property and casualty insurers, namely The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) and The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report). While the former with a market capitalization of $37.88 billion provides commercial and personal property plus casualty insurance products and services in the United states and internationally, the latter provides personal and commercial auto insurance, residential property insurance as well as other specialty property-casualty insurance and related services, primarily in the United States with a market cap of $35.7 billion.A better-ranked stock from the same industry is CNA Financial Corporation (CNA  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1Rank stocks here.Zacks RankTravelers carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Progressive has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Travelers emerges a clear winner in this round.Price PerformanceShares of Progressive have soared 55.9%, outperforming both Travelers’ rally of 15.9% and the industry’s increase of 17.2% in a year. The Progressive stock undoubtedly performs better with this metric. ValuationThe price to book value metric is the best multiple used for valuing insurers because of its variations in quarterly earnings. The industry’s P/B ratio is 1.43. However, both Progressive and Travelers with a reading of 3.84 and 1.59, respectively, are overvalued compared with the industry’s tally. Yet with a comparatively lower P/B ratio, Traveler’s shares are cheaply priced and hence the stock wins this round.  Debt-to-EquityTravelers has a lower debt-to-equity ratio of 27.6 compared with the industry average of 29.1% and Progressive’s leverage ratio of 35.6.  Therefore Travelers has a visible edge over Progressive here.  Return on EquityProgressive with a return on equity of nearly 16% exceeded the industry average of 4.8% as well as Travelers’s reading of 8.6%. Return on equity is a profitability measure, identifying how the company is effectively utilizing its shareholders’ money. Hence Progressive wins hands down this time. Dividend YieldBoth Travelers and Progressive underperform the industry’s dividend yield of 6.73%. Yet with 2.07% yield, Travelers scores higher than Progressive’s yield of 1.84%. Combined RatioCombined ratio, the percentage of premiums paid out as claims and expenses, determines an insurer’s underwriting profitability.Progressive’s combined ratio was 93.4 in 2017 while Travelers’s is 97.9. Thus Progressive edges past Travelers with this parameter.Earnings ESPBoth companies are set to report their earnings in the latter half of this month. Per our proven model, Travelers is set to deliver a positive surprise with the right combination of a favorable Zacks Rank of 2 and an Earnings ESP of +2.00%. While Progressive’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes prediction inconclusive although it has a favorable Zack Rank of 3.Earnings Surprise HistoryAs far as the companies’ surprise history goes, Travelers earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters with an average beat of 43.06%.Progressive’s metric too has outpaced the consensus mark in the last two quarters with an average four-quarter surprise of 5.01%.Travelers visibly beats Progressive in this round of the comparison game.Earnings Estimate Revisions and Growth Projections    Progressive’s 2018 earnings estimates have moved 5.1% north in the last 30 days. While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 has been revised 2.6% upward. The consensus mark for 2018 reflects 40.7% growth on 17.5% revenue increase. For 2019, the bottom line is expected to rise 5.2% on 12% higher revenues. The projected long-term earnings growth is pegged at 7.3%.For Travelers, the consensus mark for 2018 earnings has been raised 0.3% in the last 30 days while the same for 2019 has been revised upward only by a cent. The  consensus estimate for 2018 reflects 45.9% surge on 2.6% revenue improvement. For 2019, the bottom line is likely to increase 6.2% on 3.9% higher top line. The anticipated long-term earnings growth stands at 7.5%.This round lends equal weightage to both competitors.To ConcludeTravelers scored higher than Progressive on the basis of a solid Zacks Rank, valuation, sturdy leverage ratio, strong dividend yield and a robust earnings surprise history. However, considering yardsticks like price performance, return on equity or a combined ratio, Progressive seems better-equipped than Travelers. Per our comparative analysis, Travelers is thus, a more economically feasible investment option for investors than Progressive.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

However, a 4.2% year-over-year decline in net investment income and nearly 45% drop in other income limited this upside. The top line met the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Gross premiums written of $54.2 million increased 4.3%, driven by higher premiums written in livery/limousine in California and New Jersey, para-transit in Texas and taxi in Pennsylvania, partially offset by lower premiums written in para-transit in New Jersey and New York, taxi in Louisiana, and in all lines in Minnesota and Michigan.The company’s total expenses escalated 82.6% year over year to nearly $127 million due to a rise in net claims incurred, acquisition costs, interest costs and other underwriting expenses.Atlas Financial’s underwriting loss of $69.1 million is wider than $25 million loss suffered in the prior-year quarter.

314,TRV,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 6.2% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is TRV due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Travelers Q4 Earnings Surpass, Revenues Improve Y/YThe Travelers Companies’ fourth-quarter 2017 core income of $2.28 per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a whopping 39%. However, the bottom line deteriorated 28.8% year over year.    This year-over-year decline in earnings can be attributed to higher catastrophe loss due to California wildfires and a benefit in the prior-year quarter of $126 million pre-tax ($82 million after-tax) from the settlement of a reinsurance dispute. However, higher net favorable prior-year reserve development in the reported quarter partially offset this downside. Also, the bottom line was boosted by share buybacks.Full-Year HighlightsFor 2017, Travelers reported earnings per share of $7.28, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.6% but declined 28.1% year over year.Total revenues of $28.9 billion improved 4.6% year over year.Behind the Q4 Headlines Total revenues of Travelers rose nearly 3.6% from the year-ago quarter to $7.5 billion. Also, the top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.1 billion.Net written premiums displayed 6% year-over-year increase to $6.4 billion owing to growth in each business segment — Business and International Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance. Net investment income fell 4.1% year over year to $601 million on higher private equity returns. Lower private equity returns and a decrease in fixed income returns due to lower reinvestment rates available in the market, led to this downside.Travelers reported an underwriting gain of $266 million, down 54.9% from the year-ago quarter. Combined ratio contracted 550 basis points (bps) year over year to 95.5% due to higher underlying combined ratio and wider catastrophe loss, partially offset by higher net favorable prior-year reserve development.At the end of the fourth quarter, statutory capital and surplus was $20.4 billion and the debt-to-capital ratio (excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains) was 22.5%. This was within the company’s target range of 15-25%. Adjusted book value per share was $83.36, up 3.6% year over year.Segment Update    Travelers’ Business and International Insurance unit reported net written premiums of $3.4 billion, up 4.8% year over year. A continued strong retention, an improved renewal premium change and an increase in new business led to this upside. Combined ratio came in at 88.6%, remaining flat year over year. Segment income of $637 million declined 9.1%, mainly due to lower other income owing to a benefit in the prior-year quarter of $126 million pre-tax ($82 million after-tax) from the settlement of a reinsurance dispute. Bond & Specialty Insurance: Net written premiums rose 4.7% year over year to $606 million, primarily driven by improved domestic surety premiums, a sustained solid retention, higher renewal premium change plus an increase in new business in domestic management liability. Combined ratio deteriorated 1590 bps year over year to 83.7% due to higher underlying combined ratio and lower net favorable prior-year reserve development, partially offset by a favorable development on catastrophe loss that occurred earlier in 2017. Segment income plunged 34.9% year over year to $112 million due to lower underlying underwriting gain and net favorable prior-year reserve development. Personal Insurance: Net written premiums increased 8.3% year over year to about $2.4 billion. Combined ratio declined 1070 bps year over year to 108.7% due to higher catastrophe loss, partially offset by a lower underlying combined ratio and net favorable prior-year reserve development when compared with net unfavorable prior-year reserve development in the year-ago quarter. Segment loss of $50 million compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s segment income of $107 million. Noticeably, higher catastrophe loss — partially offset by a higher underlying underwriting gain and net favorable prior-year reserve development plus compared with the net unfavorable prior-year reserve development in the year-ago quarter — led to this result. Dividend and Share Repurchase Update The property & casualty (P&C) insurer returned total capital of $549 million to shareholders in the reported quarter. This included a buyback of 2.6 million shares worth $351 million in the quarter under review. The company is now left with shares worth $4.6 billion for repurchase under its existing authorization at the end of the fourth quarter. The company’s board announced a quarterly dividend of 72 cents per share in the reported quarter, payable on Mar 30, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business as of Mar 9, 2018.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month.

324,TRV,"Wall Street suffered a vicious sell-off in Monday’s trading session with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipping into a correction territory, when the index shed nearly 1,600, or 6.3% at one point. This marks the biggest one-day drop for the Dow in its 122-year history. At this level, the blue-chip index fell more than 10% from its recent peak notched on Jan 26, officially marking a correction.However, the losses recovered slightly closing the day with 1,175 points or 4.6% drop, its steepest decline since August 2011. The steep sell-off sent the index into a negative territory for the year, eroding all the powerful gains made so far. The Dow Jones is currently down 8.5% from its peak and 1% for this year.  What Happened?Though negative concerns started to build up early last week, the panic in the stock market began Friday when the blue-chip index notched its worst day since the Brexit mayhem of June 2016, tumbling 666 points or 2.5%. The slide came following the January job report, which shows the strongest wage growth in more than eight years that sparked fears of inflation, sending Treasury yields higher.Notably, the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to as much as a four-year high of 2.88% in Monday’s trading session, dulling the appeal of the equities over bonds.Investors are worried that rising inflation could push the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly than anticipated, resulting in higher borrowing costs for companies that will hurt economic growth and in turn the most powerful bull market drawing close to nine-year. The Fed has targeted three rates hike for this year but some economists believe inflationary pressures could lead to another lift-off.  Though every stock in the Dow Jones witnessed huge declines on the day, with many slipping into the negative territory for this year along with the index, there are still a few that are in the green from a year-to-date look. We have highlighted five of these below:Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report): This world's largest aerospace company and leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners and defense, space and security systems is still up 11.5% so far this year. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a top Growth Score of A. It has seen solid earnings estimate revision of $1.22 for this year over the past seven days, with an expected earnings growth rate of 10.38%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Travelers Companies Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report): This company provides a range of commercial and personal property, and casualty insurance products and services to businesses, government units, associations, and individuals in the United States and internationally. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of C. It saw positive earnings estimate revision of couple of cents for this year in the past week with an estimated earnings growth of 45.47%. Shares of TRV are up more than 4% this year.Nike Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report): This is the world's leading designer, marketer and distributor of authentic athletic footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories for a wide variety of sports and fitness activities. The stock is up nearly 3% and saw positive earnings estimate revision of a penny for this fiscal year (ending May 2018) in the past week but has an estimated earnings decline of 9.96%. Nike carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a Growth Score of B.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report): This technology company develops, licenses and supports software products, services and devices worldwide. It has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of C. Though it saw no earnings estimate revision for this fiscal year (ending June 2018) in the past week, its shares hold up well in the current turmoil with nearly 3% gains. Microsoft is expected to post earnings growth of 8.46% for this fiscal year.  Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report): Shares of this global leader in digital payments are still up nearly 2% so far this year. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of D. It saw solid earnings estimate revision of 13 cents for the fiscal year (ending September 2018) with an estimated earnings growth of 22.99%.Bottom LineEven with a steep decline, the Dow Jones is up almost 40% since Trump’s election given that strong fundamentals remain intact. Strong corporate profits, healthy economic growth and euphoria surrounding the biggest tax overhaul in decades are acting as the key catalysts to the bull market.Given this, investors could take the current turmoil as a good buying opportunity for the most-beaten stocks.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

325,TRV,"American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8, after market close. Results are expected to suffer from weak performance of its Commercial segment, loss from catastrophes and a lower amount of share buyback.The company’s Commercial insurance segment has been underperforming for several quarters. In 2016, the segment reported a pre-tax operating loss of $2.74 billion while the same registered $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2017. The segment is reeling under a rise in core losses and adverse development to account for current loss trends. Given that the company has exited some of the casualty lines business, we expect the top line to remain under pressure.The company’s nature of operations exposes it to weather-related losses. Catastrophes have historically imparted volatility to the company’s earnings. The company suffered nearly $3 billion of losses from the recent catastrophic events. AIG expects to incur loss of $500 million from the California wildfires that will hurt fourth-quarter margins. Other players in the same industry, Travelers Companies (TRV  -  Free Report), incurred a loss of $499 million from the same calamity, while Chubb Ltd. (CB  -  Free Report) suffered a loss of $477 million.The company’s newly appointed CEO has made a significant shift in its capital utilization strategy in a bid to turn the stock around and achieve greater profitability. Management now expects to utilize capital for possible acquisitions in international markets, boosting the company’s personal and lifeline segments plus investing in the domestic middle market as opposed to its hitherto usage of capital resource for share repurchases. Thus, a lower amount of share buyback will somewhat be less accretive to the bottom line.Margins will however, see an upside from its cost-control efforts. Some of the actions in this regard were a reduction in headcount, freezing of pension plans and divestiture of underperforming units. These steps led to a 13.4% decline in gross operating expense in 2016, which went further down by 14.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2017. We believe that the company’s strict cost controls will provide an extra cushion to its operating margins.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company does not have an attractove earnings surprise history. It missed earnings estimates in two of the last four quarters with an avearge negatove surprise of 7.3%. This is depicted in the chart below:American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | American International Group, Inc.

326,TRV,"Property and casualty insurer Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) is expected to release fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 7, after the market closes.Let’s Take a Look at the Factors Influencing Q4 ResultsAllstate expects to incur a loss of $516 million from the California wildfires. This, in turn, might dent the company’s underwriting results to some extent.For the first nine months of 2017, this property and casualty insurer incurred $2.64 billion loss due to the catastrophe, up 16.1% year over year. Other players in the same industry, The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) incurred a loss of $499 million from the same calamity, while Chubb Ltd. (CB  -  Free Report) suffered a loss of $477 million.We expect results to gain from a decline in the frequency of auto accidents and improved profitability in auto insurance, reflecting the profit improvement actions initiated in 2015.Meanwhile, investments made for long-term growth in businesses such as Allstate Benefits, SquareTrade and its connected-car platform at Arity seem to be paying off, as evident from an increase in the company’s current policies and higher premiums. We expect the trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, the company is gradually gaining ground after suffering from declining income in its investment portfolio for the past many years due to market volatility and low interest rates. Net investment income rose 11% for the first nine months of 2017, reflecting higher performance-based results and stable income from market-based portfolios. We expect an increase in net investment income in the fourth quarter.The bottom line will also get support from Allstate’s share buybacks.Through the first nine months of 2017, the company repurchased 10 million shares or 2.7% of those outstanding at the beginning of the year. It further remains on track in executing the $2 billion share repurchase program that was approved in August 2017.Earnings Surprise HistoryAllstate boasts an attractive earnings surprise history. It surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 56.9%. This is depicted in the chart below:Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Allstate Corporation (The) QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Allstate is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

335,TRV,"The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 17 before the market opens. Last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 2.60%.Factors to be Considered in Q2The top line is likely to have witnessed improvement in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by an expected increase in premiums, investment income coupled with higher service revenues and fees as well as other revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the period’s revenues is pegged at $7.9 billion, up 19.7%.Solid policies in force are anticipated to have improved premiums in the second quarter.Strong performing Vehicle and Property businesses might have benefited Personal and Commercial business lines.The company’s continued spending on marketing and competitive product offerings plus a sturdy market presence should consistently drive personal auto business.However, expenses might have increased due to higher loss and loss adjustment expenses, policy acquisition costs plus other underwriting expenses.The company’s Property business has already gained traction. Given its expanded footprint and a compelling product offering, the Property business is expected to have delivered solid results.   Though there were cat events like rain storms in the United States, underwriting results will still be not severely hampered.

336,TRV,"The splendid run of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since Trump’s win in the presidential election is known to all. In its northbound march, the blue-chip index crossed 25,000 for the first time in its 120-year history on Jan 4 and was just 200 points away from hitting 26,000 as of Jan 12, 2018. The index breached the 20,000-mark on Jan 6, 2017 and the rest is history.Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged 60.3% in the last two years and gained about 30.1% in the last year (as of Jan 12, 2018). Trump’s tax reform and promises of deregulation acted as the wind beneath the wings. While almost all stocks staged solid performances lately on the passing of the tax reform, a few are likely to soar higher in the days to come.Below we highlight those stocks and the related ETFs that are set to gain ahead.Boeing As per an article published on MarketWatch, Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) indicated that it would shell out $300 million on workforce-related and charitable investments. The tax reform enables Boeing “to better compete on the world stage and give us a stronger foundation for the investment in innovation, facilities and skills that will support our long-term growth.”The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has about 11% weight in iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report)), 7% focus on PowerShares Aerospace & Defense PPA), and another 7% on Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report) (read: 8 Power-Packed ETFs for 2018).Wal-Mart Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

337,TRV,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Travelers Companies has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16.6, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 21.5. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Travelers Companies’ current PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 29.8. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Travelers Companies has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 19.9, so it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Travelers Companies has a P/S ratio of about 1.3. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Travelers Companies currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Travelers Companies a solid choice for value investors.For example, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 4.8, which is far better than the industry average of 15.1. Clearly, TMK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Travelers Companies might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of F. This gives TRV a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been going down lately. The current quarter has seen no estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to six lower, while the full year estimate has seen two up and one down in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 26.5% in the past two months, while the next year estimate has decreased by 9.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:The Travelers Companies, Inc. Price and Consensus The Travelers Companies, Inc. Price and Consensus | The Travelers Companies, Inc. QuoteThis negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineTravelers Companies is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 38% compared to over 250 industries) further underlines the potential of the company overall. In fact, over the past two years, its industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below: However, a Zacks Rank #3 indicates analysts have some apprehensions about the stock in the immediate future. So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

338,TRV,"RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RNR  -  Free Report) expects to incur catastrophe (cat) loss of $90 million, from the California wildfires.In the fourth quarter, these losses will further weigh on the company’s bottom line.RenaissanceRe incurred a loss of $9.63 per share for the first nine months of 2017 compared to earnings of $5.14 in prior-year period.Unprecedented catastrophe led to net claims and claims expenses of $1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2017, significantly higher than $0.4 billion in the year ago period.AIR Worldwide, a catastrophe modeling firm expects insured losses from wildfires to exceed $10 billion.This specialty insurer has witnessed multiple weather-related losses in 2017. The results in the third quarter were severely hurt by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the Mexico City Earthquake. These natural calamities are estimated to have caused damages of more than $100 billion and underwriting losses at many insurers and reinsurers.So far this year, the stock has declined by 5.9%, underperforming the industry’s growth of 17%.   Losses Estimates Provided by Other PlayersThe Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) has estimated pre-tax catastrophe loss of $516 million for October 2017 due to California wildfires.Another insurance giant, American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) has projected $500 million loss from the same event.Travelers Cos. Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) estimates pre-tax loss in the range of $525 million to $675 million and after-tax loss in the $340 million to $440 million band.Bottom LineOn the face of it, catastrophe losses resulted in an increase in loss ratio, thereby hurting insurers’ underwriting margins. However, these losses act as catalysts in turning the industry's pricing cycle. The industry which has amassed a huge capital buffer and led to soft pricing (thanks to a benign cat loss environment in recent years) will likely see price surge in certain lines of business that have been mostly affected.RenaissanceRe carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

341,TRV,"The Finance sector is set to kick off its earnings season this week with major banks reporting quarterly results. Improving rate environment and tax cuts should continue to drive the sector’s performance.  Per the Earnings Outlook, earnings for the sector are expected to increase 18.5% on 3.6% higher revenues.Insurers, an important component of the Finance sector, are shortly going to release their financial numbers. Earnings of the Insurance Industry are envisioned to grow 12.2% in the second quarter, given a slew of tailwinds favoring its operating environment.Progressing Rate EnvironmentThe second quarter of 2018 marked the second rate hike by the Federal Reserve this year, reflecting a robust economy. The rate now stands at 2% with the regulatory body’s intentions of two more raises in 2018 followed by three in 2019 as well as a couple of in 2020.A Benign Cat EnvironmentAlthough the second quarter escaped the harsh lashes of Mother Nature, a few cat events like rain storms in the United States and Canada still plagued the period. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates global insured cat loss of about $7.1 billion in the quarter under discussion. The analyst also noted that the count is much lower than the general tally of around $14 billion insurers having suffered natural calamities in any given second quarter.However, price hikes, prudent underwriting practices, portfolio repositioning and adherence to reinsurance covers will help insurers withstand the deficits.Also, lower cat loss means lower claims, which in turn, strengthens reserves. The insurance industry is already boasting an all-time sturdy capital position.While surplus capital is lending a cushion to more capital deployment in growth initiatives, mergers and acquisitions plus shareholder value addition, the same is also responsible for restricting the desired pricing.

The bottom line improved about 11.1% year over year.American Financial Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise American Financial Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | American Financial Group, Inc. Quote The quarter benefited from increased underwriting profit in Property and Casualty Insurance Segment, partially offset by the impact of fair value accounting in our Annuity Segment.Notably, results reflect an all-time high mark for the company.Including 92 cents per share in write-down of net deferred tax asset due to the impact of a lower U.S. corporate tax rate, loss on early retirement of debt of 29 cents, 81 cents in non-core income from the reinsurance to close transaction involving Neon’s 2015 and prior years of account and tax benefits from restructuring Neon, and net realized gains of 4 cents, net income came in at $1.84 per share, having plunged 58% year over year.Behind the HeadlinesTotal operating revenues of $1.7 billion rose 7.1% year over year. The top-line growth can be attributed to higher net investment income and P&C insurance net earned premiums. Revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.3 billion.Net investment income of $465 million grew 8.4% year over year.American Financial’s total cost and expenses came in at $1.5 billion, up 8.5% year over year due to higher P&C insurance losses & expenses, annuity, life, accident & health benefits plus expenses, interest charges on borrowed money, expenses of managed investment entities and other expenses.Full-Year HighlightsOperating earnings of $6.55 per share for 2017 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.05.

Increase in net premiums written in the Property & Transportation (up 8%), Specialty Casualty (9%) and Specialty Financial (1%) on a year-over-year basis resulted in the upside.Underwriting profit of the segment surged 42% to $156 million, driven by higher underwriting profitability in Specialty Casualty and Property and Transportation Groups.The segment’s combined ratio improved 310 basis points (bps) year over year to 8.3% owing to improvement of 130 bps and 740 bps in combined ratios of Property & Transportation and Specialty Casualty divisions, respectively. However, deterioration of 20 bps in the combined ratio of Specialty Financial division was a partial offset.The Annuity segment’s statutory premiums of $909 million declined 17.4% year over year, attributable to pricing discipline in a still soft interest rate environment.Pretax income came in at $97 million, down 27% year over year.Financial UpdateAs of Dec 31, 2017, American Financial had cash and investments of $46 billion, up 11.1% from the level of $41.4 billion at 2016-end.Long-term debt of $1.3 billion at 2017-end inched up 0.1% from 2016-end level.

The bottom line improved 11% year over year.Nasdaq, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Nasdaq, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nasdaq, Inc. Quote Higher revenues as well as growth across the segments namely Market Services, Information Services and Market Technology supported this upside.

This represents a $16-million increase from buyouts and a $7-million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by a $6-million organic expense decrease.Nasdaq guided 2018 non-GAAP operating expense to the range of $1.375-$1.415 billion.Segment wise, net revenues at Market Services nudged up 0.9% from the year-ago quarter to $222 million. This upside was driven by improved revenues from cash equity trading, fixed income and commodities trading and clearing and trade management services. However, lower equity derivative trading and clearing revenues limited the upside.Revenues at Corporate Services increased 1.8% year over year to $170 million.

Subsequently, in January 2018, Nasdaq’s board members announced another $500 million buyback program, taking the tally to $726 million.Our TakeNasdaq’s results reflect a solid performance. Growth looks encouraging as the company remains focused on expansion through acquisitions and organic initiatives that enable entry and open up cross-selling opportunities into new markets. The top line should also benefit from the company’s consistent focus on its strategy to accelerate non-transaction revenue base including technology, listing and information revenues.Zacks RankNasdaq carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

344,TRV,"The spectacular run in the Wall Street is showing no signs of slowing down with the bull market now drawing close to nine years. Strong corporate earnings as well as the biggest tax overhaul in decades have been driving the latest rally. Notably, the new tax structure will save billions in the corporate world, boosting earnings and reflation trade. It would further spark a wave of share buybacks, dividend hikes and mergers & acquisitions.The Q4 earnings season is off to a strong start, with earnings of 133 S&P 500 companies that have reported results, up 12.3% from the same period last year on 8.8% higher revenues, with 81.2% beating EPS estimates and 78.9% beating revenue estimates. Overall, total earnings and revenues are projected to grow 11.6% and 5.9%, respectively (read: 4 ETFs Set to Surge in Q4 Earnings).Solid global growth, jump in oil prices, and a weak dollar are adding to the strength. The rally defied the ills of both economics and politics like global trade fears, political instability in Washington and geopolitical tensions.Given the bullish trend, momentum investing would be a winning strategy for those seeking higher returns in a short spell. This is because the strategy looks to fetch profits from buying hot stocks that have shown an uptrend over the past few weeks or months.As such, we have presented few ETFs and stocks that hit new highs in the latest trading session.

345,TRV,"It has been a month since the last earnings report for The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 2.4% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Travelers Q3 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Slump Y/YTravelers’ third-quarter 2017 core income of 91 cents per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents by a whopping 75%. However, the bottom line plunged 62.1% year over year. This year-over-year decline in earnings can be attributed to massive catastrophe losses caused by the unprecedented hurricane activity. However, an increased net investment income partially offset this downside. Also, the bottom line was boosted by share buybacks.Notably, the company delivered record net premiums this quarter, driven by the company’s well-rounded execution of its marketplace strategies.Behind the Q3 Headlines Total revenue of Travelers improved nearly 5.2% from the year-ago quarter to $7.3 billion. Also, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.0 billion.Net written premiums displayed a record 4.2% year-over-year increase to $6.7 billion owing to growth in each business segment — Business and International Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance. Net investment income inched up 1% year over year to $588 million owing to higher private equity returns. This improvement, however, was partially offset by a decrease in fixed income returns due to lower reinvestment rates available in the market. Travelers reported an underwriting loss of $246 million in contrast to the underwriting gain of $408 million in the year-ago quarter. Combined ratio deteriorated 1030 basis points (bps) year over year to 103.2% due to higher underlying combined ratio, wider catastrophe losses as well as lower net favorable prior-year reserve development. At the end of the third quarter, statutory capital and surplus was $20.7 billion and the debt-to-capital ratio (excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains) was 23.3%. This was within the company’s target range of 15-25%. Adjusted book value per share was $83.06, up 5.4% year over year. Segment Update    Travelers’ Business and International Insurance unit reported net written premiums of $3.4 billion, up 1.4% year over year. A continued strong retention, an improved renewal premium change and an increase in new business led to this upside. Combined ratio came in at 109.8%, deteriorating 1370 bps year over year due to wider catastrophe losses and a higher underlying combined ratio. However, higher net favorable prior-year reserve development partially offset this downside. Segment income of $105 million plummeted 75.8% due to significantly higher catastrophe losses and a lower underlying underwriting gain. Bond & Specialty Insurance: Net written premiums nudged up 1.8% year over year to $611 million, primarily driven by record retention and positive renewal premium change. Combined ratio deteriorated 710 bps year over year to 77.7% due to lower net favorable prior-year reserve development and higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by a lower underlying combined ratio. Segment income dropped 17.6% year over year to $136 million due to lower net favorable prior-year reserve development. Personal Insurance: Net written premiums increased 8.9% year over year to about $2.6 billion. Combined ratio deteriorated 620 bps year over year to 99.7% due to higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by a lower underlying combined ratio and no net unfavorable prior-year reserve development when compared with net favorable prior-year reserve development in the year-ago quarter. Segment income of $77 million slumped 52.8% due to noticeably higher catastrophe losses. However, this downside was partially offset by higher underlying underwriting gain. Dividend and Share Repurchase Update The property & casualty (P&C) insurer returned total capital of $528 million to shareholders in the reported quarter. This included a buyback of 2.6 million shares worth $328 million in the reported quarter. The company is now left with shares worth $4.9 billion for repurchase under its existing authorization at the end of the third quarter. The company’s board announced a quarterly dividend of 72 cents per share in the reported quarter, payable on Dec 29, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business as of Dec 11, 2017.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions lower for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted lower by 26.2% due to these changes.The Travelers Companies, Inc.

In fact, this marked the economy’s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid-2009.The economy was boosted by solid consumer spending, which increased at 3.8% over the quarter after a 2.2% gain in the third quarter. Consumer outlays registered its fastest pace of growth in the fourth quarter in almost two years. Companies also ramped up spending in the fourth quarter by 6.8%. Among other bright spots, government spending also increased at a clip of 3%.Weak Dollar Bodes Well For Large-CapsAdditionally, during the week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that any weakness in the dollar was beneficial for trade. His comments led to the ICE U.S. Dollar Index falling to its lowest level since Dec 2014 on Wednesday. Although, later Mnuchin said that his remarks regarding dollar was “misinterpreted.”Meanwhile, President Trump in the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland said that ""the dollar is going to get stronger and stronger” and eventually he wished the greenback to strengthen. However, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index fell 1.5% for the week to settle at 89.07, following Mnuchin’s comments. A weaker dollar bodes well for large-cap multinationals, which generate revenues mainly from buyers outside the U.S.Weekly RoundupFor the week, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq gained 2.1%, 2.2% and 2.3%, respectively.

356,TRV,"Assurant, Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 net operating loss of $1.40 per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of $1.79. Also, the net operating loss in the reported quarter compared unfavorably with the net operating income of $1.00 in the year-ago quarter. Significantly higher catastrophe losses resulted in such a weak earnings performance.Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Assurant, Inc. QuoteNonetheless, the company remains focused on delivering its full-year 2017 financial objectives. Also, the company anticipates its buyout of The Warranty Group to boost its opportunities to scale and enhance lifestyle offerings in 2018, while experiencing more predictable and diversified earnings as well as cash flow in the long term.Total revenues fell 7.9% year over year to $1.6 billion, mainly due to lower premiums earned. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.6%.Net investment income improved 6.3% year over year to $132.6 million.Total benefits, losses and expenses increased 5% to $1.7 billion, mainly due to a significant increase in policyholder benefits.Segmental PerformanceAssurant has revised its reportable segments in keeping with its evolved global operating model, which supported its multi-year transformation. As of fourth-quarter 2016, Assurant reported through four segments — Global Housing (formerly known as the Assurant Specialty), Global Lifestyle (formerly included in the Assurant Solutions), Global Preneed (formerly included in the Assurant Solutions) and Corporate & Other.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Housing fell about 8.4% year over year to $530.3 million, primarily due to anticipated lower placements rates in lender-placed insurance as well as catastrophe premiums. Also, reduced demand for originations and field services, together with the decrease in client volumes in mortgage solutions led to this downside. However, revenue growth in multi-family housing partially offset this downside.The company reported net operating loss of $110.3 million, which compared unfavorably with the net operating income of $44.5 million in the year-ago quarter. This dismal performance was mainly attributable to the $186.8 million of catastrophe losses arising from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria as well as the Mexico City earthquake.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Lifestyle declined 9.3% year over year to $841.7 million. This deterioration was primarily attributable to a change in program structure for a large service contract client in Connected Living, implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016.Net operating income of $42.6 million surged 50.5% year over year. The upside was driven by a tax benefit of $9.6 million along with growth in mobile and additional real estate joint venture partnership income.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Preneed grew 3.2% year over year to $44.6 million, primarily owing to growth in the United States and Canada, especially in Final Need.Net operating income declined 14.6% year over year to $12.3 million due to lower real estate joint venture investment income.Net operating loss at Corporate & Other was $13 million, substantially narrower than the year-ago quarter net operating loss of $17.4 million. Lower taxes and reduced corporate expenses in the reported quarter, drove this improvement.Financial PositionAssurant’s financial position remains strong with around $570 million in corporate capital as of Sep 30, 2017. Total assets rose 9.1% to $32.4 billion as of Sep 30, 2017, from $29.7 billion at year-end 2016.Share Repurchase and Dividends UpdateThe company’s total share buybacks and dividends amounted to $63 million in the third quarter. While share buyback totaled $34 million, dividend payout totaled $29 million.The company anticipates to complete its return of $1.5 billion of capital to shareholders by the end of 2017. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company has $408 million remaining in the current repurchase authorization.2017 OutlookAssurant estimates net operating income (excluding reportable catastrophe losses) to increase on a moderate basis compared with the 2016 level. This is primarily on the back of anticipated profitable growth in fee-based, capital-light offerings (comprising Connected Living, multi-family housing and mortgage solutions) and lower net operating loss at Corporate. However, declines in lender-placed insurance and other legacy businesses are likely to limit this uptrend.Assurant projects operating earnings per share (excluding catastrophe losses) to grow in double-digits from 2016 owing to share buyback activity.The company expects Global Housing to witness a year-over-year decline in its net earned premiums and net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses. Further decline in the ongoing lender-placed insurance normalization, which represents lower placement rates for the second half of 2017, along with reduced contributions from mortgage solutions are anticipated to reduce the above-mentioned metric. However, expense savings and profitable growth in multi-family housing are likely to partially offset this downside.Global Lifestyle’s net operating income is likely to increase owing to an improved performance in Connected Living, fueled by growth in new and existing mobile programs as well as higher contributions from vehicle protection and expense efficiencies. The decline in credit insurance and legacy North American retail clients is likely to continue. The company anticipates revenues to fall, primarily due to a change in program structure for a large service contract client. In addition, the company estimates net earned premiums to decrease by about $500 million from 2016 due to reduction in expenses. This apart, the company might witness a rise in net earned premiums and fee income owing to growth in Connected Living and vehicle protection globally. However, results are likely to be impacted by foreign exchange.Global Preneed is anticipated to experience an increase in its fee income and earnings, mainly on the back of the company’s alignment with market leaders and operational efficiencies.Assurant expects full-year net operating loss to range between $55 million and $60 million at Corporate & Other compared with $71 million in 2016, thanks to lower tax and employee-related costs as well as reduced corporate expenditures.Zacks RankCurrently, Assurant carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other InsurersAmong other firms from the insurance industry that have reported third-quarter earnings so far, the bottom line of The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report), The Travelers Companies, Inc.

357,TRV,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 1.1% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is TRV due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Travelers Q1 Earnings Miss Estimates, Revenues BeatThe Travelers Companies, Inc.’s first-quarter 2018 core income of $2.46 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.68 by 8.2%. However, the bottom line improved 13.9% year over year.This year-over-year increase in earnings can be attributed to higher net favorable prior-year reserve development along with a solid underlying underwriting gain. Moreover, lower income tax expenses, driven by the reduced U.S. corporate income tax rate also contributed to the upside. However, a benefit of $39 million in the prior-year quarter from the settlement of prior-year tax matters, partially offset this upside. Nonetheless, the bottom line was boosted by share buybacks.Behind the Q1 Headlines Total revenues of Travelers rose nearly 5% from the year-ago quarter to $7.3 billion. Also, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.2 billion. Net written premiums displayed a 5.1% year-over-year increase to $6.8 billion owing to growth in each business segment, namely Business and International Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance. Net investment income slid 1.1% year over year to $603 million on lower private equity returns. Increase in fixed income returns due to higher average level of fixed maturity investments as well as short-term interest rates, led to this downside.Travelers reported an underwriting gain of $258 million, up 22.3% from the year-ago quarter. Combined ratio improved 50 basis points (bps) year over year to 95.5% owing to higher net favorable prior-year reserve development and a benefit derived from catastrophe loss. However, a higher underlying combined ratio partially offset this improvement.At the end of the first quarter, statutory capital and surplus was $20.5 billion and the debt-to-capital ratio (excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains) was 23.4%. This was within the company’s target range of 15-25%. Adjusted book value per share was $84.54, up 3.7% year over year. Segment Update    Travelers’ Business Insurance unit reported net written premiums of $3.9 billion, up 3.6% year over year. A continued strong retention, an improved renewal premium change and a solid new business led to this upside. Combined ratio deteriorated 110 bps year over year to 97.5% due to higher underlying combined ratio as well as catastrophe loss. However, higher net favorable prior-year reserve development partially offset this downside. Segment income of $452 million grew 2.3% on the back of lower segment income before income taxes, which was more than offset by decreased income tax expense. Bond & Specialty Insurance: Net written premiums rose 5.5% year over year to $574 million, primarily driven by improved domestic surety premiums, a sustained solid retention plus an increased new business in domestic management liability. Combined ratio improved 470 bps year over year to 74.7% owing to lower underlying combined ratio as well as catastrophe loss along with higher net favorable prior-year reserve development. Segment income improved 19.3% year over year to $173 million, attributable to higher segment income before income taxes, partially offset by higher income tax expense. Personal Insurance: Net written premiums increased 7.6% year over year to about $2.3 billion. Combined ratio improved 210 bps year over year to 97.5%, backed by a higher net favorable prior-year reserve development and a benefit derived from catastrophe loss, partially offset by a higher underlying combined ratio. Segment income surged 44.9% to $129 million, attributable to higher segment income before income taxes, partially offset by higher income tax expense. Dividend and Share Repurchase Update The property & casualty (P&C) insurer returned total capital of $598 million to shareholders in the reported quarter. This included a buyback of 2.8 million shares worth $401 million. The company is now left with shares worth $4.2 billion for repurchase under its existing authorization at the end of the first quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

364,TRV,"The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) has made a name for itself, offering a wide range of property and casualty (P&C) insurance plus surety products and services. Its reputation rides high on the successful catering to its clients’ diverse needs. Historically, the clients have largely benefitted from the company’s bouquet of diverse insurance products and services and by retaining this optimism, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) P&C insurer continues to evolve stronger over time and looks set to repeat its winning streak in the near future.Growth DriversAs a leading provider of property-casualty insurance for auto, home and business, Travelers has been able to sustain its strong market position and benefit from it, reaping economies of scale. The company remains focused on implementing pricing and other actions to continue increasing returns and more importantly, improving profitability.The P&C insurer’s commercial business has been delivering a solid performance, driven by consistent stability in the markets where it is operational as well as renders wise strategic execution.Investment income, an important component of insurers’ top line, has been improving over the past several quarters, backed by higher private equity returns. The P&C insurer anticipates witnessing better investment results in the near term owing to a slow but steady improving pace of interest rates. For 2018, Travelers Companies projects about $25-$30 million of higher after-tax net investment income on a quarterly basis compared with the same in 2017.On the back of improving investment income and premium growth, the company has been witnessing an upward trend in relation to its top line. We expect the company to continue displaying this positive trend in the near term, which in turn is likely to accelerate the company’s overall growth.Underlying underwriting margin is a measure to assess the performance of a company or its segments. On the back of inherent strengths, Travelers estimates higher underlying underwriting margins for the remainder of 2018 across its Business Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance than the recorded tally in 2017.A strong capital position aids the company to return value to its shareholders via dividend hikes and buybacks. The company has made 14 straight dividend raises, witnessing a 14-year CAGR of 10%. Also, its dividend yield of 2.37% is better than the industry yield of 2.36%. It has $4.2 billion left under its existing share repurchase authorization.Shares of Travelers have gained 8.4% in a year’s time, underperforming the industry’s 17.6% rally. However, we expect the company’s aforementioned strengths to turn the stock around in the near term. Growth Projections: The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share being pegged at $10.44 on revenues of $29.46 billion. While the top line reflects a year-over-year rise of 2.9%, the bottom line represents an increase of 43.4%. For 2019, the consensus mark for the metric stands at $11.30 on $30.64 billion revenues. While revenues represent a 4% improvement, earnings reflect 8.3% growth.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Travelers displays an encouraging earnings surprise history, having outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 43.50%.Near-Term HeadwindsBeing a P&C insurer, the company has been suffering catastrophe loss for a considerable period of time, thus rendering volatility to its earnings. Such a massive loss has already hurt the company’s underwriting profitability with the combined ratio deteriorating in the last few years.Nonetheless, underlying combined ratio is likely to trend lower for Business Insurance and Personal Insurance segments for the remainder of 2018 compared with the recorded figure in 2017. With respect to Bond & Specialty Insurance, the metric is expected to remain consistent for the next two quarters with the levels reported in the same period of 2017. For the last quarter of 2018, the company predicted the combined ratio to be lower year over year, attributable to a charge for a single international surety loss in fourth-quarter 2017.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Alleghany Corporation (Y  -  Free Report), Markel Corporation (MKL  -  Free Report) and RLI Corp. (RLI  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Alleghany provides property and casualty reinsurance and insurance products in the United States and internationally.

368,TRV,"The Travelers Companies, Inc.’s (TRV  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 core income of $2.28 per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a whopping 39%. However, the bottom line deteriorated 28.8% year over year.The Travelers Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Travelers Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Travelers Companies, Inc. QuoteThis year-over-year decline in earnings can be attributed to higher catastrophe loss due to California wildfires and a benefit in the prior-year quarter of $126 million pre-tax ($82 million after-tax) from the settlement of a reinsurance dispute. However, higher net favorable prior-year reserve development in the reported quarter partially offset this downside. Also, the bottom line was boosted by share buybacks.Full-Year HighlightsFor 2017, Travelers reported earnings per share of $7.28, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.6% but declined 28.1% year over year.Total revenues of $28.9 billion improved 4.6% year over year.Behind the Q4 Headlines Total revenues of Travelers rose nearly 3.6% from the year-ago quarter to $7.5 billion. Also, the top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.1 billion. Net written premiums displayed 6% year-over-year increase to $6.4 billion owing to growth in each business segment — Business and International Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance. Net investment income fell 4.1% year over year to $601 million on higher private equity returns. Lower private equity returns and a decrease in fixed income returns due to lower reinvestment rates available in the market, led to this downside.Travelers reported an underwriting gain of $266 million, down 54.9% from the year-ago quarter. Combined ratio contracted 550 basis points (bps) year over year to 95.5% due to higher underlying combined ratio and wider catastrophe loss, partially offset by higher net favorable prior-year reserve development.At the end of the fourth quarter, statutory capital and surplus was $20.4 billion and the debt-to-capital ratio (excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains) was 22.5%. This was within the company’s target range of 15-25%. Adjusted book value per share was $83.36, up 3.6% year over year. Segment Update    Travelers’ Business and International Insurance unit reported net written premiums of $3.4 billion, up 4.8% year over year. A continued strong retention, an improved renewal premium change and an increase in new business led to this upside. Combined ratio came in at 88.6%, remaining flat year over year. Segment income of $637 million declined 9.1%, mainly due to lower other income owing to a benefit in the prior-year quarter of $126 million pre-tax ($82 million after-tax) from the settlement of a reinsurance dispute. Bond & Specialty Insurance: Net written premiums rose 4.7% year over year to $606 million, primarily driven by improved domestic surety premiums, a sustained solid retention, higher renewal premium change plus an increase in new business in domestic management liability. Combined ratio deteriorated 1590 bps year over year to 83.7% due to higher underlying combined ratio and lower net favorable prior-year reserve development, partially offset by a favorable development on catastrophe loss that occurred earlier in 2017. Segment income plunged 34.9% year over year to $112 million due to lower underlying underwriting gain and net favorable prior-year reserve development. Personal Insurance: Net written premiums increased 8.3% year over year to about $2.4 billion. Combined ratio declined 1070 bps year over year to 108.7% due to higher catastrophe loss, partially offset by a lower underlying combined ratio and net favorable prior-year reserve development when compared with net unfavorable prior-year reserve development in the year-ago quarter. Segment loss of $50 million compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s segment income of $107 million. Noticeably, higher catastrophe loss — partially offset by a higher underlying underwriting gain and net favorable prior-year reserve development plus compared with the net unfavorable prior-year reserve development in the year-ago quarter — led to this result. Dividend and Share Repurchase Update The property & casualty (P&C) insurer returned total capital of $549 million to shareholders in the reported quarter. This included a buyback of 2.6 million shares worth $351 million in the quarter under review. The company is now left with shares worth $4.6 billion for repurchase under its existing authorization at the end of the fourth quarter. The company’s board announced a quarterly dividend of 72 cents per share in the reported quarter, payable on Mar 30, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business as of Mar 9, 2018. Zacks Rank Travelers has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

376,TRV,"The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 23 before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 139.47%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.We expect catastrophe loss arising from the recent California wildfires to weigh on underwriting results of the company. Such losses also render volatility to the company’s earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the period to be reported is pegged at $1.64, representing a year-over-year slump of 48.8%.With respect to revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $7.1 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 0.3%.Travelers has projected a pre-tax catastrophe loss including estimated recoveries from reinsurance between $525 million and $675 million pre-tax or $340 million and $440 million after-tax. This will weigh on underwriting profitability, leading to deterioration in the company’s combined ratio.Despite gradual improvement in interest rates, the company anticipates a fall in net investment income in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Travelers estimates about $10 million or less of lower after-tax net investment income on a quarterly basis compared with that of 2016. Travelers has provided this estimate on the basis of the size of its fixed income portfolio, higher short-term interest rates along with specific securities, scheduled to mature through the end of next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net investment income stands at $562 million, a 10.4% decline on a year-over-year basis.Nonetheless, the company expects to see premium growth, primarily fueled by improving premiums across each business segment as well as successful marketplace strategies. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net written premiums is pegged at $6.5 billion, indicating nearly 6.7% rise on a year-over-year basis.A major contributor to the overall premium, Business Insurance segment has likely witnessed higher premiums, primarily fueled by strong production results in select and middle markets. This in turn will help boost the company’s revenues as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Business Insurance revenues is $4.1 billion, representing an increase of 19.6% on a sequential basis.Additionally, the company is estimated to have experienced high retention rates and an increase in new business across its commercial businesses.Further, the company predicts improved profitability in auto business at its Personal Insurance segment owing to implementation of favorable pricing and underwriting actions. Also, the company is on track to achieve a double-digit renewal premium change on a written basis in the fourth quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Travelers is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Travelers has an Earnings ESP of -10.69%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.47, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate’s $1.64.

Price and EPS Surprise | The Travelers Companies, Inc. Quote Zacks Rank: Travelers sports a Zacks Rank of 1, which although increases the predictive power of ESP. A company, however, needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around are as follows:The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Jan 24 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.52%.

382,TRV,"The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 7.25%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We expect a high level of losses arising from catastrophic events like Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and Mexico earthquakes. These calamities are likely to leave a significant impact on the underwriting results of the company, which in turn is anticipated to weigh heavily on the property and casualty (P&C) insurer’s overall performance.Travelers has projected a pre-tax catastrophe loss between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after-tax. This will weigh on underwriting profitability and lead to deterioration in the combined ratio. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 96%.Further, the company is expecting to witness a fall in net investment income in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, owing to the still low interest rate environment. Travelers estimates about $15-$20 million of lower after-tax net investment income on a quarterly basis compared with 2016. Travelers has provided this estimate on the basis of the current interest rate environment and the specific securities, scheduled to mature in 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net investment income is currently pegged at $558 million, a 6.7% decline on a sequential basis.Nonetheless, the company expects to see improvement in its premiums to drive its top-line growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2017 is $7.1 billion that represents an increase of 1.5% from the prior-year quarter.Business Insurance segment, which contributes majorly to the overall premiums, have likely witnessed higher premiums primarily fueled by strong production results in select and middle markets, thereby boosting the company’s revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Business Insurance revenues is $4.1 billion, which comes in line with that of the previous quarter.Further, Travelers’ premium growth will primarily be fueled by improving premiums across each business segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net written premiums is currently pegged at $6.41 billion, indicating nearly 1% rise on a sequential basis.Additionally, the company expects to experience improved profitability in auto business at its Personal Insurance segment owing to implementation of favorable pricing and underwriting actions. Also, the company is on track to achieve a double-digit renewal premium change on a written basis in the third quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Travelers is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Travelers has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 60 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Travelers carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which decreases the predictive power of ESP. Hence, we caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Further, combined with a negative ESP, confidence about an earnings surprise is visibly ruled out.The Travelers Companies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  The Travelers Companies, Inc.

383,TRV,"AXIS Capital Holdings Ltd. (AXS  -  Free Report) has recently announced its preliminary catastrophe loss estimate of $578 million, net of tax and estimated recoveries from reinsurance and retrocessional covers including the impact of estimated reinstatement premiums for third-quarter 2017. These losses stemmed from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and the Mexican tremors.While the insurer expects its insurance segment to incur cat losses of $315 million, the reinsurance segment is anticipated to incur $302 million in losses.These estimates are inclusive of the loss expectations from Novae Group plc, acquired by the company on Oct 2, 2017. Axis Capital has announced Novae’s expected catastrophe loss estimates of $60 million, net of estimated recoveries from reinsurance and are inclusive of the impact of estimated reinstatement premiums.Being a property and casualty insurer, AXIS Capital is highly exposed to losses resulting from natural disasters, man-made catastrophes and other catastrophic events. Underwriting results have thus been affected for years now. For the first half of 2017, AXIS Capital incurred $76 million in catastrophe loss, narrower than the year-ago loss of $63 million. Underwriting income deteriorated 33% with 260 basis points contracting in its combined ratio.Exposure to catastrophe events has always been a concern for the company because of the uncertainty of their occurrences as well as the magnitude of their impact.  The company maintains comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance coverage for its insurance segment, comprising facultative reinsurance, property per risk treaty reinsurance and property catastrophe treaty reinsurance. However, irrespective of the techniques deployed by the company to ease off catastrophes, exposure to weather-related calamities makes its earnings volatile.Other insurers too have come up with their loss estimates. The Navigators Group, Inc. (NAVG  -  Free Report) estimates to incur catastrophe loss of $50-$70 million pre-tax ($33-$45 million after-tax) in the third quarter. XL Group Ltd. (XL  -  Free Report) estimates catastrophe losses of $1.48 billion pre-tax or $1.35 billion post-tax. The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) predicts pre-tax catastrophe loss from Harvey between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after-tax. Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementAxis Capital Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Shares of the company have massively underperformed the industry in a year’s time due to natural disasters. While the stock has gained 1.5%, the industry has registered an increase of 25.8%.

385,TRV,"The third-quarter earnings season has begun with 26 of the S&P 500 index members having already reported their results. Only about 1% of the companies from the Finance sector have reported so far, marking 13.5% earnings growth on 14% higher revenues per our Earnings Outlook.  However, a soft performance from the insurance industry will drag the Finance sector’s third-quarter results. Per our Earnings Outlook, earnings are estimated to decline 45.1% on 0.7% lower revenues.Being integral to the insurance industry, property and casualty insurers have suffered the wrath of a slew of catastrophes. Spells of tropical storms and tremors have rocked the operational performance of non-life insurers for the third quarter. While Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc in August, Irma and Maria devastated parts of the United States in September.  Adding to the woes, two consecutive earthquakes also hit Mexico last month.Per the catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide, the insured loss estimates from Irma could range between $25 billion and $35 billion and between $40 billion and $85 billion from Maria. Moody’s Analytics earlier estimated economic losses from Irma come in the $58-$83 billion band while that from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion. Capital reserve, built by insurers owing to a not-so-active catastrophe environment, will help companies meet insurance claims.  Underwriting profitability of insurers will be affected by deterioration in combined ratio due to catastrophe losses incurred. This in turn will drag the companies’ bottom line.  Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in underwriting results, insurers have braced themselves with prudent underwriting practices to withstand the loss to some extent.Amid bad news, there are reasons for insurers to fall back on for cushion. Though the Fed hadn’t approved the rate hike at the last September meet, the interest rate has been nonetheless improving, albeit at a slower pace, courtesy three hikes made since December 2016. Investment income has also markedly improved from historical lows.Strategic initiatives to have a diversified portfolio, mergers and consolidation to accelerate growth and expand globally, capital influx and effective capital deployment to enhance shareholders’ value position non-life insurers on a solid base against all odds.Nevertheless, a beleaguered operating environment has shoved the industry down the ranking order to be currently placed at #242, thus representing the bottom 9% of the Zacks Industry Rank. The industry has also underperformed the S&P 500 index year to date. While the index has clocked a rally of 11.7%, the industry has gained 13.9%.Move Over the Following StocksWe picked stocks carrying a bearish Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) with an adverse VGM Score, as estimates moved downward over the last 30 days.

386,TRV,"Markel Corporation (MKL  -  Free Report) recently announced pre-tax catastrophe loss estimates, originating from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and two Mexican earthquakes. The company projects catastrophe loss of about $503 million, net of reinstatement premiums.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at $7.02 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 25.4%. We expect estimates to move downward as analysts incorporate impact of catastrophe losses.Being a property and casualty insurer, Markel will bear the brunt of the disaster caused by these catastrophe events, weighing on its underwriting profitability. Nonetheless, the company’s underwriting profit has been improving over the years owing to its niche focus, effective management of insurance risk and focus on developing and maintaining underwriting as well as pricing guidelines on existing products and new product development.Notably, the company’s combined ratio has been better than the industry average over the last five years through 2016, though the same deteriorated 500 basis points in the first half of 2017 due to less favorable development on prior-year loss reserves.Irrespective of catastrophe alleviating techniques, severe blows from weather-related calamities make earnings unstable and hazardous. Nonetheless, Markel is capable of meeting insurance claims, courtesy a sturdy balance sheet.Shares of Markel have rallied 20.8% year, outperforming the industry’s increase of 12.3%. Strong operational results driven by insurance, investments and Markel ventures should continue to drive shares.Markel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Also, the bottom line improved 5.2% on a year-over-year basis.The company’s quarterly performance was driven by solid organic growth, outstanding revenue improvement from the tuck-in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and a strong margin expansion. The company also witnessed a strong performance across all segments.Net profit rose 2.9% year over year to 71 cents per share.Operational UpdateTotal revenue was $1.6 billion, up 6.9% year over year.

Gallagher’s total expense rose 7.2% year over year to $1.5 billion in the quarter. Expenses escalated due to a rise in compensation costs, operating costs, interest expenses, cost of revenues from clean coal activities, plus higher depreciation and amortization expenses as well as a change in estimated acquisition earnout payables.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization and change in estimated acquisition earnout payables (EBITDAC) increased 10.4% to $238.8 million.  Segment ResultsBrokerage: Adjusted revenues of $953.1 million grew 7.9% year over year on higher commissions.

388,TRV,"Shares of The Navigators Group, Inc. (NAVG  -  Free Report) have slid 1.8% in the last three trading sessions after the company announced expected catastrophe loss estimates emanating from Hurricane Harvey, Irma and Maria and two Mexican tremors. The company anticipates to incur catastrophe loss of $50-$70 million pre-tax ($33-$45 million after-tax) in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at 65 cents per share, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 7.1%. We expect the estimates to move downward as analysts incorporate impact of catastrophe losses.Despite challenging market conditions, in 2016, the company had delivered underwriting profits for the fifth year with a combined ratio of 96.7%. However, underwriting profit plunged 38.2% compared with 2015 as the International Insurance underwriting segment was adversely affected by North American exposures underwritten at Lloyd’s. The recent catastrophe events are expected to weigh heavily on the company’s underwriting income, draining its margins in the process.  Third-quarter 2017 was one of the costliest in history with respect to cat loss. Mass devastation rampaged parts of the United States, which again bore the brunt of a slew of hurricanes and ravages of successive tremors.While Harvey shook Houston and Texas Gulf Coast, Irma ran roughshod in regions across the Caribbean to Florida. Both storms are considered the deadliest in a decade. No sooner than the country had experienced a breather with Hurricane Jose not turning as destructive as expected than another hurricane Maria happened to hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.A catastrophe loss materially reduces profitability, thereby affecting the companies’ finances. Being a property and casualty insurer, The Navigators Group will not escape the disaster caused by such catastrophe events. Irrespective of the techniques deployed by the company to ease catastrophes, exposure to weather-related calamities makes its earnings volatile.Other insurers too have come up with their loss estimates. W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB  -  Free Report) has recently projected a catastrophe loss of about $110 million, which translates to a $72 million after-tax. Assurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has estimated between $134 million and $140 million pre-tax of reportable catastrophe losses from Harvey and expects gross losses from Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pre-tax. The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) estimates pre-tax catastrophe loss from Harvey between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after-tax.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementThe Navigators Group carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of the company have underperformed the industry in a year’s time. While the stock has gained 20%, the industry has rallied 25%.

389,TRV,"The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) has been witnessing downward revisions over the last 60 days, evident from its  bearish Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Catastrophe loss dragging its underwriting performance as well as lower investment income will weigh on the company’s earnings results.Estimate Revisions: The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 15.5% downward. Estimates for 2018 have declined 0.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third and fourth-quarter 2017 reflects year-over-year decline of 63.6% and 13.2%, respectively. The full-year estimate represents a 26.7% slump.Share Price Performance: Shares of Travelers have gained 2.9% in a year, lagging the industry’s growth of 12.2% as well as the S&P 500’s 13.5% gain.Earnings ESP and Surprise History: Travelers has an Earnings ESP of -3.34%. This is because the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 87 cents, higher than the Most Accurate estimate of 84 cents. The company has a discouraging earnings track record, having failed to surpass estimates in two of the last four quarters.Our proven model does not conclusively show if the company is likely to beat estimates when it reports third-quarter results on Oct 19. This is because Traveler’s unfavorable Zacks Rank of 4 lowers the predictive power of ESP, thereby spoiling chances of an earnings beat. Further, combined with a negative Earnings ESP, surprise prediction becomes difficult.VGM Score: Travelers carries an unimpressive VGM Score of G. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum with the score being a weighted combination of all three factors. It presently has a Growth Score of F.Factors Weighing on the PerformanceExposure to catastrophe events has weighed on underwriting profitability. A string of hurricanes and two Mexican tremors will be a drag on insurers’ underwriting profits.  The company expects to incur pre-tax catastrophe loss between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million post-tax from Harvey.Being a property and casualty insurer, Travelers will certainly not escape the disaster caused by these tropical storms and earthquakes.  Due to inclement weather events, its underwriting results have taken a severe beating. Notably, the company has been witnessing high level of catastrophe losses for a considerable period of time. Specifically, the last quarter marked the maximum catastrophe losses since 2011. Combined ratio has also been deteriorating.In fact, the insurer has temporarily ceased its share repurchase program in the wake of the catastrophes as part of capital management strategy during a considerable stretch of catastrophic environment.Though the Federal Reserve is gradually increasing the interest rate, it still remains low. For 2017, Travelers anticipates about $15-$20 million of lower after-tax net investment income on a quarterly basis, compared with 2016.The company has also been incurring higher expenses, which has been heavily hurting the operating income as well as the bottom line.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report), Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF  -  Free Report) and Radian Group Inc. (RDN  -  Free Report).Radian Group supports homebuyers, mortgage lenders, loan servicers and investors with a suite of private mortgage insurance and related risk-management products and services.

390,TRV,"Multi-line insurer American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) expects to incur catastrophe (cat) loss of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion ($1.9 billion to $2.0 billion after-tax), net of reinsurance, in the third quarter.The loss is related to hurricanes Harvey ($1.1 billion to $1.2 billion), Irma ($1 billion to $1.1 billion) and Maria ($600 million to $700 million). The Mexico earthquake is estimated to cause $150 million of loss.The loss will be incurred in the company’s Commercial segment, which benefited in the previous quarter from low catastrophe loss.We expect the segment’s profitability to suffer in the third quarter from high loss claims at a time when the segment’s top line is already weighed down by challenging market conditions.Year to date, the stock has lost 5.4%, underperforming the industry which recorded growth of 7.2%.  Third-quarter 2017 was one of the costliest in history with respect to cat loss. Mass devastation was seen in parts of the United States which continued to be ravaged by a number of hurricanes one after another.While Harvey rocked Houston and Texas Gulf Coast, Irma ran amok in regions across Caribbean to Florida. Both storms are considered the costliest in a decade. No sooner the country had heaved a sigh of relief, with Hurricane Jose not turning not as destructive, another hurricane, Maria, hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Maria is already deemed as a Category 5 storm.Economic losses from Irma are estimated at about $58-$83 billion while the same from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion by Moody’s Analytics. Catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimates industry insured losses for Hurricane Maria in the Caribbean between $ 40 billion and $85 billion.Other insurers too have come up with their loss estimates. Assurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has estimated between $134 million and $140 million pre-tax of reportable catastrophe losses from Harvey and expects gross losses from Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pretax.The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) estimates pre-tax catastrophe loss from Hurricane Harvey between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after tax. HCI Group, Inc. (HCI  -  Free Report) projects loss between $100 million and $300 million from Hurricane Irma.On the face of it, catastrophe losses cause a spike in loss ratio and hurt insurers’ underwriting margins. However, these losses act as catalysts in turning the industry's pricing cycle. The industry which has amassed a huge capital buffer and led to soft pricing (thanks to a benign cat loss environment in recent years) will likely see price hardening in certain lines of business that have been affected  the most.AIG carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

391,TRV,"W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB  -  Free Report) has recently announced estimated catastrophe loss estimates erupting from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and earthquakes in Mexico. The company projects catastrophe loss of about $110 million, which translates to $72 million after-tax. Shares of the company have slid 0.2% in the last two trading sessions following the announcement.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at 37 cents per share, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 58.4%. We expect the estimates to move south as analysts incorporate the catastrophe loss impact.Catastrophe losses have traditionally had a significant impact on the company’s results. In 2016, the company incurred cat losses of $105.1 million, which were 82.5% wider than 2015. However, in the first half of 2017, the company witnessed a much lower level of weather-related losses, due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. Catastrophe loss came in at $47.5 million, a substantial decline of 15.5% compared with the first half of 2016. The recent cat loss will further escalate claim losses, thereby draining margins.While Harvey rocked Houston and Texas Gulf Coast, Irma hit regions spanning across Caribbean to Florida. Both storms are considered the costliest in a decade. No sooner had the country heaved a sigh of relief — with Hurricane Jose not turning as destructive as anticipated — than another hurricane Maria, happened to strike Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.Per the catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide, the estimate for insured losses from Irma could range between $25 billion and $35 billion and between $40 billion and $85 billion from Maria. The Mexican tremors will cost the insurance industry billions, per the same catastrophe risk modeler.Being a property and casualty insurer, W.R. Berkley will not escape the disaster caused by these catastrophe events, weighing on the underwriting profitability in the process.

392,TRV,"The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) and subsidiaries’ ratings were reiterated by A.M. Best. The credit rating giant has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A++ (Superior) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of “aa+” for Travelers’ property/casualty units. The abovementioned subsidiaries of this property and casualty (P&C) insurer are collectively referred to as Travelers Group.This apart, the rating agency has also affirmed the FSR of A++ (Superior) and the Long-Term ICR of “aa+” for Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America and affiliates, Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of Europe Limited plus Travelers Insurance Company of Canada.At the same time, the credit rating giant has reiterated the Long-Term ICR and senior Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR) of “a+” for Travelers and its two wholly owned downstream holding companies — Travelers Property Casualty Corp. and Travelers Insurance Group Holdings Inc. Additionally, the other Long-Term IR and Short-Term Issue Credit Rating (Short-Term IR), assured by Travelers as well as its indicative Long-Term IRs, have also been reiterated by the rating agency. Notably, the outlook for each of the aforementioned ratings remained stable.Further, the credit rating giant has also affirmed the FSR of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICR of “a” for The Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company. The outlook for each of these ratings remained stable.Also, the rating agency has affirmed the FSR of A- (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICR of “a-” for First Floridian Auto and Home Insurance Company. The outlook for these ratings also remained stable.Furthermore, A.M. Best reiterated the FSR of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICR of “a+” of The Premier Insurance Company of Massachusetts — a Travelers’ arm — representing a stable outlook. However, the rating agency has withdrawn the ratings of this unit on Premier Insurance’s request of non-participation in the rating agency’s interactive rating procedure.Ratings Representation of Travelers GroupRatings affirmation represent Travelers Group’s strong risk-adjusted capitalization, solid operational performance and favorable underwriting results, together with outstanding market position in commercial and personal lines plus an efficient management team. Also, the ratings also recognize the group’s active and inclusive risk management, underwriting and financial discipline, improved technology and internal information systems plus product and geographic diversification to name a few. Additionally, the ratings take into account the financial flexibility and liquidity contributed by Travelers.The current intensely competitive environment across property/casualty markets, substantial exposure to catastrophe events and disasters as well as issues faced in the company’s personal auto business might offset the aforementioned positive rating factors in its case. It is important to note that the rating agency anticipates a similar situation in 2017 in the wake of catastrophe losses pertaining to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, likely to ail the earnings performance.Details Behind the Ratings of Different SubsidiariesThe ratings of Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America and its 100% reinsured affiliate (Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of Europe Limited), which in turn are also the company’s two units mainly acknowledge their robust consolidated risk-adjusted capitalization, specialized underwriting experience, positive underwriting and operational performance as well as their leading position in surety, fidelity and management liability segments.However, Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America’s constrained product diversification, together with the adverse effect that ongoing competitive property/casualty markets and difficult macroeconomic conditions might leave on premium and profitability levels, can partially offset the aforementioned positive rating factors of both the subsidiaries.Talking of Travelers Insurance Company of Canada, this unit’s ratings represent its excellent risk-adjusted capitalization, positive underwriting and operating profitability plus outstanding brand recognition to name a few.However, the ongoing soft market sentiment along with inflated expense ratio can partially offset the aforementioned positive rating aspects.On the other hand, The Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company’s ratings reflect its strong risk-adjusted capitalization, superior brand recognition and well-established nationwide Canadian market presence to name a few.However, the subsidiary’s inconsistent operational performance, existent intense competitive environment and continued lower investment yields can offset the positive rating factors.Additionally, the ratings of First Floridian Auto and Home Insurance Company reflect the company’s robust risk-adjusted capitalization, local market focus as well as operational efficiencies to boot.However, the arm’s continued yet decreasing exposure to catastrophe losses along with a single state geographic concentration in Florida, might partially offset the positive rating factors.Lastly, The Premier Insurance Company of Massachusetts’ ratings consider its firm risk-adjusted capitalization, sustained operational performance and additional operational back up besides the financial flexibility provided by Travelers Group and the ultimate parent company, Travelers.However, the unit’s continual underwriting losses for over time, limited line of business as well as its single-state concentration are likely to partially offset the positive rating pointers.Rating affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies play a vital role in retaining investor confidence plus maintaining a stock’s credit worthiness. On the other hand, rating downgrades not only damage business but also increase the cost of future debt issuances. We believe that such ratings will help Travelers retain investors’ trust as well as write more businesses going forward.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementCurrently, Travelers carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Shares of the company have gained 1.7% year to date, massively underperforming the industry’s increase of 12.1%.

393,TRV,"RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RNR  -  Free Report) expects to incur catastrophe (cat) loss of $625 million (net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums) in the third quarter.The loss will emanate mainly from hurricanes Harvey ($225 million) and Irma ($175 million). The Mexico earthquake and hurricane Maria, together, will cause $225 million of losses.   The loss is expected to weigh on the company’s combined ratio. The company incurred 14% year-over-year higher claim expenses of $0.34 million in the first half of 2017. The recent cat loss will further amplify claim loss, draining margins.A meaningful portion of reinsurance and insurance written by the company provides protection from damages relating to natural and man-made catastrophes. So its results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of catastrophic events, and the coverages offered.The company continues to suffer from soft pricing in the reinsurance market, which has been continuing for the last seven years now. Year to date, the stock has gained a mere 1.2%, vastly underperforming the industry which recorded growth of 11.4%.  Third-quarter 2017 was one of the costliest in history with respect to cat loss.

Also, the operating loss in the reported quarter compared unfavorably with the operating income of $1.78 in the year-ago quarter.

This improvement was driven by 55% higher premiums written in the Reinsurance segment and 10.2% higher premiums written in the Insurance segment.Net investment income declined 18.6% year over year to $95.2 million, driven by change in fair value of alternative investments.Total expense in the quarter shot up 85.9% year over year to $1.6 billion due to higher net losses and loss expenses, acquisition costs, foreign exchange losses and transaction related expenses.AXIS Capital reported underwriting loss of $512.9 million against the underwriting income of approximately $104 million. Combined ratio deteriorated 6030 basis points (bps) to 152.9%. Catastrophe and weather-related pre-tax net losses were $317 million, largely attributable to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and Mexico earthquakes. The figure is significantly wider than the loss of $15 million in the year-ago quarter.Segment ResultsInsurance: Gross premiums written increased 10.2% year over year to $744 million owing to better performing liability lines of business, credit and political risk lines driven by new business as well as an increase in our aviation lines associated with the acquisition of Aviabel.

396,TRV,"American Financial Group, Inc. (AFG  -  Free Report) recently announced pre-tax catastrophe loss estimates stemming from Hurricane Harvey, Irma and Maria and two Mexican tremors. The company projects catastrophe loss of about $105 million or 95 cents per share post-tax.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at $1.62 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 7.3%. We expect the estimates to move downward as analysts incorporate impact of catastrophe losses.To offset the loss effect, American Financial maintains comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance coverage. It includes $15 million per occurrence net retention for property and casualty operations. Additionally, it maintains supplemental fully collateralized reinsurance coverage up to 95% of $200 million for catastrophe losses in excess of $100 million of traditional catastrophe reinsurance via a catastrophe bond.Being a property and casualty insurer, American Financial will not escape the disaster caused by these catastrophe events. The company’s earnings have traditionally been affected by inclement weather conditions. Even drought, which does not otherwise qualify as a calamity, had impacted the company’s earnings.Irrespective of catastrophe mitigation techniques deployed by the company, exposure to weather-related calamities makes its earnings volatile. Nonetheless, American Financial has a track of generating combined ratio better than the industry for 26 of the last 28 years.Shares of American Financial have gained 4.1% in the third quarter, thereby marginally underperforming the industry’s increase of 5.9%. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2017 earnings being revised 3.6% downward over the last 60 days. Catastrophes affecting underwriting results will possibly be a drag on the share price. American Financial carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

The bottom line also improved 11.2% year over year.Unum Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Unum Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Unum Group QuoteStrong performance at Unum U.S. and Colonial Life segments was partially offset by weakness at Unum U.K. business.The company’s sustained performance is driven by strong top-line growth, overall decent benefits experience and a good expense management. In the reported quarter, the company displayed growth and disciplined execution of strategy. It also efficiently returned capital to its shareholders.Including after-tax realized investment gains of 3 cents, net income improved 10.9% year over year to $1.12 per share.Total operating revenues of Unum Group was $2.8 billion, up 2.1% year over year. Revenues were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Premium income improved, whereas net investment income declined, both on a year-over-year basis.Total benefits and expenses inched up 0.9% year over year to $2.5 billion. Rise in benefits and change in reserves for future benefits, commissions and amortization of deferred acquisition costs led to an overall increase in costs.Quarterly Segment UpdateUnum U.S.: Premium income was $1.4 billion, up 3.5% year over year. Operating income climbed 11.9% year over year to $258.4 million.Unum U.K.: Premium income grew 3.3% year over year to $131.5 million. In local currency, premium rose 3.6% year over year to £100.4 million. This was mainly owing to growth in the in-force block, resulting from prior-period sales and stable persistency.Operating income was $26.5 million, down 6% year over year. In local currency, the figure declined 6% year over year to £20.2 million.Benefit ratio was 74.9%, up 310 basis points (bps). This was owing to higher claim incidence and unfavorable claim resolutions in the group long-term disability product line and the impact of inflation-linked increases in benefits. Also, lower discount rate implemented in the first quarter of 2017 across several products of the company added to this downside. However, a lower average claim size in the group life product line partially offset the downside.Colonial Life: Premium income increased 6.9% year over year to $378.7 million on sales growth in recent quarters and stable persistency. Operating income grew 3.4% to $81.7 million.Benefit ratio deteriorated 20 bps year over year to 51.8%.Closed Block: Premium income decreased 3.6% from the year-ago quarter. This decline stemmed from expected policy terminations and maturities for the individual disability line of business. Nonetheless, improvement in premium income for the long-term care line of business owing to premium rate increases on certain in-force policies, limited the downside.Operating income was $26.6 million, falling nearly 7% year over year.Corporate: The segment incurred an operating loss of $36.2 million, narrower than the operating loss of $45.7 million in the year-ago quarter. This was mainly driven by reduced operating expenses and decrease in interest expense owing to a lower level of outstanding debt, partially offset by a higher overall rate of interest.Capital ManagementAs of Sep 30, 2017, the weighted average risk-based capital ratio for Unum Group’s traditional U.S. insurance companies was approximately 410%.

QuoteHigher revenues as well as growth across the segments — Market Services, Information Services and Market Technology — supported this upside. However, the improvement was limited by an increase in expenses.On a GAAP basis, the company’s net income jumped 31.2% year over year to $1.01 per share.Performance in DetailNasdaq’s revenues of record $607 million improved 3.8% year over year. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $599 million, primarily owing to organic growth of $15 million and a $7 million favorable impact on the back of changes in forex rates.    Adjusted operating expenses were $317 million in the reported quarter, remaining unchanged year over year. This represents a decline in organic expense, amounting to $4 million, offset by a $4 million unfavorable impact from changes in forex rates.Notably, the company increased the lower end of its 2017 non-GAAP operating expense to the range of $1.28-$1.29 billion from $1.26-$1.30 billion, guided earlier.Segment wise, net revenue at Market Services rose 4.3% from the year-ago quarter to $581 million. This upside was driven by improved revenues from European cash equities, higher volumes and pricing changes at NFX, increased customer demand for third-party connectivity, co-location and test facilities as well as a favorable impact from changes in forex rates.Revenues at Corporate Services slipped 0.6% year over year to $161 million. This was mainly due to a decline in in U.S. listings revenues due to the run-off of listing of additional shares fees, driven by implementation of the company’s all-inclusive annual fee. An increase in European listing services revenues partially offset the downside.Information Services revenues rose 9.5% year over year to $150 million. Higher shared tape plan revenues and audit collections, as well as higher assets under management in exchange traded products linked to Nasdaq indexes, drove the upside.Revenues at Market Technology increased 5.5% year over year to $77 million due to higher change request revenues, along with organic revenue growth in software as a service revenue and a positive impact due to changes in forex rates. However, lower software, licensing and support revenues partially offset the upside. Market Technology order intake totaled $66 million. The Nasdaq Stock Market witnessed 78 new listings during the third quarter, 34 of which were IPOs.Financial UpdateNasdaq had cash and cash equivalents of $530 million as of Sep 30, 2017, up 31.5% from 2016-end level.

As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had $255 million remaining under its buyback authorization.Our TakeNasdaq’s results reflect a decent performance. Growth looks encouraging as the company remains focused on expansion through acquisitions and organic initiatives that enable entry and open up cross-selling opportunities into new markets. The top line should also benefit from the company’s consistent focus on its strategy to accelerate non-transaction revenue base, including technology, listing and information revenues.Zacks RankNasdaq carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

406,TRV,"After providing loss estimates from the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) has come up with loss estimates due to Hurricane Maria and two Mexican earthquakes. The insurer projects $220 million pre-tax or $200 million post-tax losses from Maria.These losses are net of reinsurance, including reinstatement premiums. Pre-tax losses of $152 million or $135 million after-tax will drag Chubb’s commercial and personal property as well as casualty insurance operations. Reinsurance businesses will be hurt by $53 million loss. Despite the deficit, the estimated reinstatement premiums are pegged at an extra $15 million pre-tax.With respect to Mexican earthquakes that struck in September, the company expects to incur insured losses of $25 million pre-tax or $24 million post-tax, plus net of reinsurance and inclusion of reinstatement premiums.Chubb also anticipates to have incurred a catastrophe loss of about $107 million pre-tax or $86 million after-tax from all other damages for which, it had not yet provided any estimates.Recently, Chubb has calculated losses amounting to $650 million pre-tax or $520 million post- tax from Harvey, while the same from Irma is expected to be between $800 million and $950 million pre-tax or $640 million and $760 million after-tax. Per Moody’s Analytics, economic losses from Irma are estimated at $58-$83 billion while the same from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion.Being an insurer, Chubb could not escape the vagaries of natural disasters inducing volatility in underwriting results. Despite catastrophe losses, expense efficiencies from the merger and impressive combined ratios helped Chubb generate strong underwriting profitability through the last two reported quarters.Shares of Chubb have lost 1.9% in the third quarter, underperforming the industry’s increase of 5.9%. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised downward 21.7% while the same for 2018 has slid 0.4% in the last 30 days.

407,TRV,"We expect Property and Casualty (P&C) insurer, The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report), to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, before the market opens.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Travelers has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.96%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.10 is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.08. The positive ESP is a leading indicator of a likely earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Travelers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating on earnings. The combination of Travelers’ favorable Zacks Rank and positive Earnings ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Travelers is likely to have witnessed net premium growth in its Business and International Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance businesses in the quarter to be reported. This, in turn, has possibly added to the top line.The P&C insurer has likely experienced high levels of retention across all business lines, particularly in domestic business insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance segments. Also, policies in force are estimated to have remained healthy in the second quarter.In addition, continued share buybacks should have boosted the bottom line.Moreover, the P&C insurer is likely to have recorded an improved net investment income, mainly driven by a rising interest rate environment as well as higher private equity returns. Yet, management estimated $15–$20 million lower after-tax net investment income on a quarterly basis.The company is also expected to have displayed better performance at its Agency Auto as well as Agency Homeowners in the quarter awaiting results.However, higher catastrophe losses and a lower underlying underwriting gain are likely to be dampeners on bottom line.With respect to the earnings trend, this company delivered positive surprises in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 4.18%.The Travelers Companies, Inc.

410,TRV,"Specialty insurer ProAssurance Corporation (PRA  -  Free Report) expects to incur catastrophe (cat) loss of $7.5 million (net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums) for the third quarter.These losses are from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which created havoc in Texas, several states in the southeast United States and islands in the Caribbean.The loss will be incurred in the company’s Lloyds Syndicate segment (which contributed nearly 7% of the gross premium in the first half of 2017) and is attributed to its 58% participation in business written by Lloyd's Syndicate 1729.The expected loss is likely to weigh on the segment’s loss ratio, which deteriorated 1320 basis points year over year in the first six months of 2017. The segment reported a 11.4% increase in revenues in the first half of 2017.Year to date, the stock has lost 2.1%, underperforming the industry which recorded growth of 10.7%.  Third-quarter 2017 was one of the costliest in history with respect to cat loss. Mass devastation was seen in parts of the United States which continued to be ravaged by a trio of hurricanes one after another.While Harvey rocked Houston and Texas Gulf Coast, Irma ran amok in regions across Caribbean to Florida. Both storms are considered the costliest in a decade. No sooner the country had heaved a sigh of relief, with Hurricane Jose not turning not as destructive, another hurricane, Maria, hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Maria is already deemed as a Category 5 storm.Economic losses from Irma are estimated at about $58-$83 billion while the same from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion by Moody’s Analytics. Catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimates industry insured losses for Hurricane Maria in the Caribbean will be between $ 40 billion and $85 billion.Other insurers too have come up with their loss estimates. Assurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has estimated between $134 million and $140 million pre-tax of reportable catastrophe losses from Harvey and expects gross losses from Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pretax.The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) estimates pre-tax catastrophe loss from Hurricane Harvey between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after tax. HCI Group, Inc. (HCI  -  Free Report) projects loss between $100 million and $300 million from Hurricane Irma.On the face of it, catastrophe losses cause a spike in loss ratio and hurt insurers’ underwriting margins. However, these losses act as catalysts in turning the industry's pricing cycle. The industry which has amassed a huge capital buffer and led to soft pricing (thanks to a benign cat loss environment in recent years) will likely see price hardening in certain lines of business that have been affected  the most.ProAssurance carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

411,TRV,"Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) has evaluated pre-tax catastrophe loss stemming from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma as well as earthquakes in Mexico. Loss from Harvey is projected to be $650 million pre-tax or $520 million after tax. Loss from Irma is anticipated to be between $800 million and $950 million pre-tax or $640 million and $760 million after tax.These losses are net of reinsurance, including reinstatement premiums and are attributable to commercial and personal property plus casualty insurance operations as well as reinsurance activities.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the third quarter is currently pegged at 46 cents per share, plummeting 84.1% year over year. We expect this estimate to move further south as analysts incorporate the catastrophe loss impact.Being a property and casualty insurer, Chubb could not escape the vagaries of natural disasters inducing volatility in underwriting results. Through the first half of 2017, the company incurred $316 million in catastrophe losses. Nonetheless, expense efficiencies from the merger and impressive combined ratios help Chubb generate strong underwriting profitability.Shares of Chubb have gained 7.6% year to date, thereby underperforming the industry’s increase of 10.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has moved down 21.7% while the same for 2018 has slipped 0.4% in the last 30 days.

(UIHC  -  Free Report) recently announced an estimate of $83 million third-quarter catastrophe loss before income taxes or $54 million after tax net of expected reinsurance recoveries. Estimates include loss caused by hurricanes Harvey and Irma.The company calculates loss of about $300-$600 million before reinsurance recoveries and income taxes stemming from the tropical storms.United Insurance’s catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance restricted retained losses to $81 million with quota share reinsurance further lowered to $73 million.    Blueline Re, a wholly owned subsidiary of United Insurance, has a separate reinsurance program for its commercial excess and surplus lines property business.

413,TRV,"The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) recently announced estimated pretax catastrophe loss of about $593 million or $385 million after tax for August 2017. Estimated gross catastrophe losses, excluding homeowners’ flood, are $576 million, stemming from Hurricane Harvey.The company expects reinsurance recoveries to reduce the number by $23 million. About 55% of the catastrophe losses were related to auto coverage. Allstate added that about $53 million estimated losses and expenses from commercial insurance, auto-protection contracts and loss-adjusting expenses were not covered by reinsurance.Allstate is yet to estimate catastrophe loss from Hurricane Irma that hit regions spanning Caribbean to Florida in September. In July 2017, Allstate had estimated to have incurred pretax catastrophe losses of $181 million or $118 million after tax attributable to 13 catastrophic events that took place in June. Taking that into account, the company’s total estimates are $774 million pretax and $503 million after tax for the last two months.Recently, The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) also projected its pretax catastrophe loss between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after tax from Hurricane Harvey. Even Assurant, Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has projected pretax catastrophe losses between $134 million and $140 million attributable to Hurricane Harvey and expects gross losses from Hurricane Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pre-tax. HCI Group, Inc. (HCI  -  Free Report) has calculated possible losses between $100 million and $300 million owing to Hurricane Irma.Being a property and casualty insurer, Allstate is exposed to catastrophic events. These have weighed on the company’s claims and benefits, expenses, and cash flow, draining its underwriting profitability. However, the company is making efforts to lower losses through its catastrophe management strategy and reinsurance programs. It is also limiting exposure to riskier geographic markets by raising premiums. This may lead to a decline in the number of policies in force.Zacks Rank & Share Price Impact The Allstate carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its shares have outperformed the industry in a year’s time.

414,TRV,"Property and casualty insurer The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) expects to incur catastrophe (cat) loss of $593 million pretax ($385 million after tax) for the month of August 2017.The loss may be attributed to six events from Hurricane Harvey. While these losses will cost $591 million pretax, the company expects to incur the remaining $2 million from the prior-period adverse reserve reestimate.Allstate also expects to incur nearly $181 million, pre-tax ($118 million after-tax), in estimated catastrophe losses for the month of July 2017.Catastrophes are an inherent risk of the company that have and will continue to result in material year-to-year fluctuations in its results and financial position. In the first six months of 2017, Allstate incurred cat loss of $1.75 billion, down 2.2% year over year.The company might incur additional loss from hurricane Irma that occurred this month.In order to mitigate weather-related losses, Allstate is focusing on catastrophe management strategy and reinsurance programs. Despite these efforts, we cannot rule out the possibility of losses from catastrophes and severe weather incidents, going forward.Nevertheless, shares of Allstate have been rising steadily year to date, generating returns of 22%, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 10.7%.The outperformance reflects optimism surrounding the stock from initiatives taken by the company such as profit-improvement plans in its auto business, which suffered high auto claims for the past many quarters. Efforts to diversify its business and product offerings at a time when some of its business lines are subjects of friction have also been viewed favorably by investors.  There seems no end to woes and mass devastation as parts of the United States continue to be rampaged by a host of Hurricanes hitting one after another.

415,TRV,"The Travelers Companies, Inc.’s (TRV  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 core income of 91 cents per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents by a whopping 75%. However, the bottom line plunged 62.1% year over year. This year-over-year decline in earnings can be attributed to massive catastrophe losses caused by the unprecedented hurricane activity. However, an increased net investment income partially offset this downside. Also, the bottom line was boosted by share buybacks.The Travelers Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Travelers Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Travelers Companies, Inc. QuoteNotably, the company delivered record net premiums this quarter, driven by the company’s well-rounded execution of its marketplace strategies. Behind the Q3 Headlines Total revenue of Travelers improved nearly 5.2% from the year-ago quarter to $7.3 billion. Also, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.0 billion. Net written premiums displayed a record 4.2% year-over-year increase to $6.7 billion owing to growth in each business segment — Business and International Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance. Net investment income inched up 1% year over year to $588 million owing to higher private equity returns. This improvement, however, was partially offset by a decrease in fixed income returns due to lower reinvestment rates available in the market. Travelers reported an underwriting loss of $246 million in contrast to the underwriting gain of $408 million in the year-ago quarter. Combined ratio deteriorated 1030 basis points (bps) year over year to 103.2% due to higher underlying combined ratio, wider catastrophe losses as well as lower net favorable prior-year reserve development. At the end of the third quarter, statutory capital and surplus was $20.7 billion and the debt-to-capital ratio (excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains) was 23.3%. This was within the company’s target range of 15-25%.Adjusted book value per share was $83.06, up 5.4% year over year. Segment Update    Travelers’ Business and International Insurance unit reported net written premiums of $3.4 billion, up 1.4% year over year. A continued strong retention, an improved renewal premium change and an increase in new business led to this upside. Combined ratio came in at 109.8%, deteriorating 1370 bps year over year due to wider catastrophe losses and a higher underlying combined ratio. However, higher net favorable prior-year reserve development partially offset this downside.  Segment income of $105 million plummeted 75.8% due to significantly higher catastrophe losses and a lower underlying underwriting gain. Bond & Specialty Insurance: Net written premiums nudged up 1.8% year over year to $611 million, primarily driven by record retention and positive renewal premium change. Combined ratio deteriorated 710 bps year over year to 77.7% due to lower net favorable prior-year reserve development and higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by a lower underlying combined ratio. Segment income dropped 17.6% year over year to $136 million due to lower net favorable prior-year reserve development. Personal Insurance: Net written premiums increased 8.9% year over year to about $2.6 billion. Combined ratio deteriorated 620 bps year over year to 99.7% due to higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by a lower underlying combined ratio and no net unfavorable prior-year reserve development when compared with net favorable prior-year reserve development in the year-ago quarter. Segment income of $77 million slumped 52.8% due to noticeably higher catastrophe losses. However, this downside was partially offset by higher underlying underwriting gain. Dividend and Share Repurchase Update The property & casualty (P&C) insurer returned total capital of $528 million to shareholders in the reported quarter. This included a buyback of 2.6 million shares worth $328 million in the reported quarter. The company is now left with shares worth $4.9 billion for repurchase under its existing authorization at the end of the third quarter. The company’s board announced a quarterly dividend of 72 cents per share in the reported quarter, payable on Dec 29, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business as of Dec 11, 2017. Zacks Rank  Currently, Travelers has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  Performance of Other Insurers Among other players from the insurance industry that have reported third-quarter earnings so far, the bottom line at Brown & Brown, Inc.

416,TRV,"As we discussed earlier this week, today is the 30th anniversary of the stock market crash in 1987, which would later be referred to as “Black Monday.” A heavy sell-off overseas — particularly in Hong Kong and rippling out to smaller places on the Pacific Rim, most notably New Zealand — came home to roost after market overvaluations dropped the U.S. indexes by roughly 25%. It was a harrowing day in the markets, though in retrospect investors were able to climb back out of the crater in less than a year’s time.These days, as Zacks Chief Strategist John Blank points out, there is no major country in the world undergoing a recession. This type of global growth is very rare to behold, what with the European Union (EU) working through its issues concerning Brexit (although the Catalonian vote to leave Spain is a storm still brewing) and China and its surrounding trading partners gaining economic traction. Here at home, good news regarding Q3 earnings and the labor market will likely backstop any sell-off scenarios that might follow new record highs yesterday for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500.Let’s start with the jobs market first: Initial Jobless Claims were again back within the range of robust employment after fighting through a worse-than-usual hurricane season: 222K new jobless claims last week was a precipitous drop from the previous week’s (downwardly revised) 244K, which itself was mercifully lower than the near 300K claims that came in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Continuing claims for the previous week fell a smidge beneath 1.89 million, also representing the low range we’ve seen over the past year or more.The Philly Fed survey posted its strongest month in October since May, with a 27.9 read more than 4 points higher than the September headline. This survey tracks manufacturing production of the city of Philadelphia, the sixth largest municipality in the U.S. Sure, its range is limited, but metrics like this and the Empire State survey give helpful reads on economic growth by different regions.Q3 Earnings ResultsThe largest telecom provider in the U.S., Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), posted decent numbers for its Q3 earnings before today’s opening bell. Earnings of 98 cents per share met the Zacks consensus estimate exactly, whereas quarterly sales of $31.72 billion surpassed the $31.45 billion expected. In an increasingly competitive market, Verizon posted 603K new wireless subscribers in the quarter. Shares of VZ are up about 2.7% in today’s pre-market; the telecom giant is actually down almost 9% year to date.The Travelers Company (TRV  -  Free Report), a major insurer that had been affected by the aforementioned hurricanes in the Southeastern portion of the U.S. last month, impressed analysts by beating estimates on both top and bottom lines: 91 cents per share blew the 52 cents expected out of the (flood) water, whereas revenues of $7.3 billion topped the $7.0 billion of the Zacks consensus.Admittedly, much of the disaster claims are not yet showing up in TRV results this morning, but net written premiums were up in the quarter, while underwriting losses were down from the year-ago quarter.

417,TRV,"There seems no end to the woes and mass devastations as parts of the United States continue to be rampaged by a host of Hurricanes. While Harvey rocked Houston and Texas Gulf Coast, Irma ran amok in the regions across Caribbean to Florida. Both storms are considered costliest in a decade. No sooner the country had heaved a sigh of relief as Hurricane Jose was not so destructive in effect than another Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Maria is already deemed to a Category 5 storm.Economic losses from Irma are estimated about $58-$83 billion while the same from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion by Moody’s Analytics. Loss counts are yet to come for the damages caused by Maria. The only good news is that Irma’s impact is projected as lower than anticipated.We can safely say that the third quarter of property and casualty insurance industry is characterized by Hurricanes, disrupting the results of insurers in the process. Continuous damages can even induce underwriting loss, resulting in major deterioration in combined ratio in the third quarter of 2017. Third-quarter earnings will therefore be badly affected.Insurers have already started releasing loss estimates. Assurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has estimated between $134 million and $140 million pre-tax of reportable catastrophe losses from Harvey and expects gross losses from Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pre-tax. The insurer stated that this loss will impact the third-quarter performance of its Global Housing segment the most.The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) estimates pre-tax catastrophe loss from Hurricane Harvey between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after-tax. In fact, in the wake of such a grave loss, the insurer halted its share repurchase program. HCI Group, Inc. (HCI  -  Free Report) projects loss between $100 million and $300 million from Hurricane Irma. HCI Group also anticipated the extent of loss to exceed its $16 million reinsurance retention level.Insurers need to be prepared with enough funds to address huge claims arising due to calamities. The main challenge lies in settling claims smoothly without affecting their own financials. Due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment, the insurers could build reserves over the last several quarters. We expect such capital accumulation to help insurers meet the claims and yet at the same time, save them from buckling under the burden.  The industry is currently ranked at #206, representing the bottom 8% of the Zacks Industry Ranks. The industry has also underperformed the S&P 500 over the last month.

418,TRV,"HCI Group, Inc. (HCI  -  Free Report) recently estimated pre-tax catastrophe loss estimates in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Homeowners Choice Property & Casualty Insurance Company, Inc., a subsidiary providing homeowners’ insurance in Florida, projects loss between $100 million and $300 million.HCI Group also anticipated the extent of loss to exceed its $16 million reinsurance retention level. Notably, the tropical storm of Irma has affected regions ranging from Caribbean to Florida.  This Florida-based HCI Group will surely then see its underwriting results being badly hurt. However, damages from Irma are hitherto estimated as lower than expected.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the third quarter is currently pegged at 60 cents per share, plummeting 45.5% year over year. We expect the estimates to move downward as analysts incorporate the impact of the catastrophe loss.HCI Group has been bracing its operations with strategic initiatives. Last quarter, the insurer had completed the reinsurance program for 2017-2018 reinsurance year, improving coverage and lowering risks in the process. The company has also extended its flood insurance activities to nine additional states, which forms part of its strategy to diversify geographically as well as through product mix.  Shares of HCI Group have lost 5.9% year to date, underperforming the industry’s increase of 9.5%.

419,TRV,"Thursday, October 19, 2017As we discussed earlier this week, today is the 30th anniversary of the stock market crash in 1987, which would later be referred to as “Black Monday.” A heavy sell-off overseas — particularly in Hong Kong and rippling out to smaller places on the Pacific Rim, most notably New Zealand — came home to roost after market overvaluations dropped the U.S. indexes by roughly 25%. It was a harrowing day in the markets, though in retrospect investors were able to climb back out of the crater in less than a year’s time.These days, as Zacks Chief Strategist John Blank points out, there is no major country in the world undergoing a recession. This type of global growth is very rare to behold, what with the European Union (EU) working through its issues concerning Brexit (although the Catalonian vote to leave Spain is a storm still brewing) and China and its surrounding trading partners gaining economic traction. Here at home, good news regarding Q3 earnings and the labor market will likely backstop any sell-off scenarios that might follow new record highs yesterday for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500.Let’s start with the jobs market first: Initial Jobless Claims were again back within the range of robust employment after fighting through a worse-than-usual hurricane season: 222K new jobless claims last week was a precipitous drop from the previous week’s (downwardly revised) 244K, which itself was mercifully lower than the near 300K claims that came in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Continuing claims for the previous week fell a smidge beneath 1.89 million, also representing the low range we’ve seen over the past year or more.The Philly Fed survey posted its strongest month in October since May, with a 27.9 read more than 4 points higher than the September headline. This survey tracks manufacturing production of the city of Philadelphia, the sixth largest municipality in the U.S. Sure, its range is limited, but metrics like this and the Empire State survey give helpful reads on economic growth by different regions.Q3 Earnings ResultsThe largest telecom provider in the U.S., Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), posted decent numbers for its Q3 earnings before today’s opening bell. Earnings of 98 cents per share met the Zacks consensus estimate exactly, whereas quarterly sales of $31.72 billion surpassed the $31.45 billion expected. In an increasingly competitive market, Verizon posted 603K new wireless subscribers in the quarter. Shares of VZ are up about 2.7% in today’s pre-market; the telecom giant is actually down almost 9% year to date.The Travelers Company (TRV  -  Free Report), a major insurer that had been affected by the aforementioned hurricanes in the Southeastern portion of the U.S. last month, impressed analysts by beating estimates on both top and bottom lines: 91 cents per share blew the 52 cents expected out of the (flood) water, whereas revenues of $7.3 billion topped the $7.0 billion of the Zacks consensus. Admittedly, much of the disaster claims are not yet showing up in TRV results this morning, but net written premiums were up in the quarter, while underwriting losses were down from the year-ago quarter.

420,TRV,"The two most important factors concerning the insurance industry are impact of two catastrophe events and uncertainty over the next rate hike.The third-quarter results of non-life insurers will be hurt by the two hurricanes — Harvey and Irma — that rampaged Houston, Texas Gulf Coast and regions ranging from Caribbean to Florida. Losses from these catastrophes will surely upset the underwriting results dragging the bottom line.While The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) projects pre-tax catastrophe loss between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after-tax, Assurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) projects between $134 million and $140 million pre-tax of reportable catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums resulting from the Harvey tropical storm. Assurant also projects loss from Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pre-tax.However, there is still a faint ray of hope to harp on. For such catastrophes will help insurer increase price that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. Also, cautious underwriting should help insurers from capital erosion.The cloud of uncertainty regarding the next rate hike makes investors eagerly wait for the upcoming FOMC Meeting on Sep 19. While the Federal Reserve has already hiked rates twice in 2017, everybody now eagerly awaits the third one. Good news is that the Fed announced intention for three rate hikes in 2017. However, at the annual central banking conference in Jackson Hole, WY on Aug 25, no hints were dropped about the next hike in interest. In fact, lack of signals about the announcement of the next rate hike was interpreted as ‘dovish’ by the markets.Benefits of improving rates could already be seen in insurers’ results.  Progressing economy, encouraging employment data, stringent underwriting standards as well as influx of capital instill confidence among investors.Assured PicksIt’s every investor’s wish to invest in stocks that are currently undervalued but have great growth potential.

421,TRV,"Assurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) recently announced pre-tax catastrophe loss estimates stemming from the impact of Hurricane Harvey and preliminary loss estimates from Hurricane Irma.Assurant projects between $134 million and $140 million pre-tax of reportable catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums resulting from Hurricane Harvey. The loss will impact the third-quarter performance of its Global Housing segment the most. In fact, the segment has already been facing headwinds regarding lender-places business. The company is realigning business with an eye on higher growth returns. We expect the outcomes to remain depressed as the segment’s performance is hampered by the catastrophe.With respect to Hurricane Irma, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurer expects loss to exceed its retention of $125 million pre-tax. However, the same will be covered by its reinsurance program. This July, Assurant announced a $1.36 billion 2017 property catastrophe reinsurance program, intended to lower the company’s risk and financial exposure, thereby augmenting financial capabilities.The reinsurance coverage comprises $1.03 billion for the U.S. catastrophe loss and $0.33 billion for the International segment. Within the program, Assurant will cover $100 million loss while reinsure 90% of $324 million loss from its Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund. The International per-occurrence catastrophe coverage for Caribbean region is $152.5 million. These will likely cushion the company’s third-quarter results.Assurant stated to maintain strong surplus levels in insurance companies. It boasts a solid capital position with $625 million of capital as of Jun 30, 2017.Assurant had also experienced catastrophe losses from Louisiana floods in the year-ago quarter. Catastrophe losses were $33 million in third-quarter 2016 compared with none in third- quarter 2015.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at $1.45 per share, which reflects a year-over-year increase of 45%. We expect the estimates to move downward as analysts incorporate the impact of the catastrophe loss.Shares of Assurant have gained 0.5% year to date, underperforming the industry’s increase of 2.9%. Estimates for 2017 have inched up 0.4% while the same for 2018 remain unchanged in the last seven days. Strategic initiatives to fuel growth and a solid capital position should continue to drive the shares higher.Recently, The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) announced pre-tax catastrophe loss between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after-tax from Hurricane Harvey.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Atlas Financial Holdings, Inc.

422,TRV,"The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) recently announced pre-tax catastrophe loss estimates stemming from Hurricane Harvey that hit Texas on Aug 25, 2017. The company projects pre-tax catastrophe loss between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after-tax.Travelers being a property and casualty insurer will not escape the disaster caused by these catastrophe events since its underwriting results have severely taken a beating. The company has been witnessing high level of catastrophe losses for a considerable period of time. Notably, the last quarter marked the maximum catastrophe losses since 2011. However, this statistic might change once the damages from both the storms are estimated.In the year-ago quarter too, Travelers experienced catastrophe losses resulting from hail storms in the Western region of the United States and floods in the Southeast region of the United States. Catastrophe losses of $89 million weighed on underwriting gains that slumped 46% and combined ratio deteriorating 330 basis points year over year.On a positive note, shares of Travelers have gained 2.3% in yesterday’s trading session, the first trading day after Hurricane Irma struck Florida over the weekend. Satisfactory news is that the narrower-than-expected damage caused by Irma has likely helped Travelers from not losing in the session.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at $1.77 per share, translating to a year-over-year plunge of 26.1%. We expect the estimates to move downward as analysts incorporate the impact of the catastrophe loss.Concurrently, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) property and casualty insurer has also announced to halt its share repurchase program in the wake of the catastrophe activities as part of capital management strategy during a considerable catastrophic environment. Nonetheless, the company had already spent $328 million to buy back 2.6 million shares for the quarter. The company has about $4.9 billion remaining under its existing share repurchase authorization.Shares of Travelers have nudged up 0.1% year to date, underperforming the industry’s increase of 8.1%. Estimates for 2017 have moved down 1.7% while the same for 2018 have remained unchanged in the last seven days. Catastrophes affecting underwriting results and uncertainty over next rate hike will possibly be a drag on share price.Recently, Assurant Inc.

This marked its biggest percentage gain since Apr 24. All of the S&P 500’s 11 sectors ended in the green, led by financials. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) advanced 1.7%.The financial sector gained from bullish sentiments following weaker than expected impact of Hurricane Irma. The hurricane was initially categorized as a Category 5 hurricane but lost strength after hitting the coast of Florida over the weekend. It has since been degraded to a tropical storm as the impact has been significantly lesser than what had originally been expected by the National Hurricane Centre.Biggest contributors to such gains were stocks of leading insurers.. Shares of Travelers Companies Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report), Progressive Corp. (PGR  -  Free Report), American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report), XL Group (XL  -  Free Report) and Everest Re Group (RE  -  Free Report) increased 2.3%, 2.2%, 1.7%, 5% and 4.3% respectively.

Early last week, reports surfaced from South Korea that Pyongyang would test another missile over the weekend to celebrate its foundation day. In the event of North Korea not going ahead with the test, geopolitical tensions between Pyongyang and Washington were eased and markets were back to normal.Meanwhile, the United States urged the Security Council of the United Nations to impose fresh sanctions on North Korea. The Trump administration wants the United Nations to impose an oil embargo on Pyongyang. This gave rise to fresh tensions as North Korea reacted by saying that the U.S. would eventually pay a ‘due price’ for backing the imposition of sanctions on the Asian country.Stocks That Made HeadlinesEquifax (EFX  -  Free Report) Tanks as Massive Data Breach News SurfacesThe brand image and creditability of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) is in question as very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from the credit information provider’s database.

424,TRV,"Speculations of massive destruction by Hurricane Irma had rattled the insurance industry. The storm's impact on Florida, however, was not as devastating as expected as it has been downgraded to Category 1. Storm surges were also of a lesser magnitude than the National Hurricane Center’s initial projections.As Irma inflicted lesser damage than feared, insurance stocks bounced back and were among the biggest gainers on the bourses. Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), in the meanwhile, said that the insurance industry “has strong balance sheet to weather the financial impact” of the storm and has historically performed well after such nerve-wrecking events.Needless to say, the insurance industry is already boosting business operations, implementing new technologies and investing in cybersecurity to drive growth. Thus, investing in sound insurance stocks seems prudent at the moment.Insurance Stocks: The Biggest GainersInsurance stocks had been losing ground for weeks as the hurricanes dampened investors’ sentiments. Rating agency Moody’s cautioned that property and casualty insurers, reinsurers as well as alternative capital providers like the buyers of catastrophe bonds, were all likely to undergo “substantial losses” owing to the hurricanes, particularly Irma. And why not? Irma was expected to be the most powerful hurricane and had already wrecked roads and telecommunications systems in the French Caribbean island territories.The lesser damage has been a blessing in disguise for insurance stocks. Major players like Travelers Companies Inc (TRV  -  Free Report) rallied 2.3% on Sep 11 and was one of the biggest drivers for the Dow Jones. Other significant players, including Progressive Corp (PGR  -  Free Report) and American International Group Inc (AIG  -  Free Report), improved a respective 2.2% and 1.7%.Exchange traded fund that tracks the insurance sector also moved north. The SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE) and the iShares Dow Jones US Insurance Index ETF (IAK) increased 2.2% and nearly 2%, respectively. In fact, the PowerShares KBW Property & Casualty Insurance Portfolio advanced 3.1%, its highest one-day climb since July 2015. This gain helped the fund close in the positive territory for the year. The biggest gainers from the PowerShares fund were Aspen Insurance Holdings Limited (AHL  -  Free Report), Validus Holdings, Ltd. (VR  -  Free Report) and Maiden Holdings, Ltd. (MHLD  -  Free Report), which saw a respective rally of 9.4%, 6.9% and 7.1%.Irma Fears DodgedInsurers breathed a sigh of relief after Irma changed its direction in the eleventh-hour and eased worries about widespread destruction in the Sunshine State. Residents of Florida had fled to safety as the hurricane was anticipated to hit with record-breaking winds of 185 miles an hour. The 400-mile-wide hurricane was devastating enough to affect the entire state (read more: Hurricane Irma Set to Hit Florida: Gainers & Losers).Irma, however, gradually lost strength once it made landfall on the Florida Keys on Sep 10. The eye of the storm missed Miami and lost steam once it crossed the mostly uninhabited Everglades. Following this, Irma was downgraded to a tropical storm. Chief investment officer of Atlantic Trust, David Donabedian said that “it was a relief rally”, while AIR Worldwide, a catastrophe modeling software firm added that expected losses stemming from Irma is between $20 billion and $40 billion, way below their initial forecast of $20-$65 billion.New Technologies & Business Models Bode Well for InsurersMajority of U.S. insurance company CEOs that participated in the KPMG U.S. CEO Outlook 2017 are confident about the prospects of their firms in the next three years. They believe that innovative processes and implementation of new technologies in response to various disruptions will bode well for the industry.The insurance industry is optimizing the use of data analytics and predictive technologies, building data collection capabilities and uplifting the skill of the current workforce. At the same time, many insurance companies are investing in cybersecurity to find new revenue streams and innovate. Matt McCorry, Insurance Advisory Leader, KPMG LLP believes that “as insurers embark on a digital journey, cybersecurity is becoming increasingly more important to secure ongoing operations.”4 Must-Buy Insurance Stocks to Boost Your PortfolioGiven such positive trends, investing in fundamentally solid insurance stocks seems judicious.

425,TRV,"On Thursday, Hurricane Irma continued its path of destruction through the Caribbean after hitting Barbuda, St. Barthélemy, St. Martin, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands, as well as the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico yesterday.Many industries have felt the impact of Irma already, and the storm has yet to make landfall here in the United States.According to the National Weather Service, the storm is projected to hit the central Bahamas by Friday, and then make landfall near Miami, Florida by Sunday morning as a Category 4 hurricane, “bringing high winds, abundant rainfall and potentially dangerous storm surge.”From the greater travel industry to airlines and restaurants, companies that have broad exposure to Florida have seen their shares slide on anticipation of Irma’s impending arrival. For more information, read:Hurricane Irma Hammers Travel StocksAs Hurricane Irma Gets Stronger, Restaurant Stocks Get WeakerHurricane Irma Hits Airline StocksIrma, as well as the aftermath of Harvey, has also taken a toll on the insurance market, and this past Tuesday marked one of the worst days of 2017 for insurance stocks. Today is no better, and the S&P 500 Insurance Industry Index (IUX) is down over 2% in afternoon trading, on pace for what could be its worst daily performance since Brexit lows back in June 2016. The SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE  -  Free Report) is down nearly 2.5%.Like other industries, insurance companies with a huge presence in Florida are being hit the hardest. HCI Group (HCI  -  Free Report), known for its largest subsidiary Homeowners Choice Property & Casualty Insurance Company, is down over 10% in afternoon trading. Headquartered in Jacksonville, HCI provides property and casualty homeowners insurance, condominium-owners' insurance and tenants insurance.Another big name is Universal Insurance , which is currently down 14.75%. Universal is based in Fort Lauderdale, and through its subsidiary Universal Property & Casualty Insurance Company (UPCIC), is engaged in insurance underwriting, distribution and claims.Heritage Insurance Holdings (HRTG  -  Free Report) and United Insurance Holdings (UIHC  -  Free Report) are two other Florida-focused insurance players that have seen their stocks fall over the past few days. Headquartered in Clearwater and St. Petersburg, HRTG and UIHC are currently down over 5% and nearly 9% in afternoon trading.Other insurance stocks affected include Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report), Alleghany Corp. (Y  -  Free Report), Chubb Ltd. (CB  -  Free Report), Cincinnati Financial (CINF), Progressive Corp. (PGR  -  Free Report), and Travelers Companies (TRV  -  Free Report), all of which have seen their stocks move downwards today.Companies who offer reinsurance, or when multiple companies purchase insurance policies from other insurers to limit the total loss the original insurer would experience in case of a disaster, are also at risk. Everest Re (RE  -  Free Report) and RenaissanceRe (RNR  -  Free Report), for example, are down 6.76% and 3.6% today.Experts are already predicting that Irma could be the biggest ever in insured damage in the U.S., even surpassing the record held by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. According to Barclays’ Jay Gelb, ""In a worst-case scenario, catastrophe modelers AIR Worldwide and Karen Clark and Co. have estimated a repeat of the 1926 Miami hurricane could result in $125-130 billion of insured damage.”One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

426,TRV,"The super-powerful but slow-moving Hurricane Irma has so far claimed at least 8 lives in the Caribbean, and has not lost steam from its Category 5 status and one of the strongest storms to ever affect the Atlantic Ocean. Puerto Rico has not taken a direct hit but has been blacked out due to rain and winds; this morning Irma has the Dominican Republic and Haiti in its sights. The storm is not expected to make landfall in Florida until this weekend, most likely Sunday.There is still a chance the hurricane will change direction and head back out to sea, but for now precautions are being taken, and rightly so: those who have not left their homes to escape the storm have cleaned out Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) of supplies to combat the storm’s potential damage, and supermarkets and convenience stores are selling out of consumables, most notably drinking water. In breaking news, Miami Beach is now under mandatory evacuation as of this morning.Hurricane Irma may well surpass Hurricane Harvey — which hit the Southeastern Texas coast not two weeks ago — as the most expensive storm in U.S. history. Oil refineries shutting and chemical plants experiencing fires are just a couple of the most immediate affects; soon we will find out what the payout will be from insurance companies such as Travelers (TRV  -  Free Report).Jobless Claims Surge in Harvey’s AftermathThe impact of Harvey continues to be at crisis levels, and we even see it affecting Initial Jobless Claims, which have spiked to 298K last week, a surge of 62K from the previous week’s 236K. The latter figure is quite representative of the last year or so’s very modest claims totals, which mostly stayed between a healthy 225K-250K each week. The four-week moving average is now a smudge above 250K based on this latest read’s big jump — the largest since Hurricane Sandy hit New York City and its surrounding area nearly 5 years ago.Continuing claims have not yet been affected by the storm: 1.94 million claims actually dropped by 5000 for the week. We expect this figure to ratchet up accordingly as joblessness continues to affect the regions of both Southeastern Texas and Florida coasts, should Hurricane Irma strike the area in and around Miami.ECB Keeps Policy Unchanged“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” A most American phrase that might well be applied to European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi when he announced today he would keep interest rates unchanged and current quantitative easing (QE) program in place. The Eurozone has seen strides in economic improvement since the ECB has followed the U.S. Federal Reserve’s (since rescinded) approach of slashed interest rates and bond buybacks. Draghi’s decision to keep marginal lending at 0.25% and EUR 60 billion in buybacks per month through the end of 2017, as expected.In his address today, Draghi said there is “still a need for substantial accommodation” and that currency volatility is a source of uncertainty. The ECB President also said low interest rates would remain past the bond-buying QE program.The euro monetary unit is up 1% versus the U.S. dollar in the pre-market following Draghi’s statement.

427,TRV,"Thursday, September 7, 2017The super-powerful but slow-moving Hurricane Irma has so far claimed at least 8 lives in the Caribbean, and has not lost steam from its Category 5 status and one of the strongest storms to ever affect the Atlantic Ocean. Puerto Rico has not taken a direct hit but has been blacked out due to rain and winds; this morning Irma has the Dominican Republic and Haiti in its sights. The storm is not expected to make landfall in Florida until this weekend, most likely Sunday.There is still a chance the hurricane will change direction and head back out to sea, but for now precautions are being taken, and rightly so: those who have not left their homes to escape the storm have cleaned out Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) of supplies to combat the storm’s potential damage, and supermarkets and convenience stores are selling out of consumables, most notably drinking water.

428,TRV,"The Dow suffered a loss of more than 200 points on Tuesday to register its worst one-day drop since Aug 17, ending its four day winning streak. Such losses were incurred after investors rotated out of relatively riskier assets due to escalating tensions between Pyongyang and Washington. Likelihood of the fallout of another hurricane named Irma over the coast of Florida sent home insurers lower.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,987.56, declining 234.25 points or 1.1%. United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) was the Dow’s biggest decliner after its shares tanked 5.7% following a deal with Rockwell Collins to purchase the latter for $30 billion. The S&P 500 Index (INX) dipped 0.8% to close at 2,457.85, ending a six day winning streak and recording its worst daily drop since Aug 17. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,375.57, decreasing 0.9%. Trade volumes remained lower on Tuesday due to Labor Day holiday.A total of 6.7 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 5.8 billion shares.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.34-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 2.14-to-1 ratio. The CBOE Volatility index (VIX) increased 21% to 12.23.Geopolitical Tensions Send Shivers Down the MarketsThe CBOE Volatility index (VIX), widely regarded as the fear guage in the market, briefly jumped more than 38% to 14 on Tuesday. This was because of the escalating geopolitical tensions between North Korea and the United States. Over the weekend, North Korea tested its most powerful nuclear bomb, raising geopolitical instability in the Korean Peninsula and between Pyongyang and Washington.The latest missile test resulted in North Korea earning flak from leaders in the U.S. The U.S. Secretary of Defense, Jim Mattis warned Pyongyang that it would have to face  “a massive military response” in case of it attacked the U.S. or any of its allies such as South Korea and Japan. “We have many military options and the President wanted to be briefed on each one of them,”  said Mattis on Sunday afternoon.Moreover, South Korea’s defense ministry announced that North Korea was preparing to launch another intercontinental ballistic missile. Major General Jang Kyung-soo, the acting deputy minister for national defense policy, South Korea, said there are indications that North Korea will launch another ICBM, which they would test around Sep 9, their Foundation Day. Such statements hurt investor sentiments.Investors Rotate Out of Financials into BondsThe S&P 500 suffered its worst daily drop since Aug 17 following a nosedive in shares o financials. Eight of the S&P 500’s 11 main sectors closed lower, with financials leading the decliners. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) lost 2.10%, suffering its worst decline since May. Such a decline was the result of investors moving out of stocks that would have benefitted from tax deregulations to safer havens such as bonds. Market watchers are increasingly losing faith on Trump Administration’s ability to push through the much awaited tax reforms. Moreover, the recent rhetoric between Pyongyang and Washington also led investors to rotate out of riskier assets.The rotation from financial shares into bonds led to the yield on 10-year Treasury notes falling to 2.07%, its lowest level since Nov 9, 2016. Shares of financial companies nosedived on Tuesday. Also weighing on treasury bonds were comments fromFederal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard. According to Brainard, the Fed should slow down the momentum of interest rate hikes in the face of relatively lower inflation rates which have not hit the target of 2% over the past five years. “In that case, it would be prudent to raise the federal funds rate more gradually,” she commented.Shares of JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), HSBC Holdings (HSBC  -  Free Report), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) declined 2.4%, 3.2%, 1.7%, 1.7%, 2.1% and 3.6%. Losses for financial shares also weighed heavily on the Dow. HSBC possesses a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) whereas the other companies possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Possibility of another Hurricane Weighs on the MarketsThe likelihood of another hurricane, Irma, hitting the coast of Florida sent home insurers stocks lower. This weighed on both the Dow and the S&P 500. Shares of Everest Group (RE  -  Free Report) and XL Group (XL  -  Free Report) tumbled 6.9% and 5.8% respectively. Shares of Travelers Companies (TRV  -  Free Report) also tanked 3.7%, scraping off almost 31 points from the Dow.

429,TRV,"The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) has been witnessing downward revisions over the last 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 moved south by 2.1% and for 2018, by 0.5%. In fact, Travelers failed to beat estimates in two of the last four quarters.The stock presently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with an unimpressive Growth Score of F. Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), handily outperform other stocks.Shares of Travelers have lost 1.4% in a year, lagging the industry’s growth of 17.5% as well as the S&P 500’s 15.9% gain.The underwriting results of non-life insurers will be affected due to damages caused by Hurricane Harvey that hit Texas sometime back and was assigned Category 4 Hurricane.  Before one could come to terms with the devastation occurred, Hurricane Irma is already making way to be deemed as another Category 4 Hurricane, which could strike regions ranging from Caribbean to Florida.Travelers being a property and casualty insurer will not escape the disaster caused by these catastrophe events since its underwriting results have severely taken a beating. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report), the industry already suffered $53 billion in catastrophe losses in the first half of 2017, the highest figure since 2011.The company has been witnessing high level of catastrophe losses for a considerable period of time. Notably, the first half of 2017 marked the highest level of catastrophe losses for the company in the past six years. Combined ratio — indicative of the underwriting loss or profit of a company — deteriorated.Travelers has also been witnessing increasing expenses, weighing on operating income expansion and thus inducing volatility to the bottom line.The Federal Reserve announced intention for three rate hikes in 2017 with another three in 2018. The Fed has already made two hikes in the first half of 2017. However, at the annual central banking conference in Jackson Hole, WY on Aug 25, no hints were dropped about the next hike in interest rates. The lack of signals about the announcement of the next rate hike was interpreted as ‘dovish’ by the markets. For 2017, Travelers anticipates about $15-$20 million of lower after-tax net investment income on a quarterly basis as compared to 2016.Nonetheless, an improving interest rate environment is aiding investment results of the insurers.Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in underwriting results, insurers have braced themselves with prudent underwriting practices to weather the loss to some extent.Also, influx of capital, building of reserves and containment of underwriting expenses must pave the way for growth prospects.Choosing the StocksThere are other attractive stocks in the property & casualty insurance industry that may not be as big a name as Travelers but promise greater returns.We have boiled down to two other stocks with potential to enhance one’s portfolio. We refine our search using the favorable Zacks Rank, northbound estimate revisions, VGM Score and growth projections. VGM Score of A or B coupled with Buy-ranked stocks are the best deals to offer.Illinois-based Atlas Financial Holdings, Inc.

The company delivered positive surprises in two of the last four quarters with an average beat of 57.94%. Atlas Financial is witnessing upward estimate revisions — up 4.5% for 2017 and 2.6% for 2018, respectively — over the last 60 days.

430,TRV,"Benchmarks turned in a mixed performance on Monday as markets digested the impact of Hurricane Harvey. Energy shares declined after the hurricane disrupted oil refineries in the coastal areas of Texas, rendering them dysfunctional. Meanwhile, the oil prices also declined, weighing further on energy shares. The tropical storm caused widespread destruction of property on the southern coast of U.S., leading to losses for commercial insurers and reinsurers. This led to a decline in shares of insurance companies such as Travelers which weighed heavily on the Dow as the blue-chip index ended in the negative territory. The S&P 500 ended in the positive territory buoyed by gains for healthcare and tech stocks. The healthcare stocks gained because of merger deals. The Nasdaq also finished in the green due to gains in tech and biotech shares.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,808.40, declining 0.1% or 5.27 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 1.19 points to close at 2,444.24. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,283.02, rising 17.37 points or 0.3%. A total of only around 5.13 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6 billion shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.14-to-1 ratio.  On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1.02-to-1 ratio.Hurricane Harvey Weighs on Energy SharesEnergy shares were impacted after tropical Hurricane Harvey, hit the coast of Texas, rendering oil refineries in the area dysfunctional. Harvey is by far the most powerful hurricane to have hit the southern coast of U.S. in the last 50 years, delivering about 30 inches of rain in Houston and leaving it flooded over the weekend. Conditions could worsen if engineers released water from overflowing reservoirs in order to safeguard the dams.  The coast of Texas houses approximately 30% of the total refining capacity of the U.S. and Houston alone hosts 15% of the total capacity. The shutting down of major oil refineries in and around Houston has impacted almost 15% of the nation’s total refining capacity. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) closed its Baytown refinery and Dutch Shell  shut its Deer Park facility after the storm pummeled Texas. This disruption led to a decline in the energy shares. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) was down 0.5%. Shares of Exxon, Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK  -  Free Report) declined 0.4%, 0.4% and 3.7% respectively due to shutdown of refining operations.Oil prices also declined on Monday. West Texas Immediate oil futures dipped 2.7% to $46.57 a barrel. Also, United States Oil Fund plummeted 2.3%. Economists said that it would take weeks before the refineries became fully functional and therefore the demand for oil by refineries would be low. This led to a decline in West Texas oil futures. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement announced on Sunday that a total of 331,370 barrels a day equivalent of crude-oil production was affected after the hurricane’s landfall.Insurance Sector Battered by HarveyInsurance stocks also declined after the destruction caused by Harvey. Current estimates place the estimated damage at around $30 billion and analysts expect it to be one of the costliest storms in the history of the U.S. In case of such natural calamities, insurance shares are sent lower due to high number of claim payouts.As a result, shares of top American insurance companies like Travelers Companies Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report), Allstate Corp (ALL  -  Free Report) and Progressive Corp (PGR  -  Free Report) all declined 2.5%, 1.4% and 2.2% on Monday.  The SPDR S&P Insurance exchange-traded fund (KIE) dipped almost 1%, posting its worst day since April 28, 2017.

431,TRV,"Monday, August 28th, 2017Ahead of the bell this morning on the first trading day of a new week, all port of Houston facilities remain closed following Hurricane Harvey slamming the Southeastern coast of Texas last Friday. Of all ports in the U.S., Houston’s ranks #1 in foreign tonnage, especially in oil and gasoline exports. Much of metropolitan Houston remains under water, with more storms expected.The Texas coast in general accounts for 30% of the entire oil refining capacity of the U.S., and almost 15% is from the region most directly affected by the storm. Houston metro GDP accounts for roughly half a trillion dollars per year, and at this stage the dollar amount this storm’s disruptions have caused are anyone’s guess.In today’s pre-market, gasoline futures for September are up 4%, and +3.4% for October futures. This is unsurprising, as lowered supplies in gasoline would naturally lead to higher prices. However, oil prices overall are down this morning, as the temporarily shuttered refineries do not address the ongoing global oil supply glut. That said, plenty of Gulf of Mexico offshore rigs have temporarily closed down in the wake of Harvey as well, but it doesn’t look at this point like that’s put much of a dent in the overall global supply. Yet, anyway.Of course, rescue efforts continue throughout the entire region. FEMA still considers Harvey — now downgraded to a tropical storm — dangerous, especially for the Galveston area, where storm warnings remain in place at this hour. Also, rivers in the area are not expected to crest — reach their highest peaks of water levels — until later this week, which increases the flooding dangers. FEMA assures the public that it is unifying ll agencies in support of keeping people safe in this still-ongoing situation.More disruptions to the refinery process are expected, as well: ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) processes more than 500K barrels of oil per day at its plant in the Houston area. And in nearby Port Arthur, TX, Saudi Aramco runs a plant that processes even more barrels per day. And insurance companies like Travelers (TRV  -  Free Report) have lots of exposure in the region, so we will keep an eye on these stock prices today, as well.Uber Chooses New CEOThough plenty of people were expecting a well-known CEO like Meg Whitman or Jeff Immelt to take the helm of the still-private ride-sharing giant Uber, former Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was who received the offer, and reportedly accepted just hours later. The Iranian-American executive grew the online travel site several times over during the last decade, tripling EXPE’s share price in the process.Obviously, the board at Uber hopes for similar success. However, with a work culture still in need of repair from allegations of sexual misconduct, plus an ongoing lawsuit with Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Waymo self-driving car unit, there is plenty of tough sledding ahead for Uber and its new boss.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

433,TRV,"The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) will release second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 18. Last quarter, this company delivered a 1.47% negative earnings surprise. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Influencing this Past QuarterProgressive’s top line is expected to have benefited from improved premiums as well as the investment income in its second quarter.The company’s diversified product portfolio, coupled with a competitive pricing, has probably aided a solid retention ratio.Policies in force across Personal and Commercial Lines are expected to have remained healthy in the quarter to be reported.However, overall expenses are estimated to have increased due to higher losses and loss adjustment expenses, rise in policy acquisition costs and escalating other underwriting expenses.With respect to an earnings trend, the company delivered positive surprises in two of the last four quarters, but with an average negative surprise of 4.95%.  The company’s share price has been trending up over the last few days and is currently trading at $45.58. We wait to see how the stock performs, post the earnings release.Progressive Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise Progressive Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Progressive Corporation (The) QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Progressive is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP as well as a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Progressive has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 60 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Progressive has a Zacks Rank #1, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a 0.00% Earnings ESP makes the surprise prediction difficult.Importantly, the Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering in the P&C insurance space with the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter are:Everest Re Group Ltd. (RE  -  Free Report) is set to report its second-quarter earnings on Jul 24. The stock has an Earnings ESP of +1.52% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.96% and a Zacks Rank #3.

The company is slated to post its second-quarter earnings on Jul 25.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation. See Them Free>>

434,TRV,"The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) has successfully catered to evolving demands and expectations of clients for years, building a solid product and service portfolio in the process. The company continues to maintain this purple patch and emerge stronger in the future.The property and casualty (P&C) insurer is anticipated to benefit from a strong market position and reap economies of scale. The company also remains committed toward implementing pricing actions to continue the increasing returns and most importantly, boost profitability.The company has been displaying better performance at both homeowners and auto units over a considerable period of time. To that end, both the business lines have been witnessing continued growth in policies in force as well as net written premiums over the past few years and we anticipate this momentum to sustain in the near term as well.In addition, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) P&C insurer’s inorganic growth story remains impressive. Besides, the company undertakes strategic buyouts to diversify operations and drive the operational performance. These initiatives are expected to accelerate growth.Travelers has been generating sufficient capital to engage in shareholder-friendly moves. Interestingly, through the first half of 2017, the company has effectively managed to return $1.2 billion to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. It also has a robust liquidity position and is making efforts to improve leverage ratios.However, exposure to catastrophe losses will continue to affect the company’s underwriting results and raise concerns in the near term.Additionally, the company anticipates about $15-$20 million of lower after-tax net investment income on a quarterly basis in 2017 compared with 2016.Shares of Travelers have gained 4.11% year to date, underperforming the industry’s increase of 9.14%. However, we expect top-line growth, improving premiums, higher net investment income and a strong capital position to turn the stock around in the near term.Nonetheless, Travelers has a trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) of 11.7%, higher than the industry average of 6.2%.

437,TRV,"Assurant, Inc.’s (AIZ  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 net operating income of $1.63 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.2%. Also, the bottom line improved 14.8% from $1.42 per share earned in the year-ago quarter.Lower Corporate and other expenses resulted in the improvement. However, lower contributions from Global Lifestyle, driven by an absence of $18 million one-time tax benefit in the year-ago quarter, partially offset this upside. Notably, the company did not incur any reportable catastrophe loss in the second quarter, in comparison to $16 million of the same in the prior-year quarter.Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Assurant, Inc. QuoteTotal revenue fell 5.2% year over year to $1.56 billion due to lower premiums earned as well as a decline in fees and other income. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.60 billion by 2.4%.Net investment income improved 1.6% year over year to $121.7 million.Total benefits, losses and expenses declined about 9% to $1.4 billion, mainly due to a significant decline in selling, underwriting, general and administrative expenses plus interest expenses.Segmental PerformanceAssurant has revised its reportable segments in keeping with its evolved global operating model which supported its multi-year transformation. As of fourth-quarter 2016, Assurant reported through four segments – Global Housing (formerly known as the Assurant Specialty), Global Lifestyle (formerly included in the Assurant Solutions), Global Preneed (formerly included in the Assurant Solutions) and Corporate & Other.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Housing fell about 2% year over year to $550.2 million, primarily due to anticipated lower placements rates in lender-placed insurance as well as reduced demand for originations and field services in mortgage solutions. However, growth in multi-family housing as well as new client revenues in lender-placed insurance partially offset this downside.Net operating income dipped about 1.2% year over year to $56.2 million. The ongoing lender-placed insurance normalization and higher non-catastrophe losses led to the downside.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Lifestyle declined 8.6% year over year to $836.0 million. This deterioration was primarily attributable to a change in program structure for a large service contract client in Connected Living, implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016.Net operating income of $40.2 million plunged 19.8% year over year. The downside was driven by a one-time tax benefit of $18 million in the prior-year quarter.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Preneed grew 6.9% year over year to $46.3 million, primarily due to expanded volumes in Canada.Net operating income climbed 13.3% year over year to $12.8 million, mainly driven by higher fees and investment income. Higher expenses partially offset this upside.Net operating loss at Corporate & Other was $10.6 million, substantially narrower than the year-ago quarter net operating loss of $19.4 million. Lower taxes and fees associated with Assurant Employee Benefits (sold in Mar 2016) as well as reduced corporate expenses in the reported quarter, drove the improvement.Financial PositionAssurant’s financial position remains strong with around $625 million in corporate capital as of Jun 30, 2017. Total assets inched up 1.2% to $30.1 billion as of Jun 30, 2017, from $29.7 billion at year-end 2016.Share Repurchase and Dividends UpdateThe company’s total share buybacks and dividends amounted to $142 million in the second quarter. While share buyback totaled $112 million, dividend payout totaled $30 million.The company spent about $25 million to repurchase an additional 0.2 million shares from Jul 1 through Jul 28, 2017. It now has $442 million remaining in the current repurchase authorization.2017 OutlookAssurant estimates net operating income (excluding reportable catastrophe losses) to remain flat with the 2016 level. This is primarily due to the anticipated profitable growth in fee-based, capital-light offerings (comprising Connected Living, multi-family housing and mortgage solutions) and lower net operating loss at Corporate. However, declines in lender-placed insurance and other legacy businesses are likely to limit this uptrend.Assurant projects operating earnings per diluted share (excluding catastrophe losses) to grow in double-digits from 2016 owing to share buyback activity.The company expects Global Housing to witness a year-over-year decline in its net earned premiums and net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses. The ongoing lender-placed insurance normalization and reduced contributions from mortgage solutions are anticipated to decrease the above-mentioned metric. However, expense savings and profitable growth in multi-family housing is likely to partially offset this downside.Global Lifestyle’s net operating income is likely to increase due to an improved performance in Connected Living, fueled by mobile as well as higher contributions from vehicle protection and expense efficiencies. The decline in credit insurance and legacy North American retail clients is likely to continue. The company anticipates revenues to fall, primarily owing to a change in program structure for a large service contract client. In addition, the company estimates net earned premiums to decrease by about $500 million from 2016 due to reduction in expenses. This apart, the company might witness a rise in net earned premiums and fee income owing to growth in Connected Living and vehicle protection globally. However, results are likely to be impacted by foreign exchange.Global Preneed is anticipated to experience an increase in its fee income and earnings, mainly due to sales growth across North America due to the company’s alignment with market leaders and operational efficiencies.Assurant expects a full-year net operating loss of about $60 million at Corporate & Other compared with $71 million in 2016, mainly due to lower tax and employee-related costs as well as reduced corporate expenditures.Zacks RankCurrently, Assurant carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other InsurersAmong other players from the insurance industry that have reported their second-quarter earnings so far, The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) as well as The Travelers Companies, Inc’s.

441,TRV,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (HIG  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted operating earnings of $1.04 per share. The figure not only surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 95 cents but also grew over three times from the previous quarter’s earnings of 31 cents. The upside was mainly driven by a reduction in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, which was a result of the company’s share repurchase program.However, Hartford Financial reported a net loss of $40 million in the second quarter that compares unfavorably with net income of $216 million in the last-year quarter.Total operating revenue of Hartford Financial came in at $4.77 billion, up 1.5% year over year. The top-line improvement was primarily driven by an increase in earned premiums and fee income, both on a year-over-year basis.Quarterly Segment ResultsProperty & Casualty (P&C):Commercial LineDuring the second quarter, Commercial Lines operating revenues were $2 billion, up 5.3% year over year.Commercial Lines net income of $258 million and core earnings of $238 million rose 9% and 8%, respectively, year over year due to lower catastrophe losses and higher net investment income on LPs (Limited Partnerships), partially offset by decreased current accident year underwriting results, excluding catastrophes.The Commercial Lines underlying combined ratio was 90.9%, a deterioration of 110 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher current accident year auto and property losses and higher expenses.Personal LinesPersonal Lines total revenue was $1 billion, down 4% year over year.Personal Lines net income of $24 million and core earnings of $20 million improved materially from a net loss of $50 million and a core loss of $52 million, respectively, year over year due to a favorable change in PYD, lower catastrophe losses and improved underlying underwriting results.The Personal Lines underlying combined ratio was 92.6%, an improvement of 160 bps from second-quarter 2016, driven by improved auto losses and lower expenses due to reduced AARP direct marketing and agency commissions. The improvement was, however, partially offset by higher Homeowners brand losses due to elevated non-catastrophe weather losses.Group Benefits:Group Benefits’ total revenue grew 1.4% to $925 million year over year.This segment generated net income of $69 million that increased 25% from second-quarter 2016 and core earnings rose 33% to $61 million year over year. The upsides were driven by better group life and group disability loss experience combined with 2% premium growth as a result of strong persistency.The total loss ratio of 76.1% improved 240 bps year over year on the back of improvement in group life and group disability.Mutual Funds:Mutual Funds operating revenues grew 16.2% year over year to $201 million.Hartford Financial reported Mutual Funds net income and core earnings of $24 million, each rising 20% year over year, driven by an increase in assets under management (AUM) over the past year.Average AUM increased 18% to $107.7 billion, mainly driven by positive net flows and market appreciation, partially offset by the continued runoff of Talcott Resolution AUM.Talcott Resolution:Talcott Resolution operating revenues declined 1.3% year over year to $602 million.Net income came at $105 million, inching up 0.1% from second-quarter 2016 due to higher net realized capital gains, offset by a decline in core earnings.Core earnings declined 12% to $80 million, principally due to lower net investment income because of the runoff of the block, partially offset by lower insurance operating costs.Corporate:Corporate segment declined 33.3% year over year to $2 million.The Corporate segment recorded a net loss of $540 million  against net income of $4 million in the prior-year quarter. Core losses of $52 million increased 4% from the year-ago quarter due to the favorable impact on second-quarter 2016 insurance operating costs and other expenses of the reversal of a legal accrual.

442,TRV,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2.9% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Travelers Q2 Earnings Miss, Revenues Beat EstimatesTravelers' second-quarter 2017 core income of $1.92 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07 by 7.2%. Also, the bottom line deteriorated 12.7% year over year.This year-over-year decline in earnings can be attributed to high levels of catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses caused by the significant U.S. tornado and hail activity. The storm activity had a significant impact on Personal Insurance, affecting results in both home and auto. However, the increased net investment income partially offset the downside. Also, the bottom line was boosted by share buybacks.Behind the Q2 HeadlinesTotal revenue of Travelers improved nearly 5.9% from the year-ago quarter to $7.2 billion. Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.9 billion.Net written premiums displayed a record 4.6% year-over-year increase to $6.6 billion due to growth in each of the business segments – Business and International Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance.Net investment income grew approximately 8.9% year over year to $598 million owing to higher private equity returns. This improvement however, was partially offset by a decrease in fixed income returns due to lower reinvestment rates available in the market.Travelers’ underwriting gains plummeted 55.4% to $173 million. Combined ratio deteriorated 360 basis points (bps) year over year to 96.7% due to higher underlying combined ratio, wider catastrophe losses and lower net favorable prior-year reserve development.At the end of the second quarter, statutory capital and surplus was $20.61 billion and the debt-to-capital ratio (excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains) was 23.3%. This was within the company’s target range of 15–25%.Adjusted book value per share was $82.71, up 6.6% year over year.Segment Update    Travelers’ Business and International Insurance unit reported net written premiums of $3.5 billion, up 2.1% year over year. A continued strong retention and an improved renewal premium change led to the upside.Combined ratio came in at 96.5%, remaining unchanged year over year.Segment income of $429 million rose 7% owing to higher net investment income and a slightly higher underlying underwriting gain. However, the upside was partially offset by higher catastrophe losses.Bond & Specialty Insurance: Net written premiums increased 4.9% year over year to $598 million, primarily driven by strong retentions and higher renewal premium change in the Domestic business, as well as a rise in management liability in the United Kingdom and contract surety in Canada.Combined ratio deteriorated 1420 bps year over year to 68.7% due to lower net favorable prior-year reserve development, partially offset by a lower underlying combined ratio and lower catastrophe losses.Segment income plunged 24.2% year over year to $163 million due to lower net favorable prior-year reserve development.Personal Insurance: Net written premiums increased 8.5% year over year to about $2.5 billion.Combined ratio deteriorated 630 bps year over year to 104.1% due to a higher underlying combined ratio, no net unfavorable prior-year reserve development when compared with net favorable prior-year reserve development in the year-ago quarter as well as higher catastrophe losses.Segment income of $12 million plummeted 87.4% due to lower underlying underwriting gain and wider catastrophe losses. However, this downside was partially offset by higher net investment income.Dividend and Share Repurchase UpdateThe property & casualty (P&C) insurer returned a total capital of $676 million to shareholders in the reported quarter. This included a buyback of 3.8 million shares worth $475 million in the reported quarter.

447,TRV,"Manulife Financial Corporation (MFC  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 core earnings of $0.9 billion (C$1.2 billion), up 50% year over year.

Strong growth, solid annualized premium equivalent (APE) sales and management actions to improve margins in Asia fueled this upside. However, a change in business mix in Hong Kong partially offset the same.During the quarter, Manulife’s total insurance sales were $1.0 billion (C$1.4 billion), up 42.9% year over year.

However, a small charge related to policyholder experience in second-quarter 2017 compared with a small gain in the prior year, partially offset this upside. Annualized premium equivalents sales climbed 12% year over year to $686 million in the quarter.Manulife’s Canadian division core earnings of $256.5 million (C$345 million) dipped 0.2% year over year. Nonetheless in local currency, core earnings improved 4% year over year, owing to higher fee income in the wealth and asset management businesses from higher average asset levels and improved earnings in the bank. A number of small items partially mitigated the upside.Insurance sales skyrocketed 266.1% year over year to $340.5 million (C$458 million), driven by large-case sales in group benefits business.The U.S. division reported core earnings of $452 million, up 25.2% year over year. This upside was fueled by improved long-term care policyholder experience gains, higher fee income from higher average assets and a favorable adjustment related to the timing of compensation expenses in WAM businesses, plus lower amortization of deferred acquisition costs related to in-force variable annuity business. Life insurance sales shot up 26% year over year owing to strong growth of international and term sales.Dividend UpdateThe company’s board of directors approved of a dividend of 20.5 cents per share to shareholders of record as of Aug 22, 2017.

457,TRV,"The Dow continued to trade within a tight band during a week dominated by earnings. Investors refrained from posting big bets on Monday, leading to the index ending mostly unchanged. Earnings results guided the Dow’s fortunes over the next two trading days of the week. However, it was a deal between two retailing majors which led to losses for a key component, and hence for the index itself on Thursday.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow closed at a record high for the third time in a row last Friday. The 30-stock index registered its 25th record close for this year, increasing by 0.4% as tech stocks gained. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) all posted better-than-expected earnings results.But shares of these banking-behemoths fell after reporting decline in trading sales. Investors also digested a couple of poor economic reports on retail sales and inflation, which led market participants to believe that the Federal Reserve may turn dovish.The index gained 1% last week even as all major benchmarks posted solid gains. The indexes overcame a series of bottlenecks from tech overvaluation fears to Russia’s involvement in the U.S. election to climb back into record territory.The Dow This WeekThe index declined a meager 0.04% on Monday as investors refrained from placing big bets ahead of a busy earnings week. Investors geared up for key quarterly earnings results of major players that were slated for release during this week.The index declined 0.3% on Tuesday weighed down by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report). Shares of the banking behemoth slipped after reporting a staggering 40% drop in second-quarter bond trading revenue. Meanwhile, shares of Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) hit a record high following larger than expected subscriber additions in the second quarter. Netflix’s gains helped other benchmarks close in the green.The Dow gained 0.3% on Wednesday. Benchmarks closed at record highs on Wednesday boosted partly by broad-based gains in technology shares. Meanwhile, IBM Corp’s (IBM  -  Free Report) disappointing quarterly results limited the Dow’s advance. Nevertheless, the blue-chip index still managed to finish at a record high.The deal between Sears Holdings Corp. SHLD and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) weighed on home improvement retailers on Thursday. This in turn dragged the Dow 0.1% lower after Home Depot Inc (HD  -  Free Report) lost 4.1%.

(MSFT  -  Free Report) gained momentum on expectations of better-than-expected quarterly results, banking on strong cloud performance and tax benefits.Components Moving the Index American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.47 beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. However, earnings witnessed a sharp 30% year-over-year decline. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-than-expected results were mainly backed by a lower tax rate and the effect of share buyback.

COST co-brand portfolio.The company reaffirmed its earlier EPS guidance of $5.60–$5.80 for 2017.

459,TRV,"The Travelers Companies, Inc.’s (TRV  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 core income of $1.92 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07 by 7.2%. Also, the bottom line deteriorated 12.7% year over year.This year-over-year decline in earnings can be attributed to high levels of catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses caused by the significant U.S. tornado and hail activity. The storm activity had a significant impact on Personal Insurance, affecting results in both home and auto. However, the increased net investment income partially offset the downside. Also, the bottom line was boosted by share buybacks.The Travelers Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Travelers Companies, Inc.

Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.9 billion.Net written premiums displayed a record 4.6% year-over-year increase to $6.6 billion due to growth in each of the business segments – Business and International Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance.Net investment income grew approximately 8.9% year over year to $598 million owing to higher private equity returns. This improvement however, was partially offset by a decrease in fixed income returns due to lower reinvestment rates available in the market.Travelers’ underwriting gains plummeted 55.4% to $173 million. Combined ratio deteriorated 360 basis points (bps) year over year to 96.7% due to higher underlying combined ratio, wider catastrophe losses and lower net favorable prior-year reserve development.At the end of the second quarter, statutory capital and surplus was $20.61 billion and the debt-to-capital ratio (excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains) was 23.3%. This was within the company’s target range of 15–25%.Adjusted book value per share was $82.71, up 6.6% year over year.Segment Update    Travelers’ Business and International Insurance unit reported net written premiums of $3.5 billion, up 2.1% year over year. A continued strong retention and an improved renewal premium change led to the upside.Combined ratio came in at 96.5%, remaining unchanged year over year.Segment income of $429 million rose 7% owing to higher net investment income and a slightly higher underlying underwriting gain. However, the upside was partially offset by higher catastrophe losses.Bond & Specialty Insurance: Net written premiums increased 4.9% year over year to $598 million, primarily driven by strong retentions and higher renewal premium change in the Domestic business, as well as a rise in management liability in the United Kingdom and contract surety in Canada.Combined ratio deteriorated 1420 bps year over year to 68.7% due to lower net favorable prior-year reserve development, partially offset by a lower underlying combined ratio and lower catastrophe losses.Segment income plunged 24.2% year over year to $163 million due to lower net favorable prior-year reserve development.Personal Insurance: Net written premiums increased 8.5% year over year to about $2.5 billion.Combined ratio deteriorated 630 bps year over year to 104.1% due to a higher underlying combined ratio, no net unfavorable prior-year reserve development when compared with net favorable prior-year reserve development in the year-ago quarter as well as higher catastrophe losses.Segment income of $12 million plummeted 87.4% due to lower underlying underwriting gain and wider catastrophe losses. However, this downside was partially offset by higher net investment income.Dividend and Share Repurchase UpdateThe property & casualty (P&C) insurer returned a total capital of $676 million to shareholders in the reported quarter.

460,TRV,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process.Let’s put The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Travelers Companies has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.70, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.63. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Travelers Companies current PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Insurance - Property and Casualty sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 21.48. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Travelers Companies has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 13.90, which is tad higher than the current level. So it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near term.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Travelers Companies has a P/S ratio of about 1.28. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.20 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Travelers Companies currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘A’, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Travelers Companies a solid choice for value investorsWhat About the Stock Overall?Though Travelers Companies might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘C’ and a Momentum score of ‘F’. This gives TRV a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘B’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been unimpressive. The current quarter has seen six estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared, while the full year estimate has seen one up and seven down in the same time period.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 2.8% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1%. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:The Travelers Companies, Inc. Price and Consensus  The Travelers Companies, Inc. Price and Consensus | The Travelers Companies, Inc. QuoteBottom LineTravelers Companies is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 11% of more than 250 industries), it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech TrendZacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy...Last year, it was generating $8 billion in global revenues.
