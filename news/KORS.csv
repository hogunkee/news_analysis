Michael Kors (KORS) and Tapestry (TPR) brand Coach, having spent a few years trying to figure out their place in the fashion world, appear to be finding their footing again.XAhead of Tapestry's May 1 fiscal third-quarter earnings report, Cowen analysts lifted their price target on Tapestry to 62 from 56 and reiterated an outperform rating. Analyst Oliver Chen affirmed his confidence in the brand strength of the fashion house's Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman brands, and said recent leadership changes ""can be a driver for positive changes.""Last week, Tapestry named Eraldo Poletto as the new CEO and brand president of Stuart Weitzman. The month prior, ex-Kors exec Anna Bakst boarded Kate Spade as chief executive and brand president.Coach has pivoted from large logos (although those are notably coming back in style, particularly in China), pulled back from department stores shelves, revamped certain stores, and partnered up with pop star Selena Gomez on a purse collection.Coach is still a favorite brand over Kors among women and those with household incomes of more than $100,000, which indicates ""brand prestige and potential for greater full-price selling,"" noted Chen.And the Kate Spade brand, acquired barely a year ago, is still hugely popular, especially with women and the key millennial demo.""The percentage of women who believe carrying a Kate Spade bag makes them feel 'put together' increased among the Broad Premium Market, and 85% of women believe Kate Spade bags are 'fashionable' and 'on trend,' "" he wrote back in February.When Tapestry reports next week, Zacks Investment Research analysts expect a 9% profit increase to 50 cents a share on 31% sales growth to $1.302 billion.Shares closed up 0.5% at 53.44 on the stock market today and have jumped around 30% so far in 2018, trading at levels not seen since the start of 2014.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

The latest Cowen survey found that category growth is in the low- to mid-single digits.Significantly, amid prolonged pearl-clutching about the retail industry's lost market share to Amazon (AMZN), the e-commerce bigwig does not appear to be eating too heartily into either brand's online orders. The poll found that only 8.5% of Coach and Kors shoppers wound up buying a purse from Amazon over the last three months.Cowen's bump up follows Monday's action from Deutsche analysts, who lifted their price target on Kors to 86 from 71, citing an ""underappreciated"" return to positive comparable-sales growth in fiscal 2019 in the wake of three years of declines.Kors shares fell 1.15% to 66.91 but are still near a 70.05 buy point.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Under Armour Stock Rebounding, But Cool Brand Status Is In TroubleThe '90s Are Back And Bringing These Brands With ThemJust Don't Do It: These 6 Top Stocks Teach Key Lesson In Market CorrectionRetail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry News

20,KORS,"Since going public in March of last year, Canada Goose (GOOS) hasn't disappointed investors yet, beating on both the top and bottom lines each quarter. That trend continued with third-quarter results Thursday morning for the high-end coat maker.But shares are tumbling intraday, with one pro pointing to high expectations overshadowing a solid performance.X Estimates: Per-share earnings of 36 cents on $188 million in revenue, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: Canada Goose reported revenue of $209.3 million with earnings per share of 46 cents. No guidance update was provided in the release.Stock: Shares tumbled 16.6% to 31.79 in the stock market today, after hitting a new intraday high of 38.25 on Wednesday.It wasn't immediately clear what was driving the stock lower. Analysts were looking for guidance, but Canada Goose said it will only do so on an annual basis, after the fiscal Q4 report.In trying to make sense of the plummet, Wells Fargo retail analyst Ike Boruchow noted that while the parka maker turned in another consecutive beat, with strong gross margins and continued growth potential, sales were softer than many bulls had hoped and there was ""expectation for a much more material beat, and hope for a raise.""""While results were very strong and fundamentals here remain extremely robust, they simply fell short of the extremely bullish view that most investors had coming into the print,"" he wrote.""That said, there is nothing that gives us pause on our fundamental stance on the name today, and actually today's pullback creates a healthy buying opportunity, in our view, for investors who feel they may have 'missed it' before.""The stock has been on a steady march higher since September, boasting a Relative Strength rating of 98, meaning it has outperformed 98% of all other publicly traded stocks.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Fellow premium fashion name Michael Kors (KORS) topped earnings forecasts Wednesday. Tapestry (TPR) (parent to Coach and Kate Spade) beat views on Tuesday. Ralph Lauren (RL) disappointed on revenue last week.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: These 2 Top Retail Stocks Are Hitting New Highs In Volatile MarketCheck Out These 5 Stocks In This Hot Industry GroupStocks Dive, But S&P 500 Earnings Beating Estimates By Most In YearsInvesting In IPO Stocks: Know The Risk With Snap, Future 'Unicorns'The Next New IPO Gems: Can You Find The Next Google, Facebook, Cisco Or Microsoft?

21,KORS,"Fashion house Michael Kors (KORS) defied expectations after reporting an increase in third-quarter earnings early Wednesday and same-store sales that also topped views.X Estimates: A 21% drop in per-share earnings to $1.29, while sales grow 1.6% to $1.38 billion.Consensus Metrix expects Kors same-store sales to fall 6.4% globally, including a 10.9% North America comp slide and 3.3% Europe growth. In constant currency, total same-store sales are seen declining 6.7%.Results: Kors earned $1.77 a share, up 8% vs. a year earlier. Sales climbed 6.5% to $1.44 billion.

""Our innovative fashion luxury product offerings for the holiday season created excitement among consumers. At Jimmy Choo, we continued to deliver glamorous luxury product and engaging brand communications, which helped drive revenue during the quarter.""Outlook: Kors sees fiscal Q4 revenue of $1.11 billion to $1.13 billion, including $110 million to $115 million of incremental Jimmy Choo revenue.

Altschwager in a Jan. 2 note to clients, detailing his outlook for the year.""Additionally, as more handbag brands in the accessible luxury space pull back on promotional activity and exposure to the off-price channel and industry consolidation improves pricing dynamics, we see opportunity for healthier trends in 2018 and beyond.""Kors shares fell 2.2% to 63.83 in Tuesday's stock market trading after hitting their highest intraday levels since April 2015.The stock does not have any potential buy points.Shares of $1,000 parka maker Canada Goose are up over 50% since breaking out in early October, with the March IPO hitting a new high of 33.96 on Jan. 5, as the stock continues to create more distance from its 50-day moving average.Canada Goose reversed lower to close down 1.7% at 31.84.

40,KORS,"The hype in what was one of the biggest IPOs of the year was huge. But so far, the returns are not.The lesson for savvy growth stock investors and short-term traders? Steer clear of the hype.XSnap (SNAP), which calls itself ""a camera company"" but essentially operates the highly popular social media network Snapchat, had a nice two-day pop after pricing an initial public offering of shares at 17 each. On March 2, shares finished their NYSE debut at 24.48, up 44% from its IPO, then rose to as high as 29.44 the next session.However, the ride has been nothing but a toboggan down in price. Wall Street has been sorely disappointed by slowing growth in active users and shocked by huge net losses. In the third quarter alone, Snap posted a net loss of 14 cents a share despite growing revenue 62% to $207.9 million.Snap's fourth quarter is not looking any rosier. The Street sees the company losing 16 cents a share in Q4, more than 15-cent loss in the year-ago period.New investors may want a piece of the action fast. After all, it's a brand-new force in the ever-evolving age of the internet, thus satisfying the N (""something New"") in IBD's seven-factor CAN SLIM investment paradigm, right?Yet no matter what is the next highly touted IPO, always take a watch-and-see approach. Refuse to buy a single share until a new stock produces a solid first-stage base. Let every new stock market debutante first establish some sort of price range in the open market, in front of millions of investors.Anything can happen. So it's sensible to let the marketplace sort things out.The first few weeks or months of action gives you a real vantage point. If the stock jumps above that price range, then you know that demand among fund managers is real and growing. A true buy point that offers higher reward and lower risk emerges. And ideally that price range should not be wide, such as 40% or 50% from low to high. Prefer those stocks that form a much shallower price range.If the stock drops to the lows of that initial price range, or even cuts below it, you also know that the readily available supply of shares is much greater than demand. This is exactly what happened with Snap on May 11. Pension funds, endowments, hedge funds and mutual funds are stepping away from the stock, not rushing to grab a stake.Decades of research by IBD has found that a few big winners can form a superb initial base that is much smaller in length than the typical winning chart patterns discussed in Investor's Corner and throughout the market and news coverage at Investors.com. While a cup base must be at least six weeks long, an IPO base can form in as little as four weeks or even less.Michael Kors (KORS), for instance, went public on Dec. 15, 2011, at 20 a share. Then the stock took just 13 days from Dec. 23, 2011, to Jan. 11, 2012, to form a very narrow IPO base that saw only a 7.5% decline from high (27.58) to low (25.50).The fashion accessories maker and store operator broke out on Jan. 17 with gusto, rising nearly 6% and swiftly jetting past the 27.68 IPO base buy point. It ran up to as high as 50.69 by March 9, 2012.However, not all IPO breakouts will work out that way. Indeed, a true growth stock investor cannot achieve excellence without executing great sell rules, no matter if a stock is on the way up or on the way down.If you seek investing greatness, learn this new sell rule that will help you get the most out of new IPOs. It's simply called the eight-week rule, showcased in IBD's newest home study program, ""IPO Trading Strategies.""This rule, the product of new IBD research, is simple to follow. You need charts to use it.Suppose the market is in a confirmed uptrend, and you buy a brand-new stock as it bursts out of its initial base. It rises. A string of up weeks tells you that institutional investors are rushing to grab shares. All good.Now it's time to apply the eight-week rule. Hold the stock until eight weeks have passed since the breakout day. Then study a weekly stock chart carefully.Has the stock risen at least 5% to 10%? Does it hold above the 10-week moving average? And is the market still healthy? If the stock passes these tests, continue to hold your shares or sell a portion. Then study the action on a week-to-week basis.Sell only when the stock sharply undercuts its 10-week moving average, typically in above-average volume. And don't ever let the stock's gain turn into a loss.In November 2006, New Oriental Education (EDU) blasted out of a seven-week initial base at 28.41. That price was 89% above the initial public offering at 15 a share. Its RS line shot to a new high. The Chinese school and test-center operator proved the paradoxical truth that a strong growth stock tends to get stronger.The IPO base was pristine. It had three down-weeks in price; just one week showed heavy volume (1), and it was, in fact, a support week. New Oriental bounced off its low, signaling a burst of buying by mutual funds, banks and the like.Eight weeks into the run, New Oriental finished the week at 33.54, up 18%. Ten weeks after the breakout, New Oriental was up 39% past the proper entry. It also reversed lower and closed below the 10-week line (2), but it wasn't a decisive break.You could have held on.A true break of the line came in the week ended July 27. New Oriental fell 14% that week; volume exploded 187% above average (3). It was a great time to sell. New Oriental went on to form another base, setting up a new breakout.You can add the IPO base as the eighth basic chart pattern that you must know — on top of the cup-with-handle, double-bottom, flat base, saucer, ascending base, the base-on-base, and the high, tight flag.The IPO Trading Strategies home study program (see the ""Home Study Programs"" product category at the IBD Store at Investors.com) includes two DVDs that integrate audio commentary from Mike Webster, a portfolio manager at IBD sister firm O'Neil Data Systems, with in-depth chart annotations.(Editor's Note: Portions of this column originally published in the Aug. 31, 2015, edition of IBD, and again on Feb. 23, 2017.)RELATED:The Next New IPO Gems: Can You Find The Next Google, Facebook, Cisco Or Microsoft?How Facebook Is Employing A Strategy From ""Art Of War"" To Battle The Threat From Snapchat Investor's Corner I: How To Find The Right Time To Buy A Good Growth StockInvestor's Corner II: Everything You Need To Know To Buy A Good IPOA Tale of 4 IPOs: Facebook, Alibaba, Snap And Square

56,KORS,"Coach (COH), the iconic New York-based leather goods maker, is changing its corporate name to Tapestry at the end of the month, a bid to broaden its image after acquiring the Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman brands.""We are now at a defining moment in our corporate reinvention,"" Chief Executive Officer Victor Luis said Wednesday in a statement. ""In Tapestry, we found a name that speaks to creativity, craftsmanship, authenticity and inclusivity on a shared platform and values.""The fashion house is building a multibrand company at a time when the handbag industry is facing waning demand and retailers are struggling with declining traffic at brick-and-mortar stores. Coach bought Kate Spade earlier this year and shoemaker Stuart Weitzman in 2015 to fuel growth as it becomes a broader lifestyle company.For investors, the name landed with a thud. Coach shares fell as much as 2.8%, the biggest intraday drop in more than three weeks.

57,KORS,"Nothing adds more sparkle to your portfolio than capturing the enormous gains of a truly innovative new company through timely investing in recent IPO stocks.XThink of Google, now known as Alphabet (GOOGL) and up more than 2,300% from its 2004 initial public offering. Or Microsoft (MSFT), which ran up 67,282% from a post-IPO trading low in March 1986 to a peak nearly 14 years later. Not to mention Cisco Systems (CSCO), the greatest stock of the 1990s bull market, which shot up 118,741% in less than a decade.In comparison, the pickings may seem slim in today's IPO market. Although the number of initial public offerings year-to-date has increased from 2016's meager pace, it's low on a historical basis.Yet sharp-eyed investors can still find jewels among new IPO stocks. There's no guarantee that these companies will match the long-term gains of Alphabet or Microsoft. Yet some are off to an impressive start and could add some shine to your portfolio.Consider: Among companies that debuted in the past 24 months, at least 23 stocks that currently trade at 25 or higher are up 40% or more this year, based on Investor's Business Daily research. That's hearty outperformance in a year when the Nasdaq is excelling, rising around 26%, and the S&P 500 has rallied 15%.This elite group includes Ichor (ICHR), Square (SQ), Atlassian (TEAM) and Argentine lender Grupo Supervielle (SUPV). (A list of top-performing IPOs to watch is provided at the bottom of this article.)Though new to the stock market, these companies have shown strong fundamentals, giving investors confidence in their business strategy. All four are highly profitable. The combined trailing 12-month revenue for this quartet of new market maestros? A stately $4.6 billion.NYSE-traded Square, whose software lets small businesses and mobile merchants take credit-card payments via a tabletop device or a smartphone, came public at 9 a share in November 2015. Today, its stock is trading near 41, up 355%. Atlassian, which sells project management and collaboration software, trades near 53 and has jogged more than 150% higher since holding its initial public offering at 21 in December 2015.In addition to the 20 or more stocks up 40%-plus in 2017, at least 25 more companies that went public this year already have risen 20% or more. Eight of these stocks hold an IBD Earnings Per Share Rating of 80 or higher. They range from retailer Floor & Decor (FND) and auto shopping site CarGurus (CARG) to Warrior Met Coal (HCC), a coal miner, and Gardner Denver (GDI), an industrial equipment maker.Greg Eisen, senior research analyst and market strategist at Los Angeles-based Singular Research, notes that roughly half of recent IPOs hail from the speculative biotech sector.""Pharmaceuticals and biotech is still one of the largest areas of innovation,"" he said. But note: Many of the newly public companies are working on new medicines and treatments that don't have any significant sales, much less profits.That's true of at least two top IPO stocks this year: Pulse Biosciences (PLSE) and BeiGene (BGNE). Pulse, which is working on devices that use a proprietary ""Nano-Pulse Stimulation"" technology  to attack solid tumors, has no sales. BeiGene, a biopharmaceutical firm registered in the Cayman Islands with operations in Cambridge, Mass., and China, posted just $1.1 million revenue in 2016.So-called clinical- or development-stage companies are risky and demand greater scrutiny, yet they too should be closely watched. One sign to look for: Do top-performing mutual funds own shares of the stock? Better yet, are they showing confidence by adding to their holdings over time? Funds have deeper research and expertise than individual investors. You can judge a fund's performance by its IBD rating; those rated A have performed in the top 15% over the past 36 months and are listed in the IBD Weekly newspaper. (Information on fund ownership of specific stocks can be found on IBD's MarketSmith service.)More IPOs are hitting the market, presenting new opportunities for investors. The first two weeks of November combined for 18 new issues, the most in any two-week period this year and raising nearly $4 billion in proceeds, according to Dealogic.On Nov. 9, Chinese internet content play Sogou (SOGO) had a positive debut, finishing the session at 13.50, up 23% from its IPO price of 11 and raising nearly $500 million before bankers' fees. The company, which has Sohu.com (SOHU) as its controlling stakeholder, notched a 60% jump in third-quarter profit to 8 cents a share on a 55% revenue gain to $257.4 million. Watch to see if it can form an initial base.The same day, Apellis Pharmaceuticals (APLS) priced 10.7 million shares at 14 each. The stock is trading near that IPO price.Year to date through Nov. 13, IPOs listed on U.S. exchanges have totaled 166 companies, together raising $45.5 billion, according to Dealogic. In all of 2016, 111 companies raised a total $24.3 billion in capital. This year's total is also higher than the $36.2 billion raised by 174 firms in 2015, but it's likely to fall well short of the $96 billion raised by 292 companies in 2014.As of Nov. 10, the number of new issues within the past 12 months as a ratio of total companies listed on the NYSE had hit a 12-month peak of 6.1%.But that's well off the five-year high of 11% seen in August 2014. (Track this statistic by going to the Psychological Indicators & Volume link in the Stocks section of the IBD Data Tables.)IBD's TAKE: Using stock charts correctly can help you time your purchases in leading stocks so that you can maximize your gains and minimize losses within a relatively short period of time. Watching for breakouts from key chart patterns during earnings season is especially helpful. In addition to the flat base and the saucer base, the cup with handle stands out as one of the most critical patterns of human psychology; it visualizes investor fear and greed, hope and denial. Learn more about the cup with handle so you can gain an extra edge.Robert Maltbie, president and founder of Singular Research, thinks optimism over new issues is not yet at a boiling point and thus good for the future of U.S. equities.In 2018, ""We could have a snowball effect in an inverse sort of way, in that as the market goes higher, it would extend into the small caps. Plus, if a tax cut occurs, that would only accelerate the issuance of IPOs,"" Maltbie said. The reason? U.S. corporations stand to benefit from Congress' plan to lower taxes sharply to 20%.Singular Research notes that the pipeline for the rest of the year is decent at around 80 potential IPOs. Both Maltbie and Eisen, however, expect upcoming market debutantes to fall within the small-cap range, unlike bigger offerings such as Snap (SNAP), which quickly hit $35 billion in market cap after its March 2 debut but is now valued at $15 billion.Despite the market's strong rebound on Thursday following passage of a massive U.S. tax reform bill in the House of Representatives, some companies have decided to wait before going public.Argentine food producer Molino Canuealas (ticker MOLC, target range of $14 to $17)  filed for registration of American depositary receipt shares on Oct. 27. On Thursday, Renaissance Capital reported that the flour, oil and biscuits giant is postponing its IPO that would offer 19.5 million shares, potentially raising up to $331 million before fees.Specialty silicone and chemical additives play MPM Holdings is also delaying a potential $350 million IPO. The Waterford, N.Y.-based company posted $2.3 billion in 12-month sales through Sept. 30.Late on Thursday, SailPoint Technologies (SAIL) priced its offering of 20 million shares at 12 apiece, raising $240 million. On Friday the Morgan Stanley, Citi and Jefferies-led new issue finished the day at 13.Investors will have a higher likelihood of picking winners if they focus on companies with large year-over-year increases in earnings and sales. Look for companies that have the best pretax and after-tax profit margins in their field.Occasionally, a company with zero earnings can still become a giant winner, particularly if revenue is growing rapidly. It may have other positive attributes, including a well-regarded management team and a Wall Street banker with a proven track record of backing highly successful new stocks. Over the past two decades, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs have successfully brought numerous outstanding companies public.Business software firm Workday (WDAY), a 2012 IPO, comes to mind. In the year the Pleasanton, Calif., firm went public, it racked up $274 million in revenue for fiscal 2013 (ended in January that year) but also lost 56 cents a share.Yet the stock climbed 143% in 14 months. Investors knew Workday founder David Duffy as the man who built PeopleSoft, a former software giant and stock market leader that eventually got acquired. Workday continued to post fast growth, with revenue soaring to $1.57 billion in fiscal 2017. The company also bagged its first net profit, earning 12 cents a share. Wall Street expects earnings to jump 592% to 83 cents in the current fiscal ending in January.Companies with that kind of growth are rare, even in the case of biotechs. Only the best companies have outstanding earnings and sales and show the potential to become as big as an Amgen (AMGN) or Gilead Sciences (GILD).While it may be tempting to buy shares of a promising new company on the first day of trading, it's usually best to wait for the stock to establish a trading range. That can take weeks, but it's time well spent. Why? An investor can, with the help of charts, get a sense of the supply-demand balance.Does the stock peak at, say 20, but seem to find a floor near 16? Such information is useful, especially when an investor uses a chart. If the stock has strong demand, it shouldn't fall below 16. And when the stock rises past 20, an investor can buy shares on the breakout to new highs. That strength suggests institutional investors such as mutual funds, banks, pensions and hedge funds are backing up the truck and desiring large amounts of shares.Technical analysis of IPO stocks is a bit different than for established stocks. IPO-style bases, or stock chart patterns, can form in just three or four weeks. That's much shorter than common bases for established stocks, such as the flat base, which must be a minimum of five weeks in length, or the cup with handle, which must be at least seven weeks long. Look for a proper entry price, which is typically 10 cents above the narrow IPO base's left-side peak, in higher volume, and buy within 5% of that buy point.When luxury goods retailer Michael Kors (KORS) debuted in December 2011 at 20, shares raced higher in less than two weeks to as high as 27.58, then pulled back gently. Over the course of just 11 sessions, Kors dropped to 25.50, pulling back just 7.5% and building a narrow new IPO base.On Jan. 17, 2012, the maker of stylish handbags, watches, sunglasses and high-end apparel shot out of that narrow base, rising nearly 6% and clearing the 27.68 buy point in the fifth-heaviest volume in a single session. That breakout spurred an 83% gain in less than two months. Kors produced another new base, then broke out again near 50 in August the same year. Shares eventually reached as high as 101 in February 2014 before peaking.Patience and chart analysis can keep you from being swept into the euphoria over IPOs in supposedly hot businesses.Money-losing social network Snap is the latest example. The company got plenty of media coverage when it debuted on the NYSE on March 2 at 17 a share.Snap rose with fury in its first two days. But it's mostly fallen since then. On Nov. 8, shares plunged 15% after the Venice, Calif., company reported disappointing third-quarter revenue growth of 62%, far smaller than its than year-over gains of 406%, 286%, 153% and 666% in the prior four quarters.Blue Apron (APRN), a web-based meal kit delivery service that is bleeding red ink despite having $795 million in sales last year, has done even worse. The stock peaked at 11 its first day of trading and now trades around 3.""The quality of IPOs, generally, has declined since the heydays of the '80s and '90s, when small companies viewed going public as a rite of passage — giving them access to the public market and the recognition that being public brought to their company and their brand,"" Bryan Anderson, executive VP and market strategist at Austin-based Beck Capital Management, told IBD. Anderson once worked as a portfolio manager for William O'Neil + Co.""Based on how many of the highly touted IPOs have performed in recent years, it is clear to us that these companies are increasingly going public primarily to provide an exit strategy for their founders and venture-capital backers — leaving crumbs for the public investors,"" Anderson added. ""The early investors are making the bulk of the returns.""That's not to say the careful investor can't find IPO gems.The most successful new issues tend to create a new product or service or change the way people work, live or spend their time.Medical companies attract big sales with government-approved treatments that extend life or improve the quality of life. Take Moorestown, N.J.-based Tabula Rasa Healthcare (TRHC), which came public in September 2016. Its software provides a better way to prevent adverse side effects of multiple medicines taken by patients.Atlassian, the U.K.-based business collaboration software firm, is changing the way company employees communicate with each other to get tasks and projects done. The midcap stock boasts exceptional fundamentals, as seen in its IBD Stock Checkup: They include a Composite Rating of 99, an EPS Rating of 96, and an A for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return On Equity).IPO Leaders, a daily automated stock screen that also includes weekly commentary helps readers locate stocks that are trading near or at the best entry points.IBD found 21 companies that have gone public within the past 24 months, hold an Earnings Per Share Rating of 70 or higher, and trade at 25 a share or higher.

The drugstore's Q3 earnings came in just ahead of the Street's targets.

If a stock you're tracking clears a buy point then retreats 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. Wait for the stock to set up and breakout from a new chart pattern and entry price. Also keep in mind that the latest pattern is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one.

63,KORS,"As the stock market continues to face volatility, here's a look at five retail stocks showing relative strength: Kohl's (KSS), Michael Kors (KORS), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Tailored Brands (TLRD) and At Home (HOME).Stock market sector rotation continues. Many retailers are shining as top tech stocks like Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) struggle to maintain dominance.One indicator of outperformance is the relative strength line. The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. If the RS line is spiking into new high ground, that's bullish. It's especially bullish when the line hits a new high before the stock hits a new price high.Retailers Kohl's, Michael Kors, Urban Outfitters, Tailored Brands and At Home are all on our current list of stocks with relative strength at a new high.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAt Home leads the group with a Composite Rating of 96 out of 99 while Michael Kors earns a 93. Urban Outfitters scores a 91. Tailored Brands has an 88 Composite Rating and Kohl's has an 86. The Composite Rating ranks stocks on a variety of key fundamental and technical factors, including relative strength.Kohl's stock, by the end of Friday's session, had shaped a flat base with a 69.58 buy point. Shares fell 4.35% to 64 on Friday, just undercutting the 50-day line.Michael Kors stock is now back above the 50-day line, a prior resistance level. Kors is 7% below a 70.05 entry point. The RS line is at a new high before a new price high, a very bullish indicator.Urban Outfitters is just extended past the 5% buy range from a breakout over 36.10. Though the stock initially struggled to hold above the buy point, it found support at the 50-day.Tailored Brands, which owns Men's Wearhouse, is up 8% since breaking out of a flat base with a 26.13 entry point on April 3. Investors should be careful to not let a double-digit gain from a breakout disappear, which would be considered a round-trip sell signal.At Home, a home furnishings retailer that came public in August 2016, attempted to break out past a 34.12 buy point from a consolidation. The stock hit a record 35.60 intraday Friday but reversed lower to close down 1% at 33.72 as the broader market struggled. Even with a downside reversal, the RS line was at a new high.Monday premarket trading suggested a 2% rise for At Home, though volume was light.Meanwhile, home interior building products retailer and recent IPO Floor & Decor (FND) is performing well, up 14.5% since breaking out on March 20.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Major Retailers Continue To Outperform Despite Market CorrectionStock Market Rally Isn't Dead, But This Key Sector Undercuts LowsHow To Play Retail Stocks Amid Disruption From AmazonIn Late-Stage Bull Market, Expert Says To Focus On These Investments

64,KORS,"Dow futures rose modestly Tuesday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The Dow Jones led another solid stock market advance Monday, with the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite also strong following Friday's big rally. But quality breakouts were scarce. Monday's big winners tended to be recent laggards, including Dow Jones components Caterpillar (CAT), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) as well as recent China livestreaming IPOs Huya (HUYA) and iQiyi (IQ).The lack of breakouts is somewhat surprising. Friday's post-jobs-report, post-China-tariffs surge triggered a shift in IBD's market direction back to confirmed uptrend. Given that stocks, even leading stocks, tend to follow the major averages, you'd expect to see some new breakouts. The Nasdaq composite is just below last month's record high, while the S&P 500 index is just below a four-month best, near a handle-like formation. The Dow Jones reclaimed its 50-day moving average Monday.There are some quality stocks working on buy points. Marathon Oil (MRO) and EOG Resources (EOG) are among the many energy stocks closing in on breakouts. Trendy apparel and handbag retailer Michael Kors (KORS) — along with Dollar General (DG) and Home Depot (HD) — is also in sight of an entry area. But none of these top stocks cleared buy points in Monday's stock market trading.Cactus (WHD) stock shot up 4.5% to 35.60 on Monday, clearing a 35.28 cup-with-handle buy point. But the maker of wellhead and pressure-control equipment tumbled late on plans for a follow-on offering. Cactus came public at 19 a share in early February.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseInstead, Monday was for laggards. The day's top-performing groups tended to be ranked near the bottom of the 197 industries tracked by IBD, with few in the top quartile. The Dow Jones industrial average, up 1.3%, outpaced the 0.9% gains for the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite.Within the Dow Jones, the big winners were Caterpillar, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, up 4.1%, 3.1% and 2.7% respectively. But Caterpillar stock is still below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. So are JPMorgan stock and Goldman stock, after both hit 2018 lows last week.Huya stock, a recent spinoff from YY (YY), shot up 18% Monday. Meanwhile, iQiyi stock, a Baidu (BIDU) spinoff, rebounded more than 6%. Bilibili (BILI), another recent China livestreaming IPO, popped 4%. Huya is the only one that has turned profitable.All three stocks were big winners in May and much of June, but then sold off sharply. Perhaps Huya, iQiyi and Bilibili will consolidate and form new bases and buy points. But they have a lot work to do.Dow futures rose 0.3% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures popped 0.4%.

65,KORS,"An investor who had bought all 10 of IBD's Global Leader stocks listed on Dec. 29 would have, as of Tuesday, a 10.3% profit.That is well above the S&P 500, but a tad behind the Nasdaq's 10.9% increase over the same period. All in all, it's an uninspiring performance for profit-seeking investors.But what if you had followed CAN SLIM rules and only bought stocks at valid buy points? That strategy would immediately knock off what turned out to be the two worst performers on the final Global Leaders list of 2017. Both were Argentina-based names. Grupo Financiero Galacia (GGAL) is down 27% for the year through Tuesday. Grupo Supervielle (SUPV) showed a 34% loss. Neither entered buy zones before starting their sell-offs.Eliminate those two and the year-to-date average for the remaining eight stocks jumps to 20.5%. But that is misleading. Some stocks didn't reach buy points for a while. Others on the list saw breakouts fail and triggered sell rules, before later recovering.CAN SLIM rules further pared the list by eliminating two China-based names. YY Inc. (YY) failed to form a proper base before beginning its sell-off in January. New Oriental Education (EDU) topped a buy point, but in such weak trade that it left doubts about the breakout.That left a total of five of the 10 Global Leaders that moved into buy ranges either late last year or in January. Two of those five breakouts, Alibaba Group (BABA) and China Lodging (HTHT), quickly failed and triggered automatic sell rules.But the CAN SLIM method would have caught and held onto the breakout of Autohome (ATHM) on Jan. 2. The stock was up 63% from the 67.79 buy point on Wednesday.The list's other big gainer, Atlassian (TEAM), would've been harder to hold. It broke out Jan. 16, but triggered a sell rule four weeks later. Investors had two chances to buy back in, as the stock retook that buy point in heavy volume in late February and early March. The stock was 26% above that entry on Wednesday.The average for the five stocks that passed buy points late last year and in January gives an average gain of 16.1%. That assumes a 7% loss for each of the two failed breakouts. In addition, it's probably safe to assume most investors would've sold India-based bank HDFC (HDB), as the stock lagged through the first quarter. A sale at the early March low of 95.05 would've produced a loss of 5%.That lowers the performance of the five ""buy"" stocks to 14.8%.But a CAN SLIM investor would also have followed some of the stocks into subsequent buys. Michael Kors (KORS) never quite reached its buy point in April. The stock immediately weakened, underscoring the importance of not buying before a buy point.China Lodging topped a 41.65 buy point in a cup base on May 15. It traded about 17% above the entry Wednesday. Two weeks later, IBD Leaderboard investors closely followed Alibaba's June 1 breakout above a 201.60 buy point. It gained as much as 4% but has erased the entire gain.That means an investor who opened $5,000 positions on each of the five ""buy""stocks early in the year would now have grown those to $28,700. Also, that same investor could have invested cash freed from the early Alibaba, China Lodging and HDFC sales (minus 7% each for Alibaba and China Lodging, minus 5% for HDFC) in new positions.If the full $14,050 from those sales were invested, 50% in Alibaba and 50% in China Lodging, it would've grown to $14,963.It's not a knockout profit, but the simple strategy produced a combined total of $29,613 — an 18.5% gain. That comfortably outclasses the Nasdaq's 11.4% year to date gain through Wednesday, not to mention the S&P 500's 3.6% increase.Acacia, Lumentum Gain As U.S. To Lift Ban On ZTE Component SalesThe Robot Revolution Is Here, And Medicine Is Embracing ItAutohome Stock 'Ascends' Into Buy Zone Via This Rare, Bullish BaseAtlassian Bulls Focus On Customer Growth, Product InvestmentsChinese Stocks: Latest News & Analysis

72,KORS,"Michael Kors Holdings (KORS) agreed to buy Jimmy Choo Plc for about 896 million pounds ($1.2 billion), as the maker of handbags popular with the commuter set seeks to restore lost luster by adding ""Sex and the City"" stilettos.The purchase of Jimmy Choo, Michael Kors' first deal to expand beyond its own brand name since its initial public offering in 2011, gives the New York fashion and accessories company a presence in higher-end luxury, in a move similar to that of Coach (COH), which in 2015 acquired shoemaker Stuart Weitzman.London-based Jimmy Choo rose to prominence in the late 1990s, boosted by high-profile devotees including the late Princess Diana and the fictional Carrie Bradshaw in television series ""Sex and the City."" The deal comes amid consolidation in the U.S. luxury industry, with Coach also agreeing to buy Kate Spade earlier this year.""Again, Michael Kors follows the path of Coach — and again, on steroids,"" wrote Luca Solca, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas. ""After a meteoric rise and spectacular crash, it is now the time to recycle cash into other brands.""The company has been closing stores and reducing its exposure to department stores in an effort to boost its exclusivity. Alongside Ralph Lauren (RL) and Calvin Klein, Michael Kors has struggled to maintain its brand image after broadly distributing its products in discount stores and outlet malls. On the Macy's (M) website, for example, the brand's signature $298 tote bags are currently sold for as low as $149.Jimmy Choo competes with the likes of Manolo Blahnik and Christian Louboutin for the attention of fans of high-heeled women's shoes, selling models like the $800 Lance. The brand, named after its Malaysian-born co-founder, was created in 1996 and opened its first store in London a year later.JAB Holding Co., owned by the billionaire Reimann family, has committed to sell its 68% stake. The investment company bought Jimmy Choo for more than 500 million pounds in 2011 and later pared its holdings in a 2014 initial public offering. Before that, Jimmy Choo has been bought and sold by private-equity investors three times.In April, JAB said it was reviewing options for the shoe brand and leather-goods maker Bally International to step away from fashion and footwear. The company plans to focus on its food and beverage businesses, which has grown into one of the world's largest coffee sellers through acquisitions of brands such as Caribou Coffee, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and Panera Bread.Michael Kors will pay 230 pence a share for the luxury shoemaker, a premium of 18% over Monday's close, the companies said Tuesday. The price is equal to about 17.5 times Jimmy Choo's adjusted Ebitda for 2016.Michael Kors stock has lost about two-thirds of its value since peaking in February 2014. The stock had more than doubled in the two years prior. Jimmy Choo shares rose as much as 17% in early trading Tuesday, almost reaching the bid price.""Jimmy Choo is a higher-end brand that gives Kors a bit more diversity,"" said John Guy, luxury analyst and managing director at MainFirst Bank. ""The price tag at 2.2 times sales is quite low.""The deal could be susceptible to a counter-offer, Guy said, as some minority shareholders are likely to ask to hold out for a better price.BofA Merrill Lynch and Citigroup advised Jimmy Choo. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co. advised Michael Kors, which said it would keep Jimmy Choo's existing management team, led by Chief Executive Officer Pierre Denis.

73,KORS,"Apple (AAPL) initially fell more than 1% Monday but trimmed its losses to around 0.6% at 156.70 as the major indexes continued to avoid an eclipse of their strong year-to-date gains.XBy late afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 were nearly break-even, while the Nasdaq composite limited its loss to 0.2%. The Nasdaq 100 was also off 0.2% and is trying to stay near its flattening 50-day moving average.Volume was running sharply lower on both main exchanges; Friday saw the expiration of weekly and monthly equity and index options.Apple on Aug. 2 cleared a 156.75 flat-base entry and only has gained roughly 3.7%. As seen on a daily chart, the stock has shown zigzagging action, briefly slipping below the proper entry three times already. However, no sell signal has triggered for now.At 156.68, shares are just 3% below the all-time peak of 162.51, while small-cap indexes have dipped more. The S&P SmallCap 600, off 0.1%, has fallen 6% below its all-time peak of 878.At 5779, the Nasdaq 100 is up 18.8% since Jan. 1, far outstripping the S&P 500's 8.4% lift.Losing stocks are edging out winners on the Nasdaq by a 4-to-3 margin. But on the NYSE, advancers are leading decliners by a slim margin of fewer than 100 issues.As e-commerce activity does not show signs of letting up anytime soon, at least five top operators in the retailing space have fallen much more than the major equity benchmarks. All but one have triggered new sell signals.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) continued to fade, sinking nearly 4% to 235.49. The cosmetics and hair care products chain has broken through support at the 200-day moving average near 270 and failed to lift back above the long-term support line. Notice, too, how the stock's 50-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day line. That's bearish.Wall Street expects July-ended fiscal Q3 earnings rising 24% to $1.78 a share. That's a decent gain, but a little shy of the 25% increase one would expect from a CAN SLIM market leader. Plus, it would mark a considerable slowdown from EPS gains of 26%, 33% and 41% in the prior three quarters.Target (TGT) (18 Relative Price Strength) is trying to bottom out after falling as much as 17.6% in the past three months. Check out the week ended July 28, when the giant discount chain fell hard during the week but ended it with a solid 1% gain in sharply higher gain. Such reversals at the bottom of a stock's decline are bullish.But Target, which still depends a lot on consumers to visit their stores to keep sales flowing, needs to rise back above the 40-week moving average (roughly equivalent to a 200-day moving average on a daily chart) to show that institutional investors are seriously accumulating shares. For now, Target is just 11% below the 52-week high.Target is forecast to grow FY 2018 earnings by 11% to $3.92 a share. But the 1.8% annualized dividend yield is inferior to the S&P 500 (around 1.9%).Home Depot (HD), the biggest gainer in the 30-stock Dow, rose more than 1.3% to 149.62 and is currently forming a new base. It recently posted a 14% EPS increase for the second quarter, marking a 14th quarter in a row of double-digit earnings-per-share growth.The IBD Big Cap 20 doesn't currently hold any traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. However, consumer-oriented firms help pack the list, including Mastercard (MA), PayPal (PYPL), energy drink marketer Monster Beverage (MNST) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL).Michael Kors (KORS) and Five Below (FIVE) are trying to buck the general sell-off in the apparel and discount retail sectors, respectively.Michael Kors, famous for its jet set-styled handbags and clothing, may be working on a new bottoming-base pattern, which would be first stage. The stock had collapsed more than 60% from a February 2014 peak near 101. But shares are now up more than 15% in August so far and are on track for a third monthly advance. Quiet action from here would possibly yield a new buy point near recent upside resistance, at 46.Kors' Q2 profit dropped 11% to 80 cents a share, but that was a far smaller decline than viewed. Sales fell 4% to $952.4 million, marking a fourth quarter in a row of shrinking sales.Five Below, which sells toys, accessories and clothing for $5 each or less, rallied more than 3% to 48.58. A cup-with-handle base is forming. For now, the Philadelphia-based retailer shows a legitimate entry of 51.62, 10 cents above the two-week handle's high. The base barely passes the midpoint test (handle's midpoint is 49.29, base midpoint 49.21).Five Below holds a decent Composite Rating of 87 on a scale of 1 to 99 from Stock Checkup, second only to group peer Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI). Five Below shows an excellent A grade for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + ROE) but the 54 RS Rating needs more work.RELATED:Here Is The Easy And Fast Way To Spot Major Market Tops Before Stocks CrashIBD Sector Leaders: Why YY Is Leading The Market, Fundamentals And Technicals-WiseStocks Near A Buy ZoneThe Best Large Cap Growth Firms Today: Inside Big Cap 20

Shares rose 2%.Workday earned 33 cents a share, up 14% from a year ago. Revenue rose 29% to $618.6 million. Both topped views. But Q1 billings rose 8% to $496.6 million, missing estimates.

81,KORS,"Here's your Investing Action Plan for Tuesday: what you need to know as an investor for the day ahead.XAfter last week's department-store slump, more retailers are gearing up to report. And even though Home Depot (HD), TJX (TJX), Coach (COH), Urban Outfitters (URBN) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) compete in separate categories — home improvement, off-price clothing, handbags, millennial apparel, athletic goods — there's little doubt that online behemoth Amazon and the broader shifting retail landscape are, to some degree, impacting them all.Analysts see the home-improvement retailer's Q2 per-share profit rising 12% to $2.21 on 5% revenue growth to $27.8 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Look for possible talk on the earnings call about Sears Holding's (SHLD) recent decision to sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon (AMZN). Home-improvement retailers such as Home Depot and Lowe's (LOW), which are big appliance sellers, sold off initially on that news. The sector generally has been  seen as having more of a buffer from the power of the e-commerce giant — but Amazon's foray into groceries, fashion and a host of other areas are enough to give retailers the jitters every time it makes a move.Shares dipped 0.4% to 154.26 in Monday's stock market trading. Home Depot, a Dow industrials component, is in a flat base with a 160.96 buy point.The T.J. Maxx and Marshalls parent is expected to report flat year-over-year EPS of 84 cents and 6% revenue gains to $8.32 billion.Off-price stores are another group that have, in the past, been labeled ""Amazon-proof"" as department stores struggle to adapt to a digital-first shopping environment. But growth has slowed for TJX and other off-price chains. Look for signs of continued resilience or potential chipping in its report. Off-price peer Ross Stores (ROST) reports later in the week.Shares fell 2.1% to 69.58. The stock is still trying to recover from a sharp sell-off that started in May.Purse and accessories maker Coach is seen growing profit by 9% to 49 cents a share while sales are expected to dip 0.7% to $1.15 billion.Handbag brands are in the midst of expanding their fashion houses, with Coach completing its $2.4 billion acquisition of Kate Spade last month, and competitor Michael Kors (KORS) announcing in late July that it's gobbling up luxury shoe brand Jimmy Choo.Coach, Kors and others have had to tangle with discounting at department stores as they try to maintain an image of accessible luxury.Cultivating demand with millennial and Gen Z consumers also appears to be a priority for Coach: Pop star Selena Gomez is the latest face of the brand.Shares rose 0.7% to 47.90, near three-year highs.Speaking of young people, Urban Outfitters is projected to report a 44% profit decline to 37 cents a share on a 3% sales dip to $864 million.Specialty teen-apparel retailers have been particularly hard-hit in recent years, as younger consumers gravitate toward experiences and clothing sales remain soft. In early June, Urban Outfitters said that its same-store sales for the second quarter, which it is set to report on Tuesday, were then already ""high-single-digit negative.""Cowen has long forecast that Amazon will unseat Macy's (M) as the nation's largest apparel retailer this year.Urban Outfitters shares fell 0.2% to 17.73, still near recent eight-year lows.Consensus is for 23% EPS growth on nearly 11% sales gains to $2.18 billion.The athleticwear and sporting-goods retailer — which carries Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UAA), Adidas (ADDYY) and other popular brands — was just one company whose stock took a hit in late June on news that Nike would be selling some of its footwear on Amazon.Dick's shares rose 2.7% to 34.91, but are near their worst levels since early 2012.Hibbett Sporting Goods (HIBB) and Foot Locker (FL) report later this week.Here's one company reporting Tuesday that's not like the others listed here. Wall Street expects China-based automotive online platform BitAuto (BITA) to post 22 cents EPS on $278.25 million in revenue, according to Yahoo Finance estimates.While still off its 2014 peak, the stock hit a two-year high on Monday, up 6.4% to 39.28.Rival Autohome (ATHM) reported strong results last week.RELATED:Giants Of China's Internet, U.S. Retail Lead Investing Action Plan J.C.

82,KORS,"U.S. stock indexes turned south midday Tuesday as the Nasdaq gripped a narrow ledge above its 50-day line.XThe Nasdaq slipped less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each lost 0.2%. Small caps stayed positive as the Russell 2000 inched up 0.1%. Volume in the stock market today grew on both major exchanges.Blue chips were mostly down, but losses were generally small. In the Dow Jones industrial average leaders led declining issues by a 3-2 ratio. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) suffered the biggest percentage loss in the Dow, down 0.5%. Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) logged the biggest gain, up 1%.In the large-cap S&P 500, Western Digital (WDC) scored the biggest gain, advancing about 2.5%. The disk-drive maker is building a small cushion above its 50-day moving average line.The biggest loser in the S&P 500 was luxury apparel marketer Michael Kors (KORS). The stock gapped down 2.33 to 33.56  in heavy volume. Analysts at MKM Partners began coverage of Michael Kors with a sell rating and a 26 price target. The price target would suggest a roughly 20% haircut from the current price.The apparel group is in the middle of the pack — No. 97 among 197 industry groups. Not one stock in the industry group has a Composite Rating of 90 or better. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 90 means the stock is rated in the top 10 percentile among all stocks in IBD's database.Under Armour (UAA) is another former leader that is struggling. The sports apparel company fell 0.62 to 19.98 in fast trade. In September 2015, Under Armour traded above 50.Pretax margins for Under Armour slid in the past two years, from 11.1% in 2014 to 9.8% and 8.1% in 2015 and 2016.Earnings rose 9% in 2016 vs. the previous year, but the Street expects earnings to drop 26% this year and then advance 19% in 2018.In the Nasdaq 100, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) dropped 9.70 to 259.12 in heavy volume. The former leader is 17% off a high marked in June. The specialty retail group is a market laggard.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the day's top gainers included chip equipment makers and computer-related stocks.On the downside, gold miners and meat products took hard hits.RELATED:Why An Oil Supply Squeeze Looms3 Stocks Poised For Breakouts

83,KORS,"The Nasdaq composite, getting a nice boost from market leader Apple (AAPL), continued to hold light gains late-afternoon trading Tuesday. But other indexes cooled off amid the escalating international tension over North Korea's nuclear weapons program.Strength in certain apparel, retail, consumer goods and construction-related stocks are also keeping the uptrend in force.XApple rose 1.5% to 161.14, stretching into new high ground and rising further past a new 156.75 flat-base entry. The permissible buy zone, based on IBD's history-proven buy and sell rules, goes to 164.58, or 5% above the new buy point.However, online retail pioneer Wayfair (W) cooled after reporting a 43% jump in Q2 revenue to $1.12 billion. The stock is getting support at the 50-day moving average, which may help the stock resume its advance. Wayfair initially broke out past a 43.59 buy point in a long base in April and had run up as much as 88% before Tuesday's reaction.At 3:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite rose nearly 0.1%, backing off from its intraday highs. It was up as much as 0.6%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.2% to 0.3% as volume was running higher on both main exchanges vs. the same time Monday.A second reason why traders may benefit from adding to their Apple position or building a new position is the fact that the stock's relative strength line, as seen in blue on an IBD chart, is climbing and is on the verge of reaching new high ground.That's exactly the type of action you want to see in an RS line when a stock breaks out.Apple's Relative Price Strength Rating, meanwhile, has improved further, to an 88 on a scale of 1 to 99, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. This means that Apple's 12-month price performance is superior to 88% of all public companies in IBD's database.IBD research has found that in past bull market cycles, most of the biggest winners tend to show a RS Rating of 87 or higher at the start of their big price runs.Other companies to watch closely:Coach (COH), rising alongside the big earnings-inspired gap up by Michael Kors (KORS), is finding support. The luxury handbag, shoe and leather accessories maker has staged a first rebound off the 50-day moving average near 47 since its breakout past 41.80 on May 2. Coach gained as much as 2.2% on Tuesday and hit an intraday high of 48.60.Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) rose 8% to 105.31 in fast turnover. A new base may be forming. The RFID printer expert also cleared buy points at 71.71 in November, 88.13 in February and 93.71 in April.Zebra reported a 29% jump in second-quarter profit to $1.51 a share, edging Wall Street's consensus forecast, on a 2% gain in sales. It's the third quarter in a row of 25%-plus EPS growth, meeting the C in IBD's CAN SLIM investment model.IBD's TAKE: Apple's improving fundamentals help explain why investors are showing a bullish bent in the stock, even after the iPhone and iPad giant broke out on Jan. 6-9 and has climbed more than 32% past a 118.12 cup-with-handle entry.

The S&P 500 managed a 1.1% gain, while the Dow industrials eked out only the thinnest of fractional advances.Data played a key role in Wednesday's action, with the Dow industrials, Nasdaq and S&P 500 opening higher, then reversing sharply after the release of the Chicago Purchasing Manager Index for May at 9:45 a.m. ET, although a corrected version of the PMI showed a much stronger report.The first release of the Chicago PMI showed a reading of 55.2, down hard from the prior month's 58.3 tally and below the consensus view for 57.5. The corrected version showed a May reading of 59.4, its highest mark in 2-1/2 years and well above forecasts.Overnight data out of China showed better-than-expected manufacturing growth in May, but the steel, equipment and mining stocks that would normally react positively to such news came under pressure early in the session.

What it means for Kate Spade's watch manufacturing — it has a licensing deal with Fossil (FOSL) through 2025 — is unclear, she wrote, and the deal will not likely impact Kate Spade's shoe deal by Steve Madden (SHOO)-owned Schwartz & Benjamin.But the deal is believed to be a ""near-term negative"" for rival Michael Kors (KORS), said Murphy.Kate Spade shares shot up 8.3% to 18.38 in the stock market today.Coach leapt 4.8% to 44.71, gapping up to a two-year high intraday, perhaps on relief that the offer price wasn't higher. Coach soared 8.3% last week on better-than-expected quarterly earnings, breaking out of a cup-with-handle base with a 41.80 buy point.Michael Kors advanced 0.3% to 38.20. Kors, which also sells handbags, had been rumored to be in the hunt for Kate Spade at one point.Kate Spade said in February it was exploring strategic options, after hedge fund Caerus Investors urged the company to sell itself. Shares initially shot up as high as 24.24 on March 1, but reversed to 2017 lows as buyout talk died down.Coach expects the deal to close in the third quarter and add to earnings in 2018. The company recently hired pop singer and celebrity Selena Gomez to promote its products as part of its recent efforts to appeal to younger consumers.""Coach's acquisition of Kate Spade is another step in Coach's desire to broaden its customer base to a younger, trendier millennial shopper,"" said Moody's Vice President Mickey Chadha in an emailed statement. ""The acquisition gives Coach additional product lines and expansion opportunities, and while we expect the acquisition will increase Coach's financial leverage, the company does have some additional borrowing capacity within its rating category.""RELATED:Victoria's Secret, Nike Are Great, But Amazon Is Millennials' 'Most-Loved': Survey

97,KORS,"Shares of Kate Spade (KATE) nose-dived Tuesday after a report a day earlier indicated the apparel and handbag company would take more time to work out possible terms of a sale, while Ralph Lauren (RL) said it's examining new approaches to its retail stores.The moves are the latest that reflect the retail industry's struggles with physical stores amid competition from off-price chains, industrywide discounting and online retailers like Amazon (AMZN). Some analysts also say many retailers have far more stores than are needed.Reuters reported late Monday that Kate Spade would give those interested in acquiring Kate Spade more time to get a clearer picture of the company's finances, after Coach (COH) last week offered to buy the company. Michael Kors (KORS) has also expressed interest in buying Kate Spade, but it hasn't been aggressive about a purchase as Coach has, Reuters added.Shares crashed 14.7% to close at 19.46 on the stock market today, nearly wiping out the gains seen since buyout talk first surfaced, as any takeover price is expected to be below its market value of around $2.9 billion on Monday. Coach skidded by 2.6% to 39.56, and Michael Kors lost 3.2% to 36.82.IBD'S TAKE: Even as brick-and-mortar stores suffer due to weak mall traffic, in many cases, their online sales grew during the fourth quarter. News that Kate Spade was exploring a sale first surfaced in December. Coach, the Wall Street Journal noted at that time, had been considered a good match for the company. Shares got a lift then, and climbed further in February after the company said it was exploring ""strategic alternatives.""Ralph Lauren, meanwhile, said it would close its flagship Polo store on Fifth Avenue in New York, saying the closure would help it focus on new ways to ""pilot new and innovative customer experiences.""The company said it would integrate products from the Fifth Avenue location into its Ralph Lauren Men's and Women's flagship stores on Madison Avenue and elsewhere in the city.""We continue to review our store footprint in each market to ensure we have the right distribution and customer experience in place,"" Ralph Lauren CFO Jane Nielsen said in a statement.Those and other cost-cutting decisions would produce around $140 million in annualized savings, Ralph Lauren said and forecast restructuring costs of roughly $370 million from the efforts.The company said it would ""also explore new retail concepts, including leveraging Ralph's Coffee, and developing new store formats that connect the brand to loyal and new consumers.""Shares of Ralph Lauren plunged 4.5% to 77.74.Along with meeting e-commerce delivery needs, analysts have said retail outlets need to do more to appeal to consumers' desires for memorable experiences. Such companies as Apple (AAPL) and Nike (NKE) have stores that allow shoppers to try out products directly.Ralph Lauren also said it would collaborate with Salesforce's (CRM) Commerce Cloud service to offer what it described as a ""more cost-effective, flexible e-commerce platform.""RELATED:Sears: 'Substantial Doubt' Over Survival; Bebe, Payless Pushed To EdgeFinish Line's Dismal Earnings, Guidance Follow Nike's Retail Warning

98,KORS,"Last week, we learned from Piper Jaffray that teens love Apple (AAPL) iPhones, Nike (NKE) and Disney (DIS) movies.This week, a Conde Nast-Goldman Sachs report reveals the fashion, retail and beauty brands that their slightly older millennial peers love. L Brands' (LB) Victoria's Secret, LVMH-owned Sephora and Nike make the top three in favorability rankings, said Bloomberg, which acquired the results.And unsurprisingly, what millennials like and what Wall Street likes doesn't always overlap. Despite the recent softness in handbag trends, all three major purse makers made the list.Rounding out the top 10 favorites list were Coach (COH), Kate Spade (KATE), Michael Kors (KORS), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Lululemon (LULU), DSW (DSW) and Nordstrom (JWN).Still, it's perhaps worrying for brick-and-mortar-based retailers that their greatest online nemesis is also climbing the ranks.IBD'S TAKE: The Conde Nast-Goldman Sachs study is but another reflection of the ongoing existential crisis faced by retailers — but the situation has created potential shorting opportunities for investors.Amazon (AMZN) topped the list as men's favorite retailer across all categories, said Bloomberg, citing the report, which also bestowed Amazon with the title of ""Most-Loved Brand"" overall.The recent Piper Jaffray teen survey showed similar results: Amazon gained ground as the No. 1 preferred shopping website among teens, reaching 43% share, said analysts.""(Amazon) Prime adoption has increased across all income brackets in each of the past six surveys,"" said Piper Jaffray analysts in last week's note.L Brands rose 1.5% on the stock market today.

Both watches have touch screens and use Qualcomm (QCOM) chips.The fashion house — which this year is introducing its wearables to the China and Brazil markets, among others — also released a new version of its micro app that will let users link up to their Instagram accounts and use their own photos as a watch face background.Michael Kors' activity trackers, hybrid smartwatches and touch-screen smartwatches will range from $95 to $350.Meanwhile, Fossil followed up on its previous announcement to debut more than 300 smartwatch styles this year with a showcase at watch and jewelry expo Baselworld.The hundreds of watches will span 14 brands. New touch-screen smartwatches include styles from Diesel, Emporio Armani, Misfit and Fossil's eponymous brand. The lineup includes Michael Kors' new Sofie and Grayson models. (Fossil makes Michael Kors-branded watches under a global licensing agreement that runs through 2024.)New styles of Fossil hybrid smartwatches, i.e. connected watches that look like regular analog watches, will be sold under the Marc Jacobs, Skagen, Tory Burch, Kate Spade (KATE), Michael Kors and other labels.They'll have to contend with an expanding Apple Watch presence: Recent IDC stats point to Apple Watch shipments growing 13% to 4.6 million shipments in Q4 2016 for 13.6% market share.But familiar fashion brands and differentiated styles have the potential to lure users from Apple's relatively uniform look that offers few watch-face variations.IBD'S TAKE: The research firm earlier in the month called the Apple Watch Series 1 and Series a ""magnificent success for the company."" ""With the shift toward watches and clothing, the need of a fashionable design will take center stage,"" said Jitesh Ubrani, IDC's mobile device tracker senior analyst in a Monday release, adding that tech companies will have to ""step up their game"" and offer more selection to broaden their appeal.And that could draw shoppers away from players like Apple.""We also expect more tech vendors to partner with fashion brands for their creativity, and equally important, their distribution network,"" he said. ""In doing so, wearables will be made available to a previously unaware audience — one that frequents fashion outlets over tech outlets.""Michael Kors shares rose 1.8% to 37.23 in the stock market today, but they are still in a steep downtrend Fossil shares climbed  1.9%.

Just three months ago, the No. 1 global athletic brand touted its relative immunity to the choppy waters.""Each and every quarter over the past seven years, Nike has grown despite healthy competition within our industry, extreme macroeconomic volatility, discontinuities in the retail landscape and rapidly evolving trends in consumer preferences,"" said CFO Andy Campion on the Q2 call in December, brushing off any correlation between macroeconomic trends and Nike's growth trajectory.But the tone was noticeably different on Tuesday's call as Campion and CEO Mark Parker both commented during the Q3 call that the North American retail landscape ""is not in a steady state.""And discounting at the brick-and-mortar level appears to have caught them a bit off guard.""Digital disruption and other dynamics are resulting in more aggressive promotional activity than we expected 90-days ago,"" said Campion late Tuesday. ""So we are going to remain tight, with respect to the supply that we are putting into the North America market in the short-term, while aggressively driving the initiatives that will reshape and grow the market, and extend Nike's leadership long-term.""Nike's more ominous tone came just as Sears (SHLD) warned ""substantial doubt"" exists over the iconic department store chain's ability to survive. Meanwhile, other retailers and brands have long brought up the ""challenging retail environment"" in earnings releases as a way to explain or mitigate lackluster results. Michael Kors (KORS), Signet Jewelers (SIG), Express (EXPR) and others all mentioned some variation of the phrase this past quarter.Shares of Nike, a component on the Dow Jones industrial average, tumbled 7% to 53.92 on the stock market today, diving below their 50-day average and 200-day lines. Rival Under Armour (UAA) rebounded to close up 0.5% after falling intraday to its lowest level since September 2013. U.S.-listed shares of Adidas (ADDYY) dipped 0.5%. Sears sank 12.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Mayhem is the antithesis of convenience, when it comes to shopping. But that is the point. No one wants to stand in line outside for hours waiting for laundry detergent. A Kylie Lip Kit, however, is not long for this world. Is this what will stave off the death of the American mall?""Futures orders,"" or products scheduled for delivery to retailers, disappointed with a 1% constant-currency decline that included a 9% tumble in North America futures.While Nike has been making attempts to play down the relevancy of this metric, given its aggressive push into direct-to-consumer sales at Nike stores and at Nike.com, the number still has the power to cause consternation.Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole, in a Wednesday research note, weighed the possibilities.""(U)nprecedentedly weak (North America) futures signal share loss and either a poor retail climate or a radically changing Nike business model,"" he wrote.But for those worried about Nike's retail performance, ""the answer may be the latter,"" wrote Sole. He said that Nike's new supply chain system might mean that retailers don't have to place futures orders ""since Nike can deliver them essentially on demand.""""If true, the futures decline isn't alarming,"" he said.But Nike brand direct-to-consumer revenue grew 13% in Q3, a deceleration from last quarter's 25% growth and the first time in years that the company has not logged DTC growth over 20%.The company, as management likes to say, remains on the offensive.CEO Parker on Tuesday unrolled a new three-pronged attack plan, a ""triple-double"" initiative built to ramp up product innovation, speed to market and consumer engagement.RELATED:Nike Tanks As Q3 Results Fan Flames Of Adidas' Beast-Mode ComebackNike Vows To Halve Product Cycle To 'Weeks, Not Months'; Stock Falls On Sales, MarginsNike Rival Adidas On U.S. Turf War: Paying The Price For The PastFoot Locker Sprints As Earnings Growth Continues To Accelerate

103,KORS,"Kate Spade (KATE) shares are surging early Thursday after the handbag maker said it is ""conducting a process to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives to further enhance shareholder value.""The news confirms an earlier Wall Street Journal report from December that said the company was exploring a sale of itself at the prodding of activist hedge fund Caerus Investors.Shares gapped up nearly 15% to close at 22.56 in the stock market today, hitting the highest level since May, after retaking the key 200-day moving average in recent days. The stock enjoyed a more than 23% pop on Dec. 28, the day the Journal story surfaced.Kate Spade said its board has not set a timetable for the process, and a sale or other strategic alternative isn't guaranteed.The company also disclosed fourth-quarter results, noting a 28% increase in profit to 41 cents a share on 10.1% sales growth to $470.8 million vs. views for 34 cents and $472 million.IBD'S TAKE: Retailers are facing challenges, and malls have been forced to ramp up the drama in the age of Amazon. Here's what that looks like.Coach (COH) shares edged up 0.5%. Michael Kors (KORS) shares rose 0.4%. Coach and Kors, along with other accessible luxury names like Tory Burch, are among Kate Spade's biggest competitors.Both Coach and Kors have indicated in recent months that they will be reducing their department-store selections amid heavy discounting at the brick-and-mortar shops, which is seen as cheapening the brands.Apparel and accessories maker Ralph Lauren (RL) announced some key executive hires, two weeks after the CEO left over ""different views"" from that of the founder. Ralph Lauren stock finished 0.9% lower.RELATED:Ralph Lauren Hits 6-Year Low As CEO Exits Over 'Different Views' Than FounderChristmas Meltdown: Macy's, Kohl's, Kors, Fossil, L Brands, OthersKate Spade Stock Jumps On Report It's Considering Sale

115,KORS,"Markets in the U.S. and Europe had a good week, and that translated into a solid showing among IBD's Global Leaders stocks.Not all of the eight stocks gained. But even the two that slipped held losses to a minimum, within the boundaries of constructive chart action.The big winner on the list was Israel-based Mellanox Technologies (MLNX). Shares held steady below a 47.70 buy point Tuesday, after the company announced that it had closed its acquisition of smaller Israeli peer EZchip Semiconductor.Analyst upgrades started to roll in Wednesday: Topeka Capital upgraded the stock to buy and hoisted its price target to 60 from 46. On Thursday, JPMorgan rated shares overweight with a 67 price target. Mellanox ended the week up more than 12%, and 6% past its buy point.Ireland’s Allegion (ALLE), new to the list as of Friday, climbed more than 8% for the week.  That put the maker of door and security hardware 20% above its Feb. 8 low and back above both its 10- and 40-week moving averages as it climbs the right side of an eight-week cup base. The tentative buy point is 67.64.Hong Kong-based Michael Kors (KORS) advanced almost 8%. The stock has run up more than 60% since late January, but has much work to do before it could produce a valid buy point.Ryanair (RYAAY) managed to turn the week’s loss of more than 1% into a positive. Shares of the Ireland-based budget airline traded tightly and held steady at the 50-day line, just below an 84.97 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. The cup is only 17% deep, but undercut two prior bases. That effectively reset the stock’s base count, suggesting that it may have much further to run.Genpact (G) broke past a 26 buy point on Feb. 18. The India-based automator of a broad array of business functions added a small gain in the past week, ending Friday’s session still well within buy range. A little more gain after the breakout would have been nice. But holding steady and near new highs is just fine.Singapore’s Broadcom (AVGO) climbed almost 3.5% for the week. The diversifying chipmaker retook its 50- and 200-day moving averages. Its pattern -- which also undercuts and resets its base count -- has shaped up into a first-stage double-bottom base, with a 138.79 buy point.New Oriental Education (EDU) and TAL Education (XRS) were the subject of Thursday’s Global Leaders column.
"
116,KORS,"Investors reacted badly to Ralph Lauren's (RL) third-quarter report Thursday, which included a lower-than-expected 4% drop in revenue and a forecast that called for a 3% fall in revenue for the full year, worse than its previous guidance for flat growth. Shares plunged 22%. Luxury handbag and accessories company Coach (COH) fell 0.9%, while other apparel makers VF (VFC) fell…

117,KORS,"With Valentine's Day on Sunday, love is in the air, and if you're single, is probably poisoning it.But as couples lock down dinner reservations and gift orders, and single men cram for dates with books by Neil Strauss, here are five highly-rated IBD 50 companies that, in one way or another, could make for steamy investor relations: Facebook (FB), Global Payments (GPN), Michael Kors (KORS), Nike (NKE) and PayPal (PYPL).With oil prices diving and China's economy slowing, the prospect of a recession and credit-market contagion are on the minds of curious lovers everywhere. Let a strong company like Nike be your rock with its cash flow, solid dividend and share repurchase program, as it unlocks your passion with brand innovation.Cue the slow music and let the rose petals fall where they may as Jefferies finds the words:""Nike offers consistent cash flow and also a growth opportunity tied to continued success in China and emerging markets, and share gains for the brand and the sportswear category. While (analyst Edward Plank) likes the strong growth prospects for NKE outside of the core North America base and focus on capital returns to shareholders, he highlights Nike’s already dominant global market share in athletic footwear and competitive separation as contributing to consistent cash flow. Eddie anticipates new product innovation, driven by the 2016 Summer Olympics, will help to drive growth over the next year.""In that research note, released Friday, Jefferies cited Nike as among its picks with ""idiosyncratic growth and some degree of protection from a downturn.""The company could also become more involved with Apple (AAPL), whose Apple Watch has fitness-tracking capabilities.Shares of Nike closed down 1.3% for the week. Apple ended virtually flat.Nothing is more attractive than confidence, and analysts praised social media giant Facebook after its Q4 results last month soundly topped estimates, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was ""thriving."" Facebook has grown through mobile and video ads and has broken into virtual reality through its Oculus Rift headset, with romantic implications that need not be mentioned here.But for those who will not be boldly exploring any new boundaries this weekend, Facebook at least has one feature (detailed in this press release) that allows you to reduce your exposure to your exes.Shares cleared a consolidation in the days following Facebook's report, but they fizzled afterward and are currently testing support at their 50-day line.Facebook finished 2% lower for the week.Maybe your significant other wants a new handbag. Well, Michael Kors sells lots of handbags. And their stock jumped 23.9% on Feb.2 following the release of view-topping holiday-quarter results, which were boosted luxury offerings and e-commerce.Jefferies, in a note last month, predicted a rebound in handbags' appeal, citing new spring trends and slowing shoe sales, leaving shoppers with more money potentially to buy crossbodies, mini-bags or ""bag-cessories.""Michael Kors shares lost 4.4% for the week, finding some love above their 200-day line after a long dry spell below it.Whatever you buy on Valentine's Day, payment processor Global Payments could help you seal the deal, indulging customers with robust support for Apple Pay and a product suite of online and brick-and-mortar payment-technology solutions across 29 countries.But no multibillion-dollar company can drift through this entropic world alone forever, especially as the payments landscape becomes more competitive with the rise of e-commerce. To that end, Global Payments in December announced the $4.3 billion acquisition of Heartland Payment Systems (HPY), allowing it to reach out to smaller and midsize businesses.Shares gained 1.9% for the week, but the stock has trended below its key 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Meanwhile, PayPal, which Jefferies also cited as a good growth stock for an uncertain time, has become a globally recognized leader in online payments, partly due to social-payments app Venmo.""We see PayPal as the best positioned large-cap payments company for the current environment, with a strong hold on its core online market and options on tangential markets remittance, credit and in-store,"" Wedbush analyst Gil Luria said in a research note last month.Shares fell 2.2% for the week, testing support at their 50-day line.Image provided by Shutterstock.

196,KORS,"George Soros took stakes in Facebook (FB) and Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) in the fourth quarter, while Appaloosa cut its stake in Apple (AAPL), and both followed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BKRB) in appearing to find a bargain in airlines. Here's a look at how some big investors managed their portfolios in the last quarter of last year.Soros Fund Management bought 353,686 shares in Facebook and bulked up its stake in Alphabet (GOOGL) by nearly 60% to 20,200 shares, according to a regulatory filing out late Tuesday. Soros also increased his T-Mobile (TMUS) stake to 685,700 shares.Soros bought 62,100 shares in Goldman Sachs. Dan Loeb's Third Point last week disclosed that it had scooped up shares of Goldman, Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Bank stocks have risen on greater expectations of lighter regulations, higher interest rates and greater volatility, which Goldman's trading desk could benefit from in particular.Soros also took a 40,000-share stake in Delta Air Lines (DAL), but dropped United Airlines (UAL).Shares of Apple ended regular trading up 0.4% to 135.51 on the stock market today, after hitting a record high yesterday. Facebook fell 0.3% to 133.44, while Goldman Sachs rose 0.4% to 250.54. Delta climbed 2.6% to 51.17, American rose 2.1% to 47.54, and United gained 2.7% to 75.75.IBD'S TAKE: Even as big investors flocked to the airlines last year, Cowen analysts last month said shares of airlines could be ""due for a break"" after taking off in Q4. Meanwhile, Soros dropped Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Herbalife (HLF), Harley Davidson (HOG), PepsiCo (PEP) and JCPenney (JCP). He also dissolved his stake in Nordstrom (JWN)Soros also offloaded his position in consumer-care products giant Procter & Gamble (PG), which got a lift Tuesday after activist investor Trian took a more than $3 billion stake in the company.Hedge fund Appaloosa Management increased its stake in Facebook by 47% to 2.2 million shares. The fund also upped its holdings in Qualcomm (QCOM) and more than doubled its stake in Southwest (LUV). Appaloosa also took a 160,000-share stake in United Airlines.The fund loaded up on the health sector, taking new stakes in companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Centene (CNC), McKesson (MCK) and Pfizer (PFE). It also took a new stake in JCPenney.Appaloosa cut its position in Apple by 350,000 shares, slashed its stake in Yahoo (YHOO) and rid itself of Bank of America and General Motors (GM).Along with boosting its stake in Apple, David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital dissolved its stake in Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), U.S. Steel (X) and Michael Kors (KORS).Like Buffett, Greenlight also took a stake in Monsanto (MON).But the moves by Soros and Appaloosa into airlines are notable in that they could signal other big investors are following Buffett, who announced Q3 stakes in the sector last year.Buffett, after years of avoiding the airlines, has come around to the industry. Airlines last year showed more signs of discipline, and the wave of consolidation over the past several years has kept the major airlines relatively insulated from new competition.""When we launched on the sector late last year, we found most investors generally in agreement that airlines represented deep value,"" Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski wrote in a research note dated Tuesday.""The biggest question remains: when will the market and, more importantly, large long-term investors begin to care? We think tonight's Berkshire Hathaway 13F will go a long way to attract sector interest.""RELATED:Airline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back UpDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The AtlanticJPMorgan Sets Fresh High, Goldman Hits Highest Since 2007 On Yellen

The S&P 500 aims to beat recent resistance near the 2300 level, and the Nasdaq's uptrend is looking to break above 5670.Retail and apparel stocks were busy in early action. Dow component Wal-Mart (WMT) advanced 0.4% at the open. Sanford Bernstein initiated coverage on the big box retailer with a market perform rating and a 75 price target.Gap (GPS) fell 1% after reporting fourth-quarter results after Monday's close that came in ahead of forecasts. Weak fiscal third-quarter revenue and fourth-quarter guidance sent Michael Kors (KORS) 13% lower at the open.General Motors (GM) dropped 3.5% despite that its fourth-quarter results showed earnings and revenue comfortably above consensus views and full-year earnings guidance at the high end of the expected range. General Motors shares fell below the 50-day moving average.BP (BP) groaned 3% lower after the oil producer's fourth-quarter profit missed analysts' targets and the U.K.-based company said oil prices must raise to $60 per barrel for its cash flow to cover its dividend and capital spending budget. The company estimated payments related to the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico would be $4.5 to $5.5 billion this year, dropping to $2 billion in 2018 and $1 billion in 2019.Fiber-optic electronics manufacturer Fabrinet (FN) jumped nearly 6% on fiscal second-quarter earnings that rose 82%, helped by a 51% revenue gain, both far above analyst views. Fabrinet is forming a double-bottom base with a 45.30 buy point. More aggressive investors might plot an alternative buy point near 43-44.Among IBD 50 stocks, HealthEquity (HQY) grabbed a 0.5% gain at the open. The healthcare savings company reiterated its 2017 and 2018 earnings and revenue guidance late Monday, and reported the number of managed health savings accounts it operates rose 28% year-over-year, to 2.7 million at Jan. 31. Custodial assets rose to $5 billion, up 37%. HealthEquity is in buy range from a 45.10 flat base buy point.After today's closing bell, earnings reports are expected from Walt Disney (DIS), Microchip Technologies (MCHP), Inphi (IPHI), Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD), Lumentum (LITE) and others.The Commerce Department reported the U.S. trade deficit narrowed in December to $44.3 billion, from $45.7 billion in November.

198,KORS,"The holiday retail numbers are rolling in, and they do not look good. Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) shares were set aflame late Wednesday (and continue to burn Thursday) on same-store sales declines and slashed earnings targets.The dismal department store results have also singed Michael Kors (KORS), Coach (COH), Kate Spade (KATE) and Fossil (FOSL). The accessories brands are feeling the heat following Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren's comment that handbags and watches performed poorly over the major selling period.""Accessories was the single consistent 'negative' at both"" retailers, wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy. ""This leads us to believe the (North American) handbag category is tracking for another flat to down quarter, which likely impacts KORS.""Some specialty retailers are logging worse-than-expected holiday sales results. Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works parent L Brands (LB) said comparable sales declined 1% for the five weeks ended Dec. 31, and now projects fourth-quarter per-share profit toward the lower end of guidance for $1.85-$2, below consensus views for $1.98.The decline surprised Street analysts who had been expecting a comp increase of 1.5%.Shares of Macy's collapsed 14% on the stock market today, and Kohl's plunged 19%. L Brands sank 7.9%, Fossil tumbled 7.6% and Michael Kors fell 3.2%. Coach dropped 2.6% but Kate Spade, which could put itself up for sale, rallied to close up 0.7%. lost 2%.IBD'S TAKE: This year will be one of ""reckoning"" and ""awakening,"" said NPD Group's Marshal Cohen, as retailers grapple with modern consumption habits.But it's not all coal in Christmas stockings, at least in the e-commerce realm. Adobe (ADBE) said the November and December holiday season brought in an 11% year-over-year online sales rise to $91.7 billion, a little more than a tenth percent above predictions for $91.6 billion.And among individual retailers, Costco (COST) logged a 3% comp gain for December, which Retail Metrics said is the warehouse retailer's greatest monthly comp gain in two years.Shares of Costco were up 2% Thursday.Children's Place (PLCE) ""was one the few bright spots in retail so far reporting a solid 6.9% holiday same-store sales gain for the November-December period,"" said the research firm's president Ken Perkins in a report.Comparable retail sales rose 6.9% in the first nine weeks of Q4, prompting the company to raise Q4 and full-year earnings guidance.Children's Place shares fell intraday to 100.35 but closed up 0.1% at 104.20.

199,KORS,"Shares of fashion designer and retailer Kate Spade (KATE) surged intraday Wednesday on a report that the company has considered putting itself up for sale.The company is working with an investment bank to explore potential buyers, amid pressure from activist hedge fund Caerus Investors, which disclosed a stake in Kate Spade last month, according to the Wall Street Journal.Coach (COH) has long been considered a good fit for Kate Spade, the Journal said, noting Coach's handbags and accessories.Shares of Kate Spade jumped 23.1% to 17.86 on the stock market today, vaulting above their 50-day moving average. Coach edged up 2%. Michael Kors (KORS), another maker of handbags and accessories, climbed 0.5%. Vince Holding (VNCE) climbed 5%, and Vera Bradley (VRA) edged up 0.1%.Higher-end retailers have struggled with heavy discounting, off-price rivals, tepid mall traffic and the increasing popularity of online shopping.

201,KORS,"JCPenney (JCP) said that same-store sales fell 0.8% in November and December, making it the latest department store giant to put up uninspiring holiday results as malls become increasingly barren and Amazon.com (AMZN)-led e-commerce thrives.Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) late Wednesday cut profit forecasts due to tepid holiday sales, with both saying November-December comps slid 2.1%. Macy's also said it planned to slash 10,000 jobs as it closes 68 stores as part of a plan to shut 100 locations over time. The forecasts also came after Macy's in November expressed optimism about the holiday quarter.Meanwhile, Sears (SHLD) said this week that it would sell Craftsman to Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) and close 150 Kmart and Sears locations.JCPenney fell 3.7% to 7.57 in the stock market today after tumbling 7.2% on Thursday.The retailer said the first three weeks of November were ""challenging,"" but that comps from the Thanksgiving week through the end of December were positive. Sluggish sales in women's apparel continued to weigh on the chain's results, JCPenney said.The picture was a brighter for appliances, jewelry, outerwear, boots, toys and Sephora beauty products. JCPenney's e-commerce division saw ""double-digit growth,"" the company said, and it held to its EBITDA goal of $1 billion for fiscal 2016.""As we prepare for a new fiscal year, our turnaround in profitability remains on track, and I am pleased that we expect to deliver our fourth consecutive quarter of positive operating profit,"" CEO Marvin Ellison said in a statement.IBD'S TAKE: As traditional and specialty retailers struggle amid the galactic expansion of Amazon, off-price retailers have done better. Burlington Stores, formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory, was among the few growth stories in retail. As retailers reel, Adobe (ADBE) this week reported that online holiday sales rose 11% to a record $91.7 billion. Meanwhile, the December jobs report showed that nonstore retailers reported a 5.5% employment gain over the past 12 months. While neither report named Amazon, other surveys suggested that it was grabbing a huge share of overall e-commerce sales.Amazon rose 2%, continuing to advance after clearing its 50-day moving average earlier in the week.Macy's dipped 0.1% Friday after crashing nearly 14% Thursday. Kohl's lost 1.4% following Thursday's 19% plunge.

226,KORS,"Department stores Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) cut earnings estimates late Wednesday, citing weak holiday sales, sending shares of both department stores sharply lower after the close.Kohl's said its full-year earnings per share target to $2.92-$2.97 from $3.12-$3.32 and estimates of $3.94. November-December same-store sales fell 2.1% vs. a year earlier.Macy's cut its EPS target to $2.95-$3.10 vs. its prior goal of $3.15-$3.40. Macy's also reported a 2.1% November-December comps decline.Macy's also gave more details on its late 2016 announcement to close 100 stores. It set plans to cut 68 stores as part of that effort, cutting 10,000 jobs as part of the closures and other restructurings. The closures will cut 2017 sales by $575 million.""We continue to experience declining traffic in our stores where the majority of our business is still transacted,"" Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren said. ""We had anticipated sales would be stronger. We believe that our performance during the holiday season reflects the broader challenges facing much of the retail industrySeveral reports indicated that brick-and-mortar chains and malls saw weak traffic during the holiday season as shoppers made purchases at Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce sites. Nordstrom (JWN) said its full-line stores were seeing the worst traffic since 1972.Macy's plummeted 8.9% in late trading on the stock market today. Kohl's crashed 13.5%. Nordstrom fell 6% and JCPenney (JCP) 4.7%. Amazon was little changed.Lundgren noted that handbags and watches were weak for Macy's during the holidays.

227,KORS,"The market was mixed through midday trading in the stock market today as the retail sector lagged the general market after several large retailers reported disappointing holiday sales.The Nasdaq outperformed today on the back of strength in large-cap tech stocks.

The stock formed a four-weeks-tight pattern, but has yet to emerge from it into new highs.Netflix (NFLX) remained in good form, rising 2% following yesterday's cup-with-handle breakout. Volume remained solidly higher, tracking 44% above average.Retailers experienced across-the-board selling after Macy's (M) and Kohls (KSS) cut earnings estimates, citing weak holiday sales after the close Wednesday. Kohl's shares fell 20%.Macy's also intends to close 100 stores, which will reduce 2017 sales by $575 million. Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren indicated that what Macy's encountered may be applicable throughout the entire retail sector. He said, ""We had anticipated sales would be stronger. We believe our performance during the holiday season reflects the broader challenges facing much of the retail industry."" Shares plunged 14%.Amazon.com (AMZN) dominated the holiday season, accounting for 38% of online sales from Nov. 1 to Dec. 29.

"
228,KORS,"As malls die, Macy's (M) plans huge job cuts, and Sears (SHLD) closes 150 stores, online sales on sites like Amazon (AMZN) and devices like your Apple (AAPL) iPhone, to the surprise of perhaps nobody, were higher during the 2016 holiday season.Online sales rose 11% a record $91.7 billion, Adobe (ADBE) said Thursday, slightly surpassing the company's own expectations for $91.6 billion. More of those sales were made via mobile devices, which drove half of site visits, Adobe said. Mobile sales jumped 23% to $28.43 billion.Other surveys have suggested that Amazon grabbed a huge share of that e-commerce growth. But it didn't entirely hog the spotlight. Online auction site eBay (EBAY) was the most mentioned retailer on social media, ""with eBay sellers promoting their items for purchase and eBay buyers highlighting products they bought that they couldn't find in stores,"" Adobe said.Amazon shares rose 3.1% to 780.45 in heavy volume on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day moving average. Amazon hadn't closed above that key support level since Oct. 27, when the online giant missed earnings estimates and gave cautious guidance.Shares of eBay edged up, continuing to trade comfortably above their 50-day. Apple, which announced December App Store revenue hit $3 billion in December, also nudged higher, close to a buy point.Amazon, Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) lagged eBay in social-media mentions.Pokemon Sun/Moon was the most frequently mentioned product, followed by Barbie, Oculus and Legos.""But it's not just the total online sales figure that made this a historic holiday shopping season,"" said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst and director at Adobe Digital Insights, in a statement. ""This year, Black Friday set a new record by surpassing the $3 billion mark for the first time at $3.34 billion, with high growth in the evening hours.""Black Friday also became the first day in retail history to bring in more than $1 billion in mobile sales, she said.And Adobe's report indicated that more people are doing their buying later in the holiday season — posing more challenges to the delivery infrastructures of UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX).Sales accelerated closer to the end of last month, Adobe said, as shipping cutoff dates approached and more customers made purchases online and picked them up in stores.IBD'S TAKE: As malls become relics of the retail and real estate world and Amazon comes to dominate more forms of commerce, many store chains will face a reckoning this year.The gains in online sales have come at the expense of many brick-and-mortar retailers. Macy's and Kohl's (KSS) slashed earnings views late Wednesday as both reported a 2.1% same-store sales decline in November and December. Barnes & Noble (BKS) also said holiday sales were grim, while Sears announced a new raft of store closures and sold its Craftsman tool line.Macy's shares crashed 14% Thursday, Kohl's 19% and Barnes & Noble nearly 7%. Other department stores, apparel retailers and makers and other retail-related groups were big losers Thursday.Those follow other signs that physical stores were suffering.Handbag maker and retailer Kate Spade (KATE) is reportedly exploring a sale, while Nordstrom (JWN) management, according to a JPMorgan report, said brick-and-mortar traffic was at its worst levels in more than 40 years.Off-price retailers, however, have fared better against the likes of Amazon in part due to their ""treasure hunt"" appeal, in which shoppers don't entirely know what kind of bargain they're going to find.RELATED:Christmas Meltdown: Macy's, Kohl's, Kors, Fossil, L Brands, OthersWhat's Driving The Success Of 'Un-Amazon-Able' Ulta Beauty?Ross Stores: A No-Nonsense Retailer Free From Amazon's Clutches

Is this still a terrible time to be a department store?Like a white elephant exchange at an office holiday party, it's not clear whether everyone will be happy once all the gifting's done.Among clothiers, Gap (GPS), parent to Banana Republic, Old Navy and its flagship brand, is expected to log a 1.2% same-store sales decline during the December quarter, according to Retail Metrics estimates. Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works parent L Brands (LB) is seen growing comps 1.5%.Handbag makers Kate Spade (KATE) and Coach (COH) are likely to have a merry Christmas quarter with projected comp growth of 6.8% and 2.1%, respectively, while peer Michael Kors (KORS) is expected to drop 4.4%.Overall, early December figures appear sluggish so far. Research firm NPD Group said Wednesday that dollar sales for the week ending Dec. 3, the fifth week of the holiday shopping season, had dropped 5% from the same prior-year period.Shoppers are still buying sneakers, though. Athletic footwear sales for the week rose 2%, the only industry to outperform that week, said the firm.Nike (NKE) shares fell 1% to 51.29 on the stock market today.

Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) Watch shipments plummeted 71% during the period. But Fitbit issued a grim holiday outlook, while Apple might fare better now that its Apple Watch 2 is out.Apple iPads were widely reported to be big sellers over Thanksgiving weekend, thanks to doorbuster deals. The Apple iPhone 7 also should be a solid seller, even if the latest generation isn't seen as revolutionary.Apple shares rose 0.55% to 115.82, closing in on a 118.79 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: After initially lagging during the Trump market rally, Apple, Amazon and other big-cap techs are shaping up for potential breakouts.For November, department stores sales slipped 0.2%, and apparel sales were flat, according to the Commerce Department on Wednesday. Overall retail sales rose 0.1% from October, falling short of expectations.Retail Metrics sees a 1.5% drop in Macy's (M) holiday-quarter same-store sales but expects rival department stores J.C. Penney (JCP) and Nordstrom (JWN) to log decent gains.Big-box heavyweight Wal-Mart (WMT) should log 1.2% same-store sales growth, according to Retail Metrics.The National Retail Federation appeared bullish on holiday spending, and said that November's results point to figures that will meet or exceed its holiday sales forecast of 3.6% growth. (The forecast spans the November and December shopping period.)""The combination of job and wage gains led to solid holiday spending by American households,"" said NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz in a statement Wednesday.RELATED:November Retail Sales Rose Just 0.1%: No Trump Holiday Bump?Apple Watch Q3 Shipments Plunge; Fitbit Lead Widens In Wearables

Gold mining stocks that retook some key technical levels went back down. Newmont Mining (NEM) fell 16%, Barrick Gold (ABX) 19%.

Analysts had modeled non-GAAP EPS of 81 cents and revenue of $130.8 million after Acacia revised guidance twice during the quarter. The maker of high-speed optical devices for communications networks sees adjusted EPS of 85-92 cents vs. views of 78 cents. But revenue of $138.5 million at the midpoint of its guidance is just above the consensus for $137.2 million.

260,KORS,"Landlords on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue are sitting on a record amount of open space as retailers balk at committing to expensive new leases in one of the world's most prestigious shopping districts.The availability rate on the famed strip, home to Saks (SKS) Fifth Avenue and Tiffany & Co.'s (TIF)flagship store, jumped to 15.9% in the third quarter, up from about 10% a year earlier, according to Cushman & Wakefield. The rate has climbed steadily this year, surpassing the prior peak of 11.3%, set in the fourth quarter of 2014.The rise of empty storefronts isn't limited to Fifth Avenue. It's part of a Manhattan-wide space glut as retailers -- buffeted by e-commerce, tepid demand for luxury goods and a strong dollar that's eroded tourist spending -- push back against rents that have soared to records. Leasing costs have increased in tandem with property values in the past five years, outpacing gains in merchandise sales and making it impossible for retailers to run profitable stores at many locations, according to Richard Hodos, a vice chairman at brokerage CBRE Group (CBG).""Property trades are being based on achieving ever-higher rents, and nobody ever really looks at what retailers can afford to pay,"" Hodos said. ""In some cases, rents need to come down 30% or more for rents to be at levels where retailers are able to make sense of them again.""Retailers are being squeezed across the U.S. In 2016, malls and other types of shopping venues have been hit by 280 major-brand store closures, totaling 12.8 million square feet (1.2 million square meters), data from Reis (REIS) show. Another real estate research firm, Green Street Advisors, estimates that several hundred malls around the country will cease operations over the next decade.Shoppers continue to shift their spending from stores to computers and smartphones. Online sales in the U.S. are expected to reach $398 billion this year, up 16% from 2015, according to research firm eMarketer.On the stretch of Fifth Avenue from 49th to 60th streets, which commands the world's highest rents, landlords are asking an average of $3,213 a square foot, up from $2,075 a square foot in 2011, Cushman data show. In the tourist-heavy Times Square area, rents stand at $2,104 a square foot after tripling over a four-year period.The brokerage's retail availability rate takes into account vacancies as well as stores occupied by merchants that plan to leave when their leases expire. Retailers that signed leases at high prices in the past several years and are seeking a tenant to sublease their space are also included, according to Steve Soutendijk, an executive director at Cushman.""Tenants that signed at the absolute top of the market are looking to mitigate their exposure,"" he said.At 667 Madison Ave., a 24-story tower two blocks from Central Park, Michael Kors Holdings (KOR) is looking to sublease about 5,000 square feet of retail space at the base of the building, according to a person familiar with the plans. The store, with 22-foot ceilings, was the company's largest when it opened in 2012, the New York Times reported at the time.Four years later, the London-based fashion house is struggling to pay the rent, said the person, who asked not to be identified because negotiations aren't public. Michael Kors is seeking a tenant to take over the space on a lease that runs through 2023, the person said.A spokeswoman for Michael Kors declined to comment. Representatives for the company's landlord, Hartz Group, didn't respond to calls and emails seeking comment.Property owners with space to fill are starting to lower their expectations, according to Cushman's Soutendijk. Asking rents in some of Manhattan's prime shopping districts, including Soho and Times Square, have declined over the course of 2016, Cushman data show.""I think a lot of landlords are ready to make deals,"" Soutendijk said. ""Everybody understands there is too much space in the market. We are not in a state of equilibrium.""Buyers of real estate during the recent boom years may not have much room to maneuver. To justify paying record prices for buildings -- and the debt that financed the acquisitions -- owners are under pressure to get the highest rents possible, according to Patrick Smith, a vice chairman of the retail brokerage at Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL).""Typically, a building that has been capitalized over the past three years is very rent-sensitive,"" he said.Landlords who hold out for the right tenant can be left hanging on to empty space for years. A partnership of developer Thor Equities and General Growth Properties, the second-largest owner of U.S. malls, bought 530 Fifth Ave. in 2014. During a conference call with analysts that year, General Growth Chief Executive Officer Sandeep Mathrani highlighted the property's large, vacant block as an opportunity to attract new retailers.No new retail leases have been signed at the property since the acquisition, though three tenants are close to agreements, according to a person with knowledge of the plans. The prospective occupants are in the health-and-beauty and sporting-goods businesses, and will likely pay less in rent than what the building owners had originally aimed for, said the person, who asked not to be identified because negotiations are ongoing.Representatives for Thor and General Growth declined to comment on plans for the property. The building sits between 44th and 45th Streets, several blocks south of Fifth Avenue's most-sought-after addresses. The availability rate in the area has climbed to 29%, Cushman data show.Manhattan's empty storefronts will eventually be absorbed, according to Smith of Jones Lang. The way space is used may change to focus more on the experience than just the merchandise -- for example, Lululemon Athletica (LULU) offers yoga classes in its stores -- but New York will always be a magnet for retailers and shoppers, he said.""Will Fifth Avenue, which has been a multigenerational place to shop and has evolved over many, many decades, continue to be a successful place? Absolutely,"" Smith said. ""Will it look the same? No.""MORE ABOUT RETAIL PROPERTY:J.C.

263,KORS,"Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) fell 14% before the opening bell on the stock market today after second-quarter results trailed analysts' estimates, hurt by declining sales at its larger flagship locations.The loss in the quarter was 25 cents a share, excluding some items, the New Albany, Ohio-based company said in a statement Tuesday. Analysts projected a loss of 20 cents, on average.The results show Abercrombie is struggling with a tourism slowdown that has hurt retailers who rely on large, flagship locations in major cities to drive sales. Merchants including Tiffany (TIF) and Michael Kors Holdings (KORS) attributed recent weakness to the dearth of spending by travelers, who have been discouraged from visiting the U.S. by the dollar's strength and global economic uncertainty. For Abercrombie, the trend contributed to a 4% drop in comparable sales, which was worse than the 3.8% slide analysts estimated.""Flagship and tourist locations continued to account for the vast majority of the comparable sales decline as traffic remained a significant headwind,"" Executive Chairman Arthur Martinez said in the statement. He said the company expects those stores to continue to weigh on the business for the rest of the year.Total sales fell 4.2% to $783.2 million, just missing analysts' $783.6 million projection.The shares slid nearly 14% to 19.75 in premarket trading.

268,KORS,"Kate Spade (KATE) plunged Wednesday after the handbag and fashion company missed estimates and slashed guidance, blaming tourism and general retail woes. The move also dragged down peers including Michael Kors (KORS) and Coach (COH) and exacerbated concerns about the consumer sector. Kate Spade's Q2 earnings per share rose 38% to 11 cents, missing estimates by 3 cents a share. The retailer topped earnings expectations in Q1 after missing the prior four quarters in a row.""Several factors contributed to our second-quarter results falling short of our expectations, the most impactful of which are the retail landscape and continuing tourist headwinds,"" CEO Craig Leavitt said in the written earnings statement.Terror fears and a rising dollar is hurting travel from Europe.The New York retailer sees full-year earnings of 63-70 cents, far below analyst consensus of 78 cents a share. It cut its 2016 revenue outlook to $1.37 billion to $1.48 billion, down from $1.39 billion-$1.41 billion, and below projections of $1.41 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Kate Spade's earnings miss and weak outlook is stoking fears that weakness in the consumer sector and a slump in tourism could be a negative economic indicator. To see how Kate Spade ranks vs. other retailers see the IBD Stock Checkup.Kate Spade shares dived more than 18% to 16.47 at the close on the stock market today. On Tuesday it fell more than 6% in sync with a broad consumer retail decline, falling below both its 10-week average and 200-day lines where it was trading on Wednesday.Rival handbag maker Michael Kors fell 2.6% to 49.02, while Coach was up slightly to 41.75.Luxury jewelry chain Tiffany (TIF), whose flagship New York location is highly dependent on tourism, was unchanged at 61.42 after falling as low as 58.76. Tiffany fell 3.6% on Tuesday.Meanwhile, JCPenney (JCP)  fell 1.6% to 9.13. Kohl's (KSS) and Macy's (M) each were up more than 2% after opening sharply lower with Kohl's at 38.72 and Macy's at 33.43. JCPenney, Kohl's and Macy's all tumbled Tuesday amid a widespread sell-off in consumer-related stocks.General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) reported declining July U.S. sales Tuesday, following Ford's weak earnings and industry guidance last week. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported weak July revenue, bringing down airline stocks that day. And Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) tumbled Tuesday on weak sales and sales guidance, following weaker-than-expected U.S. sales at McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX).

269,KORS,"Some things are best judged if they aren't regarded in isolation. A film advertisement, for instance, once boldly trumpeted ""an endearing romantic comedy"" across a page and attributed the seemingly high praise to a movie review in a newspaper.The review actually read, ""political propaganda wrapped into an endearing romantic comedy that starts losing its laughs,"" but that was conveniently left out of the ad.Investing data can also be misleading if you are viewing only out-of-context facts.If a company reports a jump in revenue growth, an experienced investor will ask two questions: Is the company slashing prices to step up sales growth? Did the company make an acquisition that's boosting sales?Sales growth from an acquisition can be positive, especially if the acquisition is adding a higher-margin business.But sales growth driven by lower prices suggests the company's products are seeing weaker demand or that the products are being commoditized.Many products start out being high-margin items. But as more competitors emerge, they become lower-margin commodities. You want to catch a stock on the right end of that trend.So, when an investor notices an increase in sales, the first thing to check is IBD's SMR Rating, which stands for sales, margins and return on equity.IBD combines those three elements into one rating because they are interrelated. You can find the ratings at Investors.com in the stock quotes area and in Stock Checkup, and on the MarketSmith charts.The SMR rating's scale runs from A to E, with A being the best. Generally, you should avoid buying stocks with an SMR rating of D or E. Sometimes a turnaround candidate will have a C rating, but most top-rated stocks carry an A or B.The gauge is useful because sales growth built on low margins will hurt the SMR Rating. Return on equity is relevant because it measures how efficiently a company is using its net assets to make a profit.After the Dec. 20, 2011, follow-through day confirmed an uptrend was underway, the market remained in the uptrend for 67 sessions.In the first month after the follow-through, a number of quality stocks cleared buy points. They included InvenSense (INVN), Michael Kors (KORS), Monster Beverage (MNST), Sturm Ruger (RGR), Tractor Supply (TSCO) and Visa (V). Some of those entries were triggered by breakouts from bases and others from three-weeks-tight patterns. One was a short-stroke pattern.All of the companies mentioned above went on to rally 27% or more from their breakout points.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the July 10, 2012, edition of IBD.)
"
270,KORS,"Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) reported better-than-feared second strong quarter earnings, boosting shares of both department store chains and the broader retail sector. Nordstrom (JWN) late Thursday reported better-than-expected earnings.JCPenney (JCP) is queued for early Friday. Retail groups dominated the top-performing industries Thursday on the stock market today.The department stores offered some relief after a procession of consumer-oriented companies -- aside from e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) -- reported sluggish demand, from Ford Motor (F) to McDonald's (MCD), that fueled sector sell-offs often led by department store stocks.Macy's reported a 16% drop in earnings per share minus one-time items to 54 cents, beating estimates for 45 cents. Revenue slid 3.8% to $5.87 billion, the sixth straight quarter of year-over-year declines, but still topping consensus for $5.75 billion.Macy's said overall same-store sales fell 2% vs. a year earlier.The Cincinnati-based company plans to close 100 Macy's full-line locations, or 14%. Most of them will close in early 2017. Coach (COH) said on Tuesday it will shutter some 250 locations -- known as ""doors"" -- or about 25% of the total it has within North America, as part of ""the strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand's positioning.""Macy's said it's still seeing lower-than-normal store spending, but left its full-year guidance intact. The company sees EPS of $3.15-$3.40, with the midpoint slightly above consensus.Kohl's Q2 EPS rose 14% to $1.22, easily topping views for $1.03. Sales fell 2.1% to $4.18 billion, better than the expected $4.16 billion.Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman and CEO, said in a statement, ""Our sales improved over our first-quarter results but were below our expectations."" As a result, the company cut its full-year earnings guidance to $3.80-$4, down from $4.05-$4.25 previously but still above analysts' consensus for $3.83 at the midpoint.Macy's stock spiked 17.1% to 39.81 Thursday, the highest since the beginning of May. Macy's is trading above 200-day line for the first time in a year, as it tries to break a long downtrend.Kohl's rose 16.2% to 44.19. It's still well below below its 2016 high of 52.06, set on Jan. 7.Retails Metrics analyst Ken Perkins said in a report that for Macy's and Kohl's earnings provided ""rays of hope"" as inventories and margins improved. Still, he noted that ""both retailers guided FY16 earnings below the current consensus.""IBD'S TAKE: Traditional department stores such as Macy's, Kohl's and Nordstrom are getting beaten down by online retailers like Amazon. Giant Wal-Mart is trying to stem the tidy by buying a strong online presence.Retailers are under pressure due to a confluence of negatives. Fashion houses Kate Spade (KATE) and Michael Kors (KORS) noted in their reports that tourists visiting certain key cities have cut back on spending at their stores. The strong dollar is seen as the culprit, making some affordable luxury items too pricey for tourists.Spade and Kors also cited less foot traffic in malls. Consumers continue to opt for online bargains shipped to their home, for free if they're members of a service like Amazon's $99 a year Amazon Prime free shipping and video streaming.Brick-and-mortar retailers may continue to lose share in the crucial holiday buying season, while Amazon and other online retailers continue growing.Nordstrom jumped 7.5% at the close, then spiked after hours after reporting stronger-than-expected earnings. JCPenney climbed 8.6%, with analysts expecting a smaller loss Friday morning.The Commerce Department's July retail sales report, due Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show a 0.4% rise, or a 0.2% increase when excluding autos. There could also be an Amazon Prime Day effect in the data.

Meanwhile, the global rollout of Purchasing Managers' Index reports from London-based researcher Markit made economic news an early factor in the stock market today.Markit reports showed further slowing in the eurozone and China and accelerating declines in Japan. Japan's Nikkei average ended Wednesday down nearly 2%. Benchmark indexes in Europe showed losses just shy of 1% at midday.

316,KORS,"Here is your Investing Action Plan for Wednesday: what you need to know as an investor.Quarterly results for Michael Kors (KORS) and Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) are on tap for Wednesday, following a string of depressing results out of the retail sector.Will the Federal Reserve rates soon? May U.S. auto sales from General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and others, the May ISM manufacturing index and the Fed's own beige book will offers strong clues.Many apparel and accessories retailers this year have been shaken due to competitive discounting, a warmer winter and a colder spring, and lackluster trends. Michael Kors, which sells luxury clothing and accessories like handbags and watches, has been no exception, and Nordstrom (JWN) is reportedly purging its inventory of Michael Kors bags.But Wall Street expects the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share to rise 6.6% to 96 cents on sales up 6.2% to $1.147 billion.Michael Kors' shares plunged below their 200-day line this month after dire sales and profit forecasts from Macy's (M), which cited poor demand in handbags. Fossil (FOSL), which makes some of the watches that appear on Kors' shelves, also reported ""a malaise in watches"" as wearable technology like the Apple (AAPL) Watch becomes more popular.Some analysts, however, remain upbeat. Jefferies this month said Kors has strengthened its brand internationally and could get a lift from spring trends and reduced promotions. Weaker demand out of China could also expand the cattle supply, Jefferies noted, potentially meaning cheaper hide prices and cheaper leather costs for handbags.Shares were up Tuesday by 2.2% to 42.72.Analysts expect discounter Ollie's Bargain Outlet's first-quarter EPS to come in at 17 cents on sales of $190.44 million.The stock, which came public in July, broke out of a cup-with-handle base in March, then climbed into profit-taking territory in April before heading back down.Ollie's has a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. Shares ended Tuesday down 2.1% to 25.07.Ford, General Motors and other big automakers are set to report auto-sales data for May.The reports come amid concerns that auto sales may be soon approaching their peak. Analysts have also grown more worried about a potential auto-loan bubble.WardsAuto expects an annualized rate of 17.3 million units, down from 17.4 million in April, while a J.D. Power and LMC Automotive forecast puts May sales at 17.4 million.Experian this month said open auto loans climbed past $1 trillion in the first quarter and said auto lenders should ""keep a close eye on delinquency trends to ensure the market remains healthy,” even though delinquencies were low compared to before the recession.S&P Global ratings last week also cited ""increasing risk in the market that packages and sells low-rated auto loans."" Ford edged down by 4 cents to 13.49 Tuesday while GM lost 0.4% to 31.28.The ISM is set to release its manufacturing index for May. The index, a measure of strength in manufacturing, fell to 50.8 in April from a 51.8 reading in March. Analysts expect it to dip to 50.6 in May.Still, that would mark the third straight month of expansion. A reading of 50 or above signifies manufacturing growth.Manufacturers cited in the ISM's April report suggested lukewarm economic conditions, with more stable prices for oil and other commodities helping.The Federal Reserve releases its beige book report on U.S. economic conditions. In April, the report indicated stronger wage growth and gains in customer spending.On Tuesday, the Commerce Department backed that view, reporting that April personal spending surged 1% vs. March, the fastest pace in nearly seven years. Personal incomes rose 0.4%.The Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed a 1.1% yearly gain in prices, up from March's 0.8% uptick.

336,KORS,"Shares gapped up, slipped, but was still trading up 5.9% by late afternoon.Shares of luxury accessories retailer Coach (COH) gapped up to a seven-month high after the company reported second-quarter earnings that topped analyst expectations. But the handbag purveyor reiterated a theme from the first quarter: Its transition to a fashion-relevant store ""will take time.""Q2's earnings of 72 cents per share beat views for 66 cents, but that result was down 32% from a year earlier. Sales fell 14% to $1.219 billion, while analysts expected $1.225 billion. A stronger dollar and costs associated with store closures and renovations pressured the results.North American sales overall fell 20% to $785 million, a drop the company said it expected. Comparable-store sales in North America declined 22%.International sales fared better, falling 1% to $421 million. On a constant currency basis, the company said, those sales rose 5%, led by gains in China.In midday trading shares were up 6.5% to 38.84 in the stock market today. Except for a an intraday moment Jan. 13, that's a price shareholders hadn't seen since shares were tumbling June 19.The company, along with other traditional retailers, has struggled in recent years to compete with the rising fast-fashion and affordable-luxury companies, which offer cheaper products and rotate out fashion lines more frequently to cater to younger consumers' more fickle tastes.Analysts have also observed that customers are no longer into brands that prominently display logos like Coach and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF).Coach in 2013 brought in designer Stuart Vevers, formerly of luxury handbag maker Loewe, in attempt to shake up the company's offerings. During the second quarter, Coach said, it introduced its first ""modern luxury concept stores in key markets globally.""And this month, after the end of Q2, the company said it would purchase Stuart Weitzman, a maker of high-end women's shoes, from private equity firm Sycamore Partners.

339,KORS,"Markets finished the week in disarray after a shockingly weak jobs report upended what had been an increasingly clear case for another increase in benchmark interest rates -- just days before Federal Reserve policymakers meet.Meanwhile, the future of the auto sector came into focus as Tesla Motors (TSLA) offered clues to its ambitious production goals, and Uber got a massive investment that values the ride-hailing service at $62.5 billion.May's 38,000 net hires were the worst since September 2010. Even adjusting for the roughly 35,000 workers affected by the strike at Verizon (VZ), the payroll gain was still far below the 158,000 hires that economists had expected.The jobless rate fell to 4.7% from 5%, but that was due to a plunge in the number of people looking for work.The jobs shocker overshadowed more positive data earlier. Consumer spending in April jumped 1% from a month earlier, the biggest increase in six years. Personal incomes rose 0.4%. ISM's manufacturing index climbed to 51.3 in May from 50.8 in April, topping estimates for a dip to 50.6. The Fed's Beige Book noted modest to moderate economic growth in most regions, with tight labor markets pushing wages higher.The major averages ended the week mixed, giving up modest gains, as the dismal jobs report triggered a sell-off Friday. Economic data earlier in the week seemed to bolster arguments for a Fed rate hike in June or July, but Friday's report may now push back the timeline.Weekly losses by Apple (AAPL) and Nike (NKE) further weighed on indexes. The S&P 500 finished flat for the week, after hitting a seven-month closing high on Thursday. The Nasdaq rose 0.2%, and the Dow industrials lost 0.4%.Shares of Apple closed down 2.4% from a week ago, and Nike fell 4.9%.Tesla Motors co-founder and CEO Elon Musk, speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, said he’s “absolutely convinced” that dramatic  manufacturing improvements can be achieved. Musk said he is completely rethinking Tesla’s current factory process and hopes to improve efficiency by “factors of 10 or even 100 times.” Many analysts are skeptical that Tesla can boost production to 500,000 vehicles by 2018.He also said future owners of the Tesla Model 3 could pay a premium for supercharging packages. ""It will still be very cheap and far cheaper than gasoline to drive long distances with the Model 3,"" Musk said at the meeting. “But it will not be free long distance for life unless you purchase that package.""Later, Musk said Apple would likely build a quality vehicle, but said the Apple car might be ""late"" to the autonomous rush.Tesla stock finished down 1.8% for the week.The Saudi Public Investment Fund invested $3.5 billion in Uber, following a stream of ride-hailing investments and alliances by automakers and tech giants.Toyota (TM) last week announced a strategic investment in Uber, which has teamed up with Baidu (BIDU) in China.As for China, Apple has invested some $1 billion in Didi Chuxing, the dominant ride-hailing app in that country. Didi is backed by Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY).General Motors (GM) previously invested in Lyft, Uber's top U.S. ride-hailing rival.Volkswagen (VLKAY) made its own investment in Gett, which operates  in Europe, Israel and New York City.Athletic apparel maker Under Armour (UA) trimmed 2016 sales guidance to $4.925 billion from $5 billion due to Sports Authority's liquidation (vs. a restructuring or sale), while Nike received downgrades from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley.Under Armour also will reportedly be launching a fashion line -- Under Armour Sportswear -- in the fall, with Tim Coppens as executive creative director.Under Armour shares dropped 4% for the week.Broadcom reported fiscal Q2 sales of $3.56 billion, up 117% vs. a year earlier in its first report since its Avago merger. Earnings per share rose 19% to $2.53, ending a three-quarter string of decelerating growth, despite tumbling Apple iPhone sales.Sales edged the consensus view for $3.55 billion, but EPS topped by 15 cents.Broadcom sees current-quarter sales ex items for $3.75 billion, plus or minus $75 million, up 114%. Analysts expect $3.71 billion.Broadcom stock climbed 6%.GoPro (GPRO) supplier Ambarella (AMBA) reported $57.2 million in sales and 34 cents earnings per share minus items, down 19.5% and 52%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Analysts had expected Q1 sales of $57.01 million and EPS of 28 cents. GoPro's Hero 5 action-camera release is expected in September.Ambarella CEO Fermi Wang acknowledged the wearables headwind and told investors to expect further hold-ups after an earthquake rattled Japan in April.Ambarella stock surged 13%. GoPro gained 5.1%.The oil cartel failed to agree on a collective production ceiling after a previous failed effort in December, as Iran insisted any OPEC-wide limit must also come with output caps on individual members. Top OPEC members, including de facto leader Saudi Arabia, had made a late push for a ceiling ahead of the meeting, but markets weren't surprised by the lack of action.Also, the Energy Information Administration reported U.S. oil inventories fell by 1.4 million barrels, the third decline in the last four weeks. Production continued to drop, falling to 8.735 million barrels a day, the lowest since September 2014, down from 8.767 million in the prior week.For the week, U.S. crude lost 1.4%, settling at $48.62 a barrel on Friday. Brent dropped 0.6% to $49.64 a barrel.Salesforce.com (CRM) agreed to buy Demandware (DWRE) for $2.8 billion, or $75 a share in cash, pushing into the e-commerce market. Demandware is viewed as a leader in the $5 billion digital commerce market, which Gartner expects to grow to $8.5 billion by 2020.“Similar to the ExactTarget acquisition, Salesforce.com is buying the best available asset to serve as the cornerstone of a new cloud offering,” said Steven Ashley, an analyst at R.W. Baird.Salesforce stock ended down 1.5% for the week, while Demandware shot up 61%.The human resources software maker delivered fiscal Q1 non-GAAP profit and revenue that topped views, but billings growth -- a key sales metric -- decelerated from the previous quarter. Workday (WDAY) CEO Aneel Bhusri signaled a greater focus on profitability in fiscal 2018. On the earnings call, he noted that software peers such as Salesforce.com experienced less volatility than Workday during the January market sell-off, which he attributed in part to Salesforce's profitability.Workday stock gained 5.4% for the week.Teen value retailer Five Below’s (FIVE) Q1 EPS leapt 50% to 12 cents, above views by 2 cents, as revenue gained 25% to $192.7 million, also topping. Same-store sales grew 4.9%. But Q2 and full-year guidance fell short of estimates. Shares rose 5%.Michael Kors' (KORS) Q4 earnings and sales topped forecasts. The luxury handbag, apparel and accessories maker and retailer said it would sell fewer products to wholesale department stores as mall traffic falls and discounting rises. That will likely weigh on sales, but it should boost profit.Shares jumped 15.9% for the week.Ollie’s Bargain Outlet (OLLI), which sells a variety of marked-down home goods, reported Q1 EPS of 20 cents on sales of $193.7 million, both topping. Full-year guidance missed. The company also warned that weather at the start of Q2 was “less than desirable for seasonal sales.” Shares fell 0.3%.Shares of Cracker Barrel (CBRL) popped 8.8% this week after the home-style restaurant chain declared a special dividend of $3.25 per share, hiked its quarterly dividend and reported Q3 EPS that topped views. Sales were shy of estimates. Cracker Barrel gave mixed full-year guidance.General Motors said May U.S. sales plunged 18% to 240,753, with retail sales down 13%. Ford (F) U.S. sales fell 6% to 235,997. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) saw a 1% sales increase to 204,452 vehicles, as Jeep sales climbed 14% to 90,545 units. The weak sales -- despite rising incentives and ever-longer and ever-larger auto loans -- added to fears that demand is slowing after several years of robust growth. Still, industry annualized sales for the U.S. were 17.45 million, according to AutoData, up from 17.4 million in April and above estimates for about 17.3 million.

340,KORS,"Macy's (M) dismal first-quarter results and guidance Wednesday bolstered views of Amazon's (AMZN) unrelenting dominance, sending shares of the department store chain -- and most stocks in the retail and consumer sectors -- down.Companies ranging from Wal-Mart (WMT) to Michael Kors (KORS) to Nike (NKE) to Tiffany (TIF) to Williams-Sonoma (WSM), sold off. But Amazon stock rose 1.45%, hitting a fresh high.Macy's report followed Gap's (GPS) forecast late Monday of a 5% drop in Q1 same-store sales and weak earnings. The chain also noted a ""tepid macro environment for apparel retail.""""In light of AMZN and M's recent results, we feel more confident that AMZN will displace M as the #1 US Apparel retailer by '17,"" wrote Cowen analyst John Blackledge in a Wednesday note, doubling down on his assessment from last year.Macy's earnings fell 29% to 40 cents a share, 4 cents above views, on a 7% revenue decline to $5.77 billion that fell short of estimates for $5.93 billion.Same-store sales -- sales at facilities open more than a year -- at both Macy's-owned outlets and licensed operators dropped 5.6%. For Macy's-owned stores only, comps fell 6.1%.Shares plunged 15.2% on the stock market today to the lowest since December 2011. Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN), which report Thursday, fell 6% and 7%, respectively. JCPenney (JCP), which reports Friday, lost 1.85%. On Monday, it said it topped its own goal for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.IBD's Take: Is Macy's a premium or discount stock? And how does it compare to retail rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupMacy's is still in the best position among its department store peers, said Retail Metrics' Ken Perkins, despite Macy's recent struggles, although ""Amazon is doing so many things that a retailer like a Macy's, Target (TGT), Wal-Mart . . . just aren’t able or willing to do.""Adding to the sell-off was Macy's warning on weak consumer spending. Shares of companies not in direct competition with Amazon dropped as well, including McDonald's (MCD) and Panera (PNRA).""We are seeing continued weakness in consumer spending levels for apparel and related categories,"" Macy's Chief Executive Terry Lundgren said in a statement. ""In particular, our sales trend relative to expectations meaningfully slowed beginning in mid-March, and first-quarter results are below our original outlook.""The company now sees full-year per-share profit of $3.15-$3.40, down from its previous outlook of $3.80-$3.90 and far below Wall Street estimates for $3.80 a share. It also expects 2016 same-store sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis to fall 3%-4%, vs. prior outlook for a 1% decline.""We are not counting on the consumer to spend more,"" Lundgren said, so the department store is ""working harder to give customers more reasons to buy from us by delivering outstanding style, quality and value.""For the second straight year, tourist spending is falling in the double digits, he said, and noted a slowdown in some ""center core"" categories. But he also said that the first quarter is a ""relatively small portion of the total year"" and sees a chance to play catch-up over the next three quarters.Still, Macy's isn't exactly the next Sears Holdings (SHLD), which has seen years of falling sales and store closures.""That's a leap,"" laughed Perkins, though he also said the department store's current struggles are more than just a bump in the road.But like Sears, Macy's is evaluating real-estate proposals for joint ventures or similar arrangements. Macy's has been under pressure to spin off its real estate holdings to raise cash.

341,KORS,"Fossil's (FOSL) stock continued its freefall Wednesday after the watch designer a day earlier warned of the challenges that wearable technology -- potentially the Apple (AAPL) Watch and Fitbit (FIT) products -- pose to its traditional watch business.Fossil CEO Kosta Kartsotis said on a conference call late Tuesday that there has been a drop in overall traffic and consumer activity.""In addition to that, I think especially in watches -- we attribute this really to all of the press and PR and excitement around wearables -- there seems to be somewhat of a lack of interest in watches relative to last year,"" he said, adding later, ""there is just a malaise in watches.""Shares plummeted 29% in the stock market today, after a month of struggling to resurface above their 50-day moving average.IBD's Take: How healthy are the shares of Fossil and its rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupApple dipped 1% and Fitbit 0.7%. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) slipped 1.2%. Intel (INTC), whose technology is also used in Fossil watches, eased 0.3%.Shares of luxury apparel seller Michael Kors (KORS), one of the big companies for which Fossil makes watches, sank 12% Wednesday, breaching support at their 200-day line. Michael Kors also sold off due to an across-the-board sell-off in retail and apparel stocks in the wake of Macy's (M) slashed guidance.Fossil expects gross margins to decline this year due to an anticipated increase in outlet promotions, as well as a greater reliance on off-price partners. The stronger dollar also threatens to constrain the company's margins.The company sees second-quarter earnings per share of zero to 15 cents and full-year EPS of $1.80-$2.80, far below the respective 59 cents and $3.01 anticipated by analysts. Its first-quarter results also missed expectations.""You look at our entire analytics and our data right now, we seem to be in a lot of turbulence in terms of the traditional watch business,"" Kartsotis said. ""We feel it is prudent to give the guidance we have given, but we think the combination of wearables and all new product, that at some point this is going to turn around and be a pretty exciting prospect for us.""But even Fossil's weak guidance was too bullish for Nomura analyst Simeon Siegel.""We remain concerned that the FY guide anticipates success of wearable tech, a category which has yet to prove its scalability,"" Siegel said in a research note on Tuesday.In an effort not to be left behind amid the current popularity of the Apple Watch and fitness trackers like Fitbit, Fossil last year launched its first smart devices and announced plans in January to debut more than 100 wearables by the end of 2016.The Apple Watch was mentioned by name only once during Tuesday night;s call, by Chief Strategy and Digital Officer Greg McKelvey, in discussing the Alphabet-owned Android operating system used by Fossil's smartwatches.""On smartwatches, which is effectively the Apple Watch competitive set, we are committed to the Google Android Wear operating system,"" he said. ""So the Michael Kors Access watch and the Fossil Q watches and the lines that are coming out this year, those will always continue to be based on the Google Android Wear operating system.""

461,KORS,"Latching on to an IPO when it's breaking out of an early-stage base can often be a lucrative endeavor, especially in the early stages of a new bull market. In the later stages of a bull market, it's a little tougher.When Google (now known as Alphabet (GOOGL)) cleared an IPO base in mid-September 2004, it was an easy stock to hold. Post-breakout, it never came close to the buy point and went on to a huge gain. The same with MasterCard (MA), which never looked back after clearing an IPO base in August 2006.For growth investors, fishing in the new-issue pond is smart strategy, especially when it comes to firms with innovative products and services with bright growth prospects. These are the types of stocks that can deliver explosive gains. And a solid market uptrend always helps, but sometimes the market doesn't cooperate.Some gains from IPO bases can be eye-popping. Other times, gains are more subdued. Knowing when to sell is critical.One IBD rule says that if a gain from a base breakout hits 20% within three weeks or less, the stock should be held eight weeks. The eight-week hold rule also applies to IPOs, but such a big gain is not necessary to trigger the rule. Whether it's a high-flying stock or a new issue with potential, the eight-week hold rule is there to help you stay patient with a potential big market leader.Alibaba (BABA) didn't suffer from lack of exposure when it came public in September 2014. And why not? A company with big earnings and sales growth smack dab in the middle of a booming China e-commerce market? Investors saw dollar signs in spades. It ended up raising $25 billion, the most ever for an IPO. A breakout from an IPO base with a 99.80 buy point yielded a solid gain in short order.When an IPO shows resilience and is up at least 5% to 10% after the first few weeks of the breakout, try to hold it for eight weeks. If the stock behaves itself over that time, you can decide to hold or sell part or all of the position at the end of the eighth week.In Alibaba's case, the eight-week hold rule would have been tough to follow. After rising 20% to a high of 120, the stock drifted lower and paid a visit to its 10-week moving average. It found support during the week ended Dec. 19, but then it fell for the next two weeks, putting the rally in doubt. With eight weeks passed since the initial breakout, one could have exited the stock at that time or at least sold half the position. If an IPO sputters, the main thing is not to let a decent profit cycle into a loss.When Michael Kors (KORS) went public in December 2011, it didn't take long for the stock to clear an IPO base in January 2012. Kors posted four straight weekly price gains after the breakout week. After eight weeks, the gain from a 27.68 buy point hit 83%. It was decision time for those following the eight-week hold rule. Taking at least partial profits turned out to be the right move, as Kors was just on the cusp of a new base-building period.

462,KORS,"Gap (GPS) shares tumbled Friday following the release of disappointing March sales figures, joining apparel companies like L Brands (LB) and Michael Kors (KORS) that are also selling off below key levels of support.Late Thursday, Gap reported a system-wide 6% same-store sales decline for March, swinging from 2% growth in the prior year. Gap brand comps fell 3%, Banana Republic comps dove 14%, and Old Navy fell 6%.The company also said it is ""entering April with more inventory than planned, which the company expects will pressure its gross margin rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016.""Gap's management is optimistic about new merchandise, FBR analyst Susan Anderson wrote in a Friday note. ""However, the turnaround visibility remains low and could be further out than anticipated, given time needed to regain the consumer and a highly competitive environment.""Gap shares had managed to touch their 200-day line in March after taking support at the key 50-day level in mid-February, but Friday's 13.8% dive sent the stock well below the 50-day line.Meanwhile, Victoria's Secret parent L Brands sank 4.3%, following a 2.3% dip Thursday after announcing restructuring plans. Yoga gear company Lululemon (LULU) slipped 1.9%.Michael Kors closed down 4.75% after sinking 4.6% the day before, bringing shares definitively below the 50-day moving average, though the stock remains above its 200-day line.Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) dipped below its 50-day on Friday, falling 3.4% after retaking the key level not too long ago in February.Fellow teen apparel brand American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) shares slipped below their 50-day as well on a 1.1% fall.Express (EXPR) shares eased 1.6%.

Volume was mixed in the stock market today, rising on the Nasdaq but falling on the NYSE compared with the same time Wednesday.Oil was down more than 1% at around $37 a barrel, while gold and Treasuries rose as investors sought a safe haven.Retail stocks were among the hardest hit. J.C. Penney (JCP) fell 4% and erased a double-digit gain past a 10.19 buy point of a cup base, triggering a sell signal. The stock had been rebounding following a strong quarterly earnings report in February.  Dillards (DDS) was off nearly 4%.Michael Kors (KORS) led the IBD 50 lower. Kors, which markets luxury handbags, apparel and accessories, was down more than 3% as it tries to hold on to support at its 10-week moving average.On a positive note, Wynn Resorts (WYNN) popped 10% in huge volume  after Telsey Group upgraded the stock to outperform from market perform and boosted its price target to 112 from 67. Wynn also said late Wednesday that it's planning a $1.6 billion lake resort development in Las Vegas.In economic news, U.S. jobless claims fell more than expected last week, suggesting that the job market remains healthy.Image provided by Shutterstock.

464,KORS,"Retail sales rose 0.2% in June, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, slower than expected. But that followed two months of upwardly revised strong gains, such as a 0.5% rise in May.Strangely, motor vehicle sales dropped 0.3%, even though U.S. auto unit sales hit a 9-year high that month. But again, revenues for April and May were revised higher. Excluding autos, the monthly increase was 0.4%. There was also weakness in furniture and building/garden equipment stores.Apparel chains reported solid gains. But that didn't help upscale apparel and accessories maker and retailer Michael Kors (KORS), which tumbled nearly 6% on the stock market today.Sales are up 4.3% on the year.

466,KORS,"Investors didn't think much about Alan Greenspan's ""irrational exuberance"" comment in 1996. It came right in the middle of a roaring bull market where tech stocks were making multiyear stratospheric gains.While Greenspan, who would stay on as chairman of the Federal Reserve an additional 10 years, was early with his warning, excessive euphoria was what ultimately caused the tech bubble to burst in 2000. This wasn't the first time it happened, and it won't be the last.Excessive media coverage and hype can come when a stock is at or near a top. Use this knowledge to your advantage and treat it as a time to look for important sell signals on a chart.It happened to Netflix (NFLX) in the summer of 2011 when it topped after a lengthy run-up. By the end of the year, the stock had lost three-quarters of its value. CEO Reed Hastings was featured on the cover of Fortune in December 2010.When the media latch on to a big winner, it's often too late. The coverage often comes after a big price run. By then, everyone is already familiar with the company's growth story.In May 2014, Michael Kors appeared on the cover of London's Sunday Times Magazine. The headline read: ""The $3 Billion Bag Man."" He's currently honorary chairman and chief creative officer at Michael Kors (KORS).The ""affordable luxury"" brand was a big winner after its IPO in December 2011. It went public at 20 a share and more than quintupled in price in just 27 months.The price move was warranted, as the company consistently produced robust earnings and sales increases, taking solid market share away from Coach (COH).Kors' cover appearance came just ahead of a precipitous stock decline. Shares slumped fast on May 29 right after Wall Street digested Kors' quarterly earnings report (1). Big earnings and sales growth was there again, but concerns about profit margins brought sellers into the stock.Kors is still in growth mode, but the company hasn't been able to shake off margin concerns. Since late May, the stock is down 22%.On June 16 it joined the Cut List on IBD Leaderboard.Today its RS Rating is 19 out of a maximum 99.Keep in mind that Kors is still a relatively new company with plenty of growth opportunities ahead. But for now, the stock has relinquished leadership status in the market.

478,KORS,"""The fall collection has been well-received by fashion experts and so has the fringe bag,"" Martis told IBD.
"
479,KORS,"Many of the handbags in the fall lineup, with prices up to $1,200, are for the ""elite"" consumer willing to pay full price, she said. ""However, the bulk of Coach's core consumer, which is the aspirational middle-class consumer, still wants to buy an item at a discounted price. And analysts do feel that the whole transition and face lift of Coach's stores and brand might be pushing that core consumer away from Coach and closer to Michael Kors.""

482,KORS,"When the skirt was reintroduced for the fall season, it fetched an even higher price, as much as $4,700, at a time when its competitors were highly promotional and discounting, she adds.

Highly rated by IBD, G-III is known for fashion brand names Kenneth Cole, Vince Camuto, Cole Haan and Andrew Marc.Coach could gain some stride from its spring line fresh off a Fashion Week preview of the season in New York, and from its fall collection that hit stores Friday, according to Nomura analyst Robert Drbul.Coach's fall collection gets away from logo prints — which have fallen flat with consumers recently — and features a broad line of styles, textures and designs such as Rhyder satchel in python embossed leather for $795 and a Dakotah fringe flap cross-body bag in whiplash leather for $795.""We ... believe that Coach management has taken the steps necessary to turn the business and recapture share growth, with (executive creative director) Stuart Vevers' new fall product just now hitting stores and his spring 2015 collection debuting presently,"" wrote Drbul in a Nomura note on the luxury market.In a separate note, Drbul said he expects the new lines to ""broaden Coach's customer base, as its fresh, forward aesthetic maintains the traditional brand codes. We believe the company is taking the necessary steps to improve the business without sacrificing great product design and is doing what needs to be done to promote Vevers' new lines to improve the brand image despite lackluster earnings results.""Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research for Thomson Reuters, says one of the things Coach has ""on its side"" is the fringe handbag that was all the rage during a Fashion Week in February, and is featured in many styles in its fall collection.""The fall collection has been well-received by fashion experts and so has the fringe bag,"" Martis told IBD.Many of the handbags in the fall lineup, with prices up to $1,200, are for the ""elite"" consumer willing to pay full price, she said. ""However, the bulk of Coach's core consumer, which is the aspirational middle-class consumer, still wants to buy an item at a discounted price. And analysts do feel that the whole transition and face lift of Coach's stores and brand might be pushing that core consumer away from Coach and closer to Michael Kors.""Thomson Reuters analysts estimate Coach will see a 24.43% drop in same-store sales for the holiday quarter.Meanwhile Michael Kors continues to turn heads with its products. Martis says one of the high-end design house's featured items during February Fashion Week was a fringed leather skirt selling for $3,995, and it sold out.When the skirt was reintroduced for the fall season, it fetched an even higher price, as much as $4,700, at a time when its competitors were highly promotional and discounting, she adds.""That suggests that luxury consumers are ready, willing and able to pay full price for the latest fashion trends,"" Martis said.

511,KORS,"Apple (AAPL) slashed the base price of the Apple Watch by $50 and introduced several new watchbands at its spring event on Monday. So will the tech giant's newly priced smartwatch further eat up market share from traditional watchmakers and other wearable brands?Here's where it stacks up, price-wise, in relation to other wearables on the market:At $299, the entry-level Apple Watch is still about twice as expensive as most Fitbit (FIT) models and $50 more than the Surge, the priciest Fitbit fitness tracking offering. But it puts an Apple Watch Sport within reach of someone already willing to plunk down $250 on a smart gadget.The new price point is now also on par with the entry-level Samsung Gear S2, which starts at $299 and goes up to $449 for the rose gold and platinum models.Apple wasn't the first company this month to discount its smartwatches. Pebble brought down the price of its Pebble Time to $149.99 and Pebble Time Round to $199.99 at the start of March.And what of the analog folks? For traditional watchmakers like Fossil (FOSL), Apple's price cut puts it squarely into Fossil territory -- its display smartwatches go for $275 to $315. (Its non-display smartwatches range from $175 to $215.)Fossil has been increasingly assertive about developing smartwatches of its own, announcing just last week the launch of eight branded wearables lines, including those under the Kate Spade (KATE) and Michael Kors (KORS) banners, for a total suite of over 100 new wearables to debut this year.With prices yet to be released, it's tough to say what kind of competition Fossil's new smartwatches and wearables face from a $299 Apple Watch. But analyst chatter about the stock in general hasn't been encouraging. Macquarie analyst Laurent Vasilescu downgraded Fossil to underperform with a 34 price target, citing a range of business headwinds and noting the ""real"" wearable threat. Fossil's recent acquisition of fitness tracker maker Misfit hasn't done much to bolster Macquarie's concerns.""We are still baffled by the Misfit acquisition,"" wrote Vasilescu on March 16. ""If the company is now choosing to build its own proprietary wearable platform, we believe the purchase price of $215.4 (million) for Misfit was too much, considering the wearable startup has no patents.""But fashion-forward consumers looking for a bargain might still find something to like in these non-Apple options if it finds the iPhone maker's band selection objectionable. Its lower-priced $49 bands are limited to sports bands and the new woven nylon options.Wearable device sales are predicted to rise 18.4% in 2016, according to research firm Gartner, with smartwatch sales seen more than doubling to 66.7 million units by 2017 from 2015.""From 2015 through 2017, smartwatch adoption will have 48 percent growth, largely due to Apple popularizing wearables as a lifestyle trend. Smartwatches have the greatest revenue potential among all wearables through 2019, reaching $17.5 billion,"" Gartner research director Angela McIntyre said in a Feb. 2 release.Apple Watch sales are seen slowing early this year ahead of the expected release of a second-generation product, said IDC.Shares of Apple closed up 0.8%, Fitbit climbed 2.55%, and Fossil fell 1.55%.RELATED:Apple Unveils 4-Inch iPhone SE, New iPad Pro, Cuts Apple Watch PriceApple Watch Shipments Slowing Ahead Of Version 2Is A Kate Spade Fossil Wearable Enough To Take On The Apple Watch?

513,KORS,"Michael Kors (KORS) slumped 6% on Aug. 4 in massive volume despite reporting another strong quarter of double-digit profit and sales growth.The culprit? Worries about the company's profit margins.Why are profit margins so key?They measure how much a company actually makes out of every dollar in sales. It's displayed as a percentage. For instance: If a company has a 22% profit margin, then it nets 22 cents per dollar of sales.Let's say that it costs a company $50 to manufacture a purse. If the manufacturer sells purses for $100 each, then he or she keeps $50 per purse as net income. That's a profit margin of 50% before tax.But if he/she sells purses for $25 each, then he or she is losing $25 per purse. There's no profit, or a 0% margin.The less it costs to produce goods, generally the higher the profit margin. Thus many U.S. companies have shifted production to China, India and other overseas countries, where labor costs are typically much lower than in the U.S.But strong margins can also come from a company's outstanding pricing power.Comparing Apples To ApplesProfit margins can vary widely by industry. Grocery stores are infamous for having razor-thin margins, for instance.Taking Kroger's (KR) 1.7% after-tax margin and comparing it with Facebook's (FB) 37.5% in their latest reported quarters isn't a fair comparison. Look at profit margins for companies in the same industry.Markdowns can affect profit margins, particularly in the retail space. The more that a company has to slash prices to sell an item, the lower its profit margin.This is what Kors is contending with. The Hong Kong-based company has been rapidly expanding — but it's also had to mark down prices on some of its affordable luxury goods. Kors expects second-quarter retail gross margins to fall 50 basis points.The stock fell 4% to breach its 200-day moving average on July 14, followed by a 7% drop as analysts lowered their price targets due to margin-related concerns.Where can you find profit-margin data? IBD looks at a company's quarterly and annual pretax and after-tax profit margins. You can find a company's latest annual pretax margin in our Sector Leaders, IPO Leaders and Income Investor charts, just above the stock graph. It's also available online in IBD Stock Checkup at Investors.com. Or you can calculate net profit margin from a company's income statement by taking net income and dividing it by sales.To help readers save time, IBD offers its SMR Rating, a proprietary gauge that takes into an account a company's sales, profit margin and return on equity.Stocks are assigned a letter grade from A to E, with A being the best. Investors should focus on those that earn an A or B.The table above lists stocks with a Composite Rating of 95 or better, Earnings Per Share and Relative Strength Ratings of 90 or higher, average trading volume of at least 400,000 and a profit margin of 10% or more. They're ranked by the biggest profit margin in the last reported quarter.Not surprisingly, you'll find a lot of familiar names. And all boast an A SMR Rating.

536,KORS,"Stocks opened to thin, quiet losses and quickly slipped into modestly positive trade early Wednesday. Volume was tracking below Tuesday's levels in the stock market today.The Nasdaq rose 0.2%, while the S&P 500 showed a 0.1% gain. The Dow Jones industrial average gave up its early advance and struggled a fraction below the break-even mark.A blip up in housing starts and a slip down in building permits in February left no real substantial impact on early trade. Consumer prices minus the effect of gasoline rose for a fourth straight month, tracking a slow-burn increase in inflation.Also in February, industrial production eased 0.5%, and utilization of factories dipped to 76.7%. Production increased 0.8%, and capacity utilization was 77.1% in January. Consensus estimates projected a 0.2% dip in production and put capacity utilization at 76.9% in February.About two-thirds of the Dow’s stocks downshifted at the start of trade, but both advancers and decliners held to less than 1%.Drugmakers bracketed either end of the S&P 500. Endo Pharmaceuticals (ENDP) rebounded 9%, retaking a piece of Tuesday’s 22% divot.Ireland-based drugmaker Mallinckrodt (MNK) tanked 10% at the start of trade before trimming the loss to about 4%. Andrew Left, founder and editor of short sale research firm Citron, compared Mallinckrodt and the pricing of its mainstay drug Acthar to Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX). Valeant is under investigation by federal authorities regarding drug pricing and distribution. Mallinckrodt has been falling since allegations first appeared in August and is now trading 58% below its August high.Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) led the IBD 50, up nearly 2%. The egg producer and distributor is working to retake support at its 50-day moving average.Michael Kors (KORS) took the low spot on the list, down 3% in strong trade. The stock has lost 5% so far for the week, its biggest slip since beginning its rebound from lows in January.

537,KORS,"Fossil (FOSL) announced Tuesday the launch of eight different branded wearables this year -- including from Kate Spade (KATE) and Michael Kors (KORS) -- in 40 countries and more than 20 languages. But will its new line of more than 100 wearables be enough to help it contend with the Apple (APPL) Watch and Fitbit (FIT) as smartwatches gain steam?Demand for smart accessories has been growing steadily. The International Data Corporation (IDC) said in December that it expects worldwide wearable device shipments to jump over 44% to 111.1 million in 2016, with the Apple Watch poised to lead the smartwatch segment of the market.Fitbit recently introduced a new ""smart fitness watch,"" the Blaze, earlier this year.Both Apple and Fitbit offer various choices of interchangeable straps. A common complaint, however, is that the gadgets aren't fashionable enough.""The industry has been slow to adapt to growing consumer desires for new styles and options for wearables,"" Fossil's Chief Strategy and Digital Officer Greg McKelvey said in a statement. ""With the diversity of major fashion brands we offer, customers will be delighted with the sheer volume of styles and options available when shopping for a wearable that fits their personal style.""Fossil's new line of products will include both display and non-display watches and trackers.The company said it has boosted its technological capabilities since acquiring wearables maker Misfit last November. Its new line of smartwatches will function ""more like traditional watches"" in that they will not need to be charged weekly or even monthly, unlike the current crop of wearables on the market, it said.Other brands in its new collection include Chaps, Diesel, Emporio Armani, Skagen and Fossil's own namesake brand.Fossil has logged two straight quarters of hefty double-digit earnings declines and four consecutive quarters of revenue dips, but better-than-expected fourth-quarter results helped the stock retake its 50-day line in mid-February.Shares traded below the key level for most of 2015 and have fallen about 40% over the last 12 months. The stock closed down 5.5% on Tuesday, continuing to find resistance near its downward trending 200-day line.Image provided by Shutterstock.

538,KORS,"Stocks held on to their opening losses Tuesday, as weak economic data and the pending Federal Reserve decision weighed on early trade.The Nasdaq slipped 0.7%. The S&P 500 was down 0.6%, and the Dow industrials showed a 0.3% decline.Volume rose -- up 5% on the NYSE and 7% higher on the Nasdaq -- relative to trade at the same time Monday.Early economic news did the stock market today no big favors. The best news came from the New York Federal Reserve, which reported a 0.6 reading for March in its Empire State Manufacturing gauge. That was up from a steep decline (-16.6) in February activity and well above economists' expectations.February retail sales slipped 0.1%, as expected. Producer prices declined 0.2%, also in line with estimates.Business inventories expanded 0.1% in January, equaling December's gain and continuing a two-months-up-two-months-down pattern reported by the Commerce Department.Builder confidence held steady at February levels, with the National Association of Home Builders reporting its March Housing Market Index at 58. Economist consensus had projected a slight uptick to 59. The data came as the Fed's policy committee kicked off its two-day meeting, broadly expected to result in no change to interest rates.Drugmakers, ore and coal miners and oil-related industries were all showing some of the worst performances out of Tuesday's starting gate. A mix of medical, retail and utility groups fared best, posting modest gains.Most names on the Dow Jones industrial average carved lower at the open, with Merck (MRK) down 1.5% and Goldman Sachs (GS) off 1.4% at the deep end. Apple (AAPL) topped the handful of gainers with a 1.9% advance after an analyst note from Morgan Stanley reported iPhone demand tracking ahead of expectations in March, led by strength in China.Oil and energy issues held many of the worst early losses among the S&P 500 stocks.Services-focused conglomerate Leucadia National (LUK) dropped nearly 5% after investment banking subsidiary Jefferies Group reported a 49% revenue decline in the fourth quarter and a loss of $166.8 million, swinging from a profit of $12.9 million a year earlier. Leucadia shares have been declining for 33 months.Mead Johnson (MJN) spiked 8% at the start of trade. Financial blog Betaville reported Mead had begun working with banker Lazard with regard to takeover interest from Switzerland-based Nestle (NSRGY).Among leading stocks, Five Below (FIVE) fronted the IBD 50 list with a 0.9% gain. The deep discount retailer's stock is working on a fourth straight gain, edging up below a 41.57 buy point in a cup base.Michael Kors (KORS) dropped nearly 3% in light trade. The fashion designer remains up 64% since late January, as it scales up the right side of a 22-month consolidation.

549,KORS,"Today's IBD 50 list, which pinpoints top-performing growth stocks, includes five that made the elite list, fell off and then climbed back aboard.They are Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), Michael Kors (KORS), Five Below (FIVE), Sturm Ruger (RGR) and Smith & Wesson (SWHC).Here's a look at what's happened at these top performers that's put them back on the IBD 50.Natural and organic foods grocer Sprouts Farmers Market continues to rise on strong earnings growth while rivals Whole Foods Market (WFM) and The Fresh Market (TFM) saw lackluster growth last year amid rising competition from supermarket giant Kroger (KR), Amazon (AMZN) and others.On Feb. 25, Sprouts reported a 50% surge in Q4 earnings  and a 27% pop in revenue to $930.3 million. Both figures crushed analyst estimates.Meanwhile, reports that Kroger is looking to buy The Fresh Market have added to expectations of industry consolidation.Sprouts, which boasts a 98 IBD Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99, fell 1.6% Friday.The trendy Hong Kong-based maker of fashion clothes, footwear and accessories took the U.S. and Europe by storm a few years ago. Its stock price soared 405% from 20 at its initial public offering in December 2011 to an all-time high of 101.04 on Feb. 28, 2014, before it consolidated amid execution problems.In February, Kors had its biggest up week in four years on an earnings report that surprised Wall Street analysts.On Feb. 2, its stock shot up 24% and continued rising. Shares ended essentially flat Friday.Deep discount retailers such as Five Below, which sells preteen and teen products for $5 or less, along with Dollar Tree (DLTR), Dollar General (DG) and bulk discounter Big Lots (BIG), saw sales surge during and after the Great Recession, when people were pinching pennies.The trend among consumers to buy at discounts has lingered even as the recession has receded. On Wednesday, Five Below opened its first store in Miami, expanding its store count in the state to 17, with plans to open over 100 more in Florida.Five Below rose 2.8% to 38.77.The nation's largest firearms maker, Smith & Wesson, sees dramatic swings. The Aurora, Colo., movie theater shooting in July 2012 and the Sandy Hook school shooting in December 2012 sent sales, profit and the stock soaring as fears of tougher laws sparked a rush to buy ahead of any legislative action.But demand waned as attempts in Congress to pass new gun limits failed, sending Smith & Wesson's stock tumbling.The mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., on Dec. 2 revived the gun debate and helped fiscal Q3 results top views late Thursday.Its stock cleared a cup-with-handle base on Friday, touching an all-time high at 27.99 before closing at 27.06, up 6.5% for the day.No. 2 U.S. firearms maker Sturm Ruger reported Q4 results last month that handily beat Wall Street forecasts.On a conference call with analysts, CEO Michael Fifer predicted a ramp-up in demand if Democrats take the White House and Senate, as the next president could get several opportunities to appoint new Supreme Court justices.Sturm Ruger shares closed up 5%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

550,KORS,"Michael Kors' (KORS) price action since its IPO in December 2011 is typical of every big market leader in IBD’s model-book studies.

551,KORS,"After a long decline from a peak hit last April, Apple (AAPL) got back above a key benchmark on Tuesday: the 10-week moving average. Does that mean the polish is back on the iPhone maker’s stock?A look at Apple’s chart shows the 10-week moving average is still trending lower and is well below the longer-term 40-week line. While the tech titan may go on to launch a big new run, that’s a sign of lingering technical weakness.When searching for clues that a beaten down, former leader may be bouncing back, look for the 10-week line to get back above the 40-week moving average.While that type of crossover doesn’t guarantee success, it is a sign of renewed strength and until it happens, the stock isn’t likely to make a sustained new climb.You’ll find examples of this telltale clue in the charts of Amazon (AMZN), Starbucks (SBUX), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Michael Kors (KORS).While forming a long, 65-week consolidation from January 2014 to April 2015, Amazon’s 10-week line spent most of that time beneath its longer-term cousin.But while building the right side of that pattern, the 10-week line crossed back over the 40-week moving average after the e-commerce and cloud giant reported strong earnings. From there the stock went on an 11-month run until peaking in January.Starbucks brewed up a breakout not long after its 10-week line reclaimed the 40-week moving average in January 2013. The stock rose over 40% before peaking in November of the same year. While working on a new price consolidation, the 10-week benchmark fell below, but then crossed back above the 40-week line in July 2014 to set the stage for another big move.

552,KORS,"The charts below for Michael Kors and Alphabet show similar stories of what a stock looks like when it's on the mend.So rather than speculating and trying to guess from the latest headlines and hunches if a former big name leader like Apple is on the path to recovery, read between the lines – and look for the 10-week moving average to get back above the 40-week benchmark.Excerpt from IBD Extra Newsletter.Image provided by Shutterstock.

570,KORS,"Except for two jewelers, it was not a good week for luxury stocks.Shares of luxury names from home goods and furnishings to fashion and watches stumbled, with the sharpest drops seen from Williams-Sonoma (WSM) and Movado (MOV) following their disappointing quarterly results and lowered guidance.Williams-Sonoma sunk 12% Thursday and another 1% on Friday. High-end home-goods company Restoration Hardware (RH) followed it down 4% on Thursday and nearly 1% on Friday.Fashion and accessories firm Michael Kors (KORS), which has lost momentum since mid-July, fell 2% on Thursday. It was down nearly 3% for the week through midday Friday.Time practically stopped for luxury watch company Movado after it missed revenue and earnings forecasts on Tuesday. Its stock went into freefall, plunging 17% over three days.But Tiffany (TIF) and Signet Jewelers (SIG) shined on strong quarterly results this week. Signet soared nearly 8% Thursday after it beat views and raised its forecast.Blended earnings growth for the luxury retail category was 2% in Q2, according to figures from Retail Metrics. For home furnishings, it was negative 2%.Though Williams-Sonoma's earnings in Q2 were in line with views, same-store brand sales decelerated sharply from the first quarter, especially at Pottery Barn. Inventories also increased at a faster rate than sales, noted Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer.The company also promoted heavily during the quarter, analysts noted, particularly at its two largest brands, Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn.After a 0.4% jump in June, personal spending in July fell a surprising 0.1%, according to figures released Friday morning.Related: Luxury Watch: Tiffany Shines, Williams-Sonoma Cracks.

600,KORS,"The 88th Academy Awards are on Sunday, which means a flash-studded stroll down the red carpet for Hollywood's elite.For investors, there's this walk of fame: The IBD 50. This week's ingenues include Nvidia (NVDA), Michael Kors (KORS), Ross Stores (ROST), Ryanair (RYAAY) and Facebook (FB).Matt Damon was forced to fly solo on the Red Planet, but little did he know that Nvidia was right by his side -- chewing up the scenery. Lead visual effects studio Moving Picture Company used Nvidia Quadro graphics cards to help bring ""The Martian"" to life.The chipmaker's products power plenty of theatrical visual effects, but its recent earnings results were no illusion: Per-share earnings grew 21% in Q4, marking an eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit profit gains.The stock popped 8% on Feb. 18 following the Q4 beat and above-consensus guidance. Shares are currently forming a cup-shaped base.Nvidia closed down 0.7% in the stock market Friday.Kate Hudson and Olivia Wilde wore slinky Kors numbers to the Golden Globes last month, and this designer's gowns are almost certain to be spotted on the red carpet Sunday. The only question is who will show up draped in Michael Kors.Kors and other fashion houses like Coach (COH) and Kate Spade (KATE) have had a rough go of it lately, but Kors' holiday-quarter results exceeded expectations, sending its stock back on the road to stardom with a nearly 24% pop on Feb. 2. And IBD's apparel manufacturer's industry group is climbing the ranks.Kors shares closed Friday up 0.2% at 56.58. That's still a long way off from its all-time high of 101.04 two years ago on Feb. 28, 2014, but Hollywood, like Wall Street, loves a comeback story.Jennifer Lawrence will probably show up in Dior again, but after the Academy Awards -- and the after-parties -- it's a fair bet that celebs are probably rocking a comfy chic look the morning after.And consumers looking to dupe their favorite ""just got out of SoulCycle"" look might head to Ross Stores or TJX (TJX) for off-price brand names.Ross has been looking better than some of its struggling retail peers, particularly those in the department-store category. Shares are consolidating near a buy point of 56.78, and closed down 0.5% on Friday.Cowen & Co. recently called out Ross Stores as a ""prudent retail (stock) holding in 2016"" and one to consider should a recession strike again.European influences figure prominently in this year's Oscars nominees, from the Irish-American immigrant story in ""Brooklyn"" to the Cold War-era ""Bridge of Spies"" to three of the five foreign-language films up for awards.This Ireland-based European budget airline likely isn't the first choice of the rich and famous -- although Prince William once flew Ryanair to Scotland! -- but its most recent quarterly earnings soared higher than Harvey Weinstein's private jet.The famously bare-bones carrier logged a 25% bump in passengers and more than doubled its profit in Q3. Now, Ryanair has got its sights set on the business set as it hopes to gain share of that market.Shares dipped 0.4%. The stock is currently in an area of consolidation, with shares hovering around their 50-day line.Part of Hollywood Boulevard will be shut down, but social media will be hopping Sunday as celebs start trickling into the Dolby Theatre. Who wore what? Who's with whom? Who won what?

601,KORS,"Looking beyond the defensive sectors currently showing strength, apparel has been moving up the ranks. The apparel manufacturers' industry group is still low at 138 out of 197 in Friday's IBD, but it jumped from 165 just four weeks ago. That could be signaling a turnaround play. One of the leaders of the group is Michael Kors (KORS), which was among the hottest…
"
602,KORS,"Today's IBD 50 list includes four highly-rated retailers that have shown strength lately, while giants like Wal-Mart (WMT) have been losing ground.The world's largest retailer cut its full-year forecast Thursday and now sees sales coming in about flat, dashing hopes that recent initiatives would spark faster growth.Meanwhile, consumers continue to watch their budgets closely, and that's helping discount clothiers Ross Stores (ROST), Five Below (FIVE) and deep discounter Dollar General (DG) outperform the market.At the high end of the retail spectrum, shares of luxury clothing and accessories brand Michael Kors (KORS) popped 24% on Feb. 2 after it reported quarterly earnings and sales growth that easily beat Wall Street estimates.The chain is well positioned to weather the current market uncertainty and rising competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Morningstar and others say.""They're one of the best"" traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar told IBD recently, referring to Ross.Ross doesn't tout luxury brands or even have an online shop. But it's outperformed rivals in part by purchasing ""packaway"" inventory -- goods bought at a low price and packed away for months or years for later sale, no matter what the current fashions are.Shares have formed a deep first-stage base with a 56.78 buy point. Ross, which which will report fourth-quarter results on March 1, closed down 0.2% Friday.Teen apparel discount chain Five Below is expected to report robust holiday sales when it announces Q4 earnings next month. On Jan. 7, the company raised its guidance for the nine-week period ended Jan. 2.CEO Joel Anderson said at the time in a written statement that, ""given our holiday performance, we are raising our net sales outlook for the fourth quarter to a range of $323 million to $326 million and are narrowing our earnings per share guidance range to 75 cents to 76 cents.""That's up from Five Below's earlier outlook for EPS of 74-76 cents on $318 million-$323 million in revenue. Shares lost 0.2% Friday.Deep discount general merchandise retailer Dollar General has seen earnings and revenue growth fall off in recent quarters, though the company continues to show remarkable stability.That led Morgan Stanley to raise its rating on Dollar General on Feb. 16 from equal-weight to overweight.Its shares have a 93 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 93% of all stocks in recent quarters on key metrics such as sales and profit growth. Dollar General slipped 0.8% Friday.The outlier in the group, Michael Kors, is a leader in the luxury clothing, accessories and footwear category.In its Feb. 2 fiscal Q3 earnings announcement, Kors reported a 7.4% rise in EPS to $1.59 on a 6.2% increase in revenue to $1.397 billion. Both were an upside surprise to Wall Street.The company forecasts fiscal 2016 sales of $4.65 billion, easily topping analyst consensus for $4.42 billion.Chairman and CEO John Idol said in the earnings statement, ""As we look ahead, we are excited about our upcoming Spring collections that embody design innovation and underscore Michael Kors fashion leadership."" Shares fell 1%.
"
603,KORS,"Michael Kors Holdings (KORS) shares rocketed nearly 24% Tuesday with results that crushed views for the holiday quarter despite a challenging season for many retailers.Michael Kors' stock jumped 23.9% to 50.11 on the stock market today, after the seller of high-end accessories and clothing saw earnings for the third quarter that ended Dec. 26 rise 7% from a year earlier to $1.59 a share, sailing past analysts' views for $1.46 a share. That was a much faster gain than the prior quarter, when the company saw only a 1% rise in earnings.Rival Coach (COH) dipped 0.2% on Tuesday. But Coach had shot up 23.9% in the prior five sessions to an 8-month high after upscale handbag and apparel maker and retailer reported better-than-expected results. Kate Spade (KATE), another handbag maker rose 2.9%.Michael Kors' revenue rose 6.3% to $1.40 billion, topping forecasts for $1.36 billion. That was a slightly slower pace than the prior quarter's gain of 6%.The company said accessories and footwear helped propel its strong performance. Retail net sales increased 11.1% from a year earlier to $766.2 million, driven primarily by e-commerce sales from the company's digital flagships and 114 net new-store openings since the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the company said. However, same-store sales slipped 0.9% from a year earlier.On a constant currency basis, retail net sales grew 15.7%, and comparable store sales rose 2.0%. Wholesale net sales increased 0.3% from a year earlier to $575.5 million. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 3.0%. Licensing revenue increased 8.4% to $55.8 million.Total revenue in the Americas increased 0.4% from a year earlier to $1.06 billion on a reported basis, and rose 1.4% on a constant currency basis. European revenue grew 14.3% from a year earlier to $276 million on a reported basis, and surged 29.1% on a constant currency basis. Revenue in Japan soared 59.1% from a year earlier to $25.5 million on a reported basis, and soared 68% on a constant currency basis.The company expects fourth-quarter earnings per share to be between 93 cents and 97 cents. That's less than analyst estimates of $1 per share prior to the report. The company expects fourth-quarter revenue to be between $1.13 billion and $1.15 billion. That compares with analyst forecasts for $1.16 billion.

But Home Depot (HD) lumbered ahead 4% after reporting a 17% gain in Q4 earnings, and a 9% revenue gain, both ahead of expectations.Management also boosted its full-year revenue guidance above consensus forecasts. Home Depot shares have been correcting since December, and caught below resistance at its 10-week moving average since early February.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) was the Dow's weakest stock, down 1% before the open. The managed care provider jumped 3% in rising volume on Monday.Western Digital (WDC) dropped 9% after announcing China-based Unisplendour had backed out of a $3.78 billion investment in the company.The change sends the $19 billion effort to merge with data storage peer Sandisk (SNDK) to plan B, which decreases the transaction's cash, raises the stock-per-share equation, and requires Western shareholders to approve the combination. SanDisk shares dropped 5% in premarket trade.Motorola (MSI) and Macy's (M) sparked up 6% each after healthy Q4 reports.In the IBD 50 stables, the few stocks posting premarket gains held to moves of less than 0.5%.Losses were also mild, led by Michael Kors (KORS), which slipped almost 2%, and Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY), with a 1% decline.Kors rose 4% in above-average trade Monday to 57% above a late January low, in an advance that is being cradled by the stock's 10-day moving average. Shares ended the session still 46% below a February 2014 high.Ryanair dropped 2% in heavy trade Monday. That put shares back below their 50-day moving average, which could present the stock with resistance.

607,KORS,"Being fashionably late may earn you cool points, but blowing off EBITDA margin targets by a whole year can make investors lose interest — fast.Kate Spade (KATE) shares raced out 10% to a 7-year-high 42.87 on the stock market today thanks to better-than-expected earnings and sales growth. But shares quickly reversed during the analyst conference call as margin discussions raised concerns. Shares closed down 25% to 29, well below their 200-day moving average and at 6-month lows.The handbag and fashion brand is reportedly rethinking its 2016 adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for 25% or more, and may push that goal from 2016 to 2017.The recently introduced Kate Spade Saturday brand, a less pricey alternative to the company's signature handbags and accessories, prompted gross profit as a percentage of net sales to dip to 58.6% from 61.8% a year ago. The more affordable line may be experiencing some growing pains.""The timing of the 25% margin goal (shift) is entirely related to Saturday,"" said analyst Jim Chartier of Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co.""It's not the core brand. That brand is exceeding that target and exceeding internal expectations. It's really due to Kate Spade Saturday,"" echoes Imperial Capital analyst Mary Ross-Gilbert. ""And having to make a greater investment in that brand, having to tweak that assortment, it's a lower margin business.""Kate Spade's comparable direct-to-consumer net sales grew 30.4% in Q2, but are only expected to be in the high single digits in the back half of the year due to several factors, including fewer flash sales, a shift in the company's July Fourth sale into Q2 from Q3, and a number of store renovations, she said.Kate Spade before the open reported Q2 results that topped expectations. Earnings rose to 5 cents a share from a year-earlier loss of 12 cents a share. Revenue leapt 49% to $266 million, the second straight quarter of accelerating growth.If fickle fashionistas can see past the near term, these growing pains will eventually even out, say analysts. The company will meet its goals, but on a delayed timeline.""I don't think it's a change in long-term fundamentals,"" agreed Chartier, ""just a resetting of investor expectations.""But Kate Spade's rise and reversal bring uncomfortable parallels to Michael Kors (KORS). The highflying fashion house in late May reported strong earnings and sales, but a dip in retail operating margins. The stock rallied the first day, but then tumbled the next session, and continued to trend low until the next report — when Kors suggested that markdowns are taking their toll.Kors shares fell 3.2% Tuesday.Meanwhile, Coach (COH), which was once a fashion stock leader, is still trying to stop the bleeding on sales and profit.Coach shares fell less than 1%.After the market close, watch and accessories maker and retailer Fossil (FOSL), reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings and sales. But it guided Q3 EPS estimates lower. Fossil,which makes watches under various brands such as Michael Kors, fell 4% late after closing down nearly 1%.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter at IBD_Elow.

609,KORS,"If the demand for shares far exceeds the supply, the share price will rise, often to sustained gains.

610,KORS,"This is why the S for Supply is a part of CAN SLIM. Let's look at six ways the S factor can help define a stock's true situation.
"

612,KORS,"The table at the right shows how true the observation is. The 14 stocks are the stocks in IBD's database with a float of 5 billion shares or more. How many have been market leaders in the past decade? Only one, Apple (AAPL).

"
614,KORS,"Executives who have no skin in the game are like politicians: It's easy to do dumb things with other people's money. Exposure adds pressure, and even a sharp mind runs a little sharper when the risks are personal.

"
616,KORS,"• No. 4. Secondary offerings can work in a stock's favor — provided the cash goes to the company and is used for something dynamic. However, if the secondary offering is designed to help management dump shares, then that can hurt a stock and sometimes dilute shares by increasing the float.
"
617,KORS,"Michael Kors (KORS) announced secondary offerings in March 2012, September 2012 and February 2013. Corrections from the closing price on the day of the announced offering were 28% over three months, 17% over two months and 20% over two months.
"

Secondary offerings can work in a stock's favor — provided the cash goes to the company and is used for something dynamic. However, if the secondary offering is designed to help management dump shares, then that can hurt a stock and sometimes dilute shares by increasing the float.Michael Kors (KORS) announced secondary offerings in March 2012, September 2012 and February 2013. Corrections from the closing price on the day of the announced offering were 28% over three months, 17% over two months and 20% over two months.• No. 5.

624,KORS,"Facebook (FB), Starbucks (SBUX) and Visa (V) are among stocks that would hold up well if the U.S. economy goes into recession, a Goldman Sachs report said.Although Goldman didn't say it's looking for a recession, and many economists say recession is still a remote possibility, the list comes amid recent red flags that some analysts have said could augur recession.Railroad shipments -- a forward-looking indicator -- have fallen amid unstable economic conditions. Industrial production has also been weak, and the strong dollar has hit exporters.David Kostin, Goldman Sachs' chief U.S. equity analyst, came up with the recommendations for recession stocks on the assumption that strong balance sheets and high domestics sales should outperform in a downturn, according to Bloomberg.In addition to Facebook, Starbucks and Visa, Goldman also named Alphabet (GOOGL,), Whole Foods Market (WFM), which continues to benefit from the trend in the U.S. toward healthy food, industrial giant 3M (MMM) and Verizon Communications (VZ), the top wireless service provider.Facebook closed up 0.3% on the stock market today. Starbucks rose 1.5%, Visa ticked 0.2% higher, and Alphabet rose less than 0.1%. Whole Foods ended up 0.9%, while 3M surged 5.2% after reporting strong earnings Tuesday.Verizon last Thursday reported that Q4 EPS shot up 25%  to 89 cents on a 3.2% rise in revenue to $34.25 billion, both topping estimates. Shares gained 2.6% Tuesday.Facebook reports Wednesday, and consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for earnings per share to rise 26% to 68 cents a share on a 40% jump in revenue to $5.37 billion.Visa will report Thursday, and analysts see EPS up 8% to 68 cents on a 7% hike in revenue to $3.62 billion.Chipotle (CMG), Marathon Petroleum (MRO) and Michael Kors (KORS) made it on Goldman's list despite coming under major pressure recently.Chipotle's sales and stock have plunged since an E. coli outbreak at some locations. Marathon has sold off along with the rest of the energy sector as oil prices sank. And Michael Kors has been in an extended slide amid a shift in consumer tastes.On Tuesday, Chipotle shares rose 1.35%, Marathon rallied 3.8%, and Michael Kors rose climbed 2.9%.

626,KORS,"Fossil (FOSL) said late Thursday that it was acquiring Fitbit (FIT) rival Misfit, but concerns about the impact of the Apple (AAPL) Watch and other wearables sent the watchmaker's stock crashing to a five-year low.Shares plummeted 36.5% to 32.39 by the close in the stock market today. Fossil stock has been in a downtrend for the past two years.Fossil, which launched its first connected-accessories line last month, said the $260 million Misfit buy will help position it to ""win the connected consumer."" But the acquisition was not enough to win over analysts.Cowen analyst Oliver Chen lowered his price target to 42 from 51 on further ""downside potential"" despite Fossil's ""best-in-class multibrand portfolio, supply chain and distribution.""Jefferies analyst Randal Konik slashed his price target to 68 from 90. While he remains bullish on the company's long-term story, several factors — including licensed-watch portfolio weakness and a ""continued wall of worry over the Apple Watch"" — prompted the cut.""Our view has always been that the Apple Watch is not going to destroy the traditional watch market,"" he wrote. ""Nevertheless, there are clear signs that wearable tech is gaining traction and changing the environment.""Echoing what other analysts have said in the past, Konik believes that Fossil could benefit from the rise of wearables as new customers enter the marketplace. He also points out that minus its Kors segment (Fossil makes watches for Michael Kors (KORS), Fossil actually outperformed the overall U.S. watch market in Q3, ""demonstrating that the company is still well-positioned to gain share.""Fossil's Q3 earnings fell 39% to $1.19 a share, topping forecasts by 6 cents, but revenue missed consensus views for $794.4 million, sinking 14% to $771.3 million on a decline in its licensed-watch portfolio and currency headwinds.The company also cut its 2015 adjusted diluted EPS outlook to $5.60-6.20 from $6.20-$7.00.Fitbit, Apple Also Lose Key SupportFitbit shares fell 12% to a record low Friday after pricing a follow-on stock offering at 29 apiece, below Thursday's 31.68 closing price.

That's below the forecasts of analysts, who project EPS of 89 cents on $959.5 million in revenue.Kors shares retreated 5.9% to 77.01 on the the stock market today, hitting a six-month low of 75.13 intraday. The stock has been retreating for the past several months, following margin concerns in its fiscal Q4 report.Several analysts, including Baird, Sterne Agee and Citigroup, had recently cut price targets on concerns that the bag maker's luxury halo was dimming.Wholesale sales rose 40% to $406.8 million, and licensing was up 30.5% to $32.1 million.But retail sales shot up 47.5% to $80.2 million, thanks to 115 net new stores and a 24.2% rise in same-store sales, the company said.

655,KORS,"U.S. teens still love Apple (AAPL), but they're like so over GoPro (GPRO), according to a new survey. Piper Jaffray surveyed 9,400 teens nationwide for its semiannual Taking Stock With Teens poll. It released the results late Tuesday.Apple iPhone ownership and purchase interest remain high among teens, the investment bank said.The fall survey showed that 67% of U.S. teens own an iPhone, up from 66% in the spring. Also, 74% of teens expect their next phone to be an iPhone vs. 72% in the spring survey.On the negative side, Apple Watch purchase intent declined to 8% in the fall survey, vs. 11% in the spring and 16% in fall 2014. Some 5% of teens say they own an Apple Watch, implying 55% market share among early smartwatch adopters, Piper Jaffray said.Apple climbed one spot to the No. 5 ranking for preferred watch brands among teens from upper-income households. The top watch brands are, in descending order, Rolex, Michael Kors (KORS), Casio, Fossil (FOSL) and Apple, Piper Jaffray said. Apple was No. 6 in the spring survey.Still, just 4.8% of upper-income teens picked Apple as their preferred watch brand. That's up from 2.7% in the spring and 1.2% from fall 2014.GoPro Demand Slowing With TeensThe teen survey offered downbeat data for action-camera maker GoPro.GoPro is still top-of-mind among teens, but purchase intent is decelerating, Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy said in a report. In the fall survey, 1.1% of teens listed a GoPro as a top-two gift wish this upcoming holiday season, a deceleration from 1.6% in the spring.Family ownership of GoPro cameras is at 19.8% now vs. 17.9% in the spring survey, she said.Murphy downgraded GoPro stock late Tuesday to neutral from overweight, based in part on the survey results. She also slashed her price target to 25 from 54.Earlier Tuesday, Dougherty & Co. analyst Charles Anderson hacked his price target on GoPro stock to 32 from 70 on signs of weakening demand for GoPro cameras. However, he reiterated his buy rating on the stock based on valuation.""While we believe in the GoPro brand and its ability to engage consumers through the stickiness of its content,"" Murphy said in her report, ""we see near-term risk tied to the following: 1) consumer demand softening (signaled by teen survey); 2) recent pricing reductions that could cause gross margins to normalize (long-term plan: 42-44%); and 3) weakening trends in GoPro index on Amazon.""Amazon Climbs Higher In SurveyAmazon.com (AMZN) remained the favorite e-commerce website for upper-income U.S. teens. It was the choice of 38.3% of such teens in the latest survey, up from 36.3% in the spring and 32.1% last fall. Nike (NKE) is a distant second at 8%.Penetration of Amazon Prime in households with teens rose to 47% this fall from 43% in the spring. Usage of the subscription program, which offers free two-day shipping and streaming video, is higher among those households with more income. For instance, 66% of households with incomes of $125,000 or greater subscribe to Amazon Prime, up from 63% in the spring.Instagram, Snapchat HotFacebook (FB)-owned Instagram was the top social network for teens at 33%, followed by Twitter (TWTR) (20%) and Snapchat (19%). Facebook ranked fourth at 15%.Instagram and Snapchat have seen rapid growth among teen users, while Facebook has been on a precipitous decline.Asked about the most-anticipated movie in the next 12 months, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 2"" from Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF) was picked as No. 1 by 24% of teens.""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" from Walt Disney (DIS) came in second at 16%, followed by ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" and ""The Divergent Series: Allegiant,"" each with 12% of votes.RELATED:Headphones, tablets top planned holiday 2015 gifts.

Analysts had expected $973 million.Including one-time charges, Coach earned $11.7 million in Q4 net income on a GAAP basis, or 4 cents a share, compared with $75.2 million net income, or 27 cents a share, in Q4 2014.As the brand works to maintain relevance with the fashion-savvy set, the early results of its transformation can be seen in its new designs and ""modern luxury"" concept store renovations.CEO Victor Luis said Tuesday that the global introduction of its new concept stores will accelerate, and Coach will have a presence at New York Fashion Week next month, debuting a 75th anniversary collection that will hit shelves in February.""Taken together, these initiatives are expected to drive a return to top line growth in FY16 and positive North American comps by the end of the year,"" he said.During Q4, North American sales plunged 20%, a slight quarter-over-quarter improvement from Q3's 24% decline. Direct-to-consumer sales also fell 20%.North American same-store sales in domestic stores fell 19% as Coach tamps down ""eOutlet"" events and promotional activity.Internationally, overall sales fell 5%. China sales growth slowed from the previous quarter, rising only 5% as comps declined slightly. (In Q3, China sales rose 8% with positive comps.)Japan sales fell 15% on the strong dollar.For fiscal 2016, Coach sees its stand-alone brand revenue rising by ""low-single digits"" on a constant currency basis, with the expectation that currency woes will weigh on revenue growth by 200 basis points.Including anticipated Stuart Weitzman brand sales of $335 million, Coach expects total revenue to grow in the ""high-single digits.""Wall Street expects a 1% rise to revenue of $4.23 billion for the year.Cantor Fitzgerald upgraded Coach to hold from sell on Tuesday, boosting its price target on the stock to 33 from 31.Coach's makeover has been rather well-received so far.""We view transformation efforts positively and are especially encouraged by outperformance of remodeled stores (comping positive), which should further boost sales as the company expects 40% of store base to be in the new concept by the end of FY16 (vs. 15% today),"" wrote Jefferies analyst Randal Konik in a Tuesday note.""Plus, we think new plans to introduce a modern-luxury sales associate uniform and Craftsmanship Bar dovetail nicely with other brand-elevating initiatives.""Wedbush called the last quarter a ""challenging"" one for handbags as department stores such as Macy's (M) ramped up sales and discounts.""KORS has the highest direct exposure to the wholesale channel (nearly 50% of its North American sales), but beyond channel exposure, higher promotions at department stores and a slowing of the category in general also led to sluggish sales and increased discounting at retail locations,"" said Wedbush analyst Morry Brown in an Aug. 2 note.When Michael Kors (KORS) reports Q1 results Thursday before the open, Wall Street anticipates earnings to fall almost 18% to 75 cents a share on a 3% revenue rise to $944 million.Peer Kate Spade (KATE) discloses Q2 earnings before the market opens Wednesday. Analysts expect earnings to more than double to 11 cents a share on a 10% revenue climb to $293 million.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter: @IBD_ELow.RELATED:Kors Crashes On Limp Outlook, Plans On Wearables.

831,KORS,"The Williams-Sonoma store on Manhattan's Upper East Side drew a nice crowd during its summer clearance sale on the last Wednesday in July.

"
833,KORS,"Judging from its financial results,Williams-Sonoma (WSM) doesn't need a sale to lure customers or deliver solid profit growth.
"
834,KORS,"The luxury home goods retail operator has grown earnings by at least double digits in all but two of the past 16 quarters. During this year's first quarter it logged a 17% year-over-year increase in EPS and 10% gains in both overall sales and comparable brand sales.
"
835,KORS,"Tiffany, Kors Shine
"
836,KORS,"Williams-Sonoma isn't the only luxury retailer on a roll. In the first quarter, upscale jewelers Tiffany & Co. (TIF) andSignet Jewelers (SIG) and high-end fashion house Michael Kors Holdings (KORS) all posted double-digit earnings growth, while luxury home furnishings retailer Restoration Hardware (RH) saw a triple-digit gain.
"
837,KORS,"In contrast, retailers that target the middle- and lower-income consumer — including deep discounters Family Dollar Stores (FDO) and Dollar General (DG) as well as giant discounter Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) — reported little or no growth during the latest quarter.
"
838,KORS,"As a group, luxury retailers have outpaced the broader market since the first quarter of 2010 and discounters since the fourth quarter of 2009.
"
839,KORS,"The luxury group's Q1 profit rose 9% from the prior year. That compares with a 7% drop for the discount group and a 4.5% decline for the retail industry, says Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.
"
840,KORS,"Luxury retailers typically cater to consumers with an annual household income above $100,000. For obvious reasons, these consumers can spend more freely than those who make less money.
"
841,KORS,"Affluent consumers have benefited from the rise both in real estate and equity markets during the economic recovery, Perkins says. Most moderate-to-low-income consumers did not benefit from these assets.
"
842,KORS,"In addition, Perkins added, ""the economy has been unable to generate enough well-paying jobs to generate a higher level of consumer spending. That's had an impact on many middle- and lower-income consumers. Their wages are stagnant or in decline.""
"
843,KORS,"Analyst Bradley Thomas, who covers retail hardlines for KeyBanc Capital Markets, offers a similar take.
"
844,KORS,"""There's definitely a bifurcation, he said. ""Clearly, the wealth effect is the tailwind for high-end retailers and manufacturers.""
"
845,KORS,"Williams-Sonoma and Restoration Hardware have had ""standout results,"" Thomas says. But chains that are more exposed to low-income consumers — such as rent-to-own operators Rent-A-Center (RCII) and Aaron's (AAN) — have had a ""fair amount of weakness this year.""
"
846,KORS,"The low-end consumer also has been faced with a ""litany of small cost increases that really add up,"" Thomas says. These include a reduction in food stamp benefits and unemployment benefits.
"
847,KORS,"Luxury retailers, meantime, have done their fair share to lure consumers.
"
848,KORS,"Take Williams-Sonoma, whose lineup of retail operations includes Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn and West Elm. It has seen double-digit profit growth in all but one of the past nine quarters.
"
849,KORS,"Thomas says one reason for the company's strong results ""comes down to their omnichannel model, which it does better than just about anyone.""
"
850,KORS,"""Omnichannel"" refers to the fact that each of the company's brands sells through its own stores, online and through their catalogs.
"
851,KORS,"""Williams-Sonoma has omnichannel in their DNA dating back to their heritage as a catalog business, which has translated very well into being an online business as well as a brick-and-mortar retailer,"" Thomas said.
"
852,KORS,"In a July report initiating coverage on Williams-Sonoma with a ""buy"" rating, Nomura analyst Jessica Schoen Mace said the company's ""numerous store formats, strong retail brands and established e-commerce presence (44% of the business) should result in continued market-share growth both in the U.S. and internationally.""
"
853,KORS,"This in turn should help Williams-Sonoma exceed its planned mid- to high single-digit revenue growth and low- double-digit to mid-teens EPS growth, Mace added.
"
854,KORS,"Real Estate Restoration
"
855,KORS,"Restoration Hardware has also been a standout, with a long run of double-digit or better earnings and sales growth. The company is undergoing a real estate transformation that involves scrapping some smaller stores in favor of bigger ones, including Full Line Design Galleries of 25,000 to 60,000 square feet.
"
856,KORS,"As part of the transformation, Restoration Hardware is also revamping its supply chain and system platform. These initiatives have helped the company deliver industry-leading same-store sales gains.
"
857,KORS,"But times have been tough on the discount front — so tough that even the world's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart, has seen several quarters of declining U.S. same-store sales.
"
858,KORS,"Company officials hope a management shakeup will help turn things around. On July 24, Wal-Mart announced that its U.S. CEO, Bill Simon, is stepping down and being succeeded by Greg Foran, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Asia.
"
859,KORS,"Wal-Mart's core customer ""has been under pressure since the recovery,"" Perkins said. ""It's being forced to broaden its online effort to bring in more customers, and to expand its (small-format) Neighborhood Market stores to capture some of the business they've been losing to Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General.""
"
860,KORS,"Perkins points out that Simon noted just last month that the middle-to-low-end consumer has not seen much recovery.
"
861,KORS,"Deep Discount Powerhouse
"
862,KORS,"Meanwhile, Wal-Mart might be facing more competition. Deep discounter Dollar Tree, which sells everything for $1 or less, announced on July 28 that it had agreed to buy struggling Family Dollar in an $8.5 billion deal that would create a new No. 1 player in the deep discount space and create a 13,000-store retail powerhouse.
"
863,KORS,"The merger should result in improvements at Family Dollar, says Wedbush analyst Joan Storms. ""It clearly would improve its merchandise assortment. That will lead to increased store productivity and operating margin expansion, which would make it a stronger competitor to the likes of Wal-Mart (smaller format) Express stores.""
"
864,KORS,"One thing many agree on is that the bifurcation between the low-end and high-end retail consumer will continue.
"
865,KORS,"""It's not because the 'have nots' are getting worse, but because the 'haves' are getting better faster,"" said Joel Bines, managing director at consultancy AlixPartners.
"
866,KORS,"This has allowed luxury retailers to increase prices and create an even bigger separation between the two segments, he says. ""This also puts enormous pressure on retailers who cater to the lower-end consumer since they can't grow by raising prices.""The Williams-Sonoma store on Manhattan's Upper East Side drew a nice crowd during its summer clearance sale on the last Wednesday in July.But customers weren't only drawn to the bargains.

(TIF) andSignet Jewelers (SIG) and high-end fashion house Michael Kors Holdings (KORS) all posted double-digit earnings growth, while luxury home furnishings retailer Restoration Hardware (RH) saw a triple-digit gain.In contrast, retailers that target the middle- and lower-income consumer — including deep discounters Family Dollar Stores (FDO) and Dollar General (DG) as well as giant discounter Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) — reported little or no growth during the latest quarter.As a group, luxury retailers have outpaced the broader market since the first quarter of 2010 and discounters since the fourth quarter of 2009.The luxury group's Q1 profit rose 9% from the prior year. That compares with a 7% drop for the discount group and a 4.5% decline for the retail industry, says Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.Luxury retailers typically cater to consumers with an annual household income above $100,000. For obvious reasons, these consumers can spend more freely than those who make less money.Affluent consumers have benefited from the rise both in real estate and equity markets during the economic recovery, Perkins says. Most moderate-to-low-income consumers did not benefit from these assets.In addition, Perkins added, ""the economy has been unable to generate enough well-paying jobs to generate a higher level of consumer spending. That's had an impact on many middle- and lower-income consumers. Their wages are stagnant or in decline.""Analyst Bradley Thomas, who covers retail hardlines for KeyBanc Capital Markets, offers a similar take.""There's definitely a bifurcation, he said. ""Clearly, the wealth effect is the tailwind for high-end retailers and manufacturers.""Williams-Sonoma and Restoration Hardware have had ""standout results,"" Thomas says. But chains that are more exposed to low-income consumers — such as rent-to-own operators Rent-A-Center (RCII) and Aaron's (AAN) — have had a ""fair amount of weakness this year.""The low-end consumer also has been faced with a ""litany of small cost increases that really add up,"" Thomas says. These include a reduction in food stamp benefits and unemployment benefits.Luxury retailers, meantime, have done their fair share to lure consumers.Take Williams-Sonoma, whose lineup of retail operations includes Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn and West Elm. It has seen double-digit profit growth in all but one of the past nine quarters.Thomas says one reason for the company's strong results ""comes down to their omnichannel model, which it does better than just about anyone.""""Omnichannel"" refers to the fact that each of the company's brands sells through its own stores, online and through their catalogs.""Williams-Sonoma has omnichannel in their DNA dating back to their heritage as a catalog business, which has translated very well into being an online business as well as a brick-and-mortar retailer,"" Thomas said.In a July report initiating coverage on Williams-Sonoma with a ""buy"" rating, Nomura analyst Jessica Schoen Mace said the company's ""numerous store formats, strong retail brands and established e-commerce presence (44% of the business) should result in continued market-share growth both in the U.S. and internationally.""This in turn should help Williams-Sonoma exceed its planned mid- to high single-digit revenue growth and low- double-digit to mid-teens EPS growth, Mace added.Real Estate RestorationRestoration Hardware has also been a standout, with a long run of double-digit or better earnings and sales growth. The company is undergoing a real estate transformation that involves scrapping some smaller stores in favor of bigger ones, including Full Line Design Galleries of 25,000 to 60,000 square feet.As part of the transformation, Restoration Hardware is also revamping its supply chain and system platform. These initiatives have helped the company deliver industry-leading same-store sales gains.But times have been tough on the discount front — so tough that even the world's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart, has seen several quarters of declining U.S. same-store sales.Company officials hope a management shakeup will help turn things around. On July 24, Wal-Mart announced that its U.S. CEO, Bill Simon, is stepping down and being succeeded by Greg Foran, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Asia.Wal-Mart's core customer ""has been under pressure since the recovery,"" Perkins said. ""It's being forced to broaden its online effort to bring in more customers, and to expand its (small-format) Neighborhood Market stores to capture some of the business they've been losing to Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General.""Perkins points out that Simon noted just last month that the middle-to-low-end consumer has not seen much recovery.Deep Discount PowerhouseMeanwhile, Wal-Mart might be facing more competition. Deep discounter Dollar Tree, which sells everything for $1 or less, announced on July 28 that it had agreed to buy struggling Family Dollar in an $8.5 billion deal that would create a new No. 1 player in the deep discount space and create a 13,000-store retail powerhouse.The merger should result in improvements at Family Dollar, says Wedbush analyst Joan Storms. ""It clearly would improve its merchandise assortment. That will lead to increased store productivity and operating margin expansion, which would make it a stronger competitor to the likes of Wal-Mart (smaller format) Express stores.""One thing many agree on is that the bifurcation between the low-end and high-end retail consumer will continue.""It's not because the 'have nots' are getting worse, but because the 'haves' are getting better faster,"" said Joel Bines, managing director at consultancy AlixPartners.This has allowed luxury retailers to increase prices and create an even bigger separation between the two segments, he says. ""This also puts enormous pressure on retailers who cater to the lower-end consumer since they can't grow by raising prices.""

867,KORS,"When looking for potential stocks to buy, your best bet is to stick with those building early-stage bases.Why? Leaders tend to make their biggest moves as they break out of early-stage patterns.An institutional-quality stock's first breakout from a sound base can easily result in gains of 20% or more gains during a market uptrend. The odds of success with second-stage bases are still fairly high, often resulting in another advance of 20% or more.But by the time they form third-stage and later bases, there might not be as much gas left in the tank, raising the risk of a failed breakout. After a lengthy and sizable run-up, savvy mutual funds and other big players that helped propel the stock higher will likely look to start unloading shares.Before the first base forms, a stock must always show a prior uptrend of at least 30%. Also, if it has not risen 20% from a proper base buy point and then forms a new base, count the two bases together as one base.When a stock starts to act differently at its breakout — it hesitates and falters instead of surging in big volume — that's a red flag.That said, there are a few exceptional leaders that can defy the odds and still knock out a productive breakout from a third-stage or even later base. Such stocks should continue to display truly strong fundamentals and sound chart action amid a bull market.Michael Kors (KORS) has consistently notched double- or triple-digit quarterly profit growth and 39%-or-better sales gains since its public debut in late 2011 debut.Shares of the former ""Project Runway"" judge's namesake company cleared an ultrashort IPO base just weeks after their December 2011 debut and rallied 153% in less than three months of trading. The stock paused in March 2012 to start work on its first true base 1, a five-month cup with a 50.79 entry, which it cleared the week ended Aug. 17 in heavy trade.The stock didn't take off. Instead, it moved mostly sideways, eventually rising as much as 15% before shaping its next base 2. This was the second part of a base-on-base formation.Kors broke out again, but didn't rise much. Instead, it continued to add to its prior base-on-base construction. Finally, an eight-week cup with handle 3, still part of that initial base on base formed in the first half of 2012, delivered. The stock rallied 30% from its late-July breakout past 65.21 before starting a new flat base in late December.

877,KORS,"Coach (COH) shares tumbled Thursday to a four-year low after the premium handbag and accessories retailer cut guidance amid struggles to bounce back in the face of stiff competition.Speaking at its analyst and investor day, Coach projected low-double-digit revenue decline and a high-teens same-store sales percentage decline in North America for fiscal 2015. Operating margins are expected to be in the high teens vs. prior views of 26% this year.Shares ended the day down 9% on the stock market today, hitting their lowest closing price since July 2010.The ""affordable luxury"" retailer has lost a lot of its luster lately in the wake of success from rivals Michael Kors (KORS), Kate Spade (KATE) and Tory Burch. Coach's fiscal Q3 earnings dropped 19% vs. year-ago figures to 68 cents a share. Revenue fell 7% to $1.1 billion, with North American same-store sales plunging 21%.The company has shifted its strategy following lackluster numbers, moving away from logos in favor of leather goods and reducing third-party events and flash sales in favor of a semi-annual sale. The sale is meant to evoke a ""seasonal feel,"" a company representative said at analyst day.The addition of designer Stuart Vevers as executive creative director could reinvigorate the brand, as his first collection is set to hit stores in September.Still, as Vevers' new line for Coach is eagerly anticipated, company officials seem to be focused on the long game instead of immediate results, perhaps in an attempt to temper expectations for a quick turnaround.""It's not about September. It's about evolving the Coach brand,"" said CEO Victor Luis at the company's analyst day. ""It's not about the next 'It' bag or the next 'It' collection,"" he added, but the ""journey.""Coach's new strategy will ""ultimately be brand enhancing, but in the intermediate term we could see sales fall,"" Macquarie analyst Liz Dunn previously told IBD.Michael Kors shares slid nearly 2% to 89.04 intraday.

924,KORS,"Overall operating margins improved 80 basis points to 26.8%, driven by healthy operating leverage and a slight improvement in the gross margin, said Telsey Advisory Group analyst David Wu.
"
925,KORS,"Retail operating margin, however, fell 670 basis points to 22% due to operating deleverage from higher rent costs associated with store openings, said Wu, adding that Kors is paying rent for stores that haven't yet opened.

"
929,KORS,"""Both of these investments put some pressure on the fourth-quarter retail operating margin. But our belief is fiscal 2015 retail operating margin should be relatively flat with where they ended in fiscal 2014,"" she said.
"

"
937,KORS,"Onward In Europe

952,KORS,"A lack of new customers and lower-than-expected orders from specialty gift channel retailers wilted its signature blooms in Q1, butVera Bradley (VRA) hopes a new partnership with Macy's will help its garden grow.The maker of colorful, quilted handbags and accessories reported earnings sank 30% to 16 cents a share, though it beat estimates by 3 cents. Sales dropped 8% to $113.5 million, missing analyst estimates of $118.4 million. Same-store sales sank 9.4%.Shares of Vera Bradley fell 5.4% to 23.89 in the stock market today after sinking as low as 22.73 intraday.""Sales from existing customers have been relatively stable, but our traditional patterns and products simply are not attracting enough new customers to our brand, and overall traffic is down substantially,"" said CEO Robert Wallstrom in post-earnings conference call. ""Until we can make meaningful changes to our product offering and marketing initiatives, we don't expect these sales trends to substantially improve.""As such, the company hopes to spring its floral totes and bags on a wider audience, announcing a deal Thursday with Macy's (M). The nationwide department store will sell Vera Bradley products at around 70 locations across the country, ideally widening the tote-maker's current appeal and ""broaden(ing) our geographic reach,"" said Wallstrom in a release. Many of Vera Bradley's stores are presently in the South and Northeast.The company set its sights abroad as well, striking a 5-year deal with Mitsubishi and Look to import and market its products in Japan. It plans to shutter the existing 13 Vera Bradley retail locations in that country and reassess distribution.With the launch of leather and faux-leather collections, Vera Bradley also seems to be looking to a younger audience. Its signature floral quilted look doesn't compete in the same market as higher-end luxury bagmakers such as Michael Kors (KORS), Kate Spade (KATE) or even Coach (COH), but it has developed a cult following over the years within a loyal customer base.In the past year, the company opened 16 stores and three outlets, but growth of year-over-year net revenues has been detracted by declining same-store sales. Total Q1 same-store sales sank 9.4%. E-commerce took less of a hit with a 3.3% decline, but brick-and-mortar store sales dropped 14.4%. Like many other retailers, Vera Bradley blamed the severe winter for a dip in foot traffic during the first two months of the quarter.Vera Bradley now sees Q2 EPS of 18-20 cents with revenue at $113 million to $120 million. It cut its full-year forecast to $510-$530 million in sales and $1-$1.10 in per-share earnings.Analysts had expected Q2 EPS of 30 cents on sales of $127.5 million. Wall Street had forecast full-year revenue of $553.7 million and earnings of $1.26 a share.

So far, Martis has tallied 43 negative guidances for Q1 and only three positive outlooks.That means it's important for retailers to move inventory that piled up during the winter storms, or else more discounting will be needed at the end of the quarter, potentially hurting profits, she warns.While Thursday's sales report reflects a rebound from January's ""weather-depressed pace,"" it would've been stronger had it not been for lingering weather problems that held back consumers, said Michael Niemira, chief economist for the International Council of Shopping Centers.""But encouragingly,"" he added, ""as March started, sales improved, suggesting that pent-up demand is likely to propel sales over the next couple of months.""National Retail Federation CEO Matthew Shay says the Commerce Department's numbers are encouraging, indicating the economy is primed for growth.""While the weather continues to play tricks on economic forecasts and figures, we expect much-needed clarity come spring as consumers release pent-up demand,"" he said in a statement.Still, he added, retailers continue to face ""serious head winds"" placed on them by policymakers, such as new overtime mandates and ""political posturing on the minimum wage.""

1139,KORS,"Nobody likes being duped. But in the world of fashion, ""dupes"" mean coveted products that look and feel like consumers' favorite high-end brands, at a fraction of the price.

1141,KORS,"In the wake of plunging sales and increasing competition, the maker and retailer of leather handbags and accessories aims to bounce back with smarter sales and a smarter look. But Coach will likely preach patience at Thursday's analyst day. Even if successful, a turnaround could take years.
"
1142,KORS,"Coach and its logo-emblazoned leather bags were ubiquitous until recent years, when Michael Kors (KORS), Kate Spade (KATE) and Tory Burch started encroaching on its space, and look-at-this-bag fashion faded from the spotlight in favor of more recession-friendly modesty.
"
1143,KORS,"The brand ""stuck with logos maybe a little bit longer than they should have,"" Macquarie analyst Liz Dunn told IBD. But fixing things that ain't broke can seem counterintuitive, and Coach rode on a C-encrusted wave of popularity until it petered out. Dunn says that the company has since ""pulled back pretty significantly,"" with its logo on less than 20% of its merchandise now, compared to a peak of about one-third in the past.
"
1144,KORS,"High-end brands such as Gucci and Louis Vuitton have also toned down monogrammed merchandise, according to London-based Ledbury Research, a luxury-brand market research firm.

1145,KORS,".Coach was once a pioneer in ""accessible luxury,"" a market that appeals to middle-income consumers, but competition from up-and-comers plus a lack of fashionable edge have contributed to its backslide.
"
1146,KORS,"In its fiscal third quarter ending in March, Coach's earnings slid 19% vs. a year earlier to 68 cents a share. Revenue declined 7% to $1.1 billion, with North American same-store sales plunging 21%.

1152,KORS,"The Budget Bag Image
"
1153,KORS,"With its purses off trend, Coach has struggled to move its wares out the door. While the company has, until now, eschewed sales at its full-price stores, off-price Coach bags aren't exactly hard to find. The company has offered price cuts via third-party events such as preferred-customer events and flash sales on other sites, and its handbags and shoes can frequently be found on sale at department stores such as Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN).
"
1154,KORS,"Kors and Kate have lower-tier lines such as Michael by Michael Kors and Kate Spade Saturday, but Coach has traditionally gone with flash sales and factory stores to appeal to budget-conscious consumers.
"
1155,KORS,"Coach also may have overexpanded its factory outlets, which offer products at a lower price point. Coach closed three net retail stores in fiscal 2013 but opened 24 factory outlet stores. It opened 26 factory stores in 2012.

1156,KORS,"Sterne Agee's Boruchow estimates that factory ""sales per square foot peaked at ~$2,700"" in fiscal 2012, following saturation of full-price channels. However, ""it now appears that the Factory business is bearing the brunt of the company's struggles.""
"
1157,KORS,"Boruchow adds that Coach was believed to be ""clearing virtually all of its excess inventory through Factory stores.""
"
1158,KORS,"Coach reportedly will start sales of 30%-50% every June and January at its main locations. The goal is to get customers to forget that its products used to be a little cheaper almost all of the time.

1159,KORS,"The semi-annual sales strategy will ""ultimately be brand enhancing, but in the intermediate term we could see sales fall,"" said Dunn to IBD, reaffirming in a note that ""the first sale will likely be met with criticism from the investment community and confusion from customers.""

1161,KORS,"Time For A Makeover
"
1162,KORS,"A brand turnaround for Coach may take years, but it can be done. Burberry managed to ""put itself back on the luxury map in less than 5 years,"" Ledbury Research said in a report. The U.K. apparel brand ""shook off its mass/fashion association and counterfeit issues by reducing the visibility of the distinctive check \ from 2006.""
"
1163,KORS,"Higher-end lines raised average prices while creating a ""halo effect"" on Burberry's other products.

1164,KORS,"Coach could do the same, but not without work.
"
1165,KORS,"""After a year of persistent traffic declines,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Corinna Freedman in a research note, ""we believe COH has to work much harder than it has in the past to bring customers back to the brand (at full price), as its turnaround is dependent on elevating the brand.""
"
1166,KORS,"Bringing in new North American customers may also prove difficult, because the premium women's handbag market is fairly mature in North America, and Coach already has a large share.

1230,KORS,"As the retail first-quarter earnings train moves full speed ahead this week, investors will get an idea of how high-end players Tiffany & Co. (TIF) and Williams-Sonoma (WSM) fared during the harsh winter when they report results on Wednesday.If followers are on the money, the two retailers likely saw both sales and earnings heat up during the quarter as consumers braved the cold weather and stepped up the pace of spending.Luxury consumers have been reaping the benefits of stock-market gains and increased home values, which have helped buoy spending at retailers that cater to this crowd — retailers like Williams-Sonoma and Tiffany.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect upscale jeweler Tiffany to see earnings rise 11% from a year earlier to 78 cents a share when it reports before the opening bell Wednesday. That would follow a 5% rise during the holiday fourth quarter. Sales are seen increasing 6.6% to $955.63 million. That would be up from a 5% increase in the prior quarter.High-end home-goods retailer Williams-Sonoma is seen showing a 7% increase in Q1 earnings to 44 cents a share when it deliver results after the close Wednesday. Analysts expect it to report a 6% increase in sales to $941.88 million.The high-end retail segment also includes players like upscale department store operator Nordstrom (JWN), which beat Q1 earnings views Thursday. Fashion house Michael Kors (KORS) and home furnishings retailer Restoration Hardware (RH) also cater to upscale consumers.Williams-Sonoma is likely getting a lift from the rise in home improvement spending amid the continued recovery in the housing market.Other members of IBD's Retail/Wholesale-Jewelry group, where Tiffany operates, include Signet Jewelers (SIG) and Fossil Group (FOSL).

"
1232,KORS,"IPO bases — the very first bullish pattern a stock creates in its trading history — can be shorter than normal. Michael Kors' (KORS) version certainly fit that description.After its initial public offering (IPO), a stock's initial weeks in the market can be wild and unsettled. But at some point, the trading will settle down and a base can quickly form. A new IPO stock can also shoot up with unusual energy and give early shareholders a prodigious gain.But investors still need to study a stock chart to find the proper buy point, which can be harder to spot on a brand new chart than on a long-established one.The upscale accessories maker and retailer went public on the NYSE on Dec. 15, 2011. For Kors, the IPO base formed swiftly.From the first day, the stock traded above the offering price of 20 a share. A 12% surge the second week showed Kors was winning over institutional investors.In the fourth week of trading, Kors had its first decline (1) . A drop of less than 5% wasn't much to fuss about. It was hard to gauge volume with such a new stock, but the down week's trading, while higher than the prior week, wasn't excessive. That gave chart readers some reassurance.Two weeks later, in the week ended Jan. 20, 2012, Kors surged to a new high in heavy trading (2).That was the breakout for this IPO base. From a 27.68 buy point to the peak of 50.69 two months later, the stock vaulted 83%.To be sure, this IPO base was easy to miss. It is perhaps somewhat of a misnomer for an Investor's Corner series that goes under the banner of classic IPO bases. Even on IBD Leaderboard, the base was said to be too short to be a true IPO pattern.A two-week consolidation indeed can be too short for most stocks. But Kors had something relatively few stocks can boast — a potent set of fundamentals.Earnings per share had bulged 117% and 213% the two quarters leading up to the IPO. Sales growth was 60% and 61%, in line with previous quarters.As the market would learn after its fourth-quarter results, the company's fiscal 2011 and 2012 profit climbed 81% and 129%, respectively. Sales increased 58% and 62%. Pretax margin of 21.4% in fiscal 2012 was the highest ever; return on equity was a very robust 57.4%.With those numbers, Kors established itself not just as a leader in its category but also in the broad market.When a true leader like that forms a base that may seem too narrow in scope, don't ignore it. Study it carefully, especially if the market is in a confirmed uptrend.The stock formed its first conventional base from March to August of 2012. The breakout didn't produce much of a gain, as did a couple of subsequent bases. But Michael Kors started another strong advance in July 2013.(Editor's Note: Read the IPO Leaders column on Tuesday and Thursday for more insight.)

1371,KORS,"Michael Kors (KORS) dethroned Coach in recent years as the it handbag, but how is it faring against upstart Kate Spade in the battle for affordable luxury purses and clutches?Last year Kors posted a 72% jump in shares as sales rose $2.2 billion. Kors is slated to report fourth-quarter results May 28. Analysts expect the fashion house to report a 36% jump in earnings to 68 cents per share and sales to rise 37% to $816.7 million.Over the holidays, Kors increased its market share among 18-24-year-old women. According to a Cowen Consumer Tracking Survey, among women 18 to 34 years old, 30% preferred Michael Kors to Coach (COH) in December 2013, up from 24% in November 2013 and 20% in December 2012. For women who buy two to three handbags per year, the preference for Michael Kors hit a new high of 27% in December 2013 vs. 23% in November and 16% in December 2012.Kors handbags tend to sell for $200-$350, a pricey item but less so than an even more upscale Louis Vuitton bag.Kors' stock debut on the NYSE in December 2011, but Michael Kors the designer has been turning heads on runways around the world since 1981 when he launched the Michael Kors women's wear line.Kors is a more mature brand than Kate Spade (KATE) and, like Coach, has learned, older, established brands that don't always do better.In a report last month, Citi said Kors has four times the share of the global handbag market vs. Kate.But as with Kors' leap over Coach, Kate could be the next big thing, say analysts in the Citi report.Last week, Kate reported an adjusted loss from continuing operations of 6 cents per share, up from a loss of 16 cents in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting only a 4-cent loss. But sales jumped 33.5% to $328 million, its best gain in several years, on a 54% jump in its namesake Kate Spade brand as the company sheds its underperforming brands like Juicy Couture and Lucky Brand.Kate is known for its handbags with bright colors and bold stripes. The brand also makes home accessories, an area Coach and Kors don't have a large presence in.The brutal winter and tough economic conditions for consumers hit retailers overall, but luxury brands still seemed to do well during the holidays as shoppers splurged on the it bag of the season.It's debatable if the it bag was Kors or Kate, but it definitely wasn't Coach. In April, Coach reported a 19% drop in Q3 EPS to 68 cents while revenue fell 7.4% to $1.1 billion, and its North American same-store sales fell 21% on weakness in women's bags and accessories.Still, the story isn't over quite yet for Coach. The company is under the direction of a new management team and creative director as it looks to remake itself from something old into something new.Michael Kors shares edged higher in the stock market today. Kate Spade and Coach fell less than 1%.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter at @IBD_GRich.

1373,KORS,"The team at Vince Holding wasted no time getting its high-end contemporary fashion brand all glammed up with new products and categories after hitting the Wall Street runway late last year.Vince is a premium clothing brand known for its collection of everyday luxury essentials for women — from slouchy cashmere sweaters and understated leather jackets for colder temperatures to flowy silk blouses and linen pants for the warm seasons.Since going public in November, Vince (VNCE) has woven a new pattern for growth, which includes expanding its product offerings into new categories such as handbags. The idea is to evolve into a lifestyle brand and strengthen its position with the company's wholesale partners, including upscale department stores such as Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom (JWN) and Saks Fifth Avenue (owned by Canada's Hudson's Bay (HBC), as well as its own namesake retail stores.Men And Children NextIn addition to women's clothing, which accounts for about 85% of sales, Vince offers women's footwear through a licensing arrangement and is about to launch men's footwear with the same licensing partner, Brown Shoe (BWS). The line will come out in July, according to WWD.com.Vince also plans to launch children's apparel through a licensing partner in this year's second half. Early next year, the company plans to launch a handbag collection and other accessories.""This is a company that starts with a very distinct point of view in apparel, which today makes up the majority of its business,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy.""It's taking that everyday luxury aesthetic and pushing it into different categories,"" she said. ""The biggest opportunity is their next big launch of handbags and accessories in early 2015.""The move into handbags and accessories would put Vince in a market between players like ""jet-set"" lifestyle brand Michael Kors Holdings (KORS) and traditional European luxury players such as Celine and Louis Vuitton, Murphy adds.Murphy says that Vince is positioned to fare well in this category. It's a premium brand that's priced closer to luxury than so-called ""accessible luxury,"" she says, with sweaters from around $225 to $400, leather jackets at $995 and tops from $100 to $200.""What's unique about its positioning is it's taking what we believe is white space in the handbag market,"" said Murphy.She expects Vince's handbags to be priced between $700 to $1,000 in department stores, which she says would be a ""sweet spot.""There are few brands around that price point, she says, which means Vince could capture not only the ""trade-up consumer but the trade-down consumer.""That price would compare with handbags priced at around $300 to $400, where there are many competitors — such as Michael Kors, Coach (COH), Tory Burch and Kate Spade (KATE).Sweet Spot In PricingThe luxury end of the market is priced between $1,200 and $3,000.As Vince extends into accessories, it has a ""good opportunity"" in that space, Murphy adds.""It already has a captive audience in the premium wholesale market domestically because of how well it's performing in women's apparel,"" she said.Murphy says that Vince prevails as the No. 1 contemporary apparel brand in Nordstrom, Saks and Neiman Marcus.Vince has been faring handsomely on the financial front with its current lineup of products. In its fourth quarter ended Feb. 1, its first as a public company, earnings grew 15% to 23 cents a share. Sales grew 21% to $87.8 million.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect earnings to rise 21% to 88 cents a share in 2015. They see a 30% gain in 2016 and a 13% increase in 2017.Prior to the IPO and related restructuring transactions, Vince Holding was a diversified apparel company operating a broad portfolio of fashion brands, including Vince. As a result of the IPO and the related restructuring transaction, the non-Vince businesses were separated out, and Vince became the sole operating business of Vince Holding.Management is eying several growth drivers for the company in addition to expansion into new product categories.Covering New TerritoryAs of March 27, Vince had 28 stores in the U.S., 22 of which are full-price stores and six of which are outlet stores. It's on track to open six to eight new stores in the 2014 fiscal year, with a ""strong pipeline for 2015 and beyond,"" said CEO Jill Granoff on the fourth-quarter conference call.Murphy estimates that Vince could grow its retail-store base domestically to 100 over time.As of Feb. 1, Vince products were sold to consumers via about 2,300 points of distribution through its wholesale partners.Vince's U.S. wholesale business represented 71% of sales in fiscal 2013, and international wholesale represented 8%.In fiscal 2013, Vince opened 90 new shop-in-shops globally in the wholesale channel, and it expects to open more.""Given the success"" of its shop-in-shop investments last year, it's planning to open an additional 15 to 25 domestic shops in fiscal 2014, to bring the total at the end of fiscal year to 26 to 36 domestic shops, Granoff said on the call.On the product front, the company is looking to expand its existing categories with an ""increased focus"" on outerwear and dresses, said Granoff. It's also planning to launch an ""elevated"" product assortment in its men's business in the fall.Vince is also pursuing international expansion, which includes opening free-standing stores.The company recently opened its second Vince store in Istanbul, Turkey, with its distribution partner. Vince is also actively looking to lease its first international showroom in Paris to further build the brand's European business, Granoff said.William Blair & Co. analyst Amy Noblin called Vince a ""rapidly growing accessible-luxury brand"" in her initiation report on the company.She said it's ""well positioned"" to capitalize on three trends including the ""growth in the number of and wealth of global luxury consumers; a designer customer that is trading down; and consumers increasingly cross-shopping and mixing higher- and lower-end merchandise.""Noblin says the Vince brand has developed a ""cult following"" for its everyday luxury essential products.""The brand differentiates itself through a clean, modern and somewhat timeless aesthetic that is comfortable and effortless,"" she wrote.

1509,KORS,"Hong Kong-based fashion retailer Michael Kors (KORS) has hit a snag after breaking out of a flat base in October.The Leaderboard stock cleared the 78.72 buy point Oct. 22 in heavy volume. It quickly pulled back to support at its 50-day moving average, then climbed to an all-time high of 83.13 on Nov. 18. Since then, Kors has gone mostly sideways and is just 4% above the entry, which means it's still in buying range.Kors' recent action has echoes in the stock's prior bases, when the stock would break out only to pull back and form another base. But the overall trend has been higher, as Kors has quadrupled since going public two years ago. It's up 60% this year alone, and the recent sideways action has been accompanied by weak volume, which is a good sign.Kors sells clothes, footwear, handbags and other accessories that offer a taste of luxury. It's been taking market share away from rival Coach (COH).Kors boasts a best-possible 99 Earnings Per Share Rating, though profit has decelerated in recent quarters. The company posted a 138% earnings jump in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended in March, followed by subsequent increases of 79% and 45%. Profit growth for fiscal Q3 is seen slipping further to 34%.Revenue growth has also been on a downward trend, with gains of 74%, 70%, 57%, 54% and 39% over the past five quarters.Meanwhile, retailers are facing difficulties amid sluggish job and wage growth. Overall holiday retail sales got off to a weak start last month, but higher-end stores like Kors fared relatively well, Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, told IBD last week. http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/120513-681875-soft-november-sales-a-red-flag-for-holiday.htm?p=fullKors is a top stock in the Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing industry group, which was ranked 60th on Tuesday out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks.Institutional investors still favor Kors. Fund ownership of the stock has increased for seven straight quarters, led by highly rated Wall Street titans such as the Fidelity Magellan Fund and the Columbia Marisco 21st Century fund.That helps to explain why the stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A- and an up/down volume ratio of 2.0, both of which indicate strong demand.Kors' annual pretax margin is especially attractive, accelerating for four straight years to a robust 28.7% in 2012. Return on equity was also strong last year at 52.9%.

These stocks are also the cream of the crop in their respective sectors.Over the past year through March 6, Sector Leaders shot up 94.2% on a price-weighted basis, far outpacing a 21.6% gain for the S&P 500. Year-to-date through Monday's close, Sector Leaders are already up 16.2% vs. a 3.8% advance for the Nasdaq and 1.6% for the S&P 500.With the major redesign of the stock tables back in 2008, IBD made it much faster and easier to find the best stocks from each sector. Sector Leaders are boxed at the very top of each sector heading for easy reference. In Feb. 27's IBD, BitAuto (BITA), Facebook (FB) and Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU) were the three Sector Leaders in the Internet sector, which was ranked No. 2.Note that not all of the 33 sectors in IBD will have Sector Leaders. To make it even easier, investors don't have to flip through all of the stock tables to look for the Sector Leaders. Charts of all of the Sector Leaders usually appear on Page B1 Tuesday through Friday. The Sector Leaders charts are elsewhere in Monday's edition.Stocks that make the Sector Leaders list can make for excellent watch-list candidates. Even if they already have broken out, investors should still pay attention and see if they're still in buying range or have crafted a secondary entry point.While the Sector Leaders can make for trade candidates, they can also help you gauge the overall condition of leading stocks. If Sector Leaders are breaking down even as the market is in confirmed uptrend, then that's not a good sign for investors.On the flip side, if Sector Leaders start rising in a down market, that gives you a clue to possible improving conditions ahead.Drugmaker Actavis (ACT) was featured in the July 26 Sector Leaders charts as it formed an eight-week flat base with a 133.10 buy point 1. The stock broke out that same day and has rallied 73% 2 to as high as 230.77.Other recent winners that appeared in Sector Leaders on July 26 were Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ), Michael Kors (KORS), Priceline.com (PCLN) and FleetCor Technologies (FLT).

1599,KORS,"Retailers kicked off the holiday season on a sour note with disappointing November sales gains in reports out Thursday.
"
1600,KORS,"Deep discounts throughout the month didn't do much to spark a spending spree, a sign that retailers could be in for some tough sledding as they enter the holiday season's home stretch.
"
1601,KORS,"Sales at stores open at least a year rose 1.9% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. Analysts had forecast a 2.9% gain. That was a sharp deceleration from October's 4% increase.
"
1602,KORS,"Two of the best-performing retailers over the past five years, Costco Wholesale (COST) and L Brands (LTD), both missed November views. Their results, says Perkins, reflect the tough retail environment that prompted widespread discounting throughout the month, well before the usual Black Friday promotions.
"
1603,KORS,"""The overall results were very disappointing,"" said Perkins. ""Santa delivered some early coal to retailers during November and during the Thanksgiving/Black Friday holiday weekend. It says that retailers are in for a real dogfight this holiday season.""

"
1605,KORS,"Retailers are going to find it difficult to ""squeeze blood from a stone,"" he adds, given that most consumers don't have excess discretionary dollars to spend.
"
1606,KORS,"It means that stores will have to offer 50% off or more to get consumers to spend, Perkins says.
"
1607,KORS,"L Brands cited a late Thanksgiving as a major negative. For November the company reported a sales decrease of 5% from October, its first negative monthly comp since October 2009. Analysts had forecast a 1.2% decrease. The parent of Victoria's Secret indicated that it expects December comps to rise in the low- to mid-single digits, Perkins says.
"
1608,KORS,"Costco's total company comps, including gasoline sales, were up 2% vs. a year ago, missing views for a 3.5% gain. It was its smallest gain for the giant warehouse club discounter dating back to September 2009. Costco's core U.S. comps, excluding the impact of gasoline sales, came in at a 3% rise, short of forecasts for a 4.5% gain.
"
1609,KORS,"Perkins says Costco's showing reflects the ""broader consumer caution out there and their unwillingness and inability to open their purse strings.""
"
1610,KORS,"Regional discounter Stein Mart (SMRT), a strong performer of late, was also off its game in November. It posted a 3.1% rise in comps for the month, slightly missing views for a 3.2% rise.

1612,KORS,"Perkins says the November showing overall ""doesn't bode well for the final stretch"" of the holiday season — it suggests the holiday period will be weaker than expected.
"
1613,KORS,"A Warmer View
"
1614,KORS,"Despite the soft November showing, Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, remains optimistic and is sticking to his November-December holiday forecast.
"
1615,KORS,"""I know it's a very competitive environment for retailers and consumers are very cautious,"" he said. ""But the economics behind all this is improving and, consequently, I remain optimistic we'll see the kind of performance industrywide we had anticipated.""
"
1616,KORS,"The economic factors he refers to include a ""strong"" GDP report on Thursday.
"
1617,KORS,"Niemira forecasts a gain of 3.4% vs. a year ago in GAFO (general merchandise, apparel and accessories, furniture and other) sales for November-December. That would compare with last year's 3% increase, he says. Niemira calculates November comps for the 12 monthly reporting retailers he tracks came in up 2.1% vs. a year ag o.
"
1618,KORS,"He expects December same-store sales growth to come in at 3% to 4%, and says that's conservative and may come in stronger — as this year Cyber Monday sales will be pushed into December while last year that online shopping frenzy occurred in November.
"
1619,KORS,"""Cyber Monday would give an even larger lift to December's sales,"" Niemira said.
"
1620,KORS,"November's soft showing, Niemira says, raises some questions. One is: ""How representative of the broader industry were the results, especially given the 10.1% gain in November same-store sales J.C. Penney (JCP) reported,"" he said. ""Is J.C. Penney taking market share from other retailers?""
"
1621,KORS,"Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research at Thomson Reuters, has concerns about the holiday shopping season, given November's soft results.
"
1622,KORS,"""November same-store sales are very worrisome,"" she said. ""They suggest that consumers are procrastinating and waiting for last-minute deals. They believe that as they approach the holiday the deals will get better. That doesn't bode well for retailers. It's a very promotional environment, and that means they will have to continue to do so.""
"
1623,KORS,"Old Stock For New Year
"
1624,KORS,"Another concern for Martis: Thursday's revised GDP number ""suggests retailers have high inventory levels,"" she says, which ""speaks to discounting going into January."" So when January arrives and consumers use their gift cards, she adds, they'll do so to buy discounted items vs. full-price items, which might hurt the bottom line.
"
1625,KORS,"Thomson Reuters analysts have lowered their November-through-January comp expectation to 1.7% from their month-old 1.8% view. That would be slightly higher than last year's 1.6% rise in comps for the quarter but still below the ""healthy"" level of a 3% gain, Martis says.
"
1626,KORS,"Luxury and generally higher-end retailers will fare better over the holiday season, Perkins says. They would include Michael Kors Holdings (KORS) and Tiffany & Co. (TIF), both of which shone in the latest quarter. Off-price retail operators such as TJX Cos. (TJX) andRoss Stores (ROST) should also have a cheery season, Perkins says. Teen apparel retailer and specialty apparel chains, suffering right now, will continue to do so over the holiday.Retailers kicked off the holiday season on a sour note with disappointing November sales gains in reports out Thursday.Deep discounts throughout the month didn't do much to spark a spending spree, a sign that retailers could be in for some tough sledding as they enter the holiday season's home stretch.Sales at stores open at least a year rose 1.9% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. Analysts had forecast a 2.9% gain. That was a sharp deceleration from October's 4% increase.Two of the best-performing retailers over the past five years, Costco Wholesale (COST) and L Brands (LTD), both missed November views. Their results, says Perkins, reflect the tough retail environment that prompted widespread discounting throughout the month, well before the usual Black Friday promotions.""The overall results were very disappointing,"" said Perkins. ""Santa delivered some early coal to retailers during November and during the Thanksgiving/Black Friday holiday weekend. It says that retailers are in for a real dogfight this holiday season.""Deep Discounts In Store?Retailers are going to find it difficult to ""squeeze blood from a stone,"" he adds, given that most consumers don't have excess discretionary dollars to spend.It means that stores will have to offer 50% off or more to get consumers to spend, Perkins says.L Brands cited a late Thanksgiving as a major negative. For November the company reported a sales decrease of 5% from October, its first negative monthly comp since October 2009. Analysts had forecast a 1.2% decrease. The parent of Victoria's Secret indicated that it expects December comps to rise in the low- to mid-single digits, Perkins says.Costco's total company comps, including gasoline sales, were up 2% vs. a year ago, missing views for a 3.5% gain. It was its smallest gain for the giant warehouse club discounter dating back to September 2009. Costco's core U.S. comps, excluding the impact of gasoline sales, came in at a 3% rise, short of forecasts for a 4.5% gain.Perkins says Costco's showing reflects the ""broader consumer caution out there and their unwillingness and inability to open their purse strings.""Regional discounter Stein Mart (SMRT), a strong performer of late, was also off its game in November. It posted a 3.1% rise in comps for the month, slightly missing views for a 3.2% rise.Apparel giant Gap (GPS) gave some cheery news late Thursday when it reported a 2% rise in November comps, well ahead of the 0.7% expected gain.

1680,KORS,"Michael Kors (KORS), Gap (GPS) and L Brands (LTD) drew shoppers as the early Black Friday kickoff and heavier promotions helped drive traffic to brick-and-mortar stores.Many, including Best Buy (BBY), Macy's (M) and Target (TGT), even opened on Thanksgiving Day in an attempt to lure early shoppers with big discounts. And that battle to win customers is likely to continue this month, analysts say.""This year Black Friday gave us a taste of what to expect for the remainder of the holiday selling season: intense competition, deep discounts and choppy mall traffic,"" Sterne Agee analyst Ike Boruchow said in a report.""Earlier store openings drove heavy traffic, which dissipated and then bounced through the day.""Fashion house Michael Kors, which has been a strong performer since its December 2011 stock market debut, enjoyed heavy traffic in its stores.Shares, up 61% this year, were slightly higher in afternoon trading in the stock market today.Other Black Friday traffic winners included L Brands' Victoria's Secret, Gap's Gap brand and Ann's (ANN) Loft.L Brands' Bath & Body Works also saw long lines at the register even in the early morning hours, while Gap's 50% off everything promotion drove traffic to its namesake brand stores, as did Loft's 50% off promo, Boruchow said.Gap shares were up 2% at 41.79, while L Brands was flat and Ann was 1% lower at 35.34.American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), which upped its Black Friday promo to 50% off everything from last year's 40%, also drew in shoppers and rang up sales. That's good news for the ailing teen apparel retailer, which has seen shares fall 19% this year.But Coach's (COH) ""moderate"" traffic and Fossil's (FOSL) ""minimal"" traffic put those retailers among Sterne Agee's Black Friday losers.Overall, most retailers stepped up their discounts this year, with Gap and Old Navy among those with the biggest changes. Boruchow also noted that shoppers flocked to malls starting Thursday evening and into early Friday, tailing off around 3 a.m. before picking up again starting around 10 a.m.Thanksgiving Day traffic rose 27% to nearly 45 million shoppers, and Black Friday traffic increased 3% to over 92 million, according to the National Retail Federation.Despite the pickup in traffic, steep discounts helped consumers keep their spending down a bit. Shoppers spent $407.02 on average over the long holiday weekend, lower than last year's $423.55.

1764,KORS,"Fossil kicked off the year in style with a deal that will likely spark a nice uptick in its business.
"
1765,KORS,"In January, the watch and accessory designer and retailer agreed to buy Skagen Designs, a maker of contemporary Danish-design watches and other accessories, for $225 million and 150,000 shares of stock. Skagen may get more shares if it hits specific revenue targets.
"
1766,KORS,"The buy, expected to close at the end of this month, should enhance Fossil's thriving watch business and expand its broad portfolio of brands and products, say analysts.
"
1767,KORS,"""Skagen should be a nice growth vehicle in that it expands the line and doesn't compete with Fossil's existing watches,"" said Benchmark Co. analyst Ronald Bookbinder. ""The Skagen watch is more of a European or Danish design, which is very different than the typical Fossil-type watch. It's going to appeal to a different customer. Fossil will attract more sales that way.""
"
1768,KORS,"He expects Skagen to add 18 cents to Fossil's 2012 earnings per share.
"
1769,KORS,"Not that Fossil needs a lift. The company has been enjoying a nice run with its current lineup.
"
1770,KORS,"It's logged 10 straight quarters of double-digit sales and earnings growth as it's built its business into an accessory powerhouse, with $2.6 billion in 2011 sales.
"
1771,KORS,"Profitable Brand
"
1772,KORS,"Reno, Nev.-based Skagen, which posted roughly $120 million in 2011 sales, brings a lot to the table.
"
1773,KORS,"Skagen is a ""fast-growing and profitable watch brand"" that has a global presence and is successful in North America, Europe and Asia, noted Fossil CEO Kosta Kartsotis on the fourth-quarter conference call last month. It also operates 13 retail locations around the world.
"
1774,KORS,"And it has a contemporary look, he adds, that's different than any of Fossil's products.
"
1775,KORS,"Management's long-term plan is to build Skagen into an accessory lifestyle brand based on its Danish design heritage.
"
1776,KORS,"""Our objective is to turbocharge this Skagen watch business while supporting it and expanding its distribution,"" he said.
"
1777,KORS,"Fossil gains additional sourcing capabilities from Skagen and a new brand it can build into a larger business with additional categories, stores and websites.
"
1778,KORS,"Brean Murray, Carret & Co. analyst Eric Beder called the buy ""a great tuck-in.""
"
1779,KORS,"It gives Fossil a complementary brand that differs from Fossil's fashion-oriented timepieces.
"
1780,KORS,"He says Skagen should also help expand Fossil's footprint in Japan and provide Fossil with further depth in Europe.
"
1781,KORS,"Fossil's broad array of products includes its extensive line of fashion watches, jewelry, handbags and clothing sold under its propriety and licensed brand names.
"
1782,KORS,"Its proprietary watch brands include Fossil, Relic and MW Michele. It also has licensing pacts with many premium brands, including Michael Kors (KORS), DKNY and Burberry.
"
1783,KORS,"It distributes its products through all sorts of venues, including department stores, specialty watch and jewelry shops in the U.S. and in roughly 120 countries through 22 company-owned foreign sales subsidiaries and through a network of more than 60 independent distributors. It also sells its products via more than 390 of its own retail stores.
"
1784,KORS,"Fossil posted solid fourth-quarter results, thanks to strong sales gains in watches and leather goods. Earnings rose 28% to $1.87 a share, topping views. Revenue grew 18.5% to $830.8 million. But it fell short of the $841 million that Thomson Reuters analysts had expected.
"
1785,KORS,"Overall, same-store sales rose 14.4%.
"
1786,KORS,"For the year, sales of Fossil-branded products came in just shy of $1.2 billion.
"
1787,KORS,"Its multibrand watch business grew to more than $1.8 billion, with both the Michael Kors and the Armani brands exceeding $300 million.
"
1788,KORS,"Management sees a lot of potential in the Michael Kors brand. While most of Fossil's Michael Kors business is still in the U.S., the company has a significant opportunity to expand it to a larger number as the brand is further introduced globally, said Kartsotis on the conference call.
"
1789,KORS,"North American wholesale sales rose 18%, and in Europe they increased 18.5% despite volatile economic conditions.
"
1790,KORS,"Sales Growth
"
1791,KORS,"Overall, the watch business remains strong, says Beder.
"
1792,KORS,"He added it's not as strong as it was when it was ""red hot"" 2-1/2 years ago.
"
1793,KORS,"Still, Fossil estimates overall 2012 sales will grow roughly 15%, which is a ""healthy number,"" he noted.
"
1794,KORS,"He says watches, which account for more than 70% of total sales, will be the key driver of the growth.
"
1795,KORS,"""We're still in a very good watch cycle and a very good cycle for the accessories category overall,"" said Bookbinder.
"
1796,KORS,"Handbags, in particular, have been strong sellers, he says, a trend that has helped lift Fossil's sales. In the fourth quarter, Fossil's leather sales were up 23.7% from the prior year.
"
1797,KORS,"Watchers expect Fossil's business to remain healthy. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2012 earnings to jump 19% to $5.49 a share.

Investors should never let a big gain turn into a loss.Trouble for Ambarella started Wednesday when Needham & Co. downgraded shares to hold from buy on a cautious view on sales from wearable cameras.Medical stocks had a good week, but not Akorn (AKRX). The specialty drugmaker sliced its 10-week moving average in weekly volume that jumped 59% above average, a sell signal. Akorn had been trading above its 10-week since August.The stock was downgraded to market perform from outperform on valuation by Leerink Swann on Wednesday. Akorn's up/down volume ratio has slipped to 0.9 after staying above 1.0 for a number of weeks. Readings below 1.0 signal that sellers are in control.Michael Kors (KORS) had a volatile week after suffering its own downgrade. Citigroup cut shares of the fashion house to neutral from hold Tuesday. It fell below a 78.72 buy point from a flat base early last week, but climbed back above that entry. The stock now faces resistance at its 10-week moving average and the 80 price level.The company's earnings and sales growth rates have decelerated the past two quarters.An analyst downgrade also whacked British chip designer ARM Holdings (ARMH), which erased a 9% gain past a 50.51 buy point from a cup-with-handle base.For the week, the IBD 50 jumped 2.1%, more than double the Nasdaq's 1% gain. The strong weekly performance pushed the Relative Price Strength line of the IBD 50 slightly higher. The line is back near its peak from the week ended Oct. 4.Biotechs and other drugmakers have perked up in recent sessions. Half of the 10 top performers for the week belong to the biotech or drugmaker area.On Friday, Biogen Idec (BIIB) staged an upside reversal and cleared a 298.92 buy point from a flat base in heavy trading.

1858,KORS,"The chart of Michael Kors (KORS) hasn't been so bullish lately, but its action is improving.The stock is having a good week, far outpacing the market and the retail sector. Through Thursday, Michael Kors rallied 10%, which is its best performance since a 23% pop in the week ended Aug. 17. This compares with a 2% gain for the S&P 500 and a 2% rise in the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT).Michael Kors has also outperformed both since the Nov. 23 follow-through day.This week's move put the stock back above its 10-week moving average as a new base forms. However, much of the base has formed below the 10-week line. That makes for a weak pattern, unless the stock can spend more time above the line before it breaks out.Since Michael Kors rose less than 20% from a 49.60 buy point before its last breakout sputtered, the latest pattern is a base on base.The stock has an up-down volume ratio of 1.4, showing that buyers are in control. Last week, it was at 1.2. Three weeks ago, it was at 0.9.The high-end clothing and accessories retailers has delivered solid growth in recent years, despite tough economic times around the globe. Michael Kors' earnings more than quadrupled from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2012, which ended March 31.Last month, Michael Kors easily beat expectations with fiscal Q2 profit that nearly doubled to 49 cents a share. Sales climbed 74% to $532.9 million — the second straight quarter of accelerating growth. The company performed well in Europe, where sales jumped 97%.Analysts see Michael Kors' profit rising 80%, to $1.57 a share, in fiscal 2013. Earnings are slated to grow 30%, to $2.04 a share, in fiscal 2014.

Remember, the first 15 years of a publicly traded stock are often the prime of its life.But the fearsome manner that Michael Kors fell this week makes one believe that prudence may be called for.The only problem with that approach is the buying range from the Aug. 17 breakout only runs as high as 52.08. Michael Kors is already basically at that price.

Analysts forecast sales will rise 36%, also its slowest gain since its IPO.The former ""Project Runway"" judge's namesake company has taken the fashion world by storm. A recent Piper Jaffray survey of teens showed Michael Kors handbags were the second-most preferred by that age group — just behind old guard Coach (COH) — and rapidly taking market share.Kors also will be joining the S&P 500 soon, once Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and NYSE Euronext (NYX) complete their merger, which was expected to close Nov. 4 but was delayed.Wall Street analysts think Jazz Pharma (No. 7) will post a 29% jump in Q3 EPS to $1.67 a share, the Irish company's lowest quarterly growth rate in years.

2017,KORS,"When IBD founder William O'Neil set out to discover the characteristics of winning stocks, his study came back with a resounding conclusion:Outstanding earnings growth in the most recent quarters is the single most important trait that identifies winners before they start their major price advances.The study — which analyzed the fundamentals and stock-price behavior of the best stocks during past bull markets — identified other common factors that exist in the formative stage of a future winner.Ultimately, explosive earnings growth, O'Neil explained, goes hand-in-hand with superior stock performance. Generally speaking, the bigger the earnings growth, the better.Specifically, look for a company's earnings per share up at least 25% vs. the year-ago level in the most recent quarter or two. Gains of 50%, 100% or more are typical of market leaders — before they make their huge price moves.That's the essence of the ""C"" in O'Neil's CAN SLIM investing strategy, which stands for current earnings growth.There's really no mystery about this connection. The most successful companies tend to generate the strongest profit gains, regardless of the economic cycle.Even during periods when corporate profits are weak, you still find standouts that achieve impressive earnings growth.Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR), the name behind the popular single-cup Keurig brewers, posted EPS jumps of 45% and 58% the two latest quarters. Facebook's (FB) earnings soared 58% in Q2 as it leverages its social media service to generate mobile-ad revenue.Michael Kors (KORS), enjoying solid demand for its chic luxury merchandise, reported a 79% EPS rise in its last quarter.Several resources in IBD and Investors.com can help investors find companies with top earnings growth.The best way to get the latest quarterly earnings is to call up a quote on Investors.com. A table displays the company's most recent EPS percentage change plus sales growth, three-year earnings growth rate and other financials.The IBD Stock Checkup , another online tool, also shows the latest quarter's number, with a bonus: the average EPS growth over the past three quarters.MarketSmith, a sister charting and equity research service, includes the EPS for the four most recent periods.For a more comprehensive look at earnings performance, you can use the EPS Rating. The proprietary rating compares a company's two most recent quarters and the three-year profit performance against all stocks. It's listed in the Investors.com quotes and various tables in IBD.The minicharts for IBD 50 in Wednesday's edition are another place to view the most recent EPS and the average percentage gain over the past three quarters.

2048,KORS,"Who Can Spend?
"
2049,KORS,"But the next day, retail industry bellwether Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) posted results that raised concerns about spending by lower- to moderate-income consumers.

2051,KORS,"""The reports from Wal-Mart and Kohl's suggest the low- to moderate-income consumer is still feeling pressured,"" Perkins said. ""It's going to be a barbell effect once again this holiday, with high-end retailers exposed to a higher-end consumer doing far better because their customers have more disposable income to spend on discretionary purchases.""
"
2052,KORS,"Retailers head into the holiday season as worries over jobs, the economy and fiscal policy uncertainty have taken some of the cheer out of holiday gift-buying for many Americans, particularly low- to middle-income consumers.

2054,KORS,"""The holiday will be extremely competitive and very promotional with the potential for a modest upside, given that expectations are low and that gas prices have come down so much and are expected to come down more,"" Perkins said. 
"
2055,KORS,"The lower gas prices are a ""wild card"" in terms of how that will impact spending, he adds. And the savings could be ""significant.""
"
2056,KORS,"The consumer mood is ""cautious,"" adds Michael Niemira, chief economist for the International Council of Shopping Centers.
"
2057,KORS,"""Consumers are not so upbeat,"" he said. ""But you've got to believe that with somewhat better employment, somewhat better economic numbers generally and lower gas prices, consumer confidence will march higher too and support holiday spending.""

2058,KORS,"Holiday Outlook Tallies
"
2059,KORS,"Niemira forecasts a 3.4% gain from a year ago in GAFO (general merchandise, apparel and accessories, furniture and other) sales for November-December. That would be a ""tad"" stronger than last year's 3% increase, he says.

2060,KORS,"""For sales to be spectacular this holiday, it all depends on consumer sentiment, which now is rocky,"" said Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research for Thomson Reuters. ""Consumers are very concerned about the government's leadership ability and job security. If they feel their jobs are being threatened, they're going to hold back on spending.""
"
2061,KORS,"Analysts expect that the retail industry will see a 4% gain in fourth-quarter earnings from a year ago, according to Retail Metrics. For most chains, the fourth quarter runs November through January.
"
2062,KORS,"The forecast compares against an 8.2% gain in fourth-quarter earnings in 2012, Perkins says. But, he adds, then the industry was up against the easy comparison underlying a 2.5% rise in 2011.
"
2063,KORS,"The home furnishings segment and entertainment segments of retailing are expected to see the biggest gain in fourth-quarter earnings with a 13% rise for each, Perkins says. Both are projected to see the biggest sales increases among the categories, each with an 8% rise.
"
2064,KORS,"The home furnishings niche has stores like high-end Restoration Hardware Holdings (RH) plus Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and Haverty.

2066,KORS,"These players are benefiting from the housing recovery and rising home prices that have spurred consumers to spruce up with new furniture and home decor.

"
2068,KORS,"Home improvement chains such as Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's Cos. (LOW) should fare well, she adds.
"
2069,KORS,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect fourth-quarter same-store sales for the home improvement segment to rise 4% vs. a year earlier, Martis notes. That compares with an estimated 1.9% rise for the industry overall, as of readings on Wednesday, and a 2.4% gain excluding Wal-Mart, she says.
"
2070,KORS,"The entertainment segment includes outdoor retailer Cabela's and sporting goods retailer Big 5 Sporting Goods, both of which are expected to see double-digit earnings gains in the fourth quarter.
"
2071,KORS,"Sporting goods stores are likely spots for holiday buying, as they ""tend to offer what young adults and teens really like,"" with broad offerings of branded apparel and footwear, Perkins says.
"
2072,KORS,"The department store segment should be another top performer this holiday, with an estimated 12% rise in fourth-quarter earnings, Perkins says. The group includes J.C. Penney (JCP), Macy's and Dillard's (DDS).
"
2073,KORS,"""Much of the group's growth is expected to come from J.C. Penney, which is expected to cut last year's huge loss in half this year as it works hard to get back to its roots and discounts aggressively this holiday season,"" Perkins said.
"
2074,KORS,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see J.C. Penney's fourth-quarter earnings rising 54% from a year earlier, while earnings at Macy's are expected to be up 5% and Dillard's is forecast to see a 7% rise.

2075,KORS,"'Wealth Effect' Felt
"
2076,KORS,"""The luxury markets remain strong,"" said Lawrence Creatura, portfolio manager for Federated Investors. ""The more-affluent consumers are feeling a wealth effect from the stock market and other increases in asset value.""
"
2077,KORS,"Among beneficiaries of the more flush high-end consumer's position are retailers such as department store Nordstrom (JWN), Michael Kors, Tiffany and Restoration Hardware, Perkins says.
"
2078,KORS,"""Kors has a brand that's on fire and its fashion has been received extremely well among high-end consumers,"" Perkins said.
"
2079,KORS,"He notes that it's expected to see a 34% increase in fiscal third-quarter earnings, its holiday quarter. Kors holds the No. 32 spot on the current IBD 50 list, a roster of top-rated growth stocks.
"
2080,KORS,"Niemira says the luxury segment has been performing better than the industry overall, and continues to do so. It's been seeing same-store sales growth of 4% year over year in recent months, a rate he sees continuing in the fourth quarter. That would be double the 2% increase in fourth-quarter comps that he projects for the industry.
"
2081,KORS,"Auto parts retailers are expected to see an 11% jump in fourth-quarter earnings, as consumers have revved up spending on new cars and also are sprucing up old ones. The segment includes retailers such as O'Reilly Automotive (ORL) and AutoZone (AZO).
"
2082,KORS,"Hipster and Bohemian-style apparel retailer Urban Outfitters (URBN) is expected to see a 14.5% jump in fourth-quarter comps at its Free People chain, making it the industry's best performer, says Martis.

"
2084,KORS,"Online retailer Amazon.com (AMZN) is expected to be piping hot this holiday season, too. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect it to see a stunning 215.9% surge in fourth-quarter earnings, Martis says.The bets are in that a wide swath of retailers will share the winner's circle in the race to lure consumers this holiday season.If analysts' forecasts are on the money, retailers that cater to the upper-income crowd — such as fashion house and IBD 50 stock Michael Kors Holdings (KORS) and upscale jeweler Tiffany & Co. (TIF) — should keep up the fast pace for the holiday period. So should department stores such as strong third-quarter performerMacy's (M), home furnishings retailers such as Haverty Furniture Cos. (HVT) and sporting goods stores like Cabela's (CAB)and Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV).""It's going to be a bit mixed,"" said Ken Perkins, president of analysis firm Retail Metrics.Third-quarter reports from major retailers in the last few days have given hints of how ""mixed"" the showing may be.Macy's set a high bar, posting third-quarter earnings Wednesday that sailed past views and giving positive commentary on the outlook for the fourth quarter. It's clear from the comments of Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren that Macy's is in ""good shape"" for the holiday, Perkins says.Who Can Spend?But the next day, retail industry bellwether Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) posted results that raised concerns about spending by lower- to moderate-income consumers. The giant discounter beat analysts' earnings forecasts by 1 cent, but missed views on revenue and saw its third consecutive quarterly decline in same-store sales. It also gave a disappointing fourth-quarter earnings outlook that was slightly below consensus.Value-priced department store operator Kohl's (KSS) also reported lackluster third-quarter results Thursday, missing earnings estimates by 5 cents. It cut its fourth-quarter outlook on prospects for softer holiday sales.""The reports from Wal-Mart and Kohl's suggest the low- to moderate-income consumer is still feeling pressured,"" Perkins said. ""It's going to be a barbell effect once again this holiday, with high-end retailers exposed to a higher-end consumer doing far better because their customers have more disposable income to spend on discretionary purchases.""Retailers head into the holiday season as worries over jobs, the economy and fiscal policy uncertainty have taken some of the cheer out of holiday gift-buying for many Americans, particularly low- to middle-income consumers.That's sparked heated competition for a share of holiday spending.""The holiday will be extremely competitive and very promotional with the potential for a modest upside, given that expectations are low and that gas prices have come down so much and are expected to come down more,"" Perkins said. The lower gas prices are a ""wild card"" in terms of how that will impact spending, he adds. And the savings could be ""significant.""The consumer mood is ""cautious,"" adds Michael Niemira, chief economist for the International Council of Shopping Centers.""Consumers are not so upbeat,"" he said. ""But you've got to believe that with somewhat better employment, somewhat better economic numbers generally and lower gas prices, consumer confidence will march higher too and support holiday spending.""Holiday Outlook TalliesNiemira forecasts a 3.4% gain from a year ago in GAFO (general merchandise, apparel and accessories, furniture and other) sales for November-December.

In overturning a lower court's decision, an appeals court disagreed.Krispy Kreme Doughnuts (KKD) crashed 20% in monster volume, piercing well below its 10-day line and leaving in its wake a huge gap. This is Krispy Kreme's third straight loss, and its second with heavy volume.The company's Q3 report (for the three months through October) showed earnings rose 33% to 16 cents, while sales climbed 7% to $114.2 million. Both metrics came up shy of estimates, which had been running at 15 cents on $115 million.Also disheartening, Krispy Kreme guided Q4 earnings in the range of 11 cents to 14 cents. The Street had been looking for 14 cents, the upper end of this band. Even worse, the company's full-year guidance for 2015, 71 cents to 76 cents, was shy of the consensus, which was at 77 cents.

2141,KORS,"Leading growth stocks continue to act well in the market. Many are holding gains nicely after powerful breakouts, and others are still within buying range. Some are setting up for potential moves higher. A market rally needs broad leadership, and there's plenty of it.Actavis (ACT), formerly known as Watson Pharmaceuticals, cleared a flat base last week, rising 6% in strong trade. The generic drug maker is still within range, less than 1% past a buy point of 133.10. The company's second-quarter earnings report last week showed accelerating growth from the first quarter, with profit up 42% from a year ago to $2.01 a share. Sales rose 47% to $1.99 billion.In May, Actavis agreed to acquire Irish drugmaker  Warner-Chilcott (WCRX) for roughly $8.5 billion. The deal will greatly expand Actavis' women's health and urology business, but Actavis will reportedly have to divest some overlapping operations to secure approval from the Federal Trade Commission.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), meanwhile, is working on a cup-with-handle base. After a big run already, it's a late-stage base. After a 27% pullback, Regeneron has climbed to within 6% of its all-time high. Despite recent price strength, its Relative Strength line is lagging. Regeneron's flagship drug, Eylea, is used to treat age-related wet macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly.And Michael Kors (KORS) has been consolidating gains since February. It tried to break out in late May to no avail and settled into another consolidation. The current consolidation could be looked at as a new cup-with-handle pattern with a potential buy point of 65.21, or simply a long handle area in a larger base with a potential entry of 66.28. Either way, it's consolidating gains constructively. Investors will get a look at fiscal Q1 numbers when the company reports Aug. 6 before the open. Profit is seen rising 44% to 49 cents a share, with sales up 38% to $570.8 million.

2142,KORS,"A slew of foreign leaders suddenly are rebounding from their 10-week lines, but volume behavior may not be up to snuff. Three of China's hottest ADRs fell fast to their 10-week lines and rebounded in the past two days. Let's take a closer look.Social-networking site YY (YY) peaked Oct. 3, reversed lower and began a 20% swoon through Tuesday's low. The stock lost ground in three of those four sessions. The worst was Tuesday's 15% crash, which saw YY slice its 10-week line as volume surged 122% above normal.Wednesday's 5% gain spurred 71% higher-than-average volume. YY closed that day virtually on the 10-week line. Thursday saw YY rise 7%, although volume was just average.Fast upside volume is key to a successful rebound, but YY's wasn't as fast as what it recorded on the decline. That's troubling.Real estate info site SouFun Holdings (SFUN) topped out Sept. 10, then retreated as much as 18% through Tuesday's low. Sept. 11 saw the start of a three-day, 16% losing streak. Each session saw ugly-high volume.Two more sessions, Oct. 3 and Oct. 9, saw losses of 8% (on 173% higher volume) and 9% (on 99% higher volume, respectively. Those losses carried more than a whiff of panic.Tuesday's rout brought SouFun to test its 10-week line. The stock on Wednesday rose 7% on 78% higher volume, then gained 8% Thursday on just average volume. Like YY, the rebound sessions aren't drawing the same level of action as the sell-offs.Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU), whose 14-month-old search engine is causing some perspiration at  Baidu's (BIDU) headquarters, followed much the same pattern as that seen in YY and SouFun.Qihoo peaked Sept. 11, then corrected 21% through Wednesday's low. Qihoo's 4% rise Thursday helped it firmly regain its 10-week line.But volume was a touch below average, in line with YY and SouFun's action. At the same time, Tuesday's sell-off saw Qihoo's volume rise 47% above normal — well below the panicky surges seen in YY and SouFun.Are there other stocks that are newly buyable? Yes. Look at fashion house Michael Kors (KORS) (which could use some more upside volume), Russian search engine Yandex (YNDX) and Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX). But keep an eye on volume, which could yet prove to be a problem.

2195,KORS,"For frequent flyers and road warriors, two wheels may not be enough.
"
2196,KORS,"The latest luggage being hauled behind weary business travelers in Heathrow, LaGuardia or LAX is perched up on four wheels. And those bags, of course, are constructed of ballistic-grade nylon, able to stop just about anything a baggage handler could throw at it.
"
2197,KORS,"Tumi (TUMI) is bringing high-tech engineering and product innovation to the staid world of luggage.
"
2198,KORS,"But just because its bags are as sturdy as a bulletproof vest, they don't have to look like one. Tumi is now adding splashes of color to some of its bags and rolling out new fashionable accessories to both ride the rebound in global corporate travel, and lure more women and other new customers.
"
2199,KORS,"""One of the keys to their success has been their ability to broaden their product line and customer base without alienating their core customers,"" said Amy Noblin, an analyst with William Blair & Co.
"
2200,KORS,"Tumi was founded in 1975 by a former Peace Corps volunteer, Charlie Clifford, and named after a ceremonial knife used by the Incas and early culture in pre-colonial Peru. His company originally imported rough leather bags from Latin America. In the early 1980s it developed its signature product lines of black ballistic nylon bags for business travelers and other frequent flyers willing to pay more for high-quality, rugged gear.
"
2201,KORS,"Loyal Following
"
2202,KORS,"It built a loyal following from customers who liked the sturdy designs, and the company's repair work when a zipper or wheel didn't hold up.
"
2203,KORS,"""When something is 'design fixed,' it means that it's ready for production. Our products were never completely design fixed,"" Clifford said in a 2011 interview with Inc. magazine.
"
2204,KORS,"""We'd constantly make changes and tweaks: better handles, more pockets, stronger screws to hold the piece together. We never copied other companies, but we were never afraid to borrow good concepts and then interpret them as our own.""
"
2205,KORS,"London private equity firm Doughty Hanson & Co. bought Tumi for $276 million in 2004. Clifford left the company shortly after.
"
2206,KORS,"Sales have grown at a compounded annual rate of 13% between 2005 and the end of last year. Tumi's bags and other products were on shelves at 1,700 retail locations at the end of last year, up 40% since 2006.
"
2207,KORS,"""They are one of the strongest brands in the global luggage space, which is a market that's growing at a healthy clip and looks to be consolidating,"" said Christian Buss, an analyst with Credit Suisse, which was one of the underwriters of Tumi's April 2012 IPO.
"
2208,KORS,"But investors have given Tumi mixed reviews. Shares surged 47% on its first day, but tumbled soon after.
"
2209,KORS,"Shares have taken several whacks, too, as Doughty Hanson continues to sell its stake with large follow-on offerings in November and in March. The private equity fund still holds 25% of the shares, so more large offerings are possible.
"
2210,KORS,"The risk from secondary offerings isn't unique to Tumi. Fellow high-flying lifestyle brand IPO Michael Kors (KORS) has issued three secondary offerings in the past 16 months, dampening investor enthusiasm.
"
2211,KORS,"But an expanding product line and growing net sales could help the market digest more Tumi offerings.
"
2212,KORS,"The company's travel bags, mostly those wheeled carry-on-sized luggage and soft-sided totes, made up 45% of sales last year. Brief-cases, messenger bags and other business items made up 41%.
"
2213,KORS,"The rest of sales came from its accessories line, launched in 2008. Sales of those wallets, business card holders, sunglasses and other goods were up 46% in the most recent first quarter.
"
2214,KORS,"Now, the company is focusing more on the form of its highly functional bags, in a bid to attract more women. Slightly more than half of its customers are men, it said.
"
2215,KORS,"""The brand heritage is outstanding, and our customers are highly loyal,"" CEO Jerome Griffith said in a May conference call with analysts. ""We believe that these two factors will be crucial in enabling us to successfully expand into new categories while also continuing to create high-quality innovative travel goods for our existing consumers.""
"
2216,KORS,"Hard-Shell Bags
"
2217,KORS,"The company added new colors last quarter to its Tegra-Lite line of lightweight, hard-shell wheeled bags that retail for about $800. It's Ticon line of leather satchels and bags, which sell for up to $1,500, have a pocket with a special lining that shields credit cards, ID cards and other data-chip devices from scanners that crooks can use to steel information.
"
2218,KORS,"Faye Landes, an analyst with Cowen & Co., credits the management team for delivering innovative products.
"
2219,KORS,"""Their level of understanding of their consumer and the analysis that goes into it, and their level of understanding on the product is just terrific,"" Landes said. ""That's what makes this tick. A great management team makes it look easy.""
"
2220,KORS,"But its latest guidance is modest compared with the Street's expectations. The company guided sales growth of 18% to 20%, with diluted earnings per share of between 82 to 86 cents. Analysts collectively expect sales to climb 19.9% to $477.7 million this year, with EPS at 87 cents.
"
2221,KORS,"Travel Industry
"
2222,KORS,"And Tumi's hit turbulence in the past. Sales plummeted after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which devastated the travel industry. The SARS outbreak a few years later also sent ripples through the industry again.
"
2223,KORS,"While Tumi is diversifying with its accessories, the company remains susceptible to travel disruptions.
"
2224,KORS,"There's also strong competition in each of the markets it serves. In its core luggage market, it goes up against well-established brands, including Samsonite International (which reportedly made a bid for Tumi before it came public) and German luggage maker Rimowa. Its expanding accessories business brings it up against leather goods maker Coach (COH), Michael Kors and others.
"
2225,KORS,"Tumi will need to keep an eye on quality control as it expands.
"
2226,KORS,"High-end yoga clothier Lululemon Athletica (LULU) in March spent millions recalling a batch of its stretchy pants, and slashed guidance after noticing the sheer fabric was just a little too revealing.
"
2227,KORS,"But William Blair's Noblin says Tumi hasn't fallen into that trap.
"
2228,KORS,"""They're not trying to do this radically overnight. It's a very controlled evolution of the brand, and I think that has led to their success,"" she said.

2257,KORS,"""Affordable luxury"" fashion house Michael Kors (KORS) started the day by breaking out with wicked volume. But the effort couldn't stick.Michael Kors had built a cup that runs 12 weeks long and 20% deep.The stock triggered its 58.72 buy point right on the opening with a gap-up move. But the stock — a member of the IBD 50 — quickly ducked back under its pivot, and ended the session with a small loss.You must raise your guard when a stock ends below its trigger on its breakout day — and you should be doubly dubious if the stock actually posts a loss, as Michael Kors did.But remember, though many failures look just like this, so too do many ultimately successful breakouts. Maybe the stock is dead. Maybe we're looking at the start of yet another base-building phase. Or maybe Michael Kors will regain the buy point and resume its rally.Sometimes it pays to look at a great stock as a wild bronco trying to throw you off its back.Look at how 3D Systems (DDD) started its torrid run. That stock broke out Nov. 1 at 44.90. It failed by sinking at least 8% from the buy point — twice! You really had to think fast to buy 3D as a rebound from its 10-week line.More about this base: This cup is a base-on-base structure. Michael Kors had burst from a 22-week cup in mid-August, and rose just 16% before falling into the current pattern.As such, the new cup is a first-stage base, just like the prior cup.Michael Kors came public in December 2011 at 20. Many of the market's greatest winners put in their best performances within 15 years of their debut.The tighter, shallower cup is a hint that institutions are still building positions in Michael Kors. Another clue is its up-down volume ratio, which has climbed to 1.9, its highest in months.Michael Kors seems to be striking a niche with its approach to fashion and accessories: Offer a sense of luxury without charging absurd prices.True, Michael Kors' lines include some out-of-this-world prices ($2,500 handbags, $6,000 dresses). But you'll also find a great selection of items without the sticker shock (many dresses and handbags for less than $200).Michael Kors has upped its EPS in the past four quarters by 87%, 133%, 162% and 96%. The consensus looks for a 46% gain in the December-ending period, which will be announced Feb. 12.Sales improved between 58% and 74% in the past four quarters, with acceleration seen in the past two reports.The 74% sales gain in the September-ending quarter was the company's best in years.

"
2344,KORS,"During a recent meeting with Michael Kors CEO John Idol and CFO Joe Parsons, Tunick found that management sounds particularly upbeat over the company's growth potential in Europe, which it sees as a $500 million-or-greater opportunity.
"
2345,KORS,"""Michael Kors' strength in Europe is currently driven by only about 35% brand awareness,"" Tunick noted. ""They believe 50% (brand recognition) represents a true inflection point for the business to take off, suggesting meaningful room ahead.""
"

2386,KORS,"Nordstrom is expected to report Thursday. Analysts see earnings rising 17% to 88 cents per share and sales jumping 9.5% to $3.3 billion.While J.C. Penney's (JCP) largest shareholder, hedge fund manager William Ackman, is demanding a new CEO as soon as possible, a quick change at the top won't stop the overall decline of department stores.Since peaking in 2001, retail sales at department stores have fallen steadily and in June were at the lowest level since 1992, according to Commerce Department data.Meanwhile, nonstore sales, which include online retailers like Amazon (AMZN), took off with the shift to ecommerce and overtook department store sales in 2003. In June, nonstore sales totaled $37.9 billion vs. $14.5 billion at department stores.The Retail-Department Store group is ranked No. 152 out of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks.Saks (SKS) tops the group with Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN) and Dillards (DDS) rounding out the top four.Despite the sector's declining sales, upscale chains are outperforming downscale peers as high-income shoppers haven't felt the squeeze from the recession and favor the perks of shopping at high-end retailers such as personal shoppers.Other stores like Macy's have been more successful by focusing on localization and investing in their stores. Some stores also have higher selections of luxury merchandise like Michael Kors (KORS), Chanel and Dior than online retailers do.But Mary Ross Gilbert, managing director at Imperial Capital, believes that Penney's problems are unique to the chain.""J.C.

2421,KORS,"Fashion designer Michael Kors (KORS) is near a buy point as it sketches a cup-with-handle base.The stock is about 4% below the 65.21 entry as it gets support at its 50-day moving average. The pattern formed next to a previous base and is first-stage, which has a better chance of success than those farther up the scale.Kors, which makes luxury apparel and accessories, possesses almost flawless fundamentals. But the stock has had difficulty making headway after clearing a series of bases formed after its December 2011 initial public offering. It's tripled since then, but most of the gains came in the first three months of trading.Kors said Tuesday that it will announce fiscal Q1 earnings before the market opens on Aug. 6.Wall Street analysts expect a 44% gain from a year earlier to 49 cents a share. That would mark a sharp slowdown from a string of mostly triple-digit gains over the past eight quarters. But it would still be strong growth.Sales are seen rising 38% to $571 million, continuing a long record of solid quarterly revenue growth. It's no surprise, then, that Kors boasts a best-possible 99 Earnings Per Share Rating, tops in the 29-member Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing industry group, which includes fellow IBD 50 stocks Iconix Brand Group (ICON) and PVH (PVH).Yet the stock has barely outperformed the S&P 500 since early 2012. The stock's most recent breakout, over a 62.35 buy point, failed despite strong breakout volume. Kors must overcome some head winds before it can clear the current buy point: The stock has met resistance at 65 since February and its Relative Strength line is lagging, a sign of weakness.Still, Kors is worth keeping an eye on. Institutional sponsorship has increased six straight quarters as Fidelity Magellan and other leading funds increased their holdings. That's backed up by Kors' Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B, which indicates growing demand for the shares.

"
2444,KORS,"There are two keys to Frank Caruso's investment strategy.
"
2445,KORS,"First, the lead manager of $2 billion AllianceBernstein Large Cap Growth directs his team to seek what he calls dynamic gaps.
"
2446,KORS,"Those gaps are big differences between how fast Caruso's team expects a stock's earnings to grow and Wall Street's consensus expectation.
"
2447,KORS,"The second key is where Caruso has his team look for that gap: four to five years out.
"
2448,KORS,"Caruso is adamant about avoiding a focus on the near term.
"
2449,KORS,"This approach had the fund up 32.46% this year through Nov. 30. That topped 78% of its large-cap growth peers, which averaged 29.96%. The S&P 500 was up 29.12%.
"
2450,KORS,"Over the past three years the fund's average annual gain is 18.14% vs. 15.70% for its peer group and 17.73% for the big-cap bogey.
"
2451,KORS,"Caruso, age 57, discussed his investment process with IBD from his office in Manhattan.
"
2452,KORS,"IBD: How does your search for leading stocks differ from other growth investors'?
"
2453,KORS,"Caruso: We think of equities generally (in terms of) a combination of growth and capital returns in the form of dividends and share buybacks, which support the valuations of equities over a long period.
"
2454,KORS,"And we take a long-duration approach to investment opportunities. But most growth investors are dangerously focused on the moment, growth in the short term. We try to exploit this phenomenon where not a lot of analytical work is being done four to five years out.
"
2455,KORS,"IBD: Give me some examples that show how your tack works, please.
"
2456,KORS,"Caruso: In the spring of 2012, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) missed a couple of months of sales estimates and the stock was crushed. It went from about 440 to 230 a share. But our research let us be marginal buyers in that lurch. We were confident in the caliber of management. We bought a distressed stock in a great long-term franchise (between May and July 2012 between 380 and 400). Later, they began to execute and sales improved. (We added to our position) through the beginning of October 2012 at prices between 284 and 330.
"
2457,KORS,"IBD: Is Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) another example? You added a big chunk to your stake a few quarters ago.
"
2458,KORS,"Caruso: They have a great core competency in technologies that are increasingly desired by clients: in the cloud and in mobility. It's been growing in the high teens and low 20s for years. It has no debt, and it has excess cash.
"
2459,KORS,"After putting up a strong quarter, they got caught up in the immigration debate. They rely on a lot of foreign visas to conduct their business. The stock went down about 25% in a heartbeat.
"
2460,KORS,"That was an opportunity for us to reload. In the spring of 2012 we started initiating. The stock broke down into the high 50s (from 78). We met with Cognizant managers for three or four hours, and we left convinced they still had a great business and plan. The stock moved higher. The immigration debate percolated, and we bought in the 60s. Now it's in the 90s.
"
2461,KORS,"IBD: Are you looking for investment opportunities created by the prospect of the Federal Reserve tapering its bond buys?
"
2462,KORS,"Caruso: We don't try to overthink the macro environment. So our marching orders to our analysts are to focus on company fundamentals.
"
2463,KORS,"But when (Fed Chairman Ben) Bernanke started the tapering discussion, after having underperformed the broad market and value in particular the prior 12 to 15 months, growth securities started to do well. So the market response to tapering seems to have catalyzed a shift on the margin to growth stocks.
"
2464,KORS,"IBD: Is that because growth stocks tend to have more foreign exposure?
"
2465,KORS,"Caruso: Yes, growth stocks generally have a little more exposure to foreign earnings growth. And U.S. value stocks have more exposure to, let's say, earnings that are fueled by Federal Reserve stimulus steps. This is speculation on my part, but the discussion regarding tapering might auger well for future growth stock performance.
"
2466,KORS,"IBD: Computer services, software and systems are your largest category of holdings at 12.36% of assets. Why do you expect good things from them?
"
2467,KORS,"Caruso: Cognizant is one, with close to a 4% weighting. The portfolio is built around companies like that and Google (GOOG). We think of Priceline (PCLN) as a service company. Some people think of it as a technology company.
"
2468,KORS,"Ansys (ANSS) is an engineering simulation software company. People think of this as a company that benefits from innovation.
"
2469,KORS,"In the old days, you had a team of engineers design a new product, build mockups, then software would run calculations that tested stress characteristics. It was on the tail end of the innovation. And it might take weeks to run those simulations.
"
2470,KORS,"Today you can run millions of simulations before you even get to the real engineering side of things.
"
2471,KORS,"IBD: Biotech is your second-largest industry group, with 5.45% of assets. Why are you focused there?
"
2472,KORS,"Caruso: Biotech came out of a very long, severe stock price underperformance. Now we're seeing far greater pipeline productivity emerging from a couple of leaders. We've centered our investments on Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead (GILD). Each is in a different area of disease management.
"
2473,KORS,"Biogen has been mostly a multiple sclerosis story. They've come to market with a new oral medicine called Tecfidera, which has experienced one of the most unbelievably successful product launches in pharmacology history. But (investors) have been so focused on MS that they haven't paid attention to some of the products that are in development.
"
2474,KORS,"There is a hemophilia product (Eloctate) that we expect to launch in mid-next year. It has the opportunity to take share from Baxter (BAX) and drive growth. And there's upside left for Tecfidera for a long time to come.
"
2475,KORS,"Gilead is basically an HIV and hepatitis C story. It has new product launches on the horizon. We expect Gilead to remain dominant in HIV in the near- to midterm. Their hepatitis C portfolio is starting to contribute meaningfully to corporate growth.
"
2476,KORS,"Celgene is a multiple myeloma story, a cancer story. We see expanding use of the marketplace.
"
2477,KORS,"All of these companies were coming off of pretty conservative valuations for the kind of growth we envision them experiencing for the next couple of years.
"
2478,KORS,"IBD: Why did you trim your Facebook (FB) stake recently? You could not have foreseen the pullback that began in mid-October.
"
2479,KORS,"Caruso: The stock had an amazing run after reporting Q2 earnings. They demonstrated great acceleration in their mobility business, which people got excited about. The stock doubled in a short time.
"
2480,KORS,"We made a meaningful reduction in exposure in that euphoria. It had become close to 3% of the portfolio. So we cut our position roughly in half. It is roughly 1.5% today.
"
2481,KORS,"Their 20% fall? The stock had gone up the day they reported earnings. Then management talked about the need to spend more on investing in people and their product. A lot of highly valued, high-growth companies have seen similar price corrections.
"
2482,KORS,"I'm comfortable owning the stock. At the right price, we're getting back in.
"
2483,KORS,"IBD: Michael Kors (KORS) is relatively new for you. Are you concerned that earnings-per-share growth has sharply decelerated in recent quarters?
"
2484,KORS,"Caruso: We're always concerned about decelerating growth rates. But Kors' decline is to a less-than-extraordinary level. That's still better than a lot of companies. The stock is reasonably valued for the kind of growth we envision. They have opportunities in Europe and elsewhere overseas. Kors is seen as differentiated here and overseas.
"
2485,KORS,"IBD: Any surprise to Starbucks' (SBUX) accelerating EPS growth?
"
2486,KORS,"Caruso: No. They're just an unbelievable company. They're one of the few that has been able to consistently reinvent themselves. They've done a brilliant job of expanding their product offerings in small footprint stores, in being first to market in using new technologies to connect to their customers and their rewards programs are best in their class.
"
2487,KORS,"IBD: Precision Castparts (PCP) is up this year, but you've done some trimming. What are your concerns?
"
2488,KORS,"Caruso: They are persistent in acquiring businesses that let them leverage their own infrastructure. And they're an important supplier to Boeing (BA) on the 787. They generate about $10 million of content on every 787 that Boeing ships. Part of our reduction is that we own both companies. If we sell, it probably will be out of Boeing. Precision has lagged Boeing, so Precision has more upside.
"
2489,KORS,"IBD: Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is way down this year. Yet you've added to your position in some recent quarters. Are you still optimistic?
"
2490,KORS,"Caruso: This has been the most disappointing stock in the portfolio in 2013. The interest we had was centered on the uniqueness of their business. There are no competitors at their scale. Robotic surgery is here to stay and will continue to grow.
"
2491,KORS,"Procedure growth continues to expand at a midteen clip year over year. The issue with execution relates to installation sales, which has slowed, especially in the U.S.
"
2492,KORS,"We expect a couple more tough quarters. Procedure growth will continue in the 16% area. There's no competition. Unbelievably high margins, big share buyback, no debt. Hopefully, it will be a contrary growth stock that recovers.
"
2493,KORS,"IBD: Are you concerned that LinkedIn's (LNKD) EPS growth has slowed for two quarters?
"
2494,KORS,"Caruso: They've brought a new (advertising product for mobile devices) to market. It will help their growth rate re-accelerate into next year. Like we did with Facebook, we made decent sales in the summer on the market euphoria around this stock. We're more interested in finding a price to re-engage LinkedIn than Facebook.
"
2495,KORS,"We think of it as a core holding, a business that's tough to replicate due to their network effect and LinkedIn managers who think of this as a business and want it to be profitable. It's a good business that is richly valued. It will grow into that. So getting the entry and trim points right is important.
"
2496,KORS,"IBD: Noble Energy's (NBL) EPS growth has soared the past two quarters. But tumbling crude oil prices have doused energy producer stocks' spark lately. This stock has pulled back about 10% since Oct. 30. Why stick with it?
"
2497,KORS,"Caruso: Noble is one of the best-positioned energy companies by way of its fracking inventory. Overseas — in Israel and Africa — they have unbelievable reserves. And they are really good operators, really focused on creating value.
"
2498,KORS,"Energy firms are more volatile than what we typically engage, but this company's assets are special.
"
2499,KORS,"We've seen a reduction in underlying commodity prices, so we would welcome an opportunity to buy some of this back, make it larger in the portfolio. It's not quite at a point where we would start buying it back.
"
2500,KORS,"IBD: What's the biggest change you've made since taking this fund's helm in February 2012?
"
2501,KORS,"Caruso: Basically, our perception of growth is linked to a company's ability to create long-term value. So our focus is further forward than many other investors' focus is. It's more on the economics of business and profitability than on the hunt for earnings growth, which is sometimes very episodic. We're still looking for opportunities in large-cap growth. But we're focused on the longer term.
"
2502,KORS,"IBD: What was the fund's prior time horizon?
"
2503,KORS,"Caruso: I can't say, but it was probably more consistent with most growth managers'. Annual turnover in growth portfolios is often 100% to 150%. We're trying to do closer to 50%. We want great franchises that have the ability to win over a very long time. I tell my analysts I want them to understand how companies are competitively differentiated. I don't want them spending their time trying to anticipate when a bad business is a good stock.There are two keys to Frank Caruso's investment strategy.First, the lead manager of $2 billion AllianceBernstein Large Cap Growth directs his team to seek what he calls dynamic gaps.Those gaps are big differences between how fast Caruso's team expects a stock's earnings to grow and Wall Street's consensus expectation.The second key is where Caruso has his team look for that gap: four to five years out.Caruso is adamant about avoiding a focus on the near term.This approach had the fund up 32.46% this year through Nov. 30. That topped 78% of its large-cap growth peers, which averaged 29.96%. The S&P 500 was up 29.12%.Over the past three years the fund's average annual gain is 18.14% vs. 15.70% for its peer group and 17.73% for the big-cap bogey.Caruso, age 57, discussed his investment process with IBD from his office in Manhattan.IBD: How does your search for leading stocks differ from other growth investors'?Caruso: We think of equities generally (in terms of) a combination of growth and capital returns in the form of dividends and share buybacks, which support the valuations of equities over a long period.And we take a long-duration approach to investment opportunities. But most growth investors are dangerously focused on the moment, growth in the short term. We try to exploit this phenomenon where not a lot of analytical work is being done four to five years out.IBD: Give me some examples that show how your tack works, please.Caruso: In the spring of 2012, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) missed a couple of months of sales estimates and the stock was crushed. It went from about 440 to 230 a share. But our research let us be marginal buyers in that lurch. We were confident in the caliber of management. We bought a distressed stock in a great long-term franchise (between May and July 2012 between 380 and 400). Later, they began to execute and sales improved. (We added to our position) through the beginning of October 2012 at prices between 284 and 330.IBD: Is Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) another example? You added a big chunk to your stake a few quarters ago.Caruso: They have a great core competency in technologies that are increasingly desired by clients: in the cloud and in mobility. It's been growing in the high teens and low 20s for years. It has no debt, and it has excess cash.After putting up a strong quarter, they got caught up in the immigration debate. They rely on a lot of foreign visas to conduct their business. The stock went down about 25% in a heartbeat.That was an opportunity for us to reload. In the spring of 2012 we started initiating. The stock broke down into the high 50s (from 78). We met with Cognizant managers for three or four hours, and we left convinced they still had a great business and plan. The stock moved higher. The immigration debate percolated, and we bought in the 60s. Now it's in the 90s.IBD: Are you looking for investment opportunities created by the prospect of the Federal Reserve tapering its bond buys?Caruso: We don't try to overthink the macro environment. So our marching orders to our analysts are to focus on company fundamentals.But when (Fed Chairman Ben) Bernanke started the tapering discussion, after having underperformed the broad market and value in particular the prior 12 to 15 months, growth securities started to do well. So the market response to tapering seems to have catalyzed a shift on the margin to growth stocks.IBD: Is that because growth stocks tend to have more foreign exposure?Caruso: Yes, growth stocks generally have a little more exposure to foreign earnings growth. And U.S. value stocks have more exposure to, let's say, earnings that are fueled by Federal Reserve stimulus steps. This is speculation on my part, but the discussion regarding tapering might auger well for future growth stock performance.IBD: Computer services, software and systems are your largest category of holdings at 12.36% of assets. Why do you expect good things from them?Caruso: Cognizant is one, with close to a 4% weighting. The portfolio is built around companies like that and Google (GOOG). We think of Priceline (PCLN) as a service company. Some people think of it as a technology company.Ansys (ANSS) is an engineering simulation software company. People think of this as a company that benefits from innovation.In the old days, you had a team of engineers design a new product, build mockups, then software would run calculations that tested stress characteristics. It was on the tail end of the innovation. And it might take weeks to run those simulations.Today you can run millions of simulations before you even get to the real engineering side of things.IBD: Biotech is your second-largest industry group, with 5.45% of assets. Why are you focused there?Caruso: Biotech came out of a very long, severe stock price underperformance. Now we're seeing far greater pipeline productivity emerging from a couple of leaders. We've centered our investments on Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead (GILD). Each is in a different area of disease management.Biogen has been mostly a multiple sclerosis story. They've come to market with a new oral medicine called Tecfidera, which has experienced one of the most unbelievably successful product launches in pharmacology history. But (investors) have been so focused on MS that they haven't paid attention to some of the products that are in development.There is a hemophilia product (Eloctate) that we expect to launch in mid-next year. It has the opportunity to take share from Baxter (BAX) and drive growth. And there's upside left for Tecfidera for a long time to come.Gilead is basically an HIV and hepatitis C story. It has new product launches on the horizon. We expect Gilead to remain dominant in HIV in the near- to midterm. Their hepatitis C portfolio is starting to contribute meaningfully to corporate growth.Celgene is a multiple myeloma story, a cancer story. We see expanding use of the marketplace.All of these companies were coming off of pretty conservative valuations for the kind of growth we envision them experiencing for the next couple of years.IBD: Why did you trim your Facebook (FB) stake recently? You could not have foreseen the pullback that began in mid-October.Caruso: The stock had an amazing run after reporting Q2 earnings. They demonstrated great acceleration in their mobility business, which people got excited about. The stock doubled in a short time.We made a meaningful reduction in exposure in that euphoria. It had become close to 3% of the portfolio. So we cut our position roughly in half. It is roughly 1.5% today.Their 20% fall? The stock had gone up the day they reported earnings. Then management talked about the need to spend more on investing in people and their product. A lot of highly valued, high-growth companies have seen similar price corrections.I'm comfortable owning the stock. At the right price, we're getting back in.IBD: Michael Kors (KORS) is relatively new for you. Are you concerned that earnings-per-share growth has sharply decelerated in recent quarters?Caruso: We're always concerned about decelerating growth rates. But Kors' decline is to a less-than-extraordinary level. That's still better than a lot of companies. The stock is reasonably valued for the kind of growth we envision. They have opportunities in Europe and elsewhere overseas. Kors is seen as differentiated here and overseas.IBD: Any surprise to Starbucks' (SBUX) accelerating EPS growth?Caruso: No. They're just an unbelievable company. They're one of the few that has been able to consistently reinvent themselves. They've done a brilliant job of expanding their product offerings in small footprint stores, in being first to market in using new technologies to connect to their customers and their rewards programs are best in their class.IBD: Precision Castparts (PCP) is up this year, but you've done some trimming. What are your concerns?Caruso: They are persistent in acquiring businesses that let them leverage their own infrastructure. And they're an important supplier to Boeing (BA) on the 787. They generate about $10 million of content on every 787 that Boeing ships. Part of our reduction is that we own both companies. If we sell, it probably will be out of Boeing. Precision has lagged Boeing, so Precision has more upside.IBD: Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is way down this year. Yet you've added to your position in some recent quarters.

"
2626,KORS,"Chipmaker InvenSense (INVN) and fashion retailer Michael Kors (KORS) entered the Spotlight on Friday after more than doubling in value since their IPOs late last year.Neither stock is near a buy point, so investors should watch for them to form proper bases before taking a crack at these two promising companies. Google (GOOG) similarly jumped after its 2004 IPO before offering a valid buy point that allowed patient investors to rack up big returns.Hong Kong-based Michael Kors — named after the fashion designer and ""Project Runway"" judge who founded the company — sells high-end apparel and accessories. Sales have risen at least 45% from year-ago levels in each of the past eight quarters. But profit growth, while strong, is seen slowing in Q4 for a third straight quarter to 44%.The stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A, pointing to robust demand for the shares. Its Relative Price Strength Rating is a best-possible 99.Michael Kors' apparel-clothing manufacturing group was ranked a decent No. 52 out of 197 as of Friday. After Friday's close, the company filed a plan to sell 25 million shares. It has 191 million outstanding and a float of 103 million.InvenSense is 49% beyond an 11.95 buy point from its IPO base. It's also out of range from a secondary buy point created when it bounced off its 10-week line near 15.25. Buying a stock that's more than 5% above its buy point is risky because the investor could get shaken out by a pullback.Profit at InvenSense, which makes motion-sensing integrated circuits for video game consoles, smartphones, tablets and TVs, more than doubled in the fourth quarter from a year ago on a 52% jump in sales. Both figures beat expectations. Profit for the March quarter is seen soaring 133%.Like Michael Kors, InvenSense is a strong stock in a decent-performing industry group. Fabless semiconductors rank No. 57.

2759,KORS,"Stocks can react violently to Fed policy announcements, like the one coming Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. A slew of U.S.-traded quality foreign stocks and ADRs are near buy points. Let's look at a few.
"
2760,KORS,"Michael Kors (KORS) isn't making it easy. The stock's breakout from its 62.35 cup-with-handle on May 22 failed, falling 7% before finding its legs. By then, one assumes that prudent longs from that breakout unloaded under the 7%-8% sell rule.
"
2761,KORS,"But Michael Kors found support at its 10-week moving average — twice, with a push to a new high and a retreat in between.
"
2762,KORS,"One could see Michael Kors as a rebound from the 10-week line, but the stock has shown no upside volume since its most recent test, June 13. (Although that session saw a high-volume upside reversal, Michael Kors didn't make it into positive territory.)
"
2763,KORS,"What to look for? A high-volume reclaiming of the original 62.35 buy point, although with the stock so near that spot, it likely will look the same as a high-volume rebound.
"
2764,KORS,"We note that Michael Kors' executive brain trust has issued three secondary offerings since March 2012. It seems every time the stock gets going, the company issues a new supply.
"
2765,KORS,"Taiwanese chip designer ChipMos Technologies (IMOS) on June 11 looked like it was breaking out of a four-weeks-tight add-on point. But the stock reversed lower wildly from a 6% gain, turning that into a loss of as much as 4% before ending the day off a few pennies.
"
2766,KORS,"By ending within the parameters of the four-weeks-tight, ChipMos kept that pattern alive.
"
2767,KORS,"The stock has climbed as much as 3% from its 18.91 buy point, but so far volume has been a no-show. That could change quickly.
"
2768,KORS,"The four-weeks-tight appears after a long, too-deep cup that showed a breakout above 16.30. That flawed structure offered a high-risk entry, but the four-weeks-tight is far more attractive.
"
2769,KORS,"Yandex (YNDX), Russia's dominant Web search engine, stands 6% above its 26.07 entry from an awkward and asymmetrical cup.
"
2770,KORS,"But Yandex is now in its fifth week of a base-on-base effort, which would be a first-stage structure. And if that doesn't pan out, the stock also offers an entry as a rebound from its 10-week line. Either development would be more attractive than the flawed cup.

2797,KORS,"Despite three distribution days for the Nasdaq in less than two weeks, it's hard to get too down on this market when the tech-laden index sits just 1% off its recent high.Some market leaders are facing selling pressure, but a quick scan of the IBD 50 shows just a handful of names below their 10-week moving averages — not indicative of a market that's in trouble.Still, some leaders are showing chinks in their armor. Recent IBD 50 names like Ocwen Financial (OCN), Celgene (CELG) and Herbalife (HLF) have fallen below their 10-week lines. Other big leaders like LinkedIn (LNKD) and Tesla Motors (TSLA) are in the same boat.There are times when the IBD 50 is fertile ground for buying opportunities. It's not the case now, but that doesn't mean you should stop paying attention to the list. In fact, its makeup should be monitored closely in coming weeks. If the market uptrend stays on course, alternate entry points could be seen in names holding gains after recent breakouts. If the market weakens from here, the list will reveal stocks showing resilience — good watch-list candidates for down the line.It's not easy finding buying opportunities if you've got money to put to work. The market landscape is filled with extended stocks and base breakouts remain few and far between. The problem with buying base breakouts now, infrequent as they are, is that there's always the risk you're buying a laggard breakout that could end up rolling over in no time.Spirit Airlines (SAVE) is one of the exceptions. Despite a volatile day of price action on Oct. 30, the discount airline continues to hold up well after a recent base breakout. The stock gapped up out of a cup-with-handle base on Oct. 11.Other IBD 50 names still in buying range include TripAdvisor (TRIP). The online travel firm recently cleared a 79.99 entry. As of Friday's close, it was 4% above the buy point. TripAdvisor recently reported a 2% decline in quarterly earning per share, but did report its fourth straight quarter of 20%-plus year-over-year sales growth.Meanwhile, Stratasys (SSYS) extended gains for the fourth straight session Friday. It's now 4% above a buy point of 113.04, but it's a low-volume breakout so far from a late-stage base. Stratasys, a maker of three-dimensional prototyping systems, reports earnings on Thursday.

Today's Screen Of The Day looks at Young Guns — a collection of stocks that went public in the last 15 years, with excellent fundamentals and IBD Composite Ratings.This batch also has some notable foreign-born stocks that are burning up U.S. markets, including the fashion house giant Michael Kors (KORS) and chip giant ARM Holdings (ARMH).But first up among the imports is SodaStream International (SODA), the Israeli company that makes a kitchen countertop appliance to make sodas and other carbonated beverages at home. The company, with a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, made a splash during Sunday's Super Bowl with a commercial touting the wasted plastic soda bottles that its system could replace.SodaStream shares had a strong run from mid-November to late January. But since then the stock has fallen 10.5%, suffering several high-volume selling days. Shares were up fractionally Tuesday to 48.34.Kors, which reports its fiscal Q2 on Feb. 12, has a 98 Composite Rating.The Hong Kong-based fashion house hit a new high on Jan. 28, but reversed, beginning a six-session string of losses. The stock tested its 50-day line on Tuesday, but rebounded to close up almost 1% at 55.38.ARM, with a 97 Composite Rating, designs high-performance, low-power chips used in Apple's (AAPL) iPad and iPhones — but in most other advanced mobile devices, too. And it's moving into PC and server fields, taking on long-dominant Intel (INTC).So even though Apple shares have plunged over the last several months, ARM has muscled higher.The U.K.-based stock rose 4% Tuesday to its best level since March 2000 after the company reported better-than-expected Q4 earnings and sales and offered strong guidance for the current quarter.New Jersey, where Cognizant Technologies Solutions (CTSH) calls home, isn't foreign land. But the IT outsourcing firm does much of its work in India — where skilled software developers and engineers can do coding and testing for U.S. customers at about half the cost of America-based teams.Cognizant jumped 5% on Jan. 11 to a 52-week high after rival outsourcer Infosys (INFY) posted better-than-expected earnings and offered an upbeat sales forecast. Cognizant shares have mostly moved sideways since.Cognizant shares climbed 0.7% Tuesday to 78.34. It reports Q4 results on Thursday.Related:Netflix Leads Top 5 Techs Smashing Profit ForecastsIBD 50: Michael Kors, ARM Lead Top 5 Big-Cap StocksOracle Leads 4 Top Tech Stocks With Bolting RS Lines

Trading has tightened up somewhat in recent weeks, but the overall pattern shows wide swings and accumulation is lacking. The stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is D-, below the neutral C and an indication that institutional investors are net sellers of the shares.Michael Kors has fallen below its 62.35 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. Yet so far, the fashion designer's decline has been fairly modest, coming in weak volume.

The cup corrected just 21%, the handle a scant 4%.Volume dried up as the stock built its right side. A little more action during this period would have made for a nicer picture.

2968,KORS,"Relative strength is a good thing to consider in any market.The RS line shows how a stock is doing vs. the S&P 500. A rising line means a stock is either gaining more or losing less than the index.One group showing strength is apparel manufacturers. Six stocks in the Apparel-Clothing Manufacturers group have Composite Ratings of 93 or better.RS lines are at or near 52-week highs for five of the six stocks. Two appeared in Thursday's Stock Spotlight screen — Michael Kors Holdings (KORS) and G-III Apparel (GIII).Why should apparel stocks be doing well in this sluggish economy? Last year, U.S. apparel consumption by volume fell 5.3%, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association.Despite the drop in volume, value of sales grew 4.9% at the retail level. Part of that was because of price increases. However, the ApparelStats 2012 report also pointed out that consumers are ""returning to purchases of apparel at higher price-points.""That's good news for Michael Kors, a luxury play with the highest pretax margin (21%) among the top-rated apparel stocks. The others have margins that range from 6% to 13%.A December IPO, Michael Kors also has the best return on equity. ROE is 56%, despite a debt-to-equity ratio of 0%. (Debt can inflate the ROE number.)The stock is working on a flat base with a 57.45 buy point.G-III Apparel has brands that include Levi's, Guess and Kenneth Cole. The stock recently bounced off its 50-day moving average, but earnings have been erratic.In August, the company bought Vilebrequin, a maker of luxury swimwear and resort wear with 185 retail stores.

LinkedIn has been consolidating gains for nearly six weeks, but it'll have to build the right side of a base before a new buy point emerges. Its 50-day moving average around 178 is a potential resistance level.Elsewhere, shares of Yandex (YNDX) rallied 0.8% to 26.19 in below-average volume. It's pulled back constructively to an earlier buy point of 26.07, although the initial breakout was from an unconventional base. Normally, low-volume pullbacks to prior buy points are buyable, but with the market uptrend under pressure, new buys should generally be avoided.Meanwhile, shares of 3D Systems (DDD) got a lift, rising 6% to 45.87 in light volume, after industry group peer and fellow three-dimensional firm ExOne (XONE) got a buy rating from Canaccord Genuity and a 12-month price target of 55. 3D Systems' recently tried to break out from a fourth-stage base to no avail. It's now 5% below a buy point of 48.11.Michael Kors (KORS) also outperformed, rising 1% to 61.93 in soft turnover. Its weekly chart looks a lot better than 3D Systems', mainly because of tighter trading but also because Kors' recent breakout was from an earlier-stage base.

2998,KORS,"The more characteristics of high quality a stock has, the better its chance of being a market winner.Of course, the more you demand from a stock, the fewer that may be suitable for purchase.We recently ran a screen of stocks that match IBD's 20 Rules For Your Investment Success. The results were more than limited: Not one stock met the grade.That doesn't mean you should forget about stock investing and seek returns elsewhere.The truth is, stocks can fall short in one or two areas but still become successful investments. They must be purchased and sold properly and when the market is strong.The key point: It's the degree of drawbacks that come up in a stock's analysis that has to be weighed. While there may be no such thing as a perfect stock, investors are always better off going with the stocks with the fewest blemishes.Suppose you scan through the IBD 50 for stock ideas. The first layer of the selection process might be those companies with the best profit and sales growth, leaving aside those with lesser numbers. The next layer could be the chart, focusing on those leaders forming smooth bases.As the research process goes deeper, more imperfections come up. Ultimately, an investor must decide which flaws are acceptable.Research into the company's markets and financial outlook can help make those final decisions. For example, a trend of single-digit sales gains could be normal for the company's industry. A slow economic recovery may be depressing sales growth.Don't expect a computer screen to make all those decisions for you. Critical thinking, knowledge and experience are key.Here are three case studies of successful stocks and their flaws:Stratasys (SSYS). An investor studying the stock in April 2012 would have noticed the company's annual return on equity was 13%, below the 17% minimum for winning stocks. It was thinly traded — just 201,000 shares a day on average.But Stratasys' sales, earnings and margins were superb. The stock broke out April 16 and soared 120% to its January peak of 92.30.Michael Kors (KORS). The luxury clothing and accessories house went public in December 2011 boasting excellent financials.A two-week correction was too short to be considered a proper base, even as an IPO base. But the light-volume decline marked reluctance by shareholders to sell. Kors crossed 27.68 and nearly doubled in a seven-week run.Lumber Liquidators (LL). In April 2012, the flooring products chain had some solid earnings gains but sales growth increased no more than 18% for several quarters. Return on equity and margins weren't so great, either.But the company was benefiting from the housing market's recovery. A breakout April 26 led to a 130% gain until an October top.

""Brand awareness is trending younger; the 18- to 24-year-old demographic is now the highest awareness group. This positions them well for future growth.""For many fashion brands, it's hard enough establishing success in one distribution channel, be it retail, wholesale or licensing.Michael Kors Holdings (KORS) is out to prove it can find success in all three at the same time.Michael Kors is a global accessories, footwear and apparel company. Most of its business, about 75%, comes from accessories such as handbags, small leather goods, eyewear, jewelry, watches and footwear.At the close of its fiscal first quarter, which ended in June, the company operated 253 of its own retail stores and licensed another 68 stores to partners. It also operates wholesale and licensing segments.All of these channels have produced robust growth in recent quarters, no mean feat, analysts say, considering the volatile nature of the fashion industry as well as the sluggish economy.""Among a specialty retail landscape that is desperate for growth, Michael Kors represents a highly compelling longer-term footage growth story,"" JPMorgan analyst Brian Tunick said in a report earlier this month. ""The company is in the enviable position of being able to drive growth across all of its distribution channels and geographic regions for the foreseeable future.""Kors operates in the luxury end of the fashion and retail sector, along with companies such as Coach (COH), Ralph Lauren (RL) and Donna Karan International.Its founder, Michael Kors, has built a reputation for fashion-forward designs, though he's probably best known to most folks as a judge on the ""Project Runway"" television series.The company's products feature ""innovative designs, materials and craftsmanship with a jet-set aesthetic that aims to combine stylish elegance and a sporty attitude,"" said Citigroup analyst Oliver Chen.Fashionistas aren't the only ones who've taken a liking to Michael Kors Holdings. It also has earned high marks from Wall Street.Financially, Michael Kors has consistently topped analyst expectations since going public last December.During its first three quarters as a publicly traded company, Michael Kors has grown earnings at least 87% and sales at least 58%.Chen reckons Michael Kors can grow its annual sales in Europe to $550 million, up from $109 million in fiscal 2012. The company also targets bigger sales in Japan.""Michael Kors has accelerating awareness in targeted international markets,"" Chen noted. ""(The company) has a long growth runway given its low saturation.""He projects 25% annual growth in the number of Michael Kors stores over the next few years, with a potential for 600 stores.Meanwhile, the company's long-term wholesale revenue growth should exceed 20% a year based on new or enlarged shop-in-shops in the U.S. and Europe. ""Shop-in-shop"" refers to areas within department stores that are devoted to Michael Kors products.Business has been so brisk at Michael Kors that the company recently raised its guidance for its fiscal second quarter, which ended in September.Management now expects earnings in the range of 38 cents to 40 cents a share vs. earlier guidance of 33 cents to 35 cents. It expects sales of $510 million to $520 million, up from previous guidance of $490 million to $500 million. The company raised its retail same-store sales growth to 45% vs. prior guidance for a 30% increase.It is due to report Q2 earnings on Nov. 13.""Following its updated outlook, Michael Kors has now posted 26 straight quarters of positive comps and 10 straight quarters of 35%-plus comps, some of the most robust and consistent comp gains in the space,"" Tunick noted.The company logged fiscal first-quarter earnings of 34 cents a share, up from 13 cents the prior year and 14 cents above Wall Street views.

"
3040,KORS,"For yet another week, the current stock market uptrend stayed intact and produced more bullish moves by highly rated stocks.A few IBD 50 names took it on the chin, however. It's important in IBD-style investing to watch for possible breakdowns among leading stocks, since that can serve as a caution flag. So far, though, struggles among the leaders haven't been that widespread.3D Systems (DDD) and Stratasys (SSYS) were among the week's big losers.3D Systems slumped to its 10-week moving average in big volume. It had dropped that key support level in the week ended Feb. 1, then tried to rally. Meanwhile, rival 3D printer maker Stratasys undercut its 10-week line.Generac Holdings (GNRC) also lost considerable ground, though it erased some losses after touching its 10-week line. The power generator maker reported Q4 results that crushed forecasts, but its outlook disappointed the market.Among the week's big winners, Michael Kors (KORS) made a gap-up move on its strong earnings report. The fashion house jumped back above its recent 58.72 buy point after running into resistance at that level in late January.Other IBD 50 stocks have continued to climb to fresh highs, becoming even more extended from their last buying ranges. ARM Holdings (ARMH), FleetCor Technologies (FLT), Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Waddell & Reed Financial (WDR) match this description.You also can still find some stocks that aren't that far extended from their recent buy zones. Ocwen Financial (OCN) cleared a 39.35 trigger from a cup-with-handle base a couple of weeks ago, but it's still not that far past that level.Note that the mortgage servicer's latest base was a third-stage pattern — riskier and not as fresh as a first- or second-stage structure.In addition, there are IBD 50 names that have offered secondary buying opportunities via 10-week rebounds.Consider fracking play U.S. Silica (SLCA) and South Korean chipmaker MagnaChip Semiconductor (MX). Keep in mind that MagnaChip's action also could be viewed as a base-building effort.For the week, the IBD 50 index fell 0.6%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq and NYSE composite both edged down less than 0.1% for the week. The Nasdaq bid farewell to a six-week winning streak.The S&P 500 edged up a little more than 0.1%, extending its winning streak to seven weeks.

Sports apparel maker Under Armour (UA) skidded 4.4% to 50.51.Shares of Michael Kors and G-III both closed below their 50-day moving average price, a negative technical indicator.

3116,KORS,"Luxury brands have been falling and department stores have been warning, so all eyes will be on Michael Kors (KORS) when it reports second-quarter earnings on Tuesday.Analysts are expecting earnings of 40 cents per share and sales of $519.3 million in the company's first Q2 since going public last December. The company has reported double- or triple-digit EPS and earnings gains since its debut.Kors has been one of the biggest IPO successes of the past year. It went public for 20 per share but now is trading well above 50.The brand isn't new, though. Its lead designer and namesake, Michael Kors, has been in the fashion industry for years but is perhaps best known as a judge on the hit reality show ""Project Runway.""But luxury brands, which have done well during the economic downturn, have taken some hits the past month.Fossil (FOSL), who makes Kors licensed watches and jewelry, reported weak European sales last week.Ralph Lauren (RL), the fashion house known for its preppy styles, reported flat Q2 earnings on Nov. 2. Wholesale revenue dipped 8% as the company shipped fewer goods to European stores and the company lowered its outlook.Macy's (M) third-quarter earnings beat estimates last week, but the department store operator issued weak guidance for its important holiday season in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.Kohl's (KSS) also announced quarterly earnings that beat analyst estimates but said it expects holiday sales growth will miss Wall Street targets.Michael Kors shares broke below their 50-day moving average last week.

"
3140,KORS,"The $15 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund is in the top tier of large-cap growth portfolios over several recent time periods.
"
3141,KORS,"Portfolio manager Larry Puglia has done that with a focus on stocks capable of sustainable growth.
"
3142,KORS,"Many of the fund's large-cap durable growers also happen to pay dividends that increase each year.
"
3143,KORS,"The fund was up 17.80% this year going into Tuesday. That put it into the top 14% of its peer group, which averaged a 14.17% gain, according to Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 was up 14.41%.
"
3144,KORS,"Over the past three years the fund's average annual gain is 12.76% vs. 9.90% for its direct rivals and 10.92% for the big-cap bogey.
"
3145,KORS,"Puglia, who is 52 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Baltimore.
"
3146,KORS,"IBD: You seek companies that can sustain high growth for three to five years. What sort of companies do that?
"
3147,KORS,"Puglia: Companies need several things. We use (Harvard Business School professor) Michael Porter's analysis that it takes companies with competitive advantages. Warren Buffett talks about franchise companies. And Morningstar talks about moats. We want to see stable to improving margins. We want to see companies taking market share. We ask if the total addressable market for a company's products is growing quite large over time.
"
3148,KORS,"The final piece is management. All of the other things are not that important if management does not know how to reinvest free cash flow.
"
3149,KORS,"The analogy is that a company that generates superior return and has strong free cash flow but does not have strong management is like a fast ship without a rudder. Sooner or later, it will run aground.
"
3150,KORS,"IBD: How many of your holdings pay a dividend?
"
3151,KORS,"Puglia: Eighty-eight out of 132. Exactly two-thirds.
"
3152,KORS,"IBD: Have you tried to tweak your portfolio this year to cope with volatility?
"
3153,KORS,"Puglia: If you could anticipate market changes so you could transition from more growth to more defensive names — but that's impossible to do. And we don't want to. That's why we look for durable growth.
"
3154,KORS,"IBD: Does that mean there's nothing you can do to position the fund for next year, when we don't know yet what the tax background will be?
"
3155,KORS,"Puglia: The longer it takes (for the political parties) to come to an agreement and the less confident investors are that agreement on the budget at least partially addresses entitlement reform, then the more concerned investors will be about riskiness of investing in growth.
"
3156,KORS,"Obviously, the more significant the tax increases — and everyone knows there will be tax increases — the more that investors will be concerned about growth. If the tax increases are well above what was discussed in the debt-ceiling negotiations (in the summer of 2011), that could damage growth.
"
3157,KORS,"IBD: So the longer it takes Washington to reach an agreement and the higher the taxes, what will you do with your portfolio?
"
3158,KORS,"Puglia: The longer it takes or the higher the taxes, the more that's going to lead you away from companies that are economically sensitive. And the more that will cause us to want companies that would do fairly well even in a lackluster growth environment. We will emphasize to even a greater extent companies that have durable, sustainable growth.
"
3159,KORS,"Will we continue to own companies in the technology area? Sure. But if the prospects for slower growth or even a double-dip recession increase, we will be even more reluctant to own industrial or more cyclical companies.
"
3160,KORS,"IBD: I imagine that Sherwin-Williams (SHW) is one of your dividend names. They recently bought Mexico's Comex. What else do you like?
"
3161,KORS,"Puglia: They've increased dividends 34 or 35 years. And it is important that we're having a housing recovery. New buyers paint their homes. People paint when they remodel homes.
"
3162,KORS,"I just hope the housing recovery is not dampened by the budget negotiations.
"
3163,KORS,"Also, Sherwin-Williams has increased their prices several times, showing pricing power. And a lot of raw materials have dropped in price. Oil is down. Titanium oxide is moderating. Still, someone downgraded it. That's why it dropped recently. It's still attractive. It's done well, though, so we're not buying aggressively at current prices.
"
3164,KORS,"They have a chance to earn $10 a share in 2014, so they're trading around 15 times 2014 earnings, which is reasonable. We would consider buying on any correction.
"
3165,KORS,"IBD: Why reference 2014 earnings rather than 2013's?
"
3166,KORS,"Puglia: We are less than a month away from 2013. And we generally price stocks using earnings estimates for the next calendar year. Consequently, we are starting to price stocks using calendar 2014 estimates.
"
3167,KORS,"IBD: Is Apple (AAPL) a dividend stock for you?
"
3168,KORS,"Puglia: They recently started one and they have the ability to pay a growing dividend. We think it's unwise to eliminate a company like that from a potential buying pool.
"
3169,KORS,"IBD: Is Apple's recent pullback a long-term concern for you?
"
3170,KORS,"Puglia: It is under pressure. Some concerns are real. The iPad's 55% market share is not sustainable. And they've had supply constraints with the iPad mini and iPhone 5. Supply is catching up, though. Still, there's more competition coming. Samsung is a good company, and its products (like the Galaxy smartphone) are selling well.
"
3171,KORS,"(Amazon's) Kindle, which is not directly comparable to Apple's tablet, is selling briskly.
"
3172,KORS,"And while the iPad is on a closed system, Android is more of an open system. That means that if customers see Android products and features as equivalent to the iPad, they may be less willing to pay a premium for the iPad.
"
3173,KORS,"And demand for Mac computers is not so strong. But no one's desktops and computers are selling as well as handhelds.
"
3174,KORS,"But Apple's positives are there. They feel good about demand for the holidays. They have a share buyback in place. They've instituted dividends. We think the stock is mispriced. They'll have over $200 a share in cash on their balance sheet in the next 18 to 24 months, closer to $250 really. They'll earn $50 a share in 2013 and $60.70 in calendar 2014. That means the stock is trading at less than 10 times 2014 earnings before you consider the cash. Once you take the cash out, it's more like seven times earnings. That's cheap in our view.
"
3175,KORS,"IBD: Do dividends help the fund weather volatile markets?
"
3176,KORS,"Puglia: Dividend growth helps some stocks perform better in volatile markets. But dividend growth is essentially a byproduct of durable growth, which we pursue. There are durable earnings growers that do not have significant dividend yield, which we think should also perform well in volatile markets.
"
3177,KORS,"IBD: Michael Kors (KORS) is one of your nondividend plays.
"
3178,KORS,"Puglia: It is.
"
3179,KORS,"IBD: Is its recent pullback a long-term concern for you?
"
3180,KORS,"Puglia: We're always concerned about companies that have fashion risk. They have more fashion risk than we would typically find in the sector. But they're becoming a more accepted brand name across a variety of products — wrist watches, handbags. They're competing with Coach (COH), which we still own and has less fashion risk.
"
3181,KORS,"The overarching point about Kors is that they are becoming a sought-after brand, and will have longevity. They have a variety of products, garments, handbags. Growth will be stronger than people realize and more durable.
"
3182,KORS,"IBD: Visa (V) just keeps trending higher. Can it keep it up?
"
3183,KORS,"Puglia: We have meaningful positions in Visa and MasterCard (MA). Some new technologies threaten them. Others could augment their growth.
"
3184,KORS,"MasterCard has partnered with some companies working in the area of near-field communications and outfitting phones with gear to enable swipes and make payments. They have a partnership with Google Wallet. Visa has introduced ""V.me"" mobile wallet.
"
3185,KORS,"EBay (EBAY) just reported Black Friday results. PayPal (eBay's online payment system) numbers are up close to 200%. So electronic wallets, new payment technologies are enjoying robust growth. And the bread-and-butter credit card payment business continues to show steady growth.
"
3186,KORS,"Visa does not own a European operation. So because that market is weaker, it has been better for Visa.
"
3187,KORS,"IBD: Speaking of eBay, how is its Marketplaces (e-commerce) unit doing?
"
3188,KORS,"Puglia: Both PayPal and Marketplaces are doing well. PayPal is growing more rapidly. But it was a lot more important for management to fix the (bigger) Marketplaces business. And they've done that. They fixed the website. They brought in third-party sales, similar to what Amazon (AMZN) has done.
"
3189,KORS,"We think they could earn over $3 a share in calendar 2014. Maybe $3.25 to $3.40. So they're trading at just 15 times what they could earn in 2014.
"
3190,KORS,"IBD: What will it take for Priceline (PCLN) to recover from its exposure to Europe? Does Europe have to get better?
"
3191,KORS,"Puglia: To a degree. It's reassuring to us that after a quarter or two of earnings disappointments, they have shown improving growth. Business reaccelerated for Bookings.com, their European engine. Agoda, which is prevalent in Asia, continues to do well. Priceline was already reasonably priced when it stumbled, its stock corrected, and that made it even more reasonably priced.
"
3192,KORS,"IBD: Amgen (AMGN) is helped by sales of Enbrel. What else do you like?
"
3193,KORS,"Puglia: Amgen is a company that has struggled a little. Reimbursement (from Medicare, Medicaid and other sources) concerns surround a number of their products like Epogen, which is essentially a red blood cell stimulating factor. Then they have Neupogen, which stimulates white blood cells.
"
3194,KORS,"Both are big products. Another, Aranesp, has been hurt. It is used by kidney dialysis patients. There's been a big debate about how much of it should be consumed. That's resulted in a dramatic slowing of that product.

3195,KORS,"Other products, like Prolia, have all kinds of derivatives. Some are used to rebuild bone mass by women with osteoporosis. Others can control lesions that prostate cancer patients might suffer. Prolia has shown dramatic growth.

3197,KORS,"Amgen is not our favorite biotech. But the company has cut expenses. It is probably going to grow its dividend. And its valuation is still interesting.
"
3198,KORS,"IBD: PVH (PVH) gapped up Oct. 31 after news of the Warnaco acquisition.
"
3199,KORS,"Puglia: Right. That buy was postulated for some time. PVH owns (the Calvin Klein brand) and Warnaco licenses (Calvin Klein underwear) from PVH. The deal lets PVH unify the brand. And it gives them control over valuable licenses in Europe and various markets. And it will let them save a lot of expenses by taking out redundant functions.

3200,KORS,"PVH has other brands like Tommy Hilfiger (and Van Heusen, Izod and Speedo).
"
3201,KORS,"IBD: American Tower (AMT) benefits from carriers upgrading their networks to 4G. What are the risks?
"
3202,KORS,"Puglia: Technological threats. There are some approaches to wireless data and voice that don't require big towers. Some only require small transponders. We've been watching that trend for three to four years. We're comfortable nothing will happen soon, but it's out there.IBD Special Report: Mutual Fund MonthlyThe $15 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund is in the top tier of large-cap growth portfolios over several recent time periods.Portfolio manager Larry Puglia has done that with a focus on stocks capable of sustainable growth.Many of the fund's large-cap durable growers also happen to pay dividends that increase each year.The fund was up 17.80% this year going into Tuesday. That put it into the top 14% of its peer group, which averaged a 14.17% gain, according to Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 was up 14.41%.Over the past three years the fund's average annual gain is 12.76% vs. 9.90% for its direct rivals and 10.92% for the big-cap bogey.Puglia, who is 52 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Baltimore.IBD: You seek companies that can sustain high growth for three to five years. What sort of companies do that?Puglia: Companies need several things. We use (Harvard Business School professor) Michael Porter's analysis that it takes companies with competitive advantages. Warren Buffett talks about franchise companies. And Morningstar talks about moats. We want to see stable to improving margins. We want to see companies taking market share. We ask if the total addressable market for a company's products is growing quite large over time.The final piece is management. All of the other things are not that important if management does not know how to reinvest free cash flow.The analogy is that a company that generates superior return and has strong free cash flow but does not have strong management is like a fast ship without a rudder. Sooner or later, it will run aground.IBD: How many of your holdings pay a dividend?Puglia: Eighty-eight out of 132. Exactly two-thirds.IBD: Have you tried to tweak your portfolio this year to cope with volatility?Puglia: If you could anticipate market changes so you could transition from more growth to more defensive names — but that's impossible to do. And we don't want to. That's why we look for durable growth.IBD: Does that mean there's nothing you can do to position the fund for next year, when we don't know yet what the tax background will be?Puglia: The longer it takes (for the political parties) to come to an agreement and the less confident investors are that agreement on the budget at least partially addresses entitlement reform, then the more concerned investors will be about riskiness of investing in growth.Obviously, the more significant the tax increases — and everyone knows there will be tax increases — the more that investors will be concerned about growth. If the tax increases are well above what was discussed in the debt-ceiling negotiations (in the summer of 2011), that could damage growth.IBD: So the longer it takes Washington to reach an agreement and the higher the taxes, what will you do with your portfolio?Puglia: The longer it takes or the higher the taxes, the more that's going to lead you away from companies that are economically sensitive. And the more that will cause us to want companies that would do fairly well even in a lackluster growth environment. We will emphasize to even a greater extent companies that have durable, sustainable growth.Will we continue to own companies in the technology area? Sure. But if the prospects for slower growth or even a double-dip recession increase, we will be even more reluctant to own industrial or more cyclical companies.IBD: I imagine that Sherwin-Williams (SHW) is one of your dividend names. They recently bought Mexico's Comex. What else do you like?Puglia: They've increased dividends 34 or 35 years. And it is important that we're having a housing recovery. New buyers paint their homes. People paint when they remodel homes.I just hope the housing recovery is not dampened by the budget negotiations.Also, Sherwin-Williams has increased their prices several times, showing pricing power. And a lot of raw materials have dropped in price. Oil is down. Titanium oxide is moderating. Still, someone downgraded it. That's why it dropped recently. It's still attractive. It's done well, though, so we're not buying aggressively at current prices.They have a chance to earn $10 a share in 2014, so they're trading around 15 times 2014 earnings, which is reasonable. We would consider buying on any correction.IBD: Why reference 2014 earnings rather than 2013's?Puglia: We are less than a month away from 2013. And we generally price stocks using earnings estimates for the next calendar year. Consequently, we are starting to price stocks using calendar 2014 estimates.IBD: Is Apple (AAPL) a dividend stock for you?Puglia: They recently started one and they have the ability to pay a growing dividend. We think it's unwise to eliminate a company like that from a potential buying pool.IBD: Is Apple's recent pullback a long-term concern for you?Puglia: It is under pressure. Some concerns are real. The iPad's 55% market share is not sustainable. And they've had supply constraints with the iPad mini and iPhone 5. Supply is catching up, though. Still, there's more competition coming. Samsung is a good company, and its products (like the Galaxy smartphone) are selling well.(Amazon's) Kindle, which is not directly comparable to Apple's tablet, is selling briskly.And while the iPad is on a closed system, Android is more of an open system. That means that if customers see Android products and features as equivalent to the iPad, they may be less willing to pay a premium for the iPad.And demand for Mac computers is not so strong. But no one's desktops and computers are selling as well as handhelds.But Apple's positives are there. They feel good about demand for the holidays. They have a share buyback in place. They've instituted dividends. We think the stock is mispriced. They'll have over $200 a share in cash on their balance sheet in the next 18 to 24 months, closer to $250 really. They'll earn $50 a share in 2013 and $60.70 in calendar 2014. That means the stock is trading at less than 10 times 2014 earnings before you consider the cash. Once you take the cash out, it's more like seven times earnings. That's cheap in our view.IBD: Do dividends help the fund weather volatile markets?Puglia: Dividend growth helps some stocks perform better in volatile markets. But dividend growth is essentially a byproduct of durable growth, which we pursue. There are durable earnings growers that do not have significant dividend yield, which we think should also perform well in volatile markets.IBD: Michael Kors (KORS) is one of your nondividend plays.Puglia: It is.IBD: Is its recent pullback a long-term concern for you?Puglia: We're always concerned about companies that have fashion risk. They have more fashion risk than we would typically find in the sector. But they're becoming a more accepted brand name across a variety of products — wrist watches, handbags. They're competing with Coach (COH), which we still own and has less fashion risk.The overarching point about Kors is that they are becoming a sought-after brand, and will have longevity. They have a variety of products, garments, handbags. Growth will be stronger than people realize and more durable.IBD: Visa (V) just keeps trending higher. Can it keep it up?Puglia: We have meaningful positions in Visa and MasterCard (MA). Some new technologies threaten them. Others could augment their growth.MasterCard has partnered with some companies working in the area of near-field communications and outfitting phones with gear to enable swipes and make payments. They have a partnership with Google Wallet. Visa has introduced ""V.me"" mobile wallet.EBay (EBAY) just reported Black Friday results. PayPal (eBay's online payment system) numbers are up close to 200%. So electronic wallets, new payment technologies are enjoying robust growth. And the bread-and-butter credit card payment business continues to show steady growth.Visa does not own a European operation. So because that market is weaker, it has been better for Visa.IBD: Speaking of eBay, how is its Marketplaces (e-commerce) unit doing?Puglia: Both PayPal and Marketplaces are doing well. PayPal is growing more rapidly. But it was a lot more important for management to fix the (bigger) Marketplaces business. And they've done that. They fixed the website. They brought in third-party sales, similar to what Amazon (AMZN) has done.We think they could earn over $3 a share in calendar 2014. Maybe $3.25 to $3.40. So they're trading at just 15 times what they could earn in 2014.IBD: What will it take for Priceline (PCLN) to recover from its exposure to Europe? Does Europe have to get better?Puglia: To a degree. It's reassuring to us that after a quarter or two of earnings disappointments, they have shown improving growth.

3205,KORS,"Stocks rose Friday, but closed off their session highs. The market got a lift from a solid jobs report and relief over Greece's bond swap, but pulled back in the wake of news that the swap counts as a ""credit event,"" or basically a default.The Nasdaq tacked on 0.6%, the S&P 500 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.1%. Volume declined from Thursday's levels on both main exchanges, taking some punch out of the move higher.After the close, shares of Michael Kors (KORS) plunged. The company announced a secondary stock offering. The luxury apparel company had just hit a new high in regular trading as it continued a heated advance.For the week, the Nasdaq rose 0.4%, while the S&P 500 edged up 0.1%. Each index advanced for a fourth straight week, fighting back from sizable losses suffered earlier in the week. The Dow lost 0.4% for the week.Economic news mostly was positive Friday. The government jobs report for February showed better-than-expected growth, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 227,000 and the unemployment rate staying at 8.3%. On the downside, payrolls are still 5.3 million below the January 2008 peak and the U.S. trade deficit widened for a third straight month.In the late afternoon Friday, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association said Greece's bond swap counts as a ""credit event,"" meaning holders of credit default swaps likely will be entitled to compensation estimated at $3.2 billion. Analysts have said the ISDA's announcement was expected and the amount is less than feared.Among IBD 50 stocks on Friday, Sourcefire (FIRE) gained 5% in above-average volume and touched a new all-time high. The maker of security software and hardware climbed back above a 46.39 buy point from a short-stroke pattern that it first cleared Monday. It closed 4% beyond 46.39, leaving it near the upper limit of a possible buy zone.Ulta Beauty (ULTA), another IBD 50 name, reversed from a high and finished about flat Friday. The stock was up as much as 3% in reaction to its better-than-expected Q4 results, out late Thursday. Ulta's earnings and sales grew 52% and 23%, respectively. Despite the reversal, it's still well extended past a 75.80 buy point from a cup-shaped consolidation.Starbucks (SBUX) jumped 3% in big turnover, helped by the company's plans to sell single-serve coffee makers. The company, which announced the plan late Thursday, has hit an all-time high and is now well extended past a buying range after lifting off support at its 10-week moving average. Starbucks sports an IBD Composite Rating of 96, near the best-possible grade of 99.  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR), which makes the Keurig single-serve brewers, plunged 16% Friday on the news.On Monday, Clean Energy Fuels (CLNE) is among the companies expected to report quarterly earnings.

3334,KORS,"Among apparel stocks, most don't pay a dividend.Of those that do, the top-rated stock is VF Corp. (VFC)The North Carolina-based company, which is No. 18 in the Big Cap 20, holds a slew of well-known brand names, including Wrangler, Lee, JanSport, The North Face and Timberland.Over the years, VF has grown through acquisitions. For example, Lee was acquired in 1969, JanSport and Wrangler in 1986, The North Face in 2000 and Timberland in 2011.Last year's $2.3 billion buyout of Timberland was VF's largest ever, and expanded VF's footprint in the outdoor clothing space.In a New America article in March, Cowen & Co. analyst John Kernan told IBD that VF ""could be poised to make another acquisition in the back half of this year.""The analyst believes the acquisition ""will be focused in outdoor active sports, and we think it will be a major international brand, probably in Europe.""VF derives about two-thirds of its revenue from the U.S. The balance is from Europe, Canada, Asia, Mexico and Latin America.The company said in its latest 10-K report that it is focusing more on outdoor attire, because profit margins and growth rates are higher in that space than in VF's other businesses.In 2011, VF's pretax margin was 12.7%, the best in the past five years.Annual earnings dropped 8% on a revenue decline of 6% in recessionary 2009. Since then, EPS rebounded 25% each in 2010-11 as revenue rose 7% and 23%.The Street expects earnings to rise 17% this year on 17% sales growth.The three-year earnings stability rating is 4, and the five-year rating is 9. The gauge runs from 0 (calm) to 99 (wild). The current annual yield is 1.9%.One angle to consider is VF's No. 2 status in its industry group in Stock Checkup at Investors.com. The No. 1 stock is Michael Kors (KORS), an upscale apparel marketer with much stronger fundamentals, though it pays no dividend. Buying the best on a breakout and taking income out of capital appreciation might be the best strategy.

"
3414,KORS,"Retailers posted soft March sales gains Thursday as abnormally cold weather and an early Easter dampened spending, leaving shelves bulging with spring merchandise.
"
3415,KORS,"March sales at stores open at least a year rose 1.4% vs. a year ago, says Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. The results were roughly in line with analysts' already lowered expectations. Only 43% of retailers beat views, while 57% missed.
"
3416,KORS,"""But the numbers could have been worse, given the head winds some of the retailers were facing,"" Perkins said.
"
3417,KORS,"Easter holiday store closures on March 31 hurt many retailers, especially apparel chains, as they lost a weekend day of sales vs. March of last year, he says.
"
3418,KORS,"Retailers faced difficult weather comparisons with March 2012, when above-normal temperatures led to strong spring apparel sales. This March, abnormally cold weather and above-normal snowfalls in parts of the U.S. hurt spring clothing sales and chilled sales of lawn products and outdoor furniture.
"
3419,KORS,"Zumiez Zooms
"
3420,KORS,"But the month saw some winners. Shares of Zumiez (ZUMZ) rocketed 15.66% in midday trading as the action sports retailer posted the biggest upside surprise of the group, with a 2.1% gain in March comps vs. a year ago, ahead of forecasts for an 8% decline.
"
3421,KORS,"Other chains — including Victoria's Secret's parent L Brands (LTD) and off-price retail operator Ross Stores (ROST) — also saw strong stock-price gains after reporting same-store sales ahead of views. Shares of warehouse club giant Costco Wholesale (COST) and off-price retail operator TJX Cos. (TJX)also saw a nice uptick.
"
3422,KORS,"But overall the showing was a mixed bag.
"
3423,KORS,"Costco led the pack in March with a 4% rise in same-store sales, below forecasts for a 5.6% rise, as it got stung by lower fuel prices and a strong dollar. But when you look at its core business, excluding the impact of gas and international weakness on its sales, comps were roughly in line with views, Perkins says.
"
3424,KORS,"L Brands was among the handful of chains that beat views. It posted a 3% rise in same-store sales vs. a year ago, compared with forecasts for roughly flat sales.
"
3425,KORS,"Ross saw a 2% increase in March comps vs. a year earlier, besting forecasts for a 1.3% decline. CEO Michael Balmuth expects a 5% to 6% rise in April comps.
"
3426,KORS,"After Thursday's bell, apparel giant Gap (GPS)saw comps slip 1% from a year earlier, slightly ahead of forecasts for a 1.9% decline.
"
3427,KORS,"TJX saw same-store sales slip 2% in March, below forecasts for a 1.4% decline. But April is looking better. ""April is off to a good start, our inventories are in great shape, and we are seeing an enormous amount of desirable product in the marketplace,"" said TJX CEO Carol Meyrowitz in a statement.
"
3428,KORS,"The specialty apparel group was the month's weakest performer, with a 0.2% decline in same-store sales.
"
3429,KORS,"In addition to the weather drag, retailers faced other head winds in March. Macroeconomic data softened during the month as both weekly jobless claims and non-farm payrolls weakened.
"
3430,KORS,"Still, Perkins isn't putting too much weight on the March results.
"
3431,KORS,"""The hope is it doesn't say much about consumer spending,"" he said. ""There were some one-time mitigating circumstances taking place in March.""
"
3432,KORS,"He says you have to look at same-store sales for March and April in tandem to determine any kind of a spending trend.
"
3433,KORS,"Perkins expects a sequential improvement in April from sluggish March results as consumers continue to benefit from delayed tax refunds playing catch-up, falling gas prices and an extra selling day relative to last year due to the Easter holiday calendar shift.
"
3434,KORS,"L Brands, Ross Stores and TJX are among those retailers expected to see April comps up in the mid-single-digit range, Perkins says.
"
3435,KORS,"""Hopefully, the rise in the stock market and continued uptick in home prices will lead to consumers feeling better about their net worth and spending,"" Perkins said.
"
3436,KORS,"Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, also calculates that March same-store sales rose 1.4% vs. a year ago.
"
3437,KORS,"The cold weather blast was a drag on retailers' comps in February and March, he says. But that means some pent-up demand has been built up that could be helpful to sales of items like apparel in April.
"
3438,KORS,"""I am optimistic that April's numbers will have a more positive outlook, as warmer temperatures should drive demand for seasonal apparel,"" Niemira said.
"
3439,KORS,"Niemira expects April same-store sales to increase in the range of 2% to 3% vs. a year ago.
"
3440,KORS,"Fat Inventories
"
3441,KORS,"Given how slow sales have been, retail inventories should be in relatively good shape, adds Perkins. But retailers will still have to discount to clear out spring merchandise this month, which ""certainly"" will erode margins a bit, he says.
"
3442,KORS,"Overall, the environment for retailers is lukewarm.
"
3443,KORS,"""The hourglass/barbell situation continues onward,"" said Perkins.
"
3444,KORS,"High-end retailers — such as Michael Kors (KORS), Nordstrom  (JWN), Tiffany  (TIF)and Coach (COH) — should fare better than the rest of the group, Perkins says. He expects the lower end of the barbell — including discount chains like Costco, dollar stores and off-price retailers like TJX and Ross — to also fare better than other segments of retail.
"
3445,KORS,"But he sees the midtier department stores and specialty apparel chains having a little tougher time in this retail environment.
"
3446,KORS,"Retailers continue to face head winds. A low savings rate and slow employment growth are among them, Niemira says. And he sees a relatively ""sluggish"" rate of economic growth in the second, third and fourth quarters.
"
3447,KORS,"""As long as we're in a sluggish economic growth pattern, we can't expect a lot of growth from the retail sector,"" Niemira said.Retailers posted soft March sales gains Thursday as abnormally cold weather and an early Easter dampened spending, leaving shelves bulging with spring merchandise.March sales at stores open at least a year rose 1.4% vs. a year ago, says Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.

This March, abnormally cold weather and above-normal snowfalls in parts of the U.S. hurt spring clothing sales and chilled sales of lawn products and outdoor furniture.Zumiez ZoomsBut the month saw some winners. Shares of Zumiez (ZUMZ) rocketed 15.66% in midday trading as the action sports retailer posted the biggest upside surprise of the group, with a 2.1% gain in March comps vs. a year ago, ahead of forecasts for an 8% decline.Other chains — including Victoria's Secret's parent L Brands (LTD) and off-price retail operator Ross Stores (ROST) — also saw strong stock-price gains after reporting same-store sales ahead of views. Shares of warehouse club giant Costco Wholesale (COST) and off-price retail operator TJX Cos. (TJX)also saw a nice uptick.But overall the showing was a mixed bag.Costco led the pack in March with a 4% rise in same-store sales, below forecasts for a 5.6% rise, as it got stung by lower fuel prices and a strong dollar. But when you look at its core business, excluding the impact of gas and international weakness on its sales, comps were roughly in line with views, Perkins says.L Brands was among the handful of chains that beat views. It posted a 3% rise in same-store sales vs. a year ago, compared with forecasts for roughly flat sales.Ross saw a 2% increase in March comps vs. a year earlier, besting forecasts for a 1.3% decline. CEO Michael Balmuth expects a 5% to 6% rise in April comps.After Thursday's bell, apparel giant Gap (GPS)saw comps slip 1% from a year earlier, slightly ahead of forecasts for a 1.9% decline.TJX saw same-store sales slip 2% in March, below forecasts for a 1.4% decline. But April is looking better. ""April is off to a good start, our inventories are in great shape, and we are seeing an enormous amount of desirable product in the marketplace,"" said TJX CEO Carol Meyrowitz in a statement.The specialty apparel group was the month's weakest performer, with a 0.2% decline in same-store sales.In addition to the weather drag, retailers faced other head winds in March. Macroeconomic data softened during the month as both weekly jobless claims and non-farm payrolls weakened.Still, Perkins isn't putting too much weight on the March results.""The hope is it doesn't say much about consumer spending,"" he said. ""There were some one-time mitigating circumstances taking place in March.""He says you have to look at same-store sales for March and April in tandem to determine any kind of a spending trend.Perkins expects a sequential improvement in April from sluggish March results as consumers continue to benefit from delayed tax refunds playing catch-up, falling gas prices and an extra selling day relative to last year due to the Easter holiday calendar shift.L Brands, Ross Stores and TJX are among those retailers expected to see April comps up in the mid-single-digit range, Perkins says.""Hopefully, the rise in the stock market and continued uptick in home prices will lead to consumers feeling better about their net worth and spending,"" Perkins said.Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, also calculates that March same-store sales rose 1.4% vs. a year ago.The cold weather blast was a drag on retailers' comps in February and March, he says. But that means some pent-up demand has been built up that could be helpful to sales of items like apparel in April.""I am optimistic that April's numbers will have a more positive outlook, as warmer temperatures should drive demand for seasonal apparel,"" Niemira said.Niemira expects April same-store sales to increase in the range of 2% to 3% vs. a year ago.Fat InventoriesGiven how slow sales have been, retail inventories should be in relatively good shape, adds Perkins. But retailers will still have to discount to clear out spring merchandise this month, which ""certainly"" will erode margins a bit, he says.Overall, the environment for retailers is lukewarm.""The hourglass/barbell situation continues onward,"" said Perkins.High-end retailers — such as Michael Kors (KORS), Nordstrom  (JWN), Tiffany  (TIF)and Coach (COH) — should fare better than the rest of the group, Perkins says. He expects the lower end of the barbell — including discount chains like Costco, dollar stores and off-price retailers like TJX and Ross — to also fare better than other segments of retail.But he sees the midtier department stores and specialty apparel chains having a little tougher time in this retail environment.Retailers continue to face head winds. A low savings rate and slow employment growth are among them, Niemira says. And he sees a relatively ""sluggish"" rate of economic growth in the second, third and fourth quarters.""As long as we're in a sluggish economic growth pattern, we can't expect a lot of growth from the retail sector,"" Niemira said.

3748,KORS,"In the worst of the Great Depression, an old lady is selling apples from a cart. Her sign says ""Apples: $10,000."" A man walks up and says ""Lady, who's gonna buy your apples for $10,000?"" She replies, ""I only have to sell one!""If you can sell apples — or dresses and handbags — for $10,000 each, you'll have no trouble racking up fantastic profits. Michael Kors (KORS) is thriving with a different approach.Michael Kors wholesales and retails its own line of what some analysts call ""affordable luxury,"" attractive, jet-set fashion at mostly competitive prices. There's plenty to be had by the value-conscious shopper, and a few selections for those with money to burn.A walk through the Kors line shows many dresses priced between $100 and $300, and handbags priced similarly (although some run as high as $2,600).Most men's jackets run a few hundred dollars, with at least one at $1,295. Men's watches are priced from $180 to $395.Michael Kors came public in December at 20 per share. (It's since more than doubled.) But the company was incorporated in 1981, and the fashion world is familiar with the Kors name.Wholesale deals accounted for 51% of last year's sales, retail 43% and licensing 6%.Michael Kors ran up as high as 50.69 on March 9 — a 153% surge from its IPO listing price in less than three months.The stock has been consolidating for seven weeks, correcting as much as 22%. The stock regained its 50-day moving average Friday, and remains around that level. With shares about 10% from a new high, the stock still needs some time to complete its base.Kors shows clues that another surge is not imminent. Its Relative Price Strength Rating is a stellar 98, but its Relative Strength line has chopped lower, reflecting the price. It's nowhere near its recent high.Its up-down volume ratio, at 0.9, is another clue that the stock lacks the sort of pent-up steam that makes for a dramatic push higher.But the broader picture shows a healthy company, with many fundamentals well in place.Earnings gains have been hot since an 18% tumble in the quarter ending in March 2011, Kors' fiscal fourth. Succeeding reports showed gains of 200%, 125% and 87%.Analysts' consensus for the recently ended fiscal Q4 profit runs at 56% growth.Sales in the past four quarters ranged from 45% to 81%.Kors upped its EPS 81% in fiscal 2011, and is expected to post a 79% improvement in the just-ended fiscal 2012 and 41% this current year.Its three- and five-year EPS growth rates shine at 114% and 41%, respectively. But its three-year Earnings Stability Factor is 28, and its five-year rate is 73 (on a scale from one to 100, where the lower the factor the more stable the earnings).Where's the glitch here? A nasty 78% EPS dive in 2009.Pretax margins last year came in at 16.6% — the highest since at least 2007. It was also fourth best of 34 companies in the industry group.After-tax margin in the past three reports came in at 7.3%, 12.4%, 12.4% and 14.3%. Each is an improvement over its year-earlier reading.

3913,KORS,"Don't mistake $1.2 billion Fidelity Trend's approach as a growth-at-a-reasonable-price fund.Manager Dan Kelley prefers to describe his fund as looking for companies whose growth is underestimated by Wall Street analysts.Kelley favors three types of growth stocks:Stable earnings growers.Companies on a hot streak, with high sustainable growth for many years.Opportunistic growers, which have low valuations but are near a point when a catalyst sparks a growth spurt.Google (GOOG), Monsanto (MON) and Visa (V) are examples of stable growers. Michael Kors (KORS) is in his high sustainable growth bucket, as he puts it.  Manitowoc (MTW), new to the fund as of its latest disclosure, and United Technologies (UTX) are opportunistic growers.Those latter two stocks benefit from the rally in nonresidential construction, Kelley says. Manitowoc sells cranes and lifting equipment. United sells elevators and heating systems.Other holdings also sell into the construction space.  Ingersoll-Rand (IR) makes climate control systems. Wesco (WCC) distributes industrial and electrical construction, maintenance, repair and operating supplies. Vulcan Materials (VMC) makes construction aggregates.""Nonresidential construction tends to lag residential by 12 to 18 months, so this space is right in a sweet spot,"" Kelley said.The ongoing rebound in residential housing benefits materials and tools sellers. The fund held Lowes (LOW) and Home Depot (HD) as of its latest disclosure.""As home sales improve, people feel more comfortable adding or refurbishing rooms or taking care of deferred repairs in existing homes too,"" Kelley said.Kelley's CredentialsThose areas are familiar to Kelley. Before taking the reins of Trend in January last year, at various times he has served as research analyst covering REITs and homebuilder stocks as well as manager of Select Construction & Housing along with other duties. He now runs four portfolios in all.Another trend Kelley has played is refurbished auto parts. He owned LKQ (LKQ) as of his latest disclosure.""Insurers are looking to lower auto claims expenses, so they're utilizing more refurbished parts. LKQ owns junk and scrap yards, where they get parts refurbished and recertified,"" Kelley said.Barriers To EntryThe field has grown fast and has barriers to entry. ""They have a distribution network of hubs across the U.S. that can get parts to mechanics and repair shops,"" he said.The fund was up 6.86% this year going into Tuesday. Its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. averaged 7.63%. The S&P 500 was up 10.24%.Over the past three years the fund's average annual return is 11.33% vs. 9.19% for its peers and 11.29% for the big-cap bogey.The fund's first-quarter relative performance trailed the S&P 500 as many investors shifted into defensive names and stronger yield payers. Rather than make such moves, Kelley continued to pursue growth. ""I stuck to my philosophy and process,"" he said.Kelley trimmed Apple (AAPL) in recent months. Its margins have shrunk due to rivals offering similar products at lower prices, he notes.

3931,KORS,"Recent IPO, potential growth outfit and niche, luxury men's retail label Michael Kors (KORS) came in with all-around strong results this morning. But despite beating on both its top and bottom-lines and issuing upside, above-views FY13 guidance, investors saw fit to back away from an out-the-gate gap test of its 50-day simple moving average and move shares from a high near 42.75 to an intraday level of about 40 a share. 
"
3932,KORS,"For longer-term investors seeing today's report as an opportunity to get long KORS with a good deal of company-specific uncertainty now removed, but respecting the inability of shares to get above their 50-day simple moving average within its weekly base; a collar using call and put options, might be a smart way to accessorize the position. 
"
3933,KORS,"The collar strategy buys stock, sells an ""at"" or out-of-the-money call and purchases a put for downside protection on a one-to-one basis. While the position is generally considered a moderately bullish one, the placement of strikes is what ultimately determines the risk and reward involved and how much movement in the underlying shares will be required to realize either of those amounts.
"
3934,KORS,"To illustrate a collar and one which looks interesting given what's occurring in the stock today, we've set up a 3x collar using the July 37 put and July 42 call for a net cost of $40.29 per spread. The component prices used to establish the debit are $40.04 for long stock, $2.00 call sale and $1.75 purchase price for the put. Thus, the option ""risk reversal"" costs $0.25 per spread which is added to the price paid for shares.
"
3935,KORS,"This particular collar is uneven, meaning the sold call and protective put aren't equidistant to the share price and the position maintains a bit more downside exposure versus its potential upside gain. However, adjustments might be possible down the road, given the right opportunity. In the end, the collar is a limited risk and limited reward position. But prior to expiration it's best not to cling to the notion a collar is a static spread; rather, see it as being potentially electric or dynamic and open to new designs that better fit the times.

4007,KORS,"Over three decades, designer Michael Kors has gone from rising star in the fashion world to mature talent and TV celebrity judge on ""Project Runway.""But his namesake public company, Michael Kors Holdings (KORS), is just getting started. It debuted on the Nasdaq only five months ago.But it's already a rising star on Wall Street despite being caught up in the stock market's latest dip.Having given investors a big Valentine's Day present in its first quarterly report as a public company, it has set a high bar for itself.Not only did the self-described ""accessible luxury lifestyle company"" beat analysts' estimates by more than double, but it also clocked same-store sales gains of 38% in North America and more than 34% in Europe.That good news was just on the fast-growing retail side, which closed the quarter with 231 stores, 75 of them having opened in the 12 months prior.Wholesale and licensing revenue, which included a double-digit gain in fashion watches, also shone.The company buys watches from partner Fossil (FOSL), which reports quarterly earnings on Tuesday.It also buys fragrances from Estee Lauder (EL) and eyewear from Marchon Eyewear, two other licensees it uses for their specialized expertise.Jobs ReportShares on Valentine's Day soared 27.5% to a new high. But mixed economic news on Thursday and a disappointing jobs report on Friday sent Kors' shares tumbling around 10% over the two days as the overall market fell.Shares are still more than double from December's IPO price of $20.The company will report its March-ended fiscal fourth-quarter results next month.Will the runway show for Wall Street thrill again?If Kors were a movie, it would be ""Raging Bull,"" wrote JP Morgan analyst Brian Tunick on Friday.""We think the outperformance will continue,"" said analyst Corinna Freedman of Wedbush Securities in a phone call, adding that it probably won't be as outsized as the last quarter.""Our channel checks have shown stores across the nation are comping stronger than competitors,"" Freedman said. ""Sales growth and traffic are being driven by handbags and accessories.""Same-store sales for the 11 weeks ended March 17 grew 35.8%, the company said on March 19, when it raised its earnings forecast for the fourth quarter to 14 cents to 16 cents per share from 10 cents to 12 cents prior.For the full fiscal year, it expects to report 79 cents to 81 cents vs. 74 cents to 76 cents earlier. It sees revenue of up to $1.28 billion.The company later announced a secondary stock offering of 25 million shares at $47 a share, allowing insiders to sell shares to the public and take profits ahead of the IPO's six-month lockout period, which ends June 12.If the uncertain economy and high gas prices do hurt Michael Kors, the impact will be minor, says Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners.""It will be more than offset by the organic growth in the store base and wholesale distribution expansion,"" he said.It doesn't hurt to be in the luxury arena, one of the strongest performing categories in retail.""This is a very good time to be in luxury, and midluxury is the next growth area for the consumer,"" said Marshal Cohen, chief retail analyst at the NPD Group.""(Michael Kors) is in a pretty good spot. If done right, they can grow their brand in several different directions,"" Cohen said, adding: ""Right now, Michael Kors is for the lower-upper class and the upper-middle class, and they are aspiring to reach the middle class.""Management believes it can open as many as 400 retail stores in North America, 100 locations in Europe and 100 in Japan.Plans are also under way to expand shop within shops in department stores in North America, Europe and Japan.Michael Kors' own branded retail stores are higher margin than wholesale sales. They emphasize hand bags, small leather goods and other accessories such as fashion watches and jewelry, a newer category that flew off shelves in the past quarter.Michael Kors' American-style luxury sportswear apparel is a small part of the store mix.Ready-to-wear apparel from Kors and his design team are mostly sold in department and specialty stores.The two primary collections include the Michael Kors luxury line and the lower-priced accessible luxury collection known as Michael, which was introduced in 2004.Cohen says such multitier branding strategies have worked for Ralph Lauren (RL), Donna Karan and other fashion houses as well as for Coach (COH), the handbag and accessories company.Michael Kors competes with the larger Coach in handbags and accessories. Should Coach be worried?Johnson of Customer Growth Partners thinks so.""Coach is encountering more competition from Michael Kors and Tory Burch,"" he said. ""They are more today and tomorrow brands than Coach, which is a today and yesterday brand.""""We do store checks all over the country,"" Johnson went on, ""and we are seeing a little more buzz at the Tory Burch and Michael Kors stores.""Chief Creative OfficerKors is still active in the company. He's chief creative officer. And he has more than half a million Twitter followers, according to CEO John Idol, a veteran of apparel and fashion concerns Kasper, Donna Karan and Ralph Lauren.Idol has told analysts that the firm is increasing spending on social media and expects to have more than 1 million Facebook fans by this month or next.Michael Kors' target and core customer is a 35-year-old woman who aspires to a ""jet-set lifestyle,"" the company says.After the 30-to-40-year-olds, the next biggest category is women 18 to 25. That younger group is the company's fastest growing demographic, Idol said in a February conference call.""As this young woman grows with us, she is going to be a loyal customer in the future,"" he said.

But Coach said it's seeing strong sales overseas, particularly in China, which partially offset the decline in North America. True Religion slid 2.8% to 26.50 Tuesday morning.Coach CEO Lew Frankfort said robust international sales were driven by both distribution and productivity increases.""In North America, however, an increasingly promotional environment led to lower growth than expected in factory stores. As a result, we responded by reinstating our prior practice of in-store couponing in a cross section of factory location late in the period.""During the quarter, Coach opened four new North American retail stores and seven factory outlets, including five dedicated men's stores. This brought the total to 354 retail stores and 169 factory stores in North America, the company's biggest market, as of June 30.In China, the company opened 11 stores, bringing the total to 96.Frankfort said in a written statement that the company's target is double-digit top- and bottom-line growth.Elsewhere in the clothing and accessories market, Michael Kors Holdings (KORS), the only luxury brand maker on the IBD 50 list of top stocks, dropped 2.3% to 40.52.

If you're of the mind the two are related and set up a vertical spread, you're not alone. However, as specific as that might sound, what actually happened, without talking to the parties involved firsthand, is a tough one to crack, though we'll give it a shot with the imperfect information that is available. 
"
4141,KORS,"One key factor complicating matters is whether the position is opening or closing. Not only does existing open interest nearly match today's volume, yesterday saw an identical size ""spread"" of 7,750 put up for $1.70 compared to today's ""staggered"" $1.25 net cost. The activity ultimately begs the question of whether a trader is doubling up a bearish or bullish bet, exiting for a loss or closing for a profit of $0.45 per spread. 
"
4142,KORS,"Higher implieds today on top of yesterday's bid and a vertical sporting slightly more vega per point in the 40 strike put suggest the trader may have added to a bear put spread. Also, the fact today's volume was spread out with the 40s trading first during this morning's ""EU"" euphoria (helping gap shares higher) could point to a bear trying to fade the move and receive a better price for a second vertical by waiting to sell the 36 strike put on anticipated weakness later on. 
"
4143,KORS,"On the other hand and a scenario we like slightly more, today's action might represent a trader exiting a bull put spread. A profit of $0.45 may not sound all that enticing compared to the full $1.70 potential, but a more detailed interpretation of ""higher implieds"", skew and the vertical's vega, could hint at just that sort of closing buyer. 
"
4144,KORS,"Digging a bit deeper into the pricing of implieds the past couple days reveals that while premiums lifted Wednesday, the increase was actually much smaller than today's bid. In fact, it appears the 40s and a contract now sporting more vega relative to the 36 put, saw implieds push higher by a handful of points compared to the typically upwardly skewed, lower strike put which remained largely flat. 
"
4145,KORS,"That's odd behavior. But if we reestablish the intentions of the early block print in the 40 put as a trader wanting to close long deltas in fear of the bullish opening gap faltering during the session and looking to leg the long 36 put for more opportune prices later on, it seems to make sense enough, even if $0.45 doesn't do it for you.

4159,KORS,"Losses were oddly distributed among leaders Friday as the market coped with bad news from the fiscal-cliff war. Some leaders got smacked, some held up with modest losses — and a few actually moved up.Fashion designer and retailer Michael Kors (KORS) fell 3% in modestly above-average volume. But the stock had sunk as much as 6% before clawing back enough to regain its 10-week line.U.S. Silica Holdings (SLCA), a provider of silica to various industries — including fracking companies — dived 3%. Here, too, volume was muted. And the stock pared what was a 7% loss.But Bonanza Creek Energy (BCEI) shot up 4% to a new high. Volume surged to four times its norm. The oil and gas producer broke out Tuesday from a cup base. The 26.70 buy point sparked a volume surge that has yet to cool off. Bonanza ended the session 8% above that trigger.FleetCor Technologies (FLT), a provider of payment solutions to commercial fleets and oil companies, poked 1% higher in low volume. FleetCor has been riding higher for months along its uptrending 10-week moving average.Drugmaker Watson Pharmaceuticals (WPI) climbed 1% in fast trade. The stock scored a small upside reversal after dropping 1% at the open. Watson is pushing past resistance at 90, which looks like a breakout from a shallow base.Home-beverage-systems maker SodaStream (SODA) fell 3% in average turnover, but the stock recovered from an earlier 6% loss. SodaStream couldn't quite regain its 43.10 cup-with-handle buy point.3D Systems (DDD) and Stratasys (SSYS), two makers of 3D printers and prototype systems, each bucked the selling to log small gains in below-average trade.3D Systems ended 16% past its 44.90 buy point from a cup-shaped base. That breakout was treacherous. The stock fell 8% from its Nov. 1 breakout, then regained the trigger price, then fell 8% again — and then took off.Stratasys also has put in a choppy climb. The stock ended 15% above its 69.18 cup-with-handle entry.Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU), a Chinese Web-based security software distributor and, more recently, the search engine that's challenging Baidu's (BIDU) dominance, pared its 3% loss to just 1%, and finished 9% above its 24.40 trigger from a cup-with-handle base.Cloud issue SolarWinds (SWI) fell 3% in fast trade. Online travel agent TripAdvisor (TRIP) fell 2%.

4177,KORS,"China is so big and is growing so fast that it's becoming increasingly common for well-run companies to have significant Chinese connections. IBD's rotating Screen Center today focuses on Top Fundamentals, companies with a long run of strong fundamentals. Here are the five members with Greater China ties.Las Vegas Sands (LVS) (3-year EPS growth rate: 728%)Wynn Resorts (WYNN) (3-year EPS growth rate: 103%)These two U.S.-based casino giants are riding the wave of Macau, China's special zone that is the only part of the country where casinos are allowed. It's surpassed Las Vegas as the world's largest gaming market. Sands just opened its huge Cotai casino resort there and reportedly is close to picking between Madrid and Barcelona for a Spanish gaming mecca. Meanwhile, Wynn reportedly is in negotiations to build a new Macau casino of its own.Macau's gaming growth is slowing but remains solid.Las Vegas Sands reports earnings on April 25. Analysts expect a 58% EPS gain. That follows a 36% advance in the year-end quarter on a 26% revenue increase.Wynn should report results in early May. Wall Street sees just a 2% per-share profit rise. That follows a 70% bump on a modest 9% sales gain.Wynn shares shot up Wednesday to a new closing high on that new casino buzz. Sands shares hit a record high on April 10 and are trading modestly below that peak.Michael Kors Holdings (KORS) (3-year EPS growth rate: 114%)The company is technically based in Hong Kong, but most of its sales are in America and Europe. Still, with such strong growth, the fashion designer and retailer fits right in with the other companies listed here. Kors only came public in December, then followed up with an 83% profit gain as revenue soared 91%. Analysts see a 75% earnings gain next time.Kors' shares had a huge run initially, ultimately peaking in early March. Since late March, the stock has stumbled and is now trading below its 50-day line.Baidu.com (BIDU) (3-year EPS growth rate: 95%)There's no denying Baidu's inclusion here. Its long-term performance has been great. It's a mainland Chinese company, with nearly all of its operations and revenue there. Baidu is the dominant search engine in the world's largest, and still fast growing, Internet market. Global giant Google (GOOG) curbed its China operations a few years ago amid censorship and security issues there.Baidu reports earnings on April 24. Analysts expect earnings per share rose 75% vs. a year earlier. That follows a Q4 2011 EPS rise of 83% as revenue climbed 91%.Baidu shares are near the top of a consolidation that began in July.Apple (AAPL) (3-year EPS growth rate: 68%)The tech titan manufactures and assembles, via suppliers, most of its iPhones, iPads and other amazing gadgets in China. This includes the infamous Foxconn plant with its massive staff, tough working conditions and some headline-grabbing suicides.But China also is a big opportunity market for Apple sales, though it's probably only scratching the surface of its long-term potential there as millions of people join the country's middle class every year.Apple, like Baidu, reports on April 24. Analysts expect quarterly profit rose ""only"" 55%. That follows the eye-popping 116% gain last quarter on the back of a 73% sales rise.Apple shares peaked on April 10, when the stock briefly enjoyed a $600 billion market cap. The stock retreated for five straight sessions but found support above its 50-day line. Apple shares fell early Thursday as an analyst clipped 2012 EPS forecasts but raised the price target.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter: @EdCarson1.

4179,KORS,"Think of some of the themes you've found in leaders in the past few years: technology, retail and high-growth economies. A good number of winners thrived on the wave of at least one of these themes, some enjoyed two.MercadoLibre (MELI) sits in the nexus of all three.The Argentina-based company is a sort of Latin American  eBay (EBAY), operating platforms that allow for auction-style sales and virtual stores in a dozen Latin American and Caribbean countries.MercadoLibre facilitates payments in six of these markets with its MercadoPago system, which works a lot like PayPal.This column in Tuesday's edition noted the rash of retailers that led the market's recent uptrend. They included  Lululemon Athletica (LULU), GNC Holdings (GNC), Tractor Supply (TSCO) and Michael Kors (KORS).Each of these retail stars found a niche to help it stand out. After all, if there's one thing we have no shortage of, it's stores.For example, GNC grabs prime retail space to sell its line of high-priced nutrients to the health-conscious workout crowd. Michael Kors has targeted the concept of affordable luxury fashion. And Lululemon Athletica sells its own line of yoga-themed exercise apparel and accessories.These niches are unique.But MercadoLibre, or the vendors that operate on any of its platforms, can sell anything or everything, just like eBay. What's special about everything?We're really looking at the upside of tapping into a fast-growing emerging market.True, introducing an online business in a region where penetration is rising and has room to grow seems like a winning idea.But that seems a normal part of the bigger story. Latin America is largely a fast-growing region. A middle class is emerging in countries such as Brazil (the region's anchor economy, which accounted for 56% of sales last year). Wealth is being created and spent.Nearly 76 million Brazilians were Internet users as of June 2011, according to Internet World Stats. That's 37.4% of the population. The government says the number of Internet users will grow 13.9% this year.Urban unemployment fell to 4.7% in December, an all-time low.And, crucially, per-capita GDP rose to $11,600 in 2011. That's up 2.6% for the year — and 53% in the past decade.The World Bank says Brazil's economy rose 7.5% in 2010. Credit-rating agency Fitch Ratings said in December that Brazil's GDP likely rose 2.8% in 2011.Morgan Stanley thinks growth will rise to 3.5% this year. The central bank is easing after a series of rate hikes. The new posture should help restore consumption and growth, Morgan Stanley said in December.MercadoLibre earned 47 cents per share in Q4 on sales of $86.5 million. Both results missed estimates, which seems to be traced to currency movements.MercadoLibre's chart shows a flat base developing, and a recently formed handle points to a buy point at 103.08.Volume has been light during the five-week correction, which combines with the tight price action to form a sound pattern.

They were up only 2.5% year over year in 2011's fourth quarter as stores came under big margin pressures from major discounting, rising cotton prices and free shipping, Perkins says.
"
4211,KORS,"This time, retailers are heading into the holiday with well-managed and controlled inventories, he adds. With inventories in good shape and solid demand, Perkins does not expect to see any ""fire sales.""
"
4212,KORS,"Most retailers have kept expansion plans modest lately, Niemira notes. Some, though, are selectively growing their footprint. Department store chain Nordstrom (JWN), for example, is boosting its Nordstrom Rack discount locations as that business thrives. It sees opening 24 Racks in 2013 vs. 15 this year. Dollar stores have also expanded fast, but aren't so sensitive to holiday sales as others.
"
4213,KORS,"""The slow recovery of the last several years has put a damper on expansion in the industry,"" Niemira said of retail generally.
"
4214,KORS,"Store openings have also been limited because developers aren't building many shopping centers.
"
4215,KORS,"""Very few retailers are expanding right now outside of the restaurants,"" Severino said. ""Most are holding off, and the ones who are expanding are keeping things quite modest.""
"
4216,KORS,"Severino expects only about 11 million square feet of space to be absorbed in 2012, but about 21 million in 2013.
"
4217,KORS,"Through the third quarter of 2012, total U.S. retail space has inched up only 0.2% from a year earlier, following a rise of 0.3% for all of 2011 and 0.4% in 2010, Niemira says, citing data from CoStar Realty Information. It's far down from as recently as 2006-08, when yearly growth ranged from 1.8% to 2.2%.
"
4218,KORS,"""Clearly, the pace of expansion has virtually ground to a halt,"" Niemira said. ""But existing holders of retail property find this a plus since less new supply will help to absorb the vacant space more effectively today and generate more rent.""
"
4219,KORS,"Opinions vary on how much weight this holiday season's numbers will carry, in determining whether stores expand assertively or not much at all. But given forecasts for a healthy Christmas season, many analysts expect the numbers to favor expansion, though they don't see a boom in the cards.
"
4220,KORS,"Retailers won't make long-term moves based on a single holiday, Severino says. But if they see 2012 holiday sales are up from, say, 2011 and 2010, they may decide the time is right to capitalize on still-low rents and lease more space.
"
4221,KORS,"Money In The Stocking 
"
4222,KORS,"If forecasts for a 3% to 3.3% rise in 2012 holiday sales are on target, and if retailers are able to hit or exceed expected profit margins on their sales gains, it should give them additional funds to invest in expansion, notes John Bemis, executive vice president at the retail arm of commercial real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL).
"
4223,KORS,"""If sales and margins line up the way they are projected for the 2012 holiday, retailers should have a good profit picture at the end of the holiday and that in turn should drive additional store expansion in 2013,"" Bemis said.
"
4224,KORS,"If a retailer was planning to add perhaps 20 stores in 2013, and it does particularly well over the holiday, that may give it the added funds needed to open 25, he says.
"
4225,KORS,"Typically, a successful holiday season plays a large role in determining a retailer's growth plans for the following year, says Garrick Brown, director of research for retail real estate brokerage ChainLinks Retail Advisors.
"
4226,KORS,"Expanding Tradition
"
4227,KORS,"Take what happened in 2011, after holiday sales came in well above what was forecast. The surprising success of the season helped spur retailer expansion. By the spring, overall unit growth plans for 2012 were up 20% from before the holiday, Brown says.
"
4228,KORS,"This year, he predicts, the holiday won't be as much of a factor in expansion, though it should be a successful season. He says a lot of people are waiting to see what happens with the fiscal cliff. Brown expects holiday 2012 to lift unit growth plans for 2013 by 10% at most by the spring, vs. before the holiday season.
"
4229,KORS,"""When I speak to site selection guys they're all trying to figure out where the tax policy will be next year,"" Brown said. ""Because of that they're postponing doing deals. A lot of people have deals near the finish line, but they're holding off to see what will happen.""
"
4230,KORS,"Also, in the past, the big sales boost resulting from a successful holiday season had been strongest among midpriced mall apparel retailers. But they're not in growth mode because the typical middle-income consumer is still being frugal, Brown says.
"
4231,KORS,"But Bemis says the midpriced store segment is beginning to perform better and should see sales gains for the holidays.
"
4232,KORS,"He says midmarket retailers such as department store Macy's (M), Victoria's Secret's parent Limited Brands (LTD) and teen apparel chain American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) are at a price point that accounts for the majority of stores in shopping centers across the U.S.
"
4233,KORS,"Bright At Both Ends
"
4234,KORS,"The luxury goods segment is also performing extremely well, Bemis says. It includes store operators such as Saks (SKS), Nordstrom and Michael Kors Holdings (KORS). That booming handbag and fashion brand, No. 2 on the IBD 50 list of top companies, has stores on New York's Madison Avenue and in Beverly Hills, Calif., and in malls. It also runs popular discount outlets.
"
4235,KORS,"Value retailers are also still doing extremely well. Discounters Family Dollar Stores (FDO) and Dollar General (DG) will open more stores than other retailers, Bemis says.
"
4236,KORS,"Overall, retail chains — mostly conservative on expansion — are starting to loosen the reins, he says.
"
4237,KORS,"""I expect this slow, steady increase to continue through 2013 and most likely 2014,"" Bemis said. ""But I don't think we will see a huge spike like we saw in 2001.""Are retailers ready to store up? Decisions on whether to open new locations could be swayed by how much cheer consumers deliver during holiday 2012.As Americans start their holiday shopping they'll have yet more online choices, more outlet stores filled with designer goods and the return of seasonal pop-up stores, at a time when retailers and mall owners are trying to squeeze more out of their space than in years past.Predictions call for a solid showing, but not a stellar one. How high or low this year's holiday sales and profit numbers actually come in could steer store planning toward or away from expansion in 2013.""Most prognosticators expect this holiday's retail sales to be better than last year and the trailing 10-year historical average — despite the economy,"" said Ryan Severino, senior economist at real estate research firm Reis (REIS).""With little construction coming online in the fourth quarter, there's some hope that this could translate into at least slightly increased demand for retail space and buttress retail fundamentals,"" he said.November-December brick-and-mortar retailer holiday sales should rise roughly 3% over last year, forecasts Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers. While that would be less than last year's 3.7% gain, it would still amount to a ""relatively healthy"" holiday season, Niemira says, and above the 2.1% 10-year average rise in holiday sales. The data exclude most brick-and-mortar retailers' online sales.Profit Picture Perks UpAnalysts see U.S. retailer fourth-quarter profits rising 13.9% from a year ago, says Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.

"
4239,KORS,"There's no substitute for the fundamentals of solid revenue and profit growth over time, and some companies in Thursday's IBD Stock Screen have more than doubled earnings in just the last few years.Past big market winners showed robust earnings and sales increases before big price moves. For some companies with top gains in the last three years, the stock price has already taken off.Triple-digit surges in quarterly earnings per share are common among the fundamental leaders. Long strings of quarterly double-digit revenue advances also are frequent.Here are the top five.Northern Oil & Gas (NOG)The energy company tops the list but doesn't do the actual drilling or other activities usually associated with oil exploration and production. Instead, it acts as a minority investor in wells, with an exclusive focus on the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana.That's part of the Bakken oil shale formation that has become one of the richest U.S. deposits in recent years, helped by newer but controversial extraction techniques like hydraulic fracturing.A “non-operator,” Northern Oil can avoid operating and overhead costs, allowing the Wayzata, Minn., company to call itself a low-cost producer. Its Q4 earnings report is due early next month, with per-share profit expected to nearly double to 25 cents on revenue of $55 million, up by five times from a year ago.Northern Oil has a 3-year EPS growth rate of 154%.Equinix (EQIX)The data center operator reported Q4 results last week that missed profit expectations. Earnings rose 21% to 35 cents a share, below views of 44 cents. Sales rose 25% to $431.3 million, beating views of $429.8 million.But the stock price barely had a hiccup and promptly continued a rapid climb. It has surged 33% since the start of the year and 60% since October. Demand for data centers has grown with the proliferation of cloud-based services and media-rich content for wireless devices. Equinix plans to expand its geographical reach and rentable space.Equinix has a 3-year EPS growth rate of 118%.Accretive Health (AH)The company provides software and services to help hospitals register patients, track their care, collect bills and verify insurance benefits.With hospitals looking to save money or cope with budget cuts, they have turned to IT tools to improve efficiency. That has meant more business for companies like Accretive. The last three quarters saw per-share earnings jumps of 83%, 71% and 100%. The next report due in early March is expected to show another surge of 78%.Accretive Health has a 3-year EPS growth rate of 116%.Baidu (BIDU)The Chinese search leader dominates the world's largest Internet market and doesn't look like it will lose its grip any time soon. Despite its excellent fundamentals, the stock price has been choppy, retreating since last week's report.It gets most of its revenue from ads placed with search results and expanded its market share after global search leader Google (GOOG) exited the China market over government censorship policies.Last week's Q4 report had profit and revenue that beat analysts' estimates, but Q1 outlook that disappointed. Earning growth has slowed from its triple-digit pace but is still in the 80s.Baidu has a 3-year EPS growth rate of 88%.Michael Kors Holdings (KORS)The luxury apparel and accessory retailer has only been public for a few months and has released only one quarterly report since its December IPO.It also appeared on Tuesday's Young Guns stock screen of leading newly public companies.Its Q3 report easily topped forecasts as the wholesale, retail and licensing divisions all saw growth. Kors guided Q4 profit in line with forecasts, on revenue ahead of predictions.Michael Kors has a 3-year EPS growth rate of 81%.Other companies making the fundamentals screen include megacap Apple (AAPL) and Latin American e-commerce firm MercadoLibre (MELI). Apple has a 3-year EPS growth rate of 62%, with a 122% profit gain in the latest quarter. MercadoLibre has a 3-year growth rate of 68%. It's expected to report a 42% EPS gain to 51 cents for the latest quarter after Thursday's market close.

4264,KORS,"Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 23, before the market opens. The company posted positive earnings surprise of 8.6% in the last reported quarter.Moreover, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 10.4%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to ExpectThe question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this designer, marketer and distributor of premium lifestyle products will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 86 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 3.4%. We note that earnings estimates for the current quarter have been stable in the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.49 billion, down about 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.Ralph Lauren Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ralph Lauren Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ralph Lauren Corporation QuoteRalph Lauren has outperformed the industry in the past year, driven by its positive earnings trend. The company’s shares have surged 53.2%, compared with industry’s gain of 39.1%.Factors at PlayRalph Lauren has a robust surprise trend with positive earnings surprises delivered in 12 straight quarters. The company has been gaining from favorable geographic and channel-mix shifts along with lower promotions and reduced product costs. Additionally, results in the recent quarters have been gaining from foreign currency tailwinds.The company adjusted fiscal 2018 outlook to account positive currency rates, which are likely to aid revenues and operating margins. Further, the outlook for fiscal fourth-quarter reflects optimism. The company expects fiscal fourth-quarter reported revenues to be down 8-10%, excluding currency impact. The company anticipates foreign currency to aid revenue growth by nearly 330 basis points (bps). Though it expects operating margin to decline 240-260 bps on a currency-neutral basis, foreign currency is likely to boost operating margin by about 90 bps in the fiscal fourth quarter.Including ASU 2016-09, the tax rate is expected to be nearly 3% in the quarter under review, driven by lower U.S. federal statutory income tax, owing to the new tax reform.Furthermore, Ralph Lauren remains focused to deliver goals under its Way Forward Plan while bolstering digital and international presence. Additionally, it is well on track with its restructuring plan, which is likely to generate savings of roughly $140 million by the end of fiscal 2019. These restructuring activities include rightsizing the portfolio and cost-structure alongside streamlining the organizational structure. All these factors make us optimistic about Ralph Lauren’s upcoming results.However, the company’s North America business continues to suffer due to distribution and brand exits, a planned reduction in shipments and promotions to enhance the quality of sales, and lower customer demand.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ralph Lauren is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Ralph Lauren currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. The combination of the company’s Zacks Rank and Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.82% and a Zacks Rank #2.

4265,KORS,"After reporting a positive earnings surprise of 14.3% in the final quarter of 2017, Office Depot, Inc. (ODP  -  Free Report) delivered in line earnings in the first quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, the top line came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third straight quarter.Favorable results and strategic initiatives, including strengthening of core businesses and expansion of service and subscription offerings, prompted management to provide an encouraging outlook for 2018. This led the stock to rise as much as 9% during pre-market trading hours.Moreover, improvement in Business Solutions and CompuCom divisions is also likely to benefit the company going forward. The company has undertaken a strategic review of business operating model, growth prospects and cost structure and concentrating on e-commerce platforms. Management is also making incremental investments to catapult it into a product and services-driven enterprise. Service revenue now represents approximately 14% of the total sales.The company is trying all means to give itself a complete makeover. This seems evident as demand for office products (paper-based) has been decreasing due to technological advancements. Smartphones, tablets and laptops are fast emerging as viable substitutes for paper-based office supplies. Further, stiff competition from online retailers such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and lower traffic count in retail stores have been playing spoilsport.The reflection of the same is quite visible from this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s performance in the bourses. In the past three months, shares of the company have nosedived 20.4%, wider than the industry’s decline of 1.1%.Office Depot, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Office Depot, Inc.

Operating income came in at $55 million, down from $58 million reported in the year-ago period. Operating margin shrunk 30 bps to 4.1%. The fall in the operating income was due to conversion costs and additional marketing investments.In the reported quarter, the Retail Division’s sales fell 8% to $1,244 million on account of planned closure of stores and adoption of the new revenue recognition standard that lower revenue by approximately $30 million. Comparable-store sales (comps) drop 4% due to lower transactions and fall in average order values. Segment operating income came in at $72 million, down from $112 million in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year decrease can be attributed to fall in sales and increased marketing and advertising investments. Operating margin decreased 240 bps to 5.8%.Total store count at the division was 1,376 at the quarter end.

The S&P Global Luxury Index rose 27.9% last year. Interestingly, the personal luxury goods market grew globally in 2017, driven by robust local consumption and tourist purchases.

Higher wages, a low jobless rate and upbeat consumer confidence, all indicate a bullish economy.Moreover, U.S. consumer confidence touched 128.7 in April, surpassing expectations of 126 and recovering from its fall in March. Also, U.S. consumer spending is once again increasing as evident from a retail sales rise in April.

4269,KORS,"Year 2018 so far has been marked by increased government borrowing costs. This is especially true as growing inflationary pressure is building up the case for aggressive rate hikes, pushing yields higher. According to CME, there is 51% chance of four interest rates hike this year.The 10-year Treasury yields, which are a key driver of global borrowing costs, jumped to a 7-year high of 3.12%. The latest spike came on the heels of higher oil price, which is back to $80 per barrel level, and upbeat April retail sales. Worries about growing supply of government debt are also causing the spike in yields (read: ETF Strategies to Play the 7-Year High Benchmark Yield).Pros and ConsA rising rate environment is highly beneficial for cyclical sectors like financial, technology, industrials and consumer discretionary. Banks are at the most advantageous position as they seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates. If interest rates rise, banks would be able to earn more on lending and pay less on deposits. This would expand net margins and bolster banks’ profits. Also, insurance companies are able to earn higher returns on their investment portfolio of longer-duration bonds.Higher interest rates usually indicate a healthy economy, which in turn leads to greater consumer power. An improving economy coupled with higher consumer confidence is making the consumer discretionary sector tempting to investors amid higher yields. The technology sector should benefit as rising interest rates usually correlate with an economy that is gaining strength and is expected to grow at a faster pace, leading to increased IT spending (read: 5 Niche Tech ETFs Hitting All-Time Highs).Although higher rates would attract more capital to the country, boosting the U.S. dollar against the basket of other currencies, it would have a huge impact on commodity-linked investments, implying that a rising rate environment will hurt a number of segments. In particular, high dividend paying sectors such as utilities and real estate would be the worst hit, given their higher sensitivity to rising interest rates. Additionally, securities in capital-intensive sectors like telecom would also be impacted by higher rates.Further, higher rates would also result in tighter lending conditions and curtail consumer spending on a wide range of products like cars and houses. This will in turn dent profitability across various segments. Further, businesses will also face higher loan rates over time.Given this, we have highlighted ETFs & stocks from the sectors that will benefit from higher rates and the ones that will be badly impacted.Sectors to WinFinancialsThe ultra-popular Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report), with AUM of $32.9 billion and average daily volume of 61.6 million shares, offers broad exposure to the sector with banks making up for 44.9% of the portfolio.

4270,KORS,"Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 8, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 29.2%. Moreover, Myriad Genetics beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average being 20.2%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors Influencing Q3 ResultsSimilar to last quarter, Myriad Genetics is expected to gain from strong Molecular Diagnostics performance, led by solid contributions from the GeneSight, EndoPredict and Prolaris tests.Per the company, the GeneSight test represents significant opportunities. As GeneSight is placed in a highly under-penetrated preventive care market, the product has huge growth potential. Management expects consistent growth in GeneSight test revenues in the quarters ahead.Myriad Genetics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Myriad Genetics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Myriad Genetics, Inc. QuoteWe also encouragingly note that, over the last few months, Myriad Genetics has been making encouraging progress with the EndoPredict test. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the company announced the finalization of LCD from Noridian for EndoPredict, thereby expanding the total coverage to around 90% of the U.S. market.  Further, in fiscal 2017, the company received reimbursement approval for EndoPredict in France, Quebec and in some additional German sites. Moreover, according to Myriad Genetics, EndoPredict presents a global market opportunity of more than $600 million annually, with high demand in countries like Canada and the United States.Further, management’s expectations of double-digit volume growth in fiscal 2018 for GeneSight, Vectra DA and Prolaris, all of these make up the chunk of the Molecular Diagnostics portfolio, buoys optimism.The Prolaris testing volumes grew double digits in the last reported quarter as well. We are also encouraged by the company’s receipt of a positive final Local Coverage Determination to expand Medicare coverage of the Prolaris test from Palmetto GBA in the first half of 2017. Moreover, management seems upbeat about the prospects of the Prolaris test as it represents a global market opportunity of approximately $1.5 billion annually. We expect Myriad Genetics to continue to witness year-over-year growth in Hereditary Cancer volumes. Moreover, the last reported quarter was the fourth consecutive quarter, where the volume growth was led by encouraging response to the newly launched riskScore test under its myRisk Hereditary Cancer testing portfolio.  Management believes that the company is well-positioned in the breast cancer testing space for fiscal 2018, courtesy of encouraging Hereditary cancer volumes on steady growth and predictable long-term pricing. Thus, we believe the company is positioned to cash in on the huge potential in the breast cancer screening market.On the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency translation continues to pose threat. With a considerable portion of revenues coming from outside the United States, the company faces the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, macroeconomic uncertainty and higher expenses owing to lengthy pipeline approvals might dent margins.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter revenues of $188 million reflects a decline of 4.5% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Myriad Genetics is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Geographically, the company gained traction in North America and overseas. We expect the trend to continue in the first quarter.Favorable Dental Business Trend: The company’s strategy to expand digital dentistry globally is encouraging.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter total revenues of $3.17 billion reflects an increase of 8.6% from the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, we are also upbeat about management’s expectations about the sustained dental equipment business growth in Europe and other regions.Henry Schein is busy promoting digital workflows for general dentistry as well as dental specialties. Starting Sep 1, 2017, the company started selling the full range of DENTSPLY SIRONA’s (XRAY  -  Free Report) dental equipment across North America, including the leading CEREC CAD/CAM restoration system. This is expected to boost the top line to a considerable extent. Also, per management, this agreement is expected to prove accretive to earnings per share from this year onward. Thus, we are looking forward to the deal’s contribution to Henry Schein’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Henry Schein, Inc. Quote In addition, Henry Schein continues to distribute products from Planmeca, 3Shape and 3M as well as the dental equipment and consumer product lines of its longstanding partner Danaher under the KaVo Kerr brands.Solid Animal Health Portfolio: We are optimistic about the well-diversified Animal Health product portfolio featuring software, diagnostic equipment and surgical instruments. The product offerings have been driving growth domestically as well as globally.Notably, during the fourth quarter of 2017, Henry Schein acquired Merritt Veterinary Supplies and integrated it into its Animal Health business. Merritt has 4,500 veterinary clinics in Eastern United States, with a strong presence in the Southeastern part of the nation. The company offers a comprehensive line of products, including pharmaceuticals, diagnostics and equipment. However, according to Henry Schein, this acquisition will drive earnings this year onward. Thus, we are looking forward to the deal’s contribution to Henry Schein’s financials in the to-be-reported quarter.Growing Medical Business: Henry Schein is consistently working on boosting its Medical segment. Notably, worldwide Medical revenues rose 2.6% year over year in the fourth quarter. Last October, the company inked an agreement with Cerebral Assessment Systems to distribute Cognivue. This is the first computerized cognitive assessment screening device cleared by the FDA for the detection of early signs of dementia. We believe this development will bolster the company’s presence in the field of mental cognitive diseases.Broad Distribution Network: We are also upbeat about the company’s widespread distribution network. Apart from North America and Europe, the company has presence in Australia and New Zealand as well as in the emerging nations of China, Brazil, Israel, Czech Republic and Poland. We believe Henry Schein will continue to ride on the strength of its broad distribution network in the to-be-reported quarter.Further, at the beginning of March, Henry Schein signed a distribution agreement with Grifols, enabling the former to market and distribute the latter's 500mL Normal Saline solution (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) in the United States. With growing demand for saline products in the U.S. market, we believe this partnership will prove beneficial for Henry Schein.On the flip side, Henry Schein’s disappointing gross and operating margin performance over the past few quarters due to higher cost of sales and expenses is a matter of concern.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show a beat for Henry Schein is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Henry Schein has an Earnings ESP of -0.36%.Zacks Rank: Henry Schein carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 92 cents reflects a rise of 4.5% year over year.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Brady Corporation (BRC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.03% and a Zacks Rank #2.

4275,KORS,"In the investment field we cannot scoop up handsome returns if we shy away from risky stocks. The strategy is true to some extent, especially when the market is bullish. But, we should also be ready to accept huge loss if the market turns bearish.We have developed an investment strategy which clearly shows that lucrative returns can also be generated from less risky stocks. This may sound surprising but it is true.Meaning of BetaBeta measures the volatility or risk of a particular asset in comparison to the market. In other words, beta measures the extent of a security’s price movement relative to the market. In this article, we are considering the S&P 500 as the market.If a stock has beta of 1 then the price of the stock will move with the market. So, the stock is more volatile than the market if its beta is more than 1. In the same way, the stock is not as volatile as the market if its beta is less than 1.For example, if the market offers a return of 20%, a stock with beta of 3 will return 60%, which is overwhelming. Similarly, when the market slips 20% the stock will sink 60%, which is devastating.The Winning StrategyWe have taken beta between 0 and 0.6 as our prime criterion for screening stocks that are less volatile than the market. But this should not be the only factor to be considered while selecting a winning strategy. We need to take into account other parameters that can add value to the portfolio.Percentage Change in Price in the Last 4 Weeks greater than zero: This ensures that the stocks saw positive price movement over the last one month.Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable.Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Here are five of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:Based in New York, G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (GIII  -  Free Report) is a leading designer of apparel for men and women. The company managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters.

4278,KORS,"As we enter the month of May, the current economic expansion has just become the second longest in U.S. history. Currently, the Fed is meeting to deliberate whether to raise rates, as part of the process of winding down monetary stimulus, which largely fueled a turnaround. But at 106 months, or eight years and 10 months, the current economic expansion shows no signs of cooling off. Experts believe that the low and slow nature of this expansion is the primary reason for its longevity. Several sectors such as investment and housing are facing multiple headwinds at this point. But low unemployment and resilient consumption levels are likely to remain constant in the near future. This is why it makes sense to add hiring and consumer discretionary stocks to your portfolios.Slow & Steady Pace Fuels LongevityImmediately, after the 2008 crisis, individuals and corporations alike were unwilling to accept high levels of risk. After all, debt taken on during the last boom period was still being worked off. The severity of the last economic crisis was such that investment occurred at a slow and steady pace.The slow pace of growth and sluggish inflation helped the Federal Reserve maintain a low rate environment for an extended period. This helped equity markets to expand to levels near four times higher than those witnessed during March 2009, when they hit rock bottom. The gradual nature of growth is possibly why economists don’t think that a near-term recession is in the offing. Most of them believe that the recovery will extend until July 2019, which would make it the longest on record.Labor Market Strong, Consumption SteadyHowever, several components of GDP are facing serious challenges at present. For instance, Trump’s trade-related actions versus China could significantly impair business investment. Further, the spike in materials prices due to Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum could impede manufacturing. Soaring home prices and mortgage rates are also threatening the housing recovery.But a strong labor market and, consequently, steady consumption levels are likely to fuel growth in the future. Though evidence of higher inflation has recently become available, the cost of living remains more or less constant. Economists believe that this factor along with tax cuts and strong hiring will fuel household spending. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remains at a 17-year low of 4.1%, one which usually signifies full employment. Fresh evidence of wage growth has also become recently available.Our ChoicesThe current economic expansion has just become the second longest on record. A slow and steady level of growth is likely to ensure its longevity, at least until next year. A strong labor market and steady consumption levels are likely to fuel growth in the future.Investing in consumer discretionary and hiring stocks looks like a winning option at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM Score.Las Vegas Sands Corp.

This represents a year-over-year change of 6.21% and 6.39%, respectively.Valuation MetricsWhile KORS has moved to its 52-week high in the recent past, investors need to be asking, what is next for the company? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well.

Thus, it seems as though KORS shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does Michael Kors Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Michael Kors Holdings Limited have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Columbia Sportswear Company (COLM  -  Free Report), Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report), and PVH (PVH  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 25% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for KORS, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

4282,KORS,"Shares of Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) have underperformed the industry in the past three months. The stock has gained 1.7%, underperforming the industry’s rise of 12.9%. Analysts pointed that year-over-year decline in the bottom line during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 hurt investor sentiment. Further, the company continues to witness dismal wholesale segment performance. Along with these, the contraction in margin adds to the woes.To overcome these bottlenecks, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been constantly deploying resources to expand product offerings, open stores and upgrade the e-commerce platform. The company’s project Runway 2020 strategic plan, which focuses on product innovation, brand engagement and customer experience, is well on track as well.What Hurt the Stock?Dismal Wholesale Segment PerformanceWe note that the wholesale segment continues to lack luster. After declining 8.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, wholesale revenues were down 3.2% (or 6.1% on a constant currency basis) in the final quarter. The company now expects wholesale revenue decline in the mid-single digits during fiscal 2019. The company has been strategically slowing down its promotional activity, which has resulted in lower shipments within the wholesale channel. Meanwhile, licensing revenues plunged 11.1% in the fourth quarter. The company expects the same to decline in the high single-digits on account of transition to a more elevated jewelry line and fashion watch trends.Soft MarginsMichael Kors continues to invest heavily in new store openings, expand existing outlets and fortify international operations, digital flagships and global infrastructure. As a result, operating costs are expected to rise, which may compress margins. Operating margin contracted 110 basis points to 13.1% in the final quarter of fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2019, management expects operating margin to decline 100 basis points to 17.7%.Initiatives Adopted to Lift the Stock’s PerformanceThis London, UK-based company’s commitment toward deploying resources to expand product offerings, build “shop-in-shops”, and upgrade its information system and distribution infrastructure should drive sales. This along with the “Runway 2020” plan, cost containment efforts, inventory management, focus on e-commerce platform and accretive buyouts such as that of Jimmy Choo bode well. Moreover, Michael Kors is also expanding its product mix beyond handbags, into men’s, footwear and women’s ready to wear.Meanwhile, the acquisition of Jimmy Choo has provided Michael Kors avenues for international growth, strong base in the luxury footwear segment and diversification of product portfolio. With a network of more than 240 stores, Jimmy Choo has a strong presence in Europe, the Middle East, the Americas and Asia.Management sees opportunity to boost Jimmy Choo sales to $1 billion annually and operating margin rate growth in the low teens over the long haul. We believe that the company may pursue other such strategic buyouts in the future.Michael Kors’ Runway 2020 strategic plan, which focuses on product innovation, brand engagement, fleet modernization, digital innovation and customer experience, has been progressing well.3 Stocks Hogging the LimelightLululemon Athletica Inc.

Thus, it is well-positioned for persistent growth and improved profitability over the next five years.Focus on E-commercelululemon remains committed toward enhancing the e-commerce retailing channel and investing in the innovation of new product categories, and bringing improvements to its website. These efforts are contributing to the results, as direct-to-consumer (DTC) comparable-store sales (comps) surged 26% in third-quarter fiscal 2017. Notably, comps growth at DTC stemmed from double-digit increases in traffic and transactions alongside solid conversions this year. Moreover, the company anticipates the process improvements to aid double-digit growth for digital business in the fourth quarter, and into 2018 and beyond. It also remains on track to deliver $4 billion in revenues by 2020.Ivivva Remodeling Looks Promisinglululemon is progressing well with the remodeling of its ivivva business into an online brand as announced in June 2017. Furthermore, the company intends to develop ivivva, its activewear brand, into an e-commerce focused business, with only eight ivivva stores operating across North America. This apart, it revealed plans to close about 40 of the total 55 ivivva stores and convert nearly half of the remaining stores into lululemon branded stores. In fact, this strategy will enable the company to continue offering the brand to its young patrons globally, which in turn is likely to be accretive to productivity, comps and earnings throughout fiscal 2017.Raised Q4 Guidancelululemon emerged strong this holiday season driven by accelerating trends across all parts of its businesses. Further, the company anticipates business strength and current trends to sustain throughout 2018 and beyond. Consequently, the company raised its fiscal fourth-quarter guidance. Currently, it envisions net revenues in the range of $905-$915 million compared with $870-$885 million anticipated earlier. Earnings are anticipated in a band of $1.24-$1.26 per share while adjusted earnings per share (excluding effects of restructuring ivivva operations) are expected to lie within the $1.25-$1.27 range. This marks a considerable improvement from the previously projected earnings of $1.18-$1.21 per share and adjusted earnings of $1.19-$1.22 per share. For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.27.All said, we believe that lululemon’s afore-mentioned initiatives as well as focus on 2020 strategy should keep its spectacular show on and drive the stock’s performance.Not Done Yet?

4287,KORS,"Consumers, who are the core of all economic activity, have shown profound optimism lately as is evident from the increased consumer confidence, consumer spending and stable job scenario. Consumers’ favorable position also reflects a steady U.S. economy, which is poised for growth.The commerce department revealed that annual gross domestic product (GDP) rose 3.3% in third-quarter 2017 (second estimate), above the advance reading of 3% and up from 3.1% growth in the preceding quarter. This growth was supported by increases in consumer spending, inventory investment, business investment, and exports.Consumer spending rose 2.3% in the third quarter. Further, initial holiday period sales data (during the Thanksgiving weekend) suggests that consumers are increasingly spending on restaurants, clothing, electronics, fuel and groceries in November.Moreover, consumers’ optimism is well reflected in the Consumer Confidence data, which increased for the fifth straight month and remains at a 17-year high in November. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index surged to 129.5 in November from October’s reading of 126.2.A major reason for the high consumer confidence is consumers’ expectations of further improvement in labor market. Notably, the labor market remains attractive with a gradual decline in unemployment rate. The unemployment rate has gone down significantly to 4.1% in November from 4.8% in January.The uptick in the U.S. economy is well supported by the bullish run of the stock markets in 2017. Major stock indices Nasdaq Composite Index, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average registered year-to-date growths of 15.2%, nearly 20% and 24.3%, respectively. Not surprisingly, investors can make the most of this market momentum by investing in stocks that have crushed these indices in 2017.Why Consumer Discretionary Sector?Well, spending on discretionary items which form a part of the Consumer Discretionary sector is largely dependent on consumers’ spending appetite. Given the favorable background discussed above, consumers are currently willing to spend on discretionary items like durable goods, apparel, entertainment and leisure, and automobiles.The Consumer Discretionary sector growth trends since the start of 2017 have been very appeasing. Markedly, the sector recorded 17.1% growth year to date, slightly lagging the 19.9% upside of the S&P 500. Further, it carries a Zacks Sector Rank of #9 (out of 16).Hence, there lies an opportunity to invest in Consumer Discretionary stocks that have outpaced major indices, to make the best of the improving economic situation.5 Consumer Stocks that Outpaced the MarketThat said, we bring five Consumer Discretionary stocks that not only outpaced the market in 2017 but are expected to outperform in the coming years.

4290,KORS,"With splendid Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales behind us, the enthusiasm for the upcoming holiday season is definitely on a high. The holiday season is an opportunity for retailers to make good the lost sales over the past year. The favorable economic data be it GDP growth, unemployment rate or Consumer Confidence, all indicate that this year’s holiday season is going to be a Christmas feast for both consumers and the retailers.This enthusiasm was clearly visible in the earnings of most apparel retailers, which reported earnings in the past few weeks. These leading apparel sellers have been spurred by the initial holiday sales in the Thanksgiving weekend, and consequently provided a robust outlook for the fourth quarter while raising their guidance for fiscal 2017.Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) is one such stock that not only came up with solid third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, but also raised forecasts for fiscal 2017. The company reported both top and bottom-line beat in the third quarter. While this marked the company’s third consecutive earnings beat, sales topped estimates for the eighth straight quarter. (Read More: Lululemon Jumps on Q3 Earnings & Sales Beat, Ups View)Much of this improvement can be attributed to the consumers’ favorable response to Lululemon’s product innovations, solid direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) sales, focus on supply chain initiatives and the company’s commitment to its long-term strategy. Further, the company is on track with the remodeling of its ivivva business into an online brand, as announced in June 2017.Taking into consideration the incredible enthusiasm for the holiday season along with efforts to build supply chain network and e-commerce business, the company remains hopeful about the coming quarters.The company witnessed an improvement in store traffic in both the United States and Canada through the first five weeks of the fiscal fourth quarter due to the initial holiday season fervor.

This will help in capturing really good business during the holiday season.Further, it expects the momentum across business channels since the start of the fourth quarter to continue through the holiday season. These factors and a favorable third-quarter led the company to provide an encouraging view for the fourth quarter and raise guidance for fiscal 2017.Notably, this yoga apparel retailer has gained 19.7% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 5.7%. Further, the company has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 11.1%.

4291,KORS,"Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, before the opening bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this marketer and distributor of apparel, footwear and accessories will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at a loss of 5 cents, wider than the loss of a penny reported a year ago. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.12 billion, almost flat with the year-ago quarter figure.Under Armour, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Under Armour, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Under Armour, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayFor the first quarter, management expects revenues to decline or remain flat in comparison to the year-ago quarter. Further, the company envisions loss per share in the range 6-7 cents on the back of adjusted operating loss of nearly $15 million.We believe that the prolonged weakness in the North American business is likely to tarnish first-quarter results. The company has been reporting sluggish sales from the region since fourth-quarter 2016. In fourth-quarter 2017, sales in North America declined 4.5%. The dismal show can be attributed to bankruptcies, store closures, decreased productivity and demand along with shift in fashion preference.Additionally, gross margin has been consistently shrinking in the past few quarters. In fourth-quarter 2017, the metric contracted 140 basis points (bps) to 45% following a decline of 130, 190 and 70 bps in the third, second and first quarter, respectively. Management expectsgross margin to remain flat in the first quarter of 2018.Further, Under Armour has been struggling to keep interest expenses in check. In fourth-quarter 2017, the company’s interest and other expenses rose to nearly $12 million in comparison with $10 million in the prior-year quarter. Further, it anticipates interest and other expenses to rise around $45 million in 2018 from $38.2 million last year.Nevertheless, Under Armour’s sustained focus on brand development, restructuring plans, expansion of direct-to-consumer and technology-based fitness businesses seem favorable. The company’s continuous efforts to innovate are also full of promise.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Under Armour this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen.Under Armour has an Earnings ESP of +7.22%.  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.However, the company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Guess', Inc.

4292,KORS,"Consumer confidence has rebounded in April to indicate that the economy is in fine fettle. Though the increase reported appears minor, the metric is now close to the record level achieved in February. A concurrent rebound in new home sales indicates that though a slowdown is likely during the first quarter, it is likely only temporary in nature.  This report comes at a time when markets are passing through an extended period of turmoil. Its timing, therefore, could not be better, since it indicates that the economy remains resilient in the face of several worries. Investing in consumer discretionary stocks at this point looks like an extremely smart option.Index Nears 17-Year High Achieved in FebruaryThe Consumer Confidence Index increased from 127 in March to 128.7 in April. This was also better than the consensus estimate that the metric would decline to 126.2 this month. In March, consumer confidence had declined, snapping a two-month long winning streak. With this increase, the index is only marginally below the level of 130 achieved in February, a level last witnessed in late 2000.  Coming to the details of the report, the proportion of respondents expecting a short-term decline in their incomes declined from 7.2% to 6.8%, the lowest level witnessed since December 2000. The Present Situation Index, a measure of current conditions, improved from 158.1 to 159.6. Meanwhile, the Expectations Index, which gauges future expectations, also advanced from 106.2 to 108.1. Housing Data Upbeat, Q1 Slowdown Likely TemporaryAdding to investors’ optimism was a jump in new home sales, which increased by 4% to a seasonally adjusted rate of 694,000 units in March. February’s figure was also revised significantly upward while January’s data was revised to reflect that sales remain static instead of falling by 4.7%.This report has probably failed to change economists’ opinions on how residential investment fared in the first quarter. But it does indicate that a widely anticipated dip in economic expansion during the first quarter is likely only temporary in nature.Recently released economic data certainly support such a view. This includes strong readings on retail sales and IHS Markit PMIs. Additionally, analysts at Nomura Holdings (NMR) think that the anticipated slip in economic growth will only be transitory. Despite this decline, real GDP growth will amount to 2.7% in 2018, according to Nomura. Our ChoicesThe rebound in consumer confidence is fresh evidence of the fact that the economy retains its resilience in the midst of several headwinds. Investors are also likely to gain solace from strong economic data even as equity markets pass through a volatile phase.With the economy on a firm footing and consumer confidence near record levels, investing in consumer discretionary stocks looks like a profitable option. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

4293,KORS,"Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL  -  Free Report) has been a solid investment pick for quite a while now as it continues to portray a strong earnings trend, backed by smooth progress on the Way Forward Plan alongside strategic efforts to expand digital and international presence. The cumulative effect of these efforts is clearly visible in its price performance graph, which continues to scale up despite all odds.The company’s shares showed remarkable growth in the past year, which is mostly reflective of positive earnings surprise trend. Notably, it topped earnings estimates in 12 straight quarters. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock surged 44.3% in the past year, outperforming the industry's growth of 30.3%.Additionally, the stock grew nearly 7% in the past month, indicative of the positive sentiment, even two months after the third-quarter fiscal 2018 results that released on Feb 1. This is further justified by the positive estimate revisions witnessed in a month’s span.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 climbed to $5.98 per share from prior estimate of $5.93 in the past month. Moreover, estimates for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 reflect a gain of 1 cent and 2 cents, respectively, to 86 cents per share and $6.12 per share in the last 7 days.Let’s analyze some more factors that are acting as catalysts.Growth CatalystsRalph Lauren remains on track to deliver goals under its Way Forward Plan that was announced in June 2016. Divided into two parts, the plan is all about refocusing on the core, strengthening the brands and returning the company to profitable growth in the long term. Reflecting its commitment to the core business, the company has been keen on improving assortments by discontinuing unproductive styles. It is focused on curtailing the number of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) alongside closing down underperforming stores.Further, Ralph Lauren is on track to reduce its supply chain lead times to improve sales quality and curtail markdowns. It is also focused on lowering inventories to keep it on par with demand. Apart from this, Ralph Lauren is well on track with the restructuring plan, which is likely to generate savings of roughly $140 million by the end of fiscal 2019. These restructuring activities include rightsizing the portfolio and cost-structure, alongside streamlining the organizational structure.Coming to digital and international growth, Ralph Lauren sees immense growth potential in Asia, where it is building a strong business foundation and elevating the brand for the past two years. With nearly 15% of its business in Asia, the company is currently underpenetrated in the region and sees numerous growth opportunities ahead. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, its constant-currency revenues in Asia grew 7% while comparable sales (comps) improved 3%.Going forward, the company expects Mainland China to be a major contributor to growth in Asia due to lower penetration and strong brand awareness. Moreover, it is continually expanding both online and physical presence in China while also focusing on marketing and distribution. By the end of fiscal 2018, it plans to have total 60 stores in Mainland China. Moreover, in the next five years, it targets generating nearly $0.5 billion of revenues in Greater China, including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.As already said, these efforts have greatly influenced the company’s positive earnings stream in the last 12 quarters. Looking ahead, management remains confident about Ralph Lauren’s performance, based on its efforts related to global brand reorganization and constant infrastructural investments. Also, management lowered its effective tax rate forecast for fiscal 2018, which should benefit the bottom line.Bottom LineRalph Lauren is a sure-shot winner in all aspects. However, we cannot ignore the mishaps in the North America business, which is hurting revenues. Lower retail and wholesale sales at home, due to distribution and brand-exits, the planned reduction in shipments and promotions to enhance the quality of sales, and lower customer demand, have been pressing concerns for the company.Nonetheless, we believe that the company has been taking the necessary initiatives to revive the segment. Its Way Forward Plan should take care of this hurdle, helping the stock to retain its solid market position.Looking for Trending Apparel Picks?

4294,KORS,"Driehaus strategy is generally based on the ""buy high and sell higher"" principle. Using this strategy, investors with high-risk appetite can play momentum stocks. Following the success of this investment approach, the developer of this strategy Richard Driehaus earned a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.Portfolios such as that of The American Association of Individual Investors (“AAII”) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five and 10- year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns for the S&P 500. Thus, investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy.A Look at Driehaus’ StrategyAfter a detailed study of the Driehaus’ strategy, AAII concluded that it mainly focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive prospects to pick potential outperformers. While this strategy was made to provide better returns over the longer haul, companies with a strong history of beating estimates were also given importance.“I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around,” Driehaus had said in an interview.Screening ParametersThe percentage 50-day moving average is one of the key criteria in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend. It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator – positive relative strength – has also been included in this strategy. In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have only considered those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as well as a momentum score of ‘A’ or ‘B’. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1(Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through.

4295,KORS,"Fossil Group, Inc. (FOSL  -  Free Report) has been nothing less than a gold mine for investors since the beginning of 2018. Well, shares of this renowned watchmaker more than tripled in the past six months compared with the industry’s rise of 5.7%. So, what’s boosting investors’ optimism for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock? Let’s take a look.Wearables Offer Growth ImpetusFossil owes much of its success to the stupendous growth in connected wearables category. In fact, the introduction of technology in watches has led the company to expand its brands and offer customers new functionality with products such as activity trackers, hybrid watches as well as smart watches. Notably, the company is benefiting from Android’s popularity and Google’s technology in its watches. Recently, Fossil launched approximately 14 new hybrid and smartwatches across several brands.Driven by such efforts, the company’s connected watch sales almost doubled year over year in the first quarter of 2018. Also, wearables represented roughly 20% of the company’s total watch sales in the quarter, marking a steady improvement from 8% in the year-ago quarter. This along with solid marketing efforts and initiatives to enhance store experience enabled Fossil brand sales to grow 4%. Strength in wearables also propelled online sales, ultimately leading to a 5% rise in the company’s global retail comps.As the wearable business is expected to grow by $32 billion by 2020, the company is well placed to reap benefits by adding brands to its smartwatch line-up in 2018. Progressing along these lines, Fossil plans to launch three smartwatch formats in 2018 (across owned and licensed brands). Well, the wearables market provides the opportunity to combine fashion and technology as well as introduce exciting products to cater to consumers’ evolving needs of tech-enabled advanced connected gears. Currently, the company’s wearables segment is adorned by renowned brands such as Diesel, Emporio Armani, Fossil, Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) and Misfit.E-commerce & Other Initiatives Bode WellFossil has been witnessing significant growth in e-commerce operations, backed by consumers’ growing preference for online shopping. Notably, e-commerce sales during the first quarter soared close to 50%, buoyed by growth in Europe, United States and Asia. Fossil remains keen on expanding its digital platform and meet growing demand for online transactions. To this end, the company has been making several investments to improve digital marketing for the company’s website and other online wholesale partners. Further, the success with wearables is expected to constantly bolster the company’s online sales.Moving on, Fossil is well on track with its New World Fossil plan which helped it cut operating costs and drive gross margin in the first quarter. On the back of this initiative as well as other strategic plans, the company expects to achieve gross profit improvement of $200 million by the end of 2019.  Also, it targets to achieve double-digit operating margin over the long term.Can Fossil Offset Decline in Traditional Watches?While Fossil’s wearables unit has been performing impressively, it does not blind us from the persistent weakness in the company’s traditional watches category. The company’s watch sales dropped 6% (on constant-currency basis) mainly due to sluggishness in the traditional category. Unfortunately, the company expects this segment to witness such pressures in 2018.Nevertheless, Fossil’s prospects in the connected products category combined with efforts to boost e-commerce and improve margins are expected to aid the company in overcoming the aforementioned obstacles in the long run. On that note, we continue to hope that Fossil maintains its position in investors’ good books.Need More Retail Stocks?

4296,KORS,"Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) has been facing multiple challenges from rising competition and evolving trends in the apparel space. This has dampened investors’ sentiments, which is evident from the stock’s 10.2% decline against the industry’s rally of 26.1%. In fact, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company hit a 52-week low of $17.94 during the trading session on Apr 2, eventually closing at $18.18.On the flip side, other players like Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report), Lululemon Athletica (LULU  -  Free Report) and PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) have been delivering stellar performance and contributing toward the industry’s rally on the back of well-chalked strategies to stay competitive.  Let’s take a closer look at the factors that have made Hanesbrands the odd pick and see if there’s any scope for a turnaround.What’s Pulling Hanesbrands?After posting in-line earnings in the preceding two quarters, the company succumbed to a negative surprise in the fourth quarter of 2017. Moreover, earnings fell year over year, thanks to higher cost of sales and higher SG&A expenses as well as interest expense. An improvement in the top line failed to cushion the downtrend. Further, adjusted operating profit slipped 7.7% with the operating margin contracting 180 bps, due to higher SG&A expenses.  Apart from this, we note that the Intimate Apparel/Innerwear industry is highly competitive and price sensitive. The company’s strategy to focus more on premium brands and hike prices in these categories come with the inherent risk of consumers shifting to more competitively-priced brands offered by competitors. Thus, failure to offer high-quality distinguished products at competitive price may hamper Hanesbrands’ market share, resulting in lower earnings and sales.Moreover, to add to investor’s disappointment, management continues to be cautious about 2018, given a challenging U.S. wholesale landscape. Also, rising input costs and increased marketing investments to support new innovations are likely to affect margins. Incidentally, management expects operating margin for the first half of 2018 to be hurt by escalated marketing and distribution costs.  Any Hopes of a Turnaround?We are hopeful about the company’s focus on buyouts, evident from its recent acquisition of Bras N Things that is likely to augment earnings in 2018. In this regard, the company has been gaining from contributions from Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia that were acquired in 2016.Additionally, the company has long been benefitting from the solid performance of its international segment, driven by store openings, robust consumer demand and extensive online sales. Moreover, management is focused on making investments and innovations, internationally, to sustain growth in this segment. Also, Hanesbrands’ organic sales growth during the fourth quarter has been encouraging. For 2018, the company projects organic sales growth at roughly 1% on a constant-currency basis.While the aforementioned factors make us hopeful about Hanesbrands’ revival, it is to be seen if these drivers can actually place the company in tandem with other industry gainers.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

4297,KORS,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 10.6% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is KORS due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Michael Kors Beat Earnings and Sales Estimates in Q4Michael Kors Holdings Limited maintained its positive earnings surprise streak for the 12th straight quarter, when it reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Revenues also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fifth straight quarter. The results were driven by robust performance by the Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo brands.However, in spite of reporting better-than-expected results the company’s fiscal 2019 earnings per share projection came below analysts’ expectations.This designer, marketer, distributor and retailer of branded apparel and accessories delivered quarterly earnings of 63 cents a share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents but declined 13.7% from the year-ago quarter. This follows an increase of 7.9% in the preceding quarter. We note that rise in cost of goods sold and higher interest expense might have hurt the bottom line. Even an increase in the top line failed to act as a savior.Total revenues of $1,179.5 million outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,144 million and improved 10.8% year over year. Top line includes revenue contribution of $107.9 from Jimmy Choo. Excluding the same total revenue grew 0.6%. On a constant currency basis, total revenues were up 7.2%.Comparable sales grew 2.3% but decreased 1.7% on a constant currency basis. Global e-commerce benefited comparable sales by 160 basis points.Adjusted gross profit jumped 14.9% to $712.3 million. Meanwhile, adjusted gross margin came expanded 220 basis points (bps) to 60.4% on account favorable channel mix attributable to increased proportion of retail sales and higher Retail and Wholesale gross margins. Jimmy Choo contributed 80 basis points to overall gross margin. Michael Kors retail gross margin surged 110 basis points.Adjusted operating income rose 2% to $154.2 million, while operating margin contracted 110 bps to 13.1%. Michael Kors brand generated higher income from operations. This was offset by increased investments in marketing, e-commerce and store openings with respect to Jimmy Choo.Segment PerformanceRetail revenue came in at $600.6 million, up 4.4% year over year. Management pointed that since fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, the company had opened 50 outlets, principally in Asia. It further notified that 48 outlets were closed down during the period. Comparable sales improved 2.3% buoyed by growth in the accessories, footwear, ready-to-wear and men's categories. On a constant currency basis, retail revenue inched up 0.1%, while comparable sales fell 1.7%.Wholesale revenue were down 3.2% to $441.3 million, while on a constant currency basis, the same declined 6.1%. Licensing revenue plunged 11.1% to $29.7 million.Other Financial DetailsMichael Kors ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $163.1 million, total long-term debt of $874.4 million and shareholders’ equity of $2,017.7 million, excluding non-controlling interest of $3.8 million. The company repaid $320.2 million of debt in the final quarter.During the quarter under review, Michael Kors bought back 3,157,459 shares for approximately $200 million. As of March 31, 2018, the company still had $642.2 million remaining under its share repurchase program.Management expects to incur capital expenditures of approximately $250 million. This reflects the opening of 60 Michael Kors outlets and 30 Jimmy Choo stores with a focus on Asia.As part of fleet optimization strategy for Michael Kors, the company plan shutter roughly 25 stores in fiscal 2019.Store UpdateAs of March 31, 2018, the company operated 829 retail outlets (379 in The Americas, 198 in Europe and 252 in Asia), including concessions. The company had 151 additional retail outlets, including concessions, operated through licensing partners. Thus, the total number of global Michael Kors stores was 980 at the end of the quarter under review. Jimmy Choo had 182 retail stores, including concessions, at the end of the quarter. Further, Jimmy Choo operated 61 additional retail outlets, including concessions, through licensing partners.GuidanceManagement now envisions first-quarter fiscal 2019 total revenue to be about $1,135 million, comprising incremental revenue of $140-$145 million from Jimmy Choo. Comparable sales for Michael Kors are expected to be flat with retail revenue to increase in the low single digits. Wholesale revenue to increase in the high single-digit, while licensing revenue to decline in the high single-digits.Operating margin is projected to be approximately 15.2%. The company forecast earnings in the band of 90-95 cents a share, including anticipated benefit of 1-3 cents from Jimmy Choo.For fiscal 2019, management projects total revenue to be approximately $5.10 billion, comprising incremental revenue of $570-$580 million from Jimmy Choo. Comparable sales for Michael Kors are expected to be approximately flat with retail revenue to increase in the mid-single digits. Wholesale revenue to decline in the mid-single digits and licensing revenue to decrease in the high single-digits.Operating margin is expected to be roughly 17.7%.

4298,KORS,"Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) is set to report its fourth-quarter and fiscal 2018 financial results after market close on Thursday. So let’s see if the sportswear power’s stock might be worth buying ahead of its earnings release and if Nike looks poised to rebound from its recent North American sales downturn.Overview Nike has faced challenges in its domestic market over the last year, as it faces increased competition from rival Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) as well as Lululemon (LULU  -  Free Report) and other companies with the sportswear market shifting further toward athleisure. Meanwhile, the company has also been negatively impacted by shifting retail habits that have seen the likes of Dick’s Sporting Good (DKS  -  Free Report), Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report), and Finish Line  all suffer while e-commerce giants such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) continue to soar.Nike saw its North American sales slip by 6% last quarter to $3.57 billion. The company’s North American revenues also fell by 5% in the second quarter and 3% in Q1. Luckily for investors and Nike, the company has seen its sales expand internationally.However, North America still accounted for roughly 40% of Nike’s overall revenues in Q3, so investors will be pleased to note that Nike executives said as recently as March that the company expects North American sales to stabilize. This would also signal that Nike has been successful in its direct-to-consumer push as it adapts to the e-commerce age through various mobile app stores and online selling initiatives.Now that investors have a good sense of what’s going on, let’s jump into some of Nike’s estimates and fundamentals to see if the stock looks like a buy ahead of Q4 earnings.Growth Outlook Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Nike’s fiscal Q4 revenues to climb by 8.25% to $9.39 billion. Meanwhile, Nike’s quarterly earnings are projected to pop by 6.67% to $0.64 per share. Investors also need to know a little bit more on the estimates front, and for that, we can turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file.The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts.Based on our latest consensus estimates, analysts expect Nike’s North American revenues to hit $3.76 billion, which would mark a marginal gain from the $3.75 billion it reported in the year-ago period, which is a good sign for all the reasons we already mentioned. One other important figure to keep an eye on is overall Footwear revenues, which are projected to climb by roughly 10.5% to $6.05 billion.Earnings RevisionsMoving on, investors should take a look at Nike’s most recent earnings revision trends. Nike has earned two upward earnings estimate revisions for the full year, with complete agreement to the upside, both within the last 30 days. During this same timeframe, Nike has also received one upward revision for Q4, against no downward changes.Investors should note that Nike’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—is calling for earnings of $0.63 per share, which is 1 cent worse than our current consensus estimate. But Nike has a stellar management team that hasn’t seen them miss our earnings estimates since 2012.Price Movement/ ValuationLastly, investors need to understand how Nike stock has performed recently. Shares of Nike have soared 37% over the last year and have climbed 9.7% over the last three months, which tops the S&P 500’s 4.5% upward movement. Yet, Nike has seen its stock price slip slightly during the last month to sit just a couple of dollars below its 52-week high of $75.91 per share.Meanwhile, Nike’s recent performance has caused Nike’s valuation picture to look a bit stretched at the moment. Nike stock is currently trading at 27X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a significant premium compared to its industry’s 20.7X—which includes the likes of Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report), Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report), and Columbia Sportswear (COLM  -  Free Report).For further reference, Nike stock has traded as high as 28.5X and as low as 20.7X over the last year, with a one-year median of 25.5X. Therefore, Nike is resting just below its year-long high and above its peers, but it is also worth noting that Nike has traded at a premium compared to its industry over the last five years. Bottom LineWith that said, Nike is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an “A” grade for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system. The company is also expected to grow both its top and bottom lines and end its streak of declining North American sales. Therefore, investors might want to consider Nike stock at the moment.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

4299,KORS,"Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) is currently playing a leading role on the global stage at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. The sportswear company is also about a week away from reporting its quarterly financial results. So let’s evaluate Nike stock to show investors why they might want to buy NKE at the moment.Sports Overview Nike has grown into the largest sports apparel company in the world by cultivating its brand through partnerships with key athletes, in key sports in the U.S. and around the world. Today, maybe more than ever before, Nike’s clothing and footwear is also worn far away from athletic competitions as the industry trends toward athleisure, which the likes of Lululemon (LULU  -  Free Report) and rival Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) have capitalized on as well.Meanwhile, Nike’s presence in soccer, the world’s most popular sport, is as big as ever. Nike sponsors 10 teams at this year’s World Cup, with German giant Adidas claiming 12. Meanwhile, one-time heir apparent Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) is nowhere to be found on soccer’s biggest stage—or in the sport in general. Nike is also the official jersey sponsor of America’s most popular sports, the NFL and the NBA, with reports it will soon take over MLB as well.Nike also happens to sponsor seven of the eight most famous athletes on the planet, according to ESPN’s (DIS  -  Free Report) recently published World Fame 100 list. This list includes international soccer icons, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar—who both have a massive impact on Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report)—as well as LeBron James and Kevin Durant.The company’s global reach was demonstrated through its most recent quarterly results in which Nike reported big sales jumps outside of the U.S. Nike’s Greater China revenues climbed 24% to $1.34 billion, while sales in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa surged 19% to hit $2.29 billion.Price Movement Many of the recent narratives are that Adidas has caught up to Nike through a massive North American expansion, driven by key partnerships in both sports and entertainment. There is some truth to this, as Adidas has been able to grow in the U.S., but let’s take a look at Nike’s recent price movement to see what’s really going on.Shares of Nike have climbed 143% over the last five years, which outpaces Adidas' roughly 111% surge and crushes the S&P 500’s 79%. This picture does change dramatically when assessing the last three years. Nike stock has popped just over 38%, while ADDYY has skyrocketed 174%. Yet, as investors will see, NKE has outperformed Adidas stock over the last year. Nike stock has also climbed higher since the start of the year and has jumped over 10% during the past three months, with Adidas stock down 8%.Valuation The company’s recent performance has caused Nike’s valuation picture to look a bit stretched at the moment. Coming into Tuesday, Nike stock was trading at 28.3X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a significant premium compared to Adidas’s 21.9X as well as its industry’s 21.6X——which includes the likes of Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report), Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report), Columbia Sportswear (COLM  -  Free Report), and more. Over the last year, Nike has traded as high as 28.5X and as low as 20.7X, with a one-year median of 25.5X. Clearly, Nike is resting just below its year-long high. But it is also worth noting that Nike has traded at a premium compared to its industry over the last five years, which means investors have been willing to pay more for a company they believe offers more value.  Growth Outlook Nike is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter financial results after market close on Thursday, June 28, which means investors will want to understand what to expect from the sportswear company.Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Nike’s fiscal Q4 revenues to climb by 8.24% to $9.39 billion. Meanwhile, Nike’s quarterly earnings are projected to pop by 6.67% to $0.64 per share.Investors should also note that the company’s earnings picture is being adversely impacted by its shift toward more direct-to-consumer and e-commerce focused sales in a retail environment obsessed with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). These strategic initiatives should end up paying off in the not so distant future, and should also lead to higher margins.Nike is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. And let’s not forget that the company is a dividend payer, with a yield of 1.06%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the pot trades we're targeting>>

4300,KORS,"The luxury goods market had a lavish 2017 with impressive sales figures from top players. Given the continuing economic recovery, the momentum is likely to continue in 2018. Also, optimism surrounding steady economic growth, lower tax rates, strong wage growth and a robust earnings season hint at a brighter future for luxury stocks. Robust sales figures registered by a number of luxury brands in China along with an increasing number of millennials spending more on luxury goods bode well too. A Stunning 2017 U.S. luxury stocks witnessed a robust 2017. The S&P Global Luxury Index has risen 34.76% in the last year. Shares of PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) have surged 62.4%, while Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) has rallied 67.02% in the same time frame.  The last 12 months were also great for LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (LVMUY  -  Free Report), Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL  -  Free Report) and Tapestry, Inc. (TPR  -  Free Report), which gained 51.35%, 34.44% and 29.31%, respectively.While LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, Michael Kors Holdings Limited and Ralph Lauren Corp. carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), PVH Corp. and Tapestry have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Interestingly, it wasn’t only the domestic market but also the international space, particularly China, that saw companies coming up with a stellar show. Overall, the impressive performance of luxury goods was a global affair following a change in the tastes and habits of shoppers.The overall global economy too was strong, which helped luxury goods’ stocks to grow. A good start to the holiday season in 2017 gave an added thrust to the share price of luxury brands that range from wearables, to handbags, belts, eyewear, sportswear and shoes.Global Factors Influencing GrowthThe overall picture for luxury goods was quite rosy in 2017 with the big players going all out to make their presence felt in the global market. One of the primary reasons was that most brands focused more on millennials, who are splurging on luxury goods pretty early.According to a February 2018 survey report by Mindshare North America, 57% of shoppers are between the ages of 18 and 34, indicating that millennials are now the biggest shoppers.That said, the optimism surrounding steady economic growth, higher wages, business-friendly policies by the government and an appeal for luxury in emerging economies cannot be overlooked.Moreover, a number of luxury brands also expanded globally, which helped them come up with higher sales. While Tapestry acquired Kate Spade for $2.4 billion last year, Kors acquired Jimmy Choo for $1.2 billion to expand its presence in China.LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA registered record sales for 2017 with a like-for-like sales growth of 12%, double the rate of 2016. The growth was driven by the stupendous performance of its fashion and leather goods divisions. Moreover, one of the best U.S. holiday season in years helped Tiffany rev up its sales.China Powers Global ExpansionFor global luxury brands, China remains the hottest destination. Most big names reported of benefiting from the China market in 2017 and 2018 too won’t be any different. And those who are yet to explore that market are fast gearing up to set up shop in China.Per a January 2018 Bain & Co report, sales of luxury goods in China, which moved at a snail’s pace for years, escalated at the fastest rate in more than half a decade in 2017 and are expected to perform well in 2018. The report further says that sales of luxury goods in China touched 142 billion yuan ($22.07 billion) in 2017, increasing almost 20% from a year ago. The highly dynamic Chinese market helped brands like LVMH and Kors and Tapestry.Global luxury goods purchases by Chinese shoppers jumped 12% last year to €84 billion ($104 billion), per Bain & Co. This surge in consumer spending is being attributed to the changing demographics in China. Those born after the adoption of the one-child policy in 1979, today comprise the highest number of shoppers.Moreover, the millennials, who are setting new fashion trends, are the biggest spenders and most luxury brands are following them. At the same time, per a February 2018 BCG report, social media and word-of-mouth are the first and second sources of information for shoppers in China, with 49% and 30% share, respectively. Keeping that in mind, most global luxury brands are going the D2C (direct-to-customer) way in China. Last July, LVMH launched its directly operated online store that country. Prior to that, Kors and Burberry too opened e-commerce sites in China.Millennials & Boomers to Power 2018 GrowthMillennials are dominating the changing preferences and habits of consumers as they comprise the highest percentage of shoppers. Naturally, focus on millennials will be the key to success for luxury brands in 2018. Millennials’ tastes and preferences are increasingly blurring the gap between premium and luxury brands.According to Mindshare North America’s recent survey, 55% millennials are of the opinion that big luxury brands are losing their personal feel compared with 46% Gen X and 23% of Boomers. Hence most brands are addressing these perceptions and trying to meet the demands of millennials, who are trend setters.At the same time, Boomers cannot be neglected as they are the ones with great spending impact in the market right now. So, while millennials are setting trends, Boomers have more spending power. Most luxury brands are trying to strike a perfect balance between the two.Future PerfectWith positives such as a recovering economy, lower tax rates and business-friendly policies, luxury brands are poised for growth in 2018. The China market, which saw sluggish sales for years, is finally recovering with sales of luxury goods touching record highs. This certainly has made luxury brands optimistic about the China market and expansion plans are afoot for quite a few big names. Moreover, millennials have emerged as the biggest spenders and are expected to impact sales this year too. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

4301,KORS,"On Feb 16, The University of Chicago said that its consumer sentiment index had increased in February to its second-highest level since 2004. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and continuing resilience in the jobs market were primarily responsible for this increase. These factors helped Americans ignore recent volatility in the equity markets, which threatened to snap a long streak of gains.Steady growth and resilience in the jobs market have been the highlights of the continuing economic expansion. The impetus generated by recent tax cuts will also help to raise the disposable income of U.S. citizens. This is why this is an excellent time to invest in consumer discretionary stocks.Second-highest Level in 14 YearsThe University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index increased from 95.7 in January to 99.9 in February. This was the highest level recorded since 2004 and the second highest recorded since the 13-year high hit in October 2017. This reading exceeded most economists’ expectations who had estimated that the gauge would hit between 95.5 and 95.7.  The current conditions index, which is a gauge of Americans’ opinion about their finances, increased from 110.5 to 115.1. Additionally, the expectations index increased from 86.3 to 90.2. The overall number experienced a 4.4% increase from January’s figure of 95.7. Meanwhile, expectations for current year inflation levels remained unchanged at 2.7%.Tax Cuts, Jobs Growth Boost Sentiment The survey indicates that consumers are choosing to concentrate on encouraging economic data. This includes an increase in income levels, a booming job market and other related factors. Such a mindset was not impacted by recent stock market gyrations.According to the survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin, only 6% of the respondents chose to recall discouraging news related to the equity markets, that too when prompted. Nearly 35% of the respondents provided positive references to government actions. This figure was in line with January’s reading, the highest level recorded in more than 50 years.Our ChoicesThe latest reading of the University of Chicago’s consumer sentiment index indicates that American consumers remain upbeat following recent tax cuts. A resilient job market and increasing income levels have also contributed to the uptrend in sentiment.Adding consumer discretionary stocks to your portfolio looks like a smart option at this point.

Quote Segment AnalysisPVH Corp. reports financial results under three business segments: Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage Brands.Calvin Klein’s revenues advanced 23% year over year to $977 million while it grew 18% in constant currency. Further, the segment’s International revenues surged 33% to $512 million and 23% on a constant-currency basis. Growth in International business was backed by sturdy performance in Europe and Asia, which includes a 4% increase in international comparable store sales (comps). However, gain from 53rd week was primarily offset by a decrease in revenue attributable to the timing of the Chinese New Year.The segment’s North America revenues were also up 13% to $464 million driven by solid wholesale performance in all categories along with a 4% rise in comps. However, the gain from a 53rd week was mitigated by a decline in revenues due to the deconsolidation of the segment’s business in Mexico in November 2016.Revenues at the company’s Tommy Hilfiger segment jumped 22% to $1.1 billion while it improved 15% in constant currency. The improvement in revenues can be primarily attributed to sales growth of 37% to $702 million in the brand’s International business owing to stellar performance in all regions and channels, gain from the 53rd week, and 6% comps growth.Additionally, the segment’s North America business witnessed 5% increase in revenues to $439 million (4% growth in constant currency) driven by a 10% rise in comps. However, the metric was partly offset by a decline in the wholesale off-price distribution. Further, the decline in revenues from discontinuation of its directly-operated womenswear wholesale business in the United States and Canada in fourth-quarter fiscal 2016, in connection with the licensing of the business to G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (GIII), was mitigated by gain from the 53rd week in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.  Meanwhile, the Heritage Brands segment’s revenues remained flat year over year. However, the segment’s comps improved 1%.Share RepurchaseIn fiscal 2017, the company bought back 2.2 million shares for roughly $250 million under its $1.25 billion standing authorization that extends till Jun 3, 2020.GuidanceFollowing the robust quarterly performance, positive impacts from foreign currency rates and continued strength across its brands, management issued impressive first-quarter and fiscal 2018 guidance.For fiscal 2018, the company projects revenues to rise 7% while constant-currency revenues are expected to grow 4% in comparison to fiscal 2017. Brand-wise, the metric is anticipated to increase roughly 9% (or 7% on a currency-neutral basis) at Calvin Klein and 8% (or 4% on a currency-neutral basis) at Tommy Hilfiger. Further, the company expects revenues from its Heritage Brands to be flat year over year.Net interest expenses are expected to decline to $120 million in fiscal 2018 from $122 million in the prior year. The effective tax rate for the fiscal is projected in a band of 14.5-15.5%, including the anticipated impact of the Tax Legislation.Management envisions fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $9.00-$9.10, compared with $7.94 last year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal is pegged at $8.91, which is likely to witness upward revisions.GAAP earnings per share are projected in the range of $8.76-$8.86 compared with $6.84 earned in fiscal 2017. Earnings projections include gain of roughly 35 cents per share from foreign currency translations, both on GAAP and non-GAAP basis.Q1 GuidanceFor first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company expects total revenues to increase nearly 15% year over year while it is anticipated to advance 9% on a constant-currency basis.

4304,KORS,"Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) is the latest among the FANG stocks to take a beating. The company’s shares plummeted 4.4% on Wednesday and erased $30 billion of its market capitalization after the news website Axios reported that President Donald Trump wants to take on the company’s growing powers and its tax treatment.Trump has long been arguing that the e-commerce giant has been getting an unfair tax treatment compared with brick-and-mortar retailers, which have been suffering the Amazon onslaught for quite some time now. Moreover, Trump has always been critical of Amazon and its CEO Jeff Bezos, expressing time and again how much he dislikes the company. However, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders denied that the administration is planning anything against Amazon. ""We have no announcement and no specific policies we are pushing for,"" Sanders said, related to Amazon.That said, it’s still unclear what Trump will ultimately plan or do with Amazon. If he really decides to implement an Internet tax, Amazon’s revenues will be affected and its customers will have to shell out more. This is because Amazon will likely pass on its extra cost burden to its customers.Trump Versus BezosTrump’s dislike for Amazon and Bezos isn’t unknown and dates back a long time. On Wednesday, the company’s shares nosedived once again on reports of Trump planning to take on the Internet retail behemoth and its tax treatment. This saw its shares tumbling as much as 7% at one point of the day and almost $53 billion of its market capitalization being wiped out, before it closed the day at down 4.4%. The selloff was fueled by fears of a prospective Internet tax, which would cut heavily into the profits of the company. Now, this was not something out of the blue. Back in August 2017, Trump had tweeted: “Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt - many jobs being lost!""In fact, he had also said that the United States Post Office is losing billions of dollars every year by charging the likes of Amazon and others a pittance to deliver their packages. This, Trump suggested is only making Amazon richer. Interestingly, Trump’s dislike is perhaps more for Bezos, who also owns Washington Post. Trump has often criticized Washington Post and on one occasion, misleadingly referred to it as “Amazon Washington Post.”A tweet by Trump, last year, read: ""The #AmazonWashingtonPost, sometimes referred to as the guardian of Amazon not paying Internet taxes (which they should) is FAKE NEWS!"" Understandably, Trump doesn’t like Amazon’s business style and the latest report is further proof of that.Amazon Changing the Retail LandscapeAmazon undoubtedly has changed the retail landscape in the last few years. The company has grown from strength to strength with innovations in the delivery space and by bridging the gap between online and offline retail business. Amazon’s shares have increased 63.7% in the last year and 2.4% year to date. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This definitely is giving other brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) a run for their money. This is especially so because the traditional incumbents are constantly striving to stay in the race.The biggest move in the brick-and-mortar space was made by Amazon when it acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017. Moreover, Amazon recently started free, two-hour delivery from Whole Foods’ stores to its Prime members in four cities — Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach.Of course Amazon has established its dominance in the online retail space and it’s not only the retail giants but also the smaller players that are suffering the most with many shutting shop. Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) will be closing 100-125 stores over the next two years. Sears & Kmart closed 358 stores in 2017 and 63 in January 2018. Toys R Us is nearing closure too. Naturally, Trump’s concern is for brick-and-mortar stores, which are finding it difficult to survive the Amazon onslaught.But What About Amazon’s Profits?Although it really isn’t known what Trump plans to do, an Internet tax will dent Amazon’s booming online business without an inkling of doubt. In 2017, Amazon accounted for 44% of all e-commerce sales and about 4% of total U.S. retail sales, according to CNBC’s One Click Retail study. The company’s e-commerce sales for 2017 are expected to grow almost $197 billion, reflecting a 32% increase from 2016. This says a lot about the company’s dominance in e-commerce retail. And a lot of this is because Amazon is spared from any Internet tax.Moreover, according to the study, Amazon’s grocery sales in 2017 totaled $1.5 billion, up 33% from 2016, thus making it an undisputed leader in the e-commerce space. Naturally, if an Internet tax ultimately comes to effect, Amazon’s profits are sure to take a hit. More taxes mean less profits or steeper prices in case the tax burden is passed on to consumers. This in its turn might cause a slump in sales.In ConclusionTrump’s dislike for Amazon has often come to the fore and the recent news has sparked fears in the minds of investors. An Internet tax certainly isn’t a good sign for the e-commerce giant. However, with nothing concrete on the table now, and the White House denying any imminent action against Amazon, investors can be a little more patient with the stock.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs Pending A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline. Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors. Zacks names 5 stocks to buy now.Click here to see them >>

4310,KORS,"Guess', Inc. (GES  -  Free Report) is certainly one of the must-haves for one’s portfolio, given its stupendous bull run over the past year. Backed by strength in Europe and Asia, among other factors, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has soared 97.1% in a year, crushing the industry’s rally of 20.4%. In fact, the renowned lifestyle brand has gained 31.2% in a span of just five days, courtesy of its robust fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results and outlook.So, let’s delve deeper into the factors that have been driving this California-based company, which possesses a long-term earnings growth rate of 17.5%, underscoring its solid ongoing prospects.Strength in Europe & Asia – Major DriversGuess? has mainly been riding on sturdy Europe and Asia businesses. Notably, these regions have been delivering superb results for quite some time now, courtesy of constant store openings and e-commerce growth – ultimately leading to comps growth. These factors helped revenues in Europe surge 40% (up 24% on a constant currency basis) in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. Revenues were also backed by management’s strategy to improve sales quality and merchandising structure. Moving to Asia, sales advanced 40% here as well, while it grew 33% on a currency-neutral basis. In fact, Asia also witnessed its fifth straight quarter of operating margin growth. Management stated that it invested most of its capital toward Europe and Asia in fiscal 2018, given the outstanding returns from these regions. Also, it remains committed toward making further capital investments in these regions in fiscal 2019, as these regions offer robust opportunities. Thanks to these factors, the company expects sales in Europe and Asia to continue rising in double-digits, while margins are also expected to expand in fiscal 2019.Solid Focus on Digital GrowthGuess? relies on social networking sites like Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) to advertise and market products. The company has also been focusing on linking brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce and mobile sales to improve its online operations. This has enabled customers to reserve merchandise online and pick them up in stores. In fact, e-commerce growth in the Europe and Asia segments played a major role in augmenting the company’s comps and top line. Management stated that e-commerce business in Europe is gradually approaching the size of its American e-commerce operations. As for Asia, digital sales in China have been a major driver as the company’s alliance with Tmall is growing. Apart from this, the company is also making constant investments in the digital and social media space, like Weibo and WeChat. These efforts are expected to help Guess? enhance customer base and enrich their experience, which in turn should help it continue drive sales.Fortifying Store BaseGuess? has been strongly concentrated on undertaking store openings in its profitable European and Asian regions. Incidentally, these store openings have been boosting the company’s sales for a while now and remain a major driver for the forthcoming periods.

Also, it plans to make 60 more store openings in Europe in fiscal 2018. In Asia, Guess? opened 25 new stores in the fourth quarter, which included 16 directly operated outlets in China.Guess?, Inc. Price and Consensus  Guess?, Inc. Price and Consensus | Guess?, Inc. Quote Splendid Earnings History & Outlook Boost EstimatesGuess retained its impressive earnings surprise record in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, wherein both top and bottom lines grew year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, this marked the company’s fifth straight quarter of earnings beat, while the top line advanced year over year for the sixth quarter in a row. While earnings were backed by solid sales and enhanced margins, sales were fueled by continued strength in Europe and Asia. Further, gross margin expanded on the back of lower markdowns and rents; greater IMUs and enhanced sales. Operating margin also grew owing to overall expense leverage.Guess? remains focused on exploring opportunities for growth in the European and Asia regions. Additionally, the company has been striving to improve performance in the Americas and has undertaken several initiatives to reduce costs and enhance margins. Management also expects to reap benefits from the recent tax reforms, as it will likely reduce the effective tax rate and raise flexibility to repatriate overseas cash. Markedly, for fiscal 2019, management expects consolidated net revenue growth in the range of 7-8%. On a constant-currency basis, consolidated net revenues are expected to grow 5-6%. Earnings per share for fiscal 2019 are estimated in the range of 86-98 cents, in comparison with 70 cents recorded in fiscal 2018. Markedly, the consensus mark for the fiscal has gone up by 8 cents to 96 cents since the stellar quarterly outcome.Given the aforementioned factors and Guess?’s strong cost-saving efforts, we believe that the company is set to attain greater heights and help its investors rake in solid returns in future.Looking for More?

4312,KORS,"Nintendo Co., Ltd (NTDOY  -  Free Report) has reportedly delayed the launch of 64 gigabyte (GB) game cards for the Switch system. According to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, the company has informed developers that it expects to launch the cards in 2019 instead of second-half 2018.Per the report, Nintendo is witnessing “technical issues” with the 64 GB cards. Currently, the Switch game cards have a capacity of 32 GB, which is not sufficient for certain titles. Moreover, rival consoles — PS4 and Xbox One — has 50-GB capacity that provides a competitive advantage to these devices.The high capacity game cards will replace discs and improve the portability feature of the consoles, which has been a key attraction for gamers. Launched in March 2017, the console has sold 10 million units worldwide over the first nine months of availability. The company expects to sell more than 16 million units during the current fiscal, ending March 2018.Moreover, Nintendo targets to sell around 25-30 million units of Switch Console in 2018. However, the delay in the launch of the higher capacity game card can compel some publishers to postpone data-heavy title release on the platform. This can hurt sales at least in the near term.Shares fell 2.2% to $45.40 at close on Dec 28. Nintendo has returned 75% on a year-to-date basis, substantially outperforming 42.5% rally of its industry.Innovative Product Portfolio to Drive GrowthWe believe that Switch’s success can be attributed to Nintendo’s innovative game portfolio that includes The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Super Mario Odyssey (launched in October 2017).The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the top-selling game on the Switch platform, having sold around 4.7 million units as of Sep 30. It is the most sought-after game in the United States and Europe. NPD placed the game at #15 in its top 20 selling games by revenues list for the month of November.Nintendo’s Splatoon 2 game is considered the “most impressive performer” in Japan. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, launched in April, continues to enjoy high demand globally. Further, NPD placed Super Mario Odyssey at #6 in its top 20 selling games list for the month of November.Zacks Rank & Other PicksCurrently, Nintendo sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

4313,KORS,"The Driehaus strategy focuses on investing in momentum stocks using the ""buy high and sell higher"" principle. Investors with high-risk appetite can think of buying momentum stocks using this particular investment approach. The strategy is considered as one of the most successful investment approachs. Following its success, Driehaus earned a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.Portfolios such as that of The American Association of Individual Investors (“AAII”) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five and 10- year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns for the S&P 500. Thus, investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy.A Look at Driehaus StrategyAfter a detailed study of the Driehaus’ strategy, AAII concluded that it mainly focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive prospects to pick potential outperformers. While this strategy was made to provide better returns over the longer haul, companies with a strong history of beating estimates were also given importance.“I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around,” Driehaus had said in an interview.Screening ParametersThe percentage 50-day moving average is one of the key criteria in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend. It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator – positive relative strength – has also been included in this strategy. In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have only considered those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as well as a momentum score of A or B. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1(Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through.

4314,KORS,"Of late, shares of Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) are riding high on better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2017 results and effective implementation of operational and financial initiatives. In the past three months, the stock has gained 36.7%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 24.8%.  Let’s delve deeper.Hidden CatalystClearly, the third-quarter results provided a fresh breath of life to the stock, which in the recent past had struggled due to dismal performance in the preceding two quarters. Let’s look at Foot Locker earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 has increased by 4.2% and 3.3% to $1.23 and $4.08, respectively. Further, for fiscal 2018 earnings estimates have jumped by 5.1% to $3.95 per share.We believe that continuous exploitation of opportunities such as children’s business, shop-in-shop expansion, store refurbishment and enhancement of assortments are likely to benefit the company in the long run.International expansion, especially in Europe, is another catalyst. The company is also focusing on augmenting e-commerce platform, growing direct-to-consumer operations, margin expansion and tapping underpenetrated markets. Direct-to-customer comparable sales increased 6.1% in third quarter fiscal 2017. Direct-to-customer sales rose to 13.8% of total sales during the quarter, up from 12.8% a year ago. The company’s store banner dot-com businesses both in the United States and Europe increased in mid-single digit, while digital sales in Canada rose at a double-digit rate.Further, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is effectively managing inventory, investing in digital platforms, improving supply chain efficiencies along with reorganizing corporate and division staff. The company also entered into a partnership with Nike for a pop-up store called Sneakeasy NYC. The company's long-term financial goals include attaining sales of $10 billion, sales per gross square foot of $600, operating margin of 12.5%, net income margin of 8.5%, and return on invested capital of 17%.However, Foot Locker’s dwindling top and bottom-line results remain the primary concern. Challenging retail landscape and changing consumer spending pattern are making operating environment tough. We noted that earnings per share plunged 23% year over year during third-quarter 2017, following a decline of 34% and 2.2% in the second and first quarter, respectively.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks, which warrant a look in the same sector include G-III Apparel Group, Ltd.

4315,KORS,"Fossil Group Inc. (FOSL  -  Free Report) is gaining from strong growth in its wearables business, digital expansion and restructuring actions. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have surged 307.9% in the past six months, significantly outperforming the industry’s growth of 4.6%.    Let’s delve deeper into the factors that make Fossil an attractive buy. Wearables —  The Growth Catalyst With the introduction of wearable technology in watches, Fossil has been able to expand its base and offer additional features with accessories to meet customers’ preferences and needs. Notably, the company is getting the advantage of Android’s popularity and Google’s technology in its watches. Fossil recently launched approximately 14 new hybrid and smartwatches across several brands. This led to the wearables business accounting for 20% of its total sales in the first quarter of 2018 and reflecting a substantial increase from 8% growth reported in the year-ago period. Also, the company is taking unique marketing strategies that helped Fossil brand's sales rise 4% in the quarter.  The company expects the wearables business to grow by $32 million by 2020. In response to this, it intends to add three new formats to its smartwatch lineup in 2018, with a view to enhance the company's portfolio. Moreover, the company remains confident about the continued growth in the wearables category, given the recent initiatives that will further drive sales.  Digital Expansion to Drive Sales  Fossil remains poised on expanding its digital platform through several investments and meeting consumers’ growing demand for online shopping. After recording success in this realm in 2017, the company is on track to strengthen its digital platform further in 2018. As a result of such efforts, the first quarter registered e-commerce sales growth of close to 50%, driven by growth of 47%, 19% and 147% in Europe, the United States and Asia, respectively. Part of this surge is also attributable to the fact that 50% of the wearables sales are generated online.  Innovative Product Offering Apart from Fossil’s existing watch brand, it also offers various accessories, including handbags, belts, small leather goods, jewelry, soft accessories, sunglasses and clothing, given the significant consumer interest in accessories.   Additionally, to further expand the company’s size and offerings, Fossil has signed various licensing agreements with several brands. Recently, the company announced Puma as its new licensed watch brand. The company plans to start distributing Puma watches in 2019. Further, with the renewal of Fossil’s global licensing agreement with Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) and Emporio Armani through 2024, the companies are able to expand the extensive line of watches and jewelry, and also explore other opportunities in the accessories category. The company also signed a global licensing agreement with Kate Spade & Company through 2025 and extended its global watch licensing agreement with Diesel through 2025. Further, it partnered with Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL  -  Free Report) in 2015 to develop watches under the Chaps label, which will further enhance its watch portfolio. New World Fossil Plans to Transform Business The company remains on track with its New World Fossil program, which was initiated in 2016 to restructure its business. The program aims to transform the company, fuel efficiencies, improve margins and enhance the overall operating structure to drive profitability. This program has enabled the company to cut operating costs and drive gross margin in the first quarter.  With this program, the company expects to achieve gross profit improvement of $200 million by the end of 2019, out of which it has already witnessed approximately $20-million gains in the first quarter. For 2018, the company expects gross margin in the range of 51-53%, which reflects 200-400 bps expansion from the year-ago period. This depicts management’s confidence in New World Fossil plan, greater connected margins and favorable currency. All said, the company believes that the aforementioned efforts bode well. Looking for Another Retail Stock?

4316,KORS,"Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) is in the first year of its eight-year, roughly $1 billion jersey deal with the NBA. So as the NBA Finals begin Thursday night, let’s take a look at Nike stock to see if investors might want to consider buying a piece of the world’s largest sportswear company.Star Power When Nike won the NBA jersey rights a few years back, it was a big deal not only because of how much the company paid but also because Nike’s swoosh would be the first logo ever to appear on NBA game jerseys.Nike’s iconic logo also appears on NFL jerseys, and the company signed a 10-year extension with the NFL in March that will see it remain the official apparel brand through 2028. And now there are even reports that Nike will sign a uniform deal with MLB, starting in 2020, with Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) set to back out from its scheduled deal.Nike also happens to sponsor seven of the eight most famous athletes on the planet, according to ESPN’s (DIS  -  Free Report) recently published World Fame 100 list—LeBron James and Kevin Durant are two of these seven athletes.To some, these sponsorships might seem unnecessary, but they provide the exposure that brands like Nike and German rival Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) need. They must have their sportswear connected to the biggest leagues, teams, and athletes in the world.Obviously, there are many other important factors for investors to consider, but it is worth noting just how big Nike’s presence is and how much value the company places on maintaining its relationships with the lifeblood of professional sports.Recent Performance Nike reported revenue of $8.98 billion during its fiscal third quarter, which marked a 7% climb from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the company’s hugely important North American footwear sales slipped 8% to $2.29 billion. Luckily, much of this downturn can be attributed to overall market conditions in the U.S., and Nike’s presence throughout the rest of the world is bigger than ever. Nike’s Greater China revenues climbed 24% $1.34 billion, while sales in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa surged 19% to $2.29 billion.Price Movement Moving on, Nike stock has performed well recently and over the last decade. Shares of Nike have soared 322% over the last 10 years, outpacing the S&P 500’s 113% climb. Over the last three years, Nike stock is up 40%. Scaling down, even more, shares of Nike have popped 37% during the last year, which tops the S&P 500 and rival Adidas, despite the German company’s wave of North American success. Year to date, Nike Stock is up 14%. Valuation Nike’s recent price movement has helped the stock rest just below its 52-week high of $73.49 per share, which might make some investors nervous. The company’s strong performance has also caused Nike’s valuation to look just a tad bit expensive at the moment. Coming into Thursday, Nike stock was trading at 27.3X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates. Over the last year, Nike has traded as high as 27.6X, as low as 20.6X, with a one-year median of 24.5X.Investors can also see that Nike’s valuation picture has slowly grown worse since November 2016. With that said, investors have clearly seen a reason to pay a premium for Nike stock over this same time period, as the company has consistently traded above its industry’s average—which includes the likes of Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report), Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report), Columbia Sportswear (COLM  -  Free Report), and more.Growth Outlook One of the last key factors many investors will want to take a look at is Nike’s growth picture. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Nike’s Q4 revenues to climb by 8.4% to $9.40 billion. Meanwhile, Nike’s quarterly earnings are projected to sink by 13.3% to touch $0.52 per share.With that said, investors should not worry too much about Nike’s bottom line at the moment as the company makes a massive shift toward e-commerce and direct-to-consumer selling that is aimed at helping Nike better compete in a retail world that is shifting to Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) model.Nike is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports a “B” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

4318,KORS,"Investors in Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 1, 2018 $76 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Michael Kors shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Michael Kors is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Textile – Apparel industry that ranks in the Top 20% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while no analyst has dropped its estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 58 cents per share to 60 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Michael Kors right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

4319,KORS,"Individuals ramp up purchases of things like candies, chocolates, cologne, greeting cards along with flowers and other such gifts to pamper their loved ones on Valentine’s Day. Demand for dining out also sees an uptick.This Valentine’s Day won’t be any different. The demand for such discretionary items is likely to shoot up, largely facilitated by record wage growth and higher confidence on household income.Given the positive trends, it will be prudent to bet on fundamentally-sound companies that could make the most of Valentine’s Day.Americans to Spend Billions This Valentine’sAs per the recent annual survey by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights and Analytics, U.S. consumers are expected to spend a total of $19.6 billion on discretionary items this V-Day, up from $18.2 billion last year. This number will be the second-highest in the survey’s 15-year history, topped only by $19.7 billion witnessed in 2016.On average, consumers will spend $143.56, up from last year’s $136.57, as nearly 55% of the population celebrates the day. In fact, the survey shows that this year, consumers will spend an average $88.98 on spouses ($21.1 billion), $25.29 on children or parents ($3.5 billion), $7.26 on children’s classmates or teachers ($991 million), $7.19 on friends ($982 million), $4.79 on co-workers ($654 million) and $5.50 on pets ($751 million). Largely, consumers who are in the age group of 25 to 34 will be the biggest spenders, averaging $202.76.Nearly $4.7 billion will be spent on jewelry (19%), $1.9 billion on clothing (17%), $1.5 billion on gift cards/gift certificates (15%) and $2 billion on flowers (10%). But, most of the spending will come from eating out, around $3.7 billion (35%), while candy purchases will be up 55% from last year to a total of $1.8 billion. In the meantime, tickets to concerts or sporting events, better known as ‘gifts of experience’, continues to be in demand.And when it comes to shopping venues, much of it remains same as last year. Consumers planning to shop at department stores, discount stores, online, specialty stores, florists and local small business will be around 35%, 32%, 29%, 19%, 17% and 14%, respectively.Consumer Discretionary Spending on the RiseAmericans are set to splurge on discretionary items this Valentine’s Day, courtesy of fatter paychecks. Wages are growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade, which plays a significant role in driving consumer discretionary spending.Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74 in January. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009. Wages grew on a tighter labor market; tax cut policy and a rise in the minimum wage threshold in several states. Minimum wage has been raised in 18 states in January, which had a positive impact on 4.5 million workers, per the Economic Policy Institute (read more: Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009: Top 5 Gainers).Moreover, consumer confidence was stronger than expected in January and hovered near a 17-year high, according to the Conference Board. More the confidence households generate, the higher will be the amount they spend.5 Stocks to Gain From Valentine’s DayConsumers are expected to spend near record levels this Valentine’s Day.

4320,KORS,"Fossil Group Inc. (FOSL  -  Free Report) saw its shares soar as much as 80% during yesterday’s after-market trading session following the company’s fourth-quarter 2017 results. Notably, both the top and bottom line came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and comparable store sales (comps) also increased year over year. Sturdy e-commerce business and wearables sales remained major drivers, especially during the holiday season.Fossil’s focus on expanding its wearables portfolio seems to be appeasing investors for a while now. Evidently, the company’s shares have gained 26.3% in the past three months, surpassing the industry’s 18.3% growth.  Q4 in DetailAdjusted earnings came in at 64 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. However, the bottom line declined significantly from $1.21 reported in the year-ago period. The slump can be attributed to lower sales and margins. Fossil Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Fossil Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fossil Group, Inc. Quote Including one-time items like tax and restructuring charges, the company reported a loss of $1.65, as against earnings of $1.03 reported in the year-ago period. We note that during the quarter, Fossil’s bottom-line growth gained 9 cents from favorable foreign currency movements.Net sales of $921 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $890 million. Though connected watches boosted sales, overall net sales declined about 4% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to sluggishness in the company's traditional watch portfolio. However, Fossil progressed quite well in the digital space, as its e-commerce sales surged 31% in the fourth quarter.On a constant-currency basis, sales tumbled 7% during the quarter, with soft watch sales across all regions. Underlying weakness in the company’s leather and jewelry businesses across all geographies also marred the top-line performance during the quarter. Management stated that dismal results in United States, Eastern Europe, Middle East and most Asian countries (especially Japan) led to the weakness.Global retail comps climbed 2% year over year, courtesy of positive comps in the watch category, which was partly countered by sluggish comps at leather and jewelry. Region-wise, Americas and Europe delivered favorable comps, whereas Asia remained disappointing.Gross profit tumbled 8.4% to $448.1 million. Gross margin contracted 230 basis points (bps) to 48.7% due to greater sales mix of low-margin connected products and increased product valuation reserves. These downsides were partly compensated by favorable currency fluctuations; shift in mix toward international and e-commerce sales (with higher margins); margin enhancement efforts stemming from the New World Fossil initiative and reduced markdowns in wholesale channels.Operating expenses declined 6.2% to $396.8 million, thanks to lower store costs owing to considerable store closures; a fall in regional overhead expenses and curtailed marketing costs. However, battered by soft sales and gross margin, operating income slumped 22.5% to $51.3 million, with the operating margin contracting 130 bps to 5.6%.Performance Based on Business CategoriesCategory-wise, sales in the watches segment declined 3% (down 6% on constant-currency basis) to $728 million in the quarter. Sales at Jewelry and leather businesses also went down 6% (down 9% on constant-currency basis) to $108 million and 10% (down 14% on constant-currency basis) to $72 million, respectively.Region-Wise PerformanceRegion wise, sales dropped 8% (down 9% on a constant currency basis) in the Americas to $442 million owing to sales decline in the United States and sluggish performance of traditional watches. This was marginally offset by sales growth in connected watches. The region also witnessed weakness in the leather and jewelry businesses.Sales improved 1% in Europe (down 6% on a constant-currency basis) to $337 million. Constant-currency decline was mainly led by weakness in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and a modest fall in Eurozone.Net sales from Asia slipped 1% (down 3% on a constant-currency basis) to $142 million. Sales growth was mainly witnessed in India and China, countered by dismal performance from all other regions, particularly Japan.Other Financial UpdatesAt the end of the quarter, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $231.2 million, long-term debt of $443.9 million and shareholders’ equity of $580.9 million.Since the prior-year quarter, the company has undertaken several store closures. At the end of 2017, the company’s total store count was 544 compared with 585 stores in the year-ago period.On Jan 29, Fossil entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which is due and payable on Dec 31, 2020. The agreement offers revolving credit loans of $325 million (subject to certain borrowing conditions) and a term loan of $425 million.2017 OverviewAdjusted earnings for fiscal 2017 came in at 5 cents a share, considerably down from $2.00 recorded in the year-ago period. This fares way better than the consensus mark of a loss of 73 cents. Net sales descended 8.3% to $2,788 million, with declines across all regions and categories. On a constant currency basis, sales fell 9% year over year. However, top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,758 million. Global retail comps for fiscal 2017 dipped 6% owing to declines across all regions.During fiscal 2017, the company undertook various strategic initiatives directed toward speeding up business evolution and positioning Fossil for long-term growth. Although the company continued with soft sales and earnings, it remains well on track with its goals of boosting growth in its wearables portfolio; utilizing scale to curtail supply-chain expenses; increasing digital capacities and continuing with business transformation through the ongoing New World Fossil plan.Progressing on these lines, Fossil almost doubled 2017 wearables sales to more than $300 million, which formed roughly 14% of total watch sales. Also, this helped the company witness a rise in Fossil brand watch sales in the second half of 2017, largely driven by positive comps in the company’s direct business during the holiday quarter. This in turn was backed by significant wearable launches ahead of the holiday season, which enhanced sales of watches of Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) and Armani. Notably, the company introduced several hybrid and display smartwatches across 14 brands during the year. Management believes that such efforts, along with constant focus on innovations in the traditional watch space places the company well for growth and stability in future.Moreover, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s wearable product costs were on par with margin goals toward 2017-end, making it hopeful of gross margin expansion in 2018. Fossil is also in line with its New World Fossil plan which helped it cut costs by $95 million in 2017, keeping it on track to achieve its profit improvement target of $200 million. All these factors, along with constant focus on improving handbag and jewelry sales and augmenting digital sales bodes well for 2018. However, management expects the retail environment in North America to remain challenged owing to changing consumer trends. Thus, the company expects its traditional watch category in the wholesale business to remain pressurized in 2018. Nevertheless, Fossil remains optimistic about enhancing bottom line by cutting cost through its New World Fossil plan and lowering sourcing expenses.OutlookAll said, management issued its outlook for 2018. Fossil Group expects net sales to decline in the range of 14-6%. The company expects gross margin in a range of 51-53%, while operating margin is envisioned in a range of flat to 4%. Further, Fossil expects interest expense and restructuring charges of approximately $50 million each, and adjusted EBITDA in a band of $150 million to $200 million.For first-quarter 2018, the company expects net sales to decrease in the range of 12-6%. Gross margin is anticipated in the range of 50-52%. Fossil expects restructuring charges of approximately $20 million, and adjusted EBITDA in a band of negative $15 million to $10 million.Looking for More Promising Stocks?

4326,KORS,"The U.S. apparel industry, one of the largest in the global market, is segregated by Zacks in Retail – Apparel and Shoes and Textile – Apparel. The basic difference in this classification is that the first one includes apparel retailers, while the second comprises apparel manufacturers.There seems to be a lot of cheer in the Textile-Apparel industry that has witnessed a rise of 10.2% this year, with many companies in the space putting up a stellar show — buoyed by favorable economic indicators and strategic growth endeavors. However, the industry, which has been battling stiff competition and soft traffic due to consumers’ inclination toward online shopping has lagged the S&P 500’s rise of 22.9%.Nonetheless, the industry (ranked among the top 16% out all Zacks industries) appears to be a bright spot for investors in 2018, given the current market scenario and companies’ efforts to keep pace with the evolving consumer trends. Notably, the U.S. economy is riding on improved consumer spending, rising consumer confidence and favorable labor market scenario. The latest GDP data also speaks of a healthy domestic economy. Per the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the third and final estimate for third-quarter GDP jumped at an annual rate of 3.2%.These factors, along with textile-apparel players’ strategies of keeping pace with the evolving consumer trends; international expansion and brand enhancement efforts have resulted in solid earnings trends for many companies. Moreover, encouraging views by these firms reflects solid confidence in future prospects, instilling further optimism about these stocks that have fared better than the industry so far this year.So, let’s take a look at some robust textile-apparel players, which are poised to maintain their spectacular performance and have the potential to march ahead of industry in 2018 as well.4 Textile-Apparel Stocks You Must HaveGuess', Inc.

Guess? has been gaining from its superb performance in Europe and Asia, which have been yielding profitable results, owing to store openings and comps growth. Also, Guess?  relies on social networking sites to advertise and market its products, while it has also been focusing on linking brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce and mobile sales to improve its online operations. These upsides encouraged management to raise its fiscal 2018 earnings view, whe it released its last quarterly outcome. (Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018?

The company has displayed a robust surprise trend with earnings topping estimates for 14 straight quarters and sales marking the fifth consecutive beat in third-quarter fiscal 2017. This is mainly backed by solid momentum at its premium Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands. Also, PVH Corp. has been undertaking significant steps to resonate with the evolving retail trends and integrate consumers’ changing preferences in its operating decisions.

4327,KORS,"Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report), once considered the arch rival of NIKE, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report), has been in a spot of bother for quite some time. The stock, which was trading around $50 in 2015, is now hovering around $15.Neither Stephen Curry's ""Curry One"" signature shoe nor UA SpeedForm Apollo running shoes have helped the stock to drive performances in 2017. Year to date, the stock has witnessed a sharp decline of 47.7%, against the industry’s gain of 8.1%. Under Armour has also been facing issues like sluggish North America business, deteriorating gross margin, higher interest expenses and most importantly decline in the bottom line.Let’s Have a Closer Introspection?Decline in sales in North America has been a major concern for investors in the past few quarters. The company has been reporting sluggish sales from the region since fourth-quarter 2016. Bankruptcies, store closures, decrease in productivity and demand along with change in fashion preference have been the major causes behind the dismal show.Further gross margin, a key financial metric in determining a company’s basic financial health, has persistently declined in the past few quarters. In third-quarter 2017, gross margin contracted 130 basis points to 46.2% following a decline of 190 and 70 basis points in the second and first quarter, respectively. We noted that, in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2016, gross margin declined 100, 70, 130 and 320 basis points to 45.9%, 47.7%, 47.5% and 44.8%, respectively. Decline in gross margin has been primarily due to aggressive inventory management, regional mix and higher promotional costs.Under Armour has been grappling with higher interest expenses stemming from increased debt levels. In third-quarter 2017, the company’s interest expenses increased to nearly $9.6 million in comparison with $8.2 million in the prior-year quarter. Further, it anticipates interest expenses to rise to roughly $35 million in 2017 from $26.4 million in 2016.All these aforementioned headwinds have been major deterrents to the company’s bottom-line, which has been declining over the past few quarters. In third-quarter 2017, Under Armour’s earnings fell 24.1% year over year. Following the last quarter results, the company trimmed the sales guidance for 2017, giving another blow to the stock. It now expects net revenues for 2017 to rise in low-single digits, down from the earlier estimate of an increase of 9-11% over the 2016 level. This can primarily be attributed to sluggish demand in North America and operational difficulties. The company anticipates adjusted earnings per share in the range of 18-20 cents, compared with the earlier estimate of 37-40 cents.Stock Surges in December: Here’s WhyHowever, as the old saying goes “All’s Well That Ends Well”, the company has displayed resilience of late. In fact, the stock has shown some signs of recovery lately, which is a big boost before we kick off 2018. Month to date, the company’s shares have witnessed a sharp gain of 14.2%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 5.3%. The recent surge can primarily be attributed to industry experts’ optimistic view on company’s 2018 performance.Earlier, management announced a restructuring plan in order to utilize financial resources more efficiently. This will cater to the evolving demands of the changing consumer environment. In sync with this, Under Armour anticipates to incur total estimated pre-tax restructuring and related charges of roughly $110-$130 million in fiscal 2017. The company incurred $89 million of these charges in the third quarter.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company continues to seek opportunities for increasing global footprint and market share. Though the company generates a major portion of revenues from the North America region, it intends to expand business operations to other parts of the world, in order to mitigate the risks stemming from concentration in one geographic region. In sync with this strategy, the company has opened factory as well as brand stores in Canada and China over the years along with giving franchise licenses in several other countries.Further, it has rolled out e-commerce platforms in countries like Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and Chile. Another major tool used by Under Armour to broaden base is the development of an International e-commerce team. In third-quarter 2017, international business surged 35% to $305 million, following an increase of 57% in the preceding quarter.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018?

4328,KORS,"Monday, November 6, 2017We’ve got another busy week in store: more Q3 earnings and economic data, Republicans in U.S. Congress get busy working through the details of its massive tax reform program and the arrest in Saudi Arabia of a man known as “the Warren Buffett of the Middle East” are all grabbing headlines this morning. And we also see what appears to be a hostile bid by Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) to take over Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) for $70 per share, or $130 billion, including $60 billion in cash and Qualcomm debt.Should this merger deal be accepted, it would be the largest pure-tech deal in history, which would be accretive to Broadcom after the first year of the merge. But odds are very good Qualcomm will reject this proposal; though the company has acknowledged it has received the offer but given no indications that its board will find the terms favorable. Considering Qualcomm’s recent difficulties as a supplier of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) products, some may see this as Broadcom moving at a very advantageous time.Reports this morning are that Qualcomm officials are openly questioning the initial asking price, as well as antitrust issues, in what is understood to be an initially negative reaction. And would Apple’s involvement — behind the scenes, perhaps — somehow manage to facilitate this deal down the road in a way that puts Qualcomm’s issues with Apple behind them? One thing is for sure: this is a discussion just warming up; we expect to hear much more about this proposed deal throughout the rest of this week and beyond.Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, reportedly facing money laundering charges following a corruption purge by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, may cause some ripples through the U.S. markets this morning — especially in two of al-Waleed’s major holdings, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report). Questions regarding Middle Eastern countries surrounding and necessarily affected by the crown prince’s moves, such as rival major power in the region, Iran, and Lebanon, which has had its own issues with stability at the top recesses of government.Futures in U.S. markets are so far shaking all of this off. We are in the green again this morning, following 8 straight weeks of an up-market. As we’ve discussed before here and elsewhere, at least some of this positive sentiment is a result of hopefulness that corporate tax cuts will create new windfalls for companies and their shareholders, perhaps even before the year is out.Q3 Earnings UpdateCVS Pharmacy (CVS  -  Free Report) beat estimates by a penny to $1.50 per share this morning, on in-line quarterly sales of $46.18 billion. Earnings are down year over year, but revenues were up 3.5%. CVS also upped its earnings guidance for full-year 2017.Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) well outperformed expectations before today’s opening bell, with earnings of $1.33 per share easily surpassing the 83 cents in the Zacks consensus, up 37% year over year. Fiscal Q2 2018 sales of $1.147 billion topped the $1.046 billion we had been expecting. Guidance for both fiscal Q3 and full-year 2018, on both top and bottom lines, were also raised.Mylan Pharma (MYL  -  Free Report), however, missed expectations on both earnings and revenues, with $1.10 per share short of the $1.22 we were looking for, and $3.0 billion in sales beneath the $3.08 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Weaker-than-expected performance in North America, underscored by a fall in EpiPen sales in the quarter, were cited in the company’s report.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

4333,KORS,"Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report), once an investors’ favorite, has been losing its sheen of late owing to the recent dismal performances. Though long-term strategy seems to bode well, recent performance suggests trouble down the road. In the past six months, shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have lost 10.2% compared with the industry's fall of 22.3%. Also, the stock has a  Growth Score of D.Let’s Delve DeepWhirlpool’s surprise history remains unimpressive as it posted fifth-straight earnings miss in third-quarter 2017. Further, the company’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in four of the last seven quarters.  In fact, management slashed its earnings guidance for 2017 and expects it in the range of $13.60-$13.90 compared with $14.50-$15.00, guided earlier.Moreover, the adverse product price/mix and raw material inflation has been denting the company’s operating margin for the last few quarters. Evidently, adjusted operating margin contracted 100 basis points (bps), 150 bps and 90 bps in the third, second and first quarters of 2017. Unfortunately, these factors are likely to persist, going forward.Further, we believe that volatility in commodity prices, particularly steel, may adversely affect the company’s operating performance. Additionally, Whirlpool derives a significant portion of its revenues from international operations, which exposes it to risks in global market. Whirlpool’s customer concentration is also high that might hurt the company’s margins.Can the Tables Turn?Whirlpool’s robust product pipeline, solid innovations and cost productivity initiatives keep it on track to deliver long-term goals. In fact, the company has outlined significant long-term targets through 2020 backed by brand strength and product portfolio. It aims to deliver organic revenue growth of 3-5% every year. Further, it anticipates growth efforts to boost consumer demand and lead to enhanced price mix, which encouraged management to target its EBIT margin to exceed 10% by 2020.Moreover, Whirlpool has been riding on its innovation strategy that helps it to tap additional sales and gain market share. Also, the company is striving to improve its margins through a series of measures including cost-based price increments and cost-reduction initiatives focused on improving business efficiency.Bottom LineThough Whirlpool’s long-term plans and solid innovation strategy reflect strength, we cannot ignore the near-term challenges hurting the results. That said, let’s wait and see if the company’s strategic growth endeavors can spark a turnaround.Meanwhile, you can consider some better-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Discretionary space that include Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL  -  Free Report), Guess?, Inc.

4341,KORS,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 6. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 29%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Well Michael Kors has a remarkable history, at least in terms of the bottom line. The company continued its positive earnings surprise streak for the eighth consecutive quarter, when it reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 10.6%.Well the obvious question that comes to mind, will Michael Kors be able to sustain its positive earnings surprise streak in the second quarter. Well past trends do indicate toward that direction but it will not be wise to jump to a conclusion without analyzing the factors at play.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is 83 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of over 12%. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,046 million, down over 3.9% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayWaning Comps Hurting Top LineStiff competition, falling comps, aggressive promotional environment and waning mall traffic are making things tough for Michael Kors. We noted that comparable sales had fallen 5.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, following declines of 14.1%, 6.9%, 5.4% and 7.4% in the fourth, third, second and first quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively. The company is also struggling with its top-line performance. After registering meager growth of 0.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, it had declined 3.7%, 3.2% and 11.2% in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017. In the first-quarter of fiscal 2018, revenues declined 3.6%.Wholesale Segment’s Dismal Run to ContinueWe remained concerned about Michael Kors’ wholesale segment performance, which has witnessed a sharp decline in the previous few quarters. This segment is likely to report dismal performance in the second quarter as well. The analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues from the segment to decline 10.9% year over year to $403 million primarily due to dismal performance in both the North American and European regions.In first-quarter fiscal 2018, wholesale segment sales declined 23% after witnessing a decline of 22.8%, 17.8%, 18.4% and 7% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively.However, revenues from retail segment are likely to witness a marginal gain in the second quarter. Per the analyst surveyed by Zacks, revenues from retail segment are likely to increase by 1.1% to $604 million owing to robust performance in the Asian region. Meanwhile, licensing revenues are expected to witness a decline of 2.8%.Strategic EndeavorsMichael Kors has been constantly deploying resources to expand product offerings, open new stores, and build shop-in-shops along with upgrading information system and distribution infrastructure. Management intends to upgrade e-commerce platform and expects the channel to be a significant contributor in the long run. We note that despite the possibility of heavy investments weighing upon the margins in the short term, management continues to take up strategic endeavors. Michael Kors Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Michael Kors Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Michael Kors Holdings Limited QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils? Well our proven model does not conclusively show that Michael Kors is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

4342,KORS,"Investors in Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Feb 9, 2018 $54 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Michael Kors shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Michael Kors is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Textile - Apparel industry that ranks in the Top 31% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.26 per share to $1.29 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Michael Kors right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

The company had earlier launched Bancroft in the Michael Kors collection line as part of its strategy of product innovation. This strategy aided the global Women's footwear comparable sales to increase by double digit in the preceding quarter.However, stiff competition, falling comps, aggressive promotional environment and waning mall traffic are making things tough.

We noted that comps had declined 14.1%, 6.9%, 5.4% and 7.4% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters, respectively.

4344,KORS,"Tapestry, Inc. (TPR  -  Free Report), formerly known as Coach, Inc., is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 6. In the trailing four quarters, this house of lifestyle brands as well as designer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts, has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 6.5%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.7%.Investors are counting on another estimate beat by Tapestry in the to-be-reported quarter. Let’s delve deep and take a look at the factors that will be influencing the results.How Are Estimates Shaping Up?Post a 6.7% decline in the bottom line, Tapestry is likely to record year-over-year growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. After rising by a penny in the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings stands at 87 cents compared with 75 cents in the year-ago quarter.Analysts polled by Zacks now project revenues of $1,768 million, up from $1,322 million in the year-ago quarter. If all goes well, this will be the second straight quarter of top-line growth for the company. We note that net sales of this New York-based company jumped 24% in the first quarter. However, the same declined 1.8% and 4% in the fourth and third quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively.Factors at PlayTapestry looks way more disciplined in its approach to adapt to the changing retail landscape. The company is undergoing a brand transformation and introducing modern luxury concept stores in key markets. The acquisitions of Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade are being viewed as a significant step by the company in becoming a multi-brand company. Moreover, management has undertaken transformation initiatives revolving around product, stores and marketing, which are likely to have a favorable impact on second-quarter results.Additionally, the company is aggressively expanding its e-commerce platform. Tapestry also plans to undertake strategic measures involving the upgrade of core technology platforms and enhancement of international supply chain.

Notably, this marked the company’s 12th straight quarter of earnings beat.The company’s better-than-expected results stemmed from stringent focus on key initiatives during the holiday season that resulted in lower discounting and better quality of sales.On a reported basis, the company posted loss per share of $1.00, compared with earnings of 98 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. Reported earnings for the quarter primarily included restructuring and other charges associated with the company’s Way Forward plan as well as the impact of tax reform.Ralph Lauren Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ralph Lauren Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ralph Lauren Corporation QuoteDespite earnings beat, the company’s shares declined 6.4% in the pre-market trading session mainly due to the lower-than-expected revenues. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has surged a solid 51.4% in the last three months, outperforming the industry's growth of 21.9%.RevenuesNet revenues of this luxury apparel retailer was down 4.2% year over year to $1,641.8 million. Further, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,648 million. On constant-currency basis, revenues declined 6%, which was at the higher end of the company’s guidance of 6-8% fall. The sales lag was mainly due to the company’s efforts to improve quality of sales, decrease promotions and elevate distribution, alongside brand exits and diminished consumer demand.During the quarter, foreign currency aided revenue growth by nearly 190 basis points (bps) owing to favorable currency rates. This was above the company’s guidance of 160-170 bps positive impact.Segment DetailsNorth America: During the third quarter, revenues at this segment slumped 11% to $886 million due to lower retail and wholesale sales. Lower sales in these channels can be attributed to distribution and brand exits; planned reduction in shipments and promotions to enhance the quality of sales; and lower customer demand. On a currency-neutral basis, comparable store sales at this division tumbled 10%. This included a drop of 3% in stores and 27% plunge in e-commerce sales, which were hampered by the planned reduction in promotional activities and fall in traffic.Europe: Revenues for this segment rose 8% year over year to $378 million, while currency-neutral revenues were flat.

The upside was driven by strong retail and wholesale sales. Comps rose 3% on a currency neutral basis, thanks to increased conversion, average unit retail and the number of transactions.MarginsRalph Lauren's adjusted gross profit margins expanded 250 bps to 60.7%, driven by efforts to enhance quality of sales through lower promotions, favorable geographic and channel mix shifts, as well as reduced product costs. Additionally, foreign currency aided gross margins by 30 bps.Adjusted operating income margin expanded 40 bps to 13.2%. The year-over-year increase can mainly be attributed to gross margin expansion and 50 bps benefit from foreign currency, offset by increased fixed expenses.FinancialsRalph Lauren ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2,038 million, total debt of $589 million and total shareholders’ equity of $3,407.5 million.

4347,KORS,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited‘s (KORS  -  Free Report) positive earnings surprise, store optimization and global expansion bode well. Further, the company’s decision to acquire Jimmy Choo gives an indication that it is focused on international fashion brands. However, waning top-line along with dismal comps and wholesale segment performance continues to act as headwinds. The company has taken several strategic initiatives to bring both the top line and comps back on growth trajectory.Turn Around StrategyMichael Kors’ acquisition of Jimmy Choo will help diversify portfolio and tap international markets. The buyout is likely to be accretive in the low-single digits in fiscal 2020. In order to drive top-line growth, the company has been focusing on store expansion. In fiscal 2016, the company opened 142 new stores, which included 47 in the Americas and 95 worldwide. In fiscal 2017, it opened 159 net new stores openings, which includes 111 outlets related to the acquisition of the earlier licensed operation in Greater China. Given the scope for high profitability from company-owned stores, management is putting more emphasis on opening retail outlets.Sales from Asia have shown tremendous improvement. The company had stated that it will continue with the expansion drive in Asia and also believes it has an opportunity worth $1 billion in the long term.In an effort to increase the profitability in stores fleet, the company has announced its intention to close between 100 to 125 full priced retail stores over the next two years. Moreover, the company stated that it will incur one-time costs of nearly $100-$125 million related to store closures. Meanwhile, it anticipates annual saving of $60 million due to store closures as well as fall in depreciation and amortization related with these impairment charges.Hurdles to CrossMichael Kors’ wholesale segment continues to pose concern. In first-quarter fiscal 2017, wholesale segment sales declined 23% to $303.6 million primarily due to dismal performance of Americas, European and Asia region, while on a constant currency basis, it fell 22.7%. In the fourth, third, second and first quarter of fiscal 2017, wholesale segment sales declined 22.8%, 17.8%, 18.4% and 7%, respectively.Stiff competition, falling comps, aggressive promotional environment and waning mall traffic are making things tough for Michael Kors. We noted that comparable sales had fallen 5.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, following declines of 14.1%, 6.9%, 5.4% and 7.4% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters, respectively.Michael Kors which shares space with Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL  -  Free Report), PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) is struggling with top-line performance. After registering meager growth of 0.2% in first-quarter fiscal 2017, it had declined 3.7%, 3.2% and 11.2% in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues declined 3.6%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

(GOOGL  -  Free Report), Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report), and Mondelez (MDLZ  -  Free Report), formerly Google, Philip Morris, and Kraft, respectively.Tapestry is likely mimicking European giants like LVMH and Kering, among others, each of whom boast an impressive slate of fashion brands among their portfolios. LVMH owns Louis Vuitton, Moët Chandon, Hennessy, Céline, Dior, and Sephora, including many others, while Kering operates Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen, and Bottega Veneta.It’ll be interesting to see what moves Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) makes going forward, too.

4350,KORS,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (LEG  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 5. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this furniture producer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. While Leggett reported in-line earnings in the last quarter, it has a mixed record of earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 61 cents, which represents a 15% growth from the year-ago period figure of 53 cents. However, the earnings estimate has been stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $999.3 million, up 10.6% from the year-ago quarter.Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Leggett & Platt, Incorporated QuoteFactors at PlayLeggett is poised on strategies to enhance business portfolio, disciplined capital allocation, and progress on goals for 2019. Further, the company’s long-term strategy focused on bolstering business portfolio by increasing investment in areas that provide a competitive edge and simultaneously exiting underperforming operations, bode well. The company remains on track to achieve its top-third TSR target by 2019 through revenue growth, margin enhancement and shareholder-friendly moves. Moreover, we believe the company’s strong liquidity position will continue to drive growth.However, it remains exposed to major volatility in raw material prices, with steel being one of the company’s key raw materials and the market for the same being cyclical in nature. Notably, the company’s gains from higher sales continue to be offset by increased raw material expenses, which is hurting stock price. Additionally, the company’s strained margins and lowered guidance remains concerns.The company anticipates sales for 2017 to grow by 5-7% to $3.95-$4 billion, reflecting the raising of the lower-end of the guidance range from the old sales guidance of 4-7% growth to $3.9-$4 billion. Adjusted EBIT margin is anticipated to be nearly 12%. Moreover, management narrowed reported EPS range to a band of $2.49-$2.54 from the previous range of $2.55-$2.65. Adjusted EPS is envisioned in the range of $2.45-$2.50, compared with the previous range of $2.40-$2.50.Battered by these factors, Leggett’s shares grew only 0.9% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s growth of 9.1%.While the company’s strategies and initiatives bode well for the long run, we believe that Leggett’s bottom-line remains prone to steel price inflation which may hurt results in the fourth quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Leggett is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Leggett has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 61 cents. While the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.92% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk.

4351,KORS,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) maintained its positive earnings surprise streak for the 12th straight quarter, when it reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Revenues also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fifth straight quarter. The results were driven by robust performance by the Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo brands.However, in spite of reporting better-than-expected results shares are down roughly 5% during pre-market trading hours, as the company guided fiscal 2019 earnings per share below analysts’ expectations.

This follows an increase of 7.9% in the preceding quarter. We note that rise in cost of goods sold and higher interest expense might have hurt the bottom line. Even an increase in the top line failed to act as a savior.Total revenues of $1,179.5 million outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,144 million and improved 10.8% year over year. Top line includes revenue contribution of $107.9 from Jimmy Choo. On a constant currency basis, total revenues were up 7.2%.Adjusted gross profit jumped 14.9% to $712.3 million. Meanwhile, adjusted gross margin came expanded 220 basis points (bps) to 60.4% on account favorable channel mix attributable to increased proportion of retail sales and higher Retail and Wholesale gross margins. Jimmy Choo contributed 80 basis points to overall gross margin.Adjusted operating income rose 2% to $154.2 million, while operating margin contracted 110 bps to 13.1%. Michael Kors brand generated higher income from operations. This was offset by increased investments in marketing, e-commerce and store openings with respect to Jimmy Choo.Michael Kors Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Michael Kors Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Michael Kors Holdings Limited QuoteSegment PerformanceRetail revenue came in at $600.6 million, up 4.4% year over year.

4352,KORS,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Michael Kors Holdings has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.0. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Michael Kors Holdings’ current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint (which is 13.1) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 23.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Michael Kors Holdings has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 14.1, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Michael Kors Holdings’ stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Michael Kors Holdings has a P/S ratio of about 2.3. This is noticeably lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is considerably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Michael Kors Holdings currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes KORS a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 11.6, which is slightly better than the industry average of 12.8. Clearly, KORS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Michael Kors Holdings might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of D. This gives KORS a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days, compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen four upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen nearly 3.4% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up 0.2%.

4355,KORS,"Investors, who generally have a high-risk appetite, focus on momentum stocks to eke out strong gains. In this context, Richard Driehaus’ investing strategy, which is based on the “buy high and sell higher"" principle. Driehaus earned a place in Barron’s All-Century Team following the success of the investing strategy.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five- and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% gains registered by the S&P 500. Thus investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns.A Detailed Look into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator – positive relative strength – has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening Parameters In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1(Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through.

4356,KORS,"Premium lifestyle retailer, Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL  -  Free Report) has been putting up a good show of late with respect to upsurge in stock price as well as positive estimate revisions. The company’s progress on its Way Forward Plan and other Restructuring initiatives are primarily behind this feat. Driven by these attributes, the company has delivered a robust earnings surprise history and solid stock movement.Splendid Stock PerformanceShares of Ralph Lauren have climbed 22.4% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s upside of just 4.7%. Additionally, the stock has witnessed a solid growth of 11.6% after reporting better-than-expected results on Aug 8.The company’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 performance was a testimony to its progress on the Way Forward Plan and Restructuring initiatives that was announced in June 2016. Notably, first-quarter fiscal 2018 marked its 10th consecutive earnings beat. Further, the company has delivered positive earnings surprises in 15 out of the last 16 quarters.Positive Estimate Revisions Drive OptimismManagement remains confident of Ralph Lauren’s performance based on its efforts related to global brand reorganization, constant infrastructural investments and e-commerce enhancements. Further, the company’s efforts to evolve product and marketing bode well. Additionally, management lowered effective tax rate forecast for fiscal 2018, which we believe should benefit the bottom line.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed an uptrend following the earnings. Further, we note that the upward estimate revision trend continues even two months after the results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has witnessed an uptrend in the last 30 days. Notably, estimates for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 rose 1.9% and 0.4%, respectively, to $5.34 per share and $5.20 per share.Ralph Lauren Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ralph Lauren Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ralph Lauren Corporation QuoteApart from a strong fiscal first quarter, the company is gaining from a significant progress on strategic initiatives. So, here is a sneak peek into the company’s initiatives that are driving growth.Way Forward Plan On Track Ralph Lauren remains on track to deliver goals under its Way Forward Plan. Divided in two parts, the first part focuses on evolving the company’s core business relating its product, marketing and customer experience. The second part centers around reviving its operating structure by developing a systematic way of building stronger assortments, a demand-driven supply chain, an excellent sourcing capability and a multi-channel global expansion strategy. In short, the plan is all about refocusing on the core, strengthening the brands and returning the company to profitable growth in the long term.As part of the progress made under the plan, the company enhanced quality of sales by reducing promotions and markdowns, alongside reducing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) count to drive productivity during the fiscal first quarter. Further, it improved inventory turns by curtailing inventory levels by 31% year over year and also achieved cost savings by lowering operating costs. Additionally, the company is keen on optimizing its wholesale distribution by shutting down underperforming points of distribution.ConclusionWhile we expect the momentum in Ralph Lauren stock to persist, concerns regarding soft sales trend on account of weak demand, brand exits and efforts to drive quality of sales cannot be ignored. Additionally, foreign currency continues to adversely impact Ralph Lauren’s top-line and margins.However, we commend its progress on strategic plans, which should bear fruit in the long term. Moreover, the company’s robust earnings trend and positive estimate revisions instill confidence. Aptly, Ralph Lauren currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want More of the Industry?

4357,KORS,"A prudent investment strategy not only means buying promising stocks, but also selling the ones that can dent your portfolio. Unfortunately, Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) has been facing multiple challenges from rising competition and evolving trends in the apparel space and is a risky bet.Notably, shares of this designer and manufacturer of apparel essentials for men, women and children have lost around 4.5% in the past year compared with the industry’s rally of 10.2%. In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock tumbled nearly 9.7%.What’s Troubling Hanesbrands?Hanesbrands has been struggling against weak domestic performance, due to soft store traffic and a tough retail landscape. Evidently, these headwinds hurt the company’s back-to-school selling season performance, which along with the U.S. hurricanes and earthquake in Mexico have affected results in third-quarter 2017.Apart from this, Hanesbrands is also battling soft sales in its Innerwear segment for quite some time, thanks to soft brick-and-mortar performance stemming from sluggish traffic. In the third quarter, sales in this unit declined 5.2% as the apparel category bore the brunt of a tough back-to-school retail landscape. Prior to this, sales for the segment fell 2.5% in the second quarter of 2017, 6% in the first quarter of 2017 and 8% in the fourth quarter of 2016.Notably, the Intimate Apparel/Innerwear industry is highly competitive and extremely price sensitive. Hence, the company’s ongoing strategy to focus more on premium brands and increase prices in these categories comes with the inherent risk of consumers shifting to other competitively-priced brands, offered by competitors.  This may, in turn, hurt Hanesbrands’ market share along with profits.Moreover, to add to investor’s disappointment in the stock, management continues to expect effects of the aforementioned adverse environment conditions and a difficult retail sales environment to linger in 2017. Increased marketing investments to drive market share growth may also hamper the company’s profits.These factors, along with impacts from the bankruptcy of Sears Canada, compelled management to trim sales and earnings outlook for 2017. The company projects net sales in the band of $6.45-$6.48 billion and adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the $1.93-$1.95 per share range.Textile Apparel Still Has Some Bright SpotsRanked amongst the top 23% of all Zacks industries, the textile-apparel industry space still has some bright spots for investors to put their funds in. Despite the headwinds looming over the apparel industry, there are many firms which have managed to stay afloat gaining from strategic endeavors to keep pace with the evolving retail trends and the improved economic scenario. This is evident from favorable consumer spending, healthy consumer confidence and improved labor market, which has been driving the U.S. economy.Moving to the companies’ efforts to resonate with consumers’ preferences, expansion in the e-commerce realm has been a vital strategy for most apparel companies. Further, efficient brand management and strategies to strengthen and expand business operations have aided firms to counter industry challenges. All said, the textile-apparel space appears to be well placed.Thus, we used the Zacks Stock Screener, and zeroed in on three apparel stocks that have been performing well.

4359,KORS,"Fossil Group, Inc (FOSL  -  Free Report) has been performing unfavorably for quite some time now. Rising demand for digitally advanced products have caused a radical setback in the company’s traditional watch sales. As a result, Fossil Group has been facing economic challenges in some of its key markets in Europe, Asia and the Americas.Fossil Group’s weak performance during the first half of 2017, has led the company to slash earnings and sales guidance for the year. It now expects net sales to decline in the range of 4.5-8.5%, wider than the previous range of 1.5-6.0%. Further, it projects 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of $0.35-$1.15 per share, as compared with previously expected range of $0.80-$1.50. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 went down 5 cents to reach 68 cents in the past 60 days. The same for the third quarter has also declined 13 cents to an estimated loss of 12 cents.Consequently, the company’s shares have plunged 50.2% in the last six months, wider than the industry’s decline of 12.5%. Let’s now look deeper into some of the factors that have been affecting the performance of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company. Sluggish Performance in Traditional Watches & Other Categories  Fossil Group’s traditional watches remained persistently weak owing to intensifying competition and evolving consumer preference toward smartwatches and connected wearables. Performance of a number of brands in this category has been overshadowed by the growing popularity of the Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) brand. Moreover, the expiration of Fossil Group’s licensing agreement with Burberry by the end of 2017 is also expected to dent traditional watch sales.Fossil Group has been trying to achieve a turnaround in its watch category by adding new products under its smartwatches and connected wearable’s portfolio. However, the segment is yet to yield significant revenues for offsetting the declines witnessed in traditional watches.Additionally, the company’s leather and jewelry businesses have also been depicting weaknesses lately owing to low consumer response. Fossil Group has also been taking very less efforts to improve the sales of these businesses.Stressed Margins Of late, Fossil Group has been investing highly in promotional activities, for driving sales of its traditional watches and newly-launched products in connected wearables. However, such efforts have not been able to revive the company’s top-line, thereby leading to lower margins.  The company expects margins to remain stressed through the rest of the year. For 2017, it anticipates adjusted operating margin in the range of 2-3.5%, lower than the previously anticipated adjusted operating margin range of 3-4.5%.Other Headwinds Impacting Performance Although licensing agreements with renowned brands such as Michael Kors, Emporio Armani and Diesel have aided in expanding the company’s portfolio, they have been contributing less toward revenues. Fossil Group’s global retail comps have also declined during the first and second quarters of 2017 following declines in all major product categories and regions.Owing to greater disadvantages associated with the stock, Fossil Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and is not a suitable pick for investors.Done With Fossil Group?

4360,KORS,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited‘s (KORS  -  Free Report) positive earnings surprise, store optimization and global expansion has kept it afloat amid a competitive environment. Further, the company’s decision to acquire Jimmy Choo gives an indication that it is focused on international fashion brands. However, waning top-line along with dismal comps and wholesale segment performance continues to act as headwinds. Let’s delve deeper and analyze the issues influencing the stock.Driving FactorsMichael Kors better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings aided the company to provide upbeat fiscal 2018 view. The company now envisions fiscal 2018 total revenues to be approximately $4.275 billion, up from the previous estimate of approximately $4.25 billion and expects comparable sales to decrease in the mid-single digit range, compared with the previous estimate of decline in the high-single digit range. Operating margin is still projected to be about 16%. Management anticipates earnings in the band of $3.62-$3.72 per share for the fiscal year, up from earlier estimate of $3.57-$3.67.Michael Kors’ acquisition of Jimmy Choo will help diversify portfolio and tap international markets. The buyout is likely to be accretive in the low-single digits in fiscal 2020. In order to drive top-line growth, Michael Kors has been focusing on store expansion. In fiscal 2016, the company opened 142 new stores, which included 47 in the Americas and 95 worldwide. In fiscal 2017, it opened 159 net new stores openings, which includes 111 outlets related to the acquisition of the earlier licensed operation in Greater China. Given the scope for high profitability from company-owned stores, management is putting more emphasis on opening retail outlets.Sales from Asia have shown tremendous improvement. The company had stated that it will continue with the expansion drive in Asia and also believes it has an opportunity worth $1 billion in the long term.In an effort to increase the profitability in stores fleet, the company has announced its intention to close between 100 to 125 full priced retail stores over the next two years. Moreover, the company stated that it will incur one-time costs of nearly $100-$125 million related to store closures. Meanwhile, the company anticipates annual saving of $60 million due to store closures as well as fall in depreciation and amortization related with these impairment charges.Hurdles to CrossMichael Kors’ wholesale segment continues to pose concern. In first-quarter fiscal 2017, wholesale segment sales declined 23% to $303.6 million primarily due to dismal performance of Americas, European and Asia region, while on a constant currency basis, it fell 22.7%. In the fourth, third, second and first quarter of fiscal 2017, wholesale segment sales declined 22.8%, 17.8%, 18.4% and 7%, respectively.Stiff competition, falling comps, aggressive promotional environment and waning mall traffic are making things tough for Michael Kors. We noted that comparable sales had fallen 5.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, following declines of 14.1%, 6.9%, 5.4% and 7.4% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters, respectively.Michael Kors which shares space with Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL  -  Free Report), PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) is struggling with top-line performance.

Earnings also considerably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.91 and outperformed its own guidance range of $2.88-$2.92.

Moreover, revenues improved 3% on a constant-currency basis.Adjusted gross profit increased 8.7% year over year to $1,297.3 million, with the gross margin expanding 180 basis points (bps), to roughly 55%.Adjusted EBIT grew 6.9% to $294.7 million, driven by improved Tommy Hilfiger earnings, somewhat negated by timing shift of wholesale shipments at Heritage Brands, an earnings decline in Calvin Klein due to higher marketing expenditures and increased corporate expenses. The adjusted EBIT margin expanded 20 bps to nearly 12.5%.Segment AnalysisPVH Corp. reports financial results under three business segments: Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage Brands.Calvin Klein’s revenues advanced 6% year over year to $943 million, including about $20 million impact from the deconsolidation of the company’s business in Mexico in November 2016. The growth was driven by a 20% increase in the segment’s International revenues, partially offset by a 5% decline in revenues for the North America business.Growth in International business was backed by solid performance of wholesale business in Europe, alongside robust growth in the retail business due to 9% comparable store sales (comps) increase and square-footage expansion. Meanwhile, revenues for the North America business was primarily hurt by the deconsolidation of the Mexico business as well as 1% decline in comps. In constant currency, revenue for the segment improved 4%.Revenues at the company’s Tommy Hilfiger segment jumped 10% to $1 billion, while it improved 7% in constant currency. Growth can primarily be attributed to 16% sales improvement in the brand’s International business, owing to persistent strength in Europe and Asia, and 7% comps growth.Additionally, the company’s North America business witnessed 2% revenue growth (1% growth in constant currency) driven by 6% increase in comps. This was partly offset by nearly $20 million reduction due to the discontinuation of its directly-operated womenswear wholesale business in the United States and Canada in fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 in connection with the licensing of this business to G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (GIII).The Heritage Brands segment’s revenues dipped 7% year over year to $396 million due to a planned change in Wholesale shipment timings from the third quarter to the second quarter. However, comps improved 2%.FinancialsThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $612.3 million, long-term debt of $3,182.7 million, and shareholders’ equity of $5,249.8 million.In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, the company repurchased about 1.8 million shares for roughly $192 million under its $1.25 billion standing authorization that extends till Jun 3, 2020.GuidanceDriven by the solid third-quarter results, improvement in foreign currency rates and continued strength across its brands, PVH Corp anticipates delivering a robust revenues and earnings in fourth-quarter 2017. This favorable view further backed by the strong start to the holiday season and the additional $20 million increase in marketing expenditures to take advantage of the continued momentum across its businesses. Further, the company raised guidance for fiscal 2017 on the aforementioned favorable trends.For fiscal 2017, the company now projects revenues to rise 7% year over year, while constant-currency revenues are expected to grow 6%. Earlier, the company forecasted revenue growth of 6%, with constant-currency revenues improving 5%. Management expects revenues to continue being dented by the licensing deal with G-III Apparel and a $150 million reduction due to the Mexico deconsolidation.Brand-wise, revenues are anticipated to increase 9% (or 7% on a currency-neutral basis) for Calvin Klein and 8% (or 7% on a currency-neutral basis) for Tommy Hilfiger. Earlier, the company had projected revenue growth of 8% for Calvin Klein (7% on a currency-neutral basis) and 6% for Tommy Hilfiger (5% on currency-neutral basis). However, the company continues to expect revenues for Heritage Brands to be flat year over year.Management now envisions fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $7.78-$7.80, compared with $7.60-$7.70 expected earlier.

4362,KORS,"McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) announced a 10.6% hike in its quarterly dividend, to 52 cents per share from 47 cents. The increased dividend is payable on Jan 16, 2018 to shareholders held in record as of Dec 29, 2017.Notably, this represents McCormick’s32nd consecutive year of dividend hike. In November 2016, the company announced a 9.3% increase in its quarterly dividend, up from 7.5% announced in 2015.Dividend hike is a prudent strategy used by companies with a stable cash position and solid prospects. Dividend hike not only enhance shareholder returns but also raise the market value of the stock. Hence, companies bank on this strategy to bolster investors’ optimism in the stock.Apart from regular dividend payments, McCormick’s focus on rewarding shareholders is also evident from share repurchase activities. Evidently, the company has a solid share buyback program of $600 million in place. During the third quarter, the company returned $312 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.What’s Driving the Shareholder-Friendly Moves?McCormick strives to increase profits and boost shareholder returns through acquisitions and cost-saving initiatives. The company’s focus on acquisitions is evident from the recent buyout of Reckitt Benckiser’s food division. In the past, the company has acquired Italy-based Enrico Giotti SpA and Australia-based Botanical Food Company.Moreover, McCormick is resorting to saving costs and enhancing productivity through ongoing Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program. Such efforts enabled the company to deliver double-digit growth in adjusted operating income during the third quarter. McCormick now expects to deliver cost savings of at least $105 million in fiscal 2017 and savings of around $400 million by Nov 30, 2019.What’s Weighing on McCormick?However, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has lost 2.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 7.5%. The company’s performance is eclipsed by sluggishness in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions. Sales in the EMEA region have been dismal due to difficult economic, political and competitive factors.Additionally, higher raw material costs have been a concern for McCormick. Also, the company expects material cost inflation in mid-single digits for fiscal 2017. McCormick has also been increasing brand marketing expenses to drive sales, which may raise expense burden and pressurize results. Nevertheless, we expect cost saving and strategic acquisitions to drive profits and propel the stock in the long term.Done with McCormick?

4363,KORS,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) has been constantly deploying resources to expand product offerings, opening new stores, building shop-in-shops and upgrading e-commerce platform. These endeavors along with the positive earnings streak for the 10th straight quarter gives an indication that the stock is well poised in the long run. Let’s delve deeper.Growth DriversMichael Kors’ acquisition of Jimmy Choo will help diversify portfolio and tap international markets. The buyout is likely to be accretive in the low-single digits in fiscal 2020. In order to drive top-line growth, Michael Kors has been focusing on store expansion. In fiscal 2016, the company opened 142 new stores, which included 47 in the Americas and 95 worldwide. In fiscal 2017, it inaugurated 159 net new stores openings, which includes 111 outlets related to the acquisition of the earlier licensed operation in Greater China.Given the scope for high profitability from company-owned stores, management is putting more emphasis on opening retail outlets. The company also remains focused on enhancing men’s business either through standalone stores or by adding men's offering in the existing lifestyle outlets in North America, Europe and Asia along with expanding luxury fashion product assortments.The company closed the buyout of Michael Kors (HK) Limited, the exclusive licensee in China and certain other jurisdictions in Asia, for $500 million in cash. During second-quarter fiscal 2018, total retail net sales in Asia surged 30.4% on account of new store opening as well as positive comparable sales growth. The company stated that it will continue with the expansion drive in Asia and also believes it has a $1 billion opportunity in the long term.Further, Michael Kors which shares space with Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL  -  Free Report), PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report), has stated that its project Runway 2020 strategic plan has made early progress during the second quarter. Notably, this plan focuses on product innovation, brand engagement and customer experience. As part of the company’s strategy of product innovation it launched Bancroft in the Michael Kors collection line. The product innovation strategy aided the global Women's footwear comparable sales to increase by double digit.ConcernsStiff competition, falling comps, aggressive promotional environment and waning mall traffic are making things tough. We noted that comparable sales dipped 1.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, following declines of 5.9% in the preceding quarter. We noted that comps had declined 14.1%, 6.9%, 5.4% and 7.4% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters, respectively. In fiscal 2018, it continues to expect comparable sales to decrease in the mid-single digit range.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

Management envisions fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $7.78-$7.80.Let’s Delve DeeperPVH Corp. has been delivering robust performance for quite some time now. This is evident from the company’s positive earnings surprise in 13 of the last 14 quarters. Further, it marked fifth consecutive sales beat in third-quarter fiscal 2017. Also, the company has been gaining from solid momentum at its premium Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, particularly in the international regions.Additionally, PVH Corp. has been undertaking significant steps to keep pace with the evolving retail trends and integrate consumers’ changing preferences into operating decisions, thereby aiding it to stay afloat in a tough operating environment. The company’s strategic deals to enhance supply-chain network, develop its omni-channel operations, making innovations are likely to boost performance. Moreover, the company’s healthy balance sheet provides it with the financial flexibility to drive growth in the future.However, PVH Corp.’s significant international presence as well as outlets in various tourist destinations across the United States exposes it to foreign currency risks.

Management has also been executing supply chain initiatives through product cost improvements.Troubled Waters in North AmericaGuess? has been facing a tough retail environment in the United States and Canada.

4366,KORS,"On Thursday, stiletto icon Jimmy Choo, which trades on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker “CHOO,” reported a huge year-over-year rise in pretax profit for the first half of 2017.Before tax, Jimmy Choo said that profits came in at £18.1 million in the six months to June 30, jumping 174% from the prior-year period and surpassing the total profit the company reported for the whole of 2016. However, last year’s figures were affected by foreign exchange losses and higher financing expenses, notes Financial Times.Taking into account interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted earnings grew 19.5% year-over-year.The luxury shoemaker’s revenues surged 16.5% to £201.6 million thanks to foreign-exchange movements; on a constant-currency basis, sales rose 4.5%. Jimmy Choo said its sales have continued to grow ahead of the market, despite a challenging operating environment.Retail and wholesale revenue increased 19% and 10%, respectively, while licensing was another standout segment. Jimmy Choo’s licensing business includes its fragrance and sunglasses lines, and it grew 40% to £8.7 million.“Our long-term growth strategy is to nurture the brand’s unique DNA, to strive for excellence in business execution and to enhance client experience, in order to deliver superior growth and profitability, as well as leveraging the significant investments we have made in the business to date. We have continued to make good progress through the first half and are well positioned to deliver over the remainder of the year,’ said Pierre Denis, CEO of Jimmy Choo.Despite these strong numbers, Jimmy Choo still remain cautious in regards to the overall retail and economic environment. But, the company’s chairman, Peter Harf, said it is confident and excited about Jimmy Choo’s upcoming sale to Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report).Earlier this summer, the “affordable” luxury retailer announced that it  agreed to buy the shoemaker for £896 million, or about $1.2 billion. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year.It’ll be interesting to see how Michael Kors utilizes the Jimmy Choo brand. While the purchase had been a long-rumored one, their customer bases do not go hand in hand. Michael Kors has completely saturated the handbag market—the company is the top handbag maker in the U.S.—with the MK logo seemingly appearing everywhere when you walk down the street. On the other hand, Jimmy Choo is the epitome of luxe. Like its peers Manolo Blahnik and Christian Louboutin, a Jimmy Choo stiletto can easily sell for over $1,000.Kors is likely hoping to use its own massive global infrastructure to expand Jimmy Choo’s footprint. Similar to what Coach  did when the company acquired Stuart Weitzman—Coach also bought fellow handbag maker Kate Spade  this year—the company will probably open Jimmy Choo retail stores and further develop the brand's online presence. And with the shoemaker’s surge in profits, it looks like Kors made a smart choice in scooping up the iconic footwear brand.Looking ahead, Jimmy Choo hopes to implement new logistics improvements to “facilitate improves sell through if collections” during the second half of 2017.Jimmy Choo closed the day up just 0.17%, while shares of KORS are currently trading up over 1% in late-morning trading.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

4367,KORS,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Michael Kors has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10.27, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 19.87. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Michael Kors’ current PE ratio below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.31. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Michael Kors has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 11.46, which is tad higher than the current level. So it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near term.P/CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, Michael Kors’ P/CF ratio of 8.77 is lower than the industry average of 17.47, which indicates that the stock is significantly undervalued in this respect.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Michael Kors currently has a Value Style Score of ‘A’, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Michael Kors a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Michael Kors might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘A’ and a Momentum score of ‘A’. This gives KORS a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘A’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been favorable. The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower, while the full year estimate has seen seven up and in the same time period.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased by 6.4% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has soared 3.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Michael Kors Holdings Limited Price and Consensus  Michael Kors Holdings Limited Price and Consensus | Michael Kors Holdings Limited Quote Despite the bearish bullish sentiments, the stock holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Thus, we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineMichael Kors is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a strong industry rank (among Top 20% of more than 250 industries) instills investor confidence.However, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

4368,KORS,"Premium lifestyle products retailer, Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL  -  Free Report) seems to be striking the right chords as evident from the progress made on its Way Forward Plan and other Restructuring initiatives. The cumulative effect of this progress is not only reflected in the company’s solid earnings surprise trend but has also seeped in to the recent stock performance.Shares of Ralph Lauren have shown significant growth last month as against its dismal past performances. The stock witnessed a solid 19.4% growth in the past month, outperforming the industry’s 4.7% upside.Further, this apparel retailer boasts a VGM Score of A and has a long-term EPS growth rate of 15%.

Divided in two parts, the plan is all about refocusing on the core, strengthening the brands and returning the company to profitable growth in the long term.During the fiscal first quarter, the company enhanced quality of sales by reducing promotions and markdowns, alongside reducing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) count to drive productivity. Further, the company improved inventory turns by curtailing inventory levels by 31% year over year and also achieved cost savings by lowering operating costs. Additionally, the company is keen on optimizing its wholesale distribution by shutting down underperforming points of distribution.Earnings Trend & OutlookRalph Lauren flaunts a solid earnings history, with positive earnings surprises delivered in 15 out of the last 16 quarters. Notably, first-quarter fiscal 2018 marked its 10th consecutive earnings beat. Further, the bottom line grew year over year and gross profit margin continued to expand – thanks to favorable geographic and channel mix shifts along with lower promotions and cost-controls. Also, the company curtailed operating expenses, which in turn drove operating margin expansion.Ralph Lauren Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Ralph Lauren Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ralph Lauren Corporation QuoteLooking ahead, management remains confident of Ralph Lauren’s performance based on its efforts related to global brand reorganization, constant infrastructural investments and eCommerce enhancements. Further, the company’s efforts to evolve product and marketing bode well. Additionally, management lowered effective tax rate forecast for fiscal 2018, which we believe should benefit the bottom line.Positive Estimate RevisionsThese factors led to an uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimates in the last seven days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter and fiscal 2018 rose to $1.77 per share and $4.89 per share, respectively, from $1.70 and $4.81.Sales Continue to DeclineWhile all is well with this New York-based company, its sales continued to be soft due to weak demand, brand exits and efforts to drive quality of sales. This marked the company’s second consecutive sales miss.Currency HeadwindsApart from the aforementioned factors, foreign currency continued to have an adverse impact on Ralph Lauren’s top-line and margins in the most recent quarter. In fact, currency has long been a hindrance for Ralph Lauren, given its international exposure. Currency impacted revenues by nearly 130 basis points (bps) and operating margin by 50 bps in the fiscal first quarter.Further, it anticipates the headwinds to continue to impact results in second-quarter fiscal 2018. For the second quarter, the company expects currency headwinds to hurt revenue growth and operating margin by nearly 40 bps, each.ConclusionWhile the company’s soft top-line picture is discouraging, we commend its progress on its strategic plans, which should bear fruit in the long term. Further, we note that the soft sales performance is more or less a function of its ongoing revival efforts and should recover as the company implements its plans. Aptly, Ralph Lauren currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Meanwhile, investors interested in the space can also count on Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report), PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

4369,KORS,"Investors in Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 1, 2017 $35 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Michael Kors shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Michael Kors is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Textile - Apparel industry that ranks in the Top 19% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while nine analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.51 per share to $1.26 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Michael Kors right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

4370,KORS,"Guess?, Inc. (GES  -  Free Report) posted mixed third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. Management raised earnings outlook for fiscal 2018 and lowered the high end of its previously issued sales guidance.On a GAAP basis, the company reported a loss and also witnessed a sharp decline in adjusted operating profit in the third quarter.These factors dented investors’ confidence as the company’s shares lost 12.3% in the after-market trading session on Nov 21.

On a constant-currency basis, revenues grew 0.6%.

The company’s gross margin also expanded 90 basis points (bps) to 34.5%, owing to improved supply chain initiatives. This was partially offset by higher distribution costs stemming from the development of a new distribution center in Europe.The company reported adjusted operating profit of $12.6 million, which plunged 21.1% from the prior-year quarter. Operating profits were negatively impacted by higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses led by resetting of performance-based compensation.

Store openings and comps growth boosted the region’s performance. Retail comp sales, including e-commerce, improved 10% (up 4% on a constant-currency basis). Operating margin for the segment declined 320 bps to 3% due to higher distribution costs from the repositioning of the European distribution center.

Retail comp sales, including e-commerce, grew 3% (up 5% on a constant-currency basis).

4373,KORS,"On Tuesday, “affordable” luxury retailer Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) announced that it has agreed to buy footwear brand Jimmy Choo, a popular brand name in the fashion world known for its towering stilettos, for about $1.2 billion, or £896 million, in cash. Kors will pay £2.30 per share for the luxury shoemaker.Shares of Jimmy Choo, which trade on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker “CHOO,” rallied after the news broke, surging over 17%. Michael Kors stock, however, is currently trading down about 0.4% in mid-morning trading.""We believe that Jimmy Choo is poised for meaningful growth in the future and our company is committed to supporting the strong brand equity that Jimmy Choo has built over the last 20 years,"" John Idol, CEO of Michael Kors, said in a statement.Jimmy Choo initially announced that it wanted a new buyer in April. Its largest shareholder, JAB Holding, acquired the brand back in 2011 for £540 million, or $800 million at the time, and then took the company public in 2014. But JAB is a privately-held business group, and has built its brand portfolio around coffee and food companies rather than luxury accessories; it owns American coffee giants like Peet’s Coffee & Tea, Caribou Coffee, and Keurig Green Mountain, and recently purchased Panera Bread Co.Michael Kors said the deal has the support of JAB, and comes just a few months after Coach’s  $2.4 billion acquisition of Kate Spade . Coach, an iconic American handbag and leather goods maker, is on a dedicated quest to transform its brand, cutting back on promotional discounts and pulling its products out of department stores; they hope Kate Spade will help them achieve this.It’ll be interesting to see how Michael Kors utilizes the Jimmy Choo brand, however. While the purchase had been a long-rumored one, their customer bases do not go hand in hand. Michael Kors has completely saturated the handbag market—the company is the top handbag maker in the U.S.—with the MK logo seemingly appearing everywhere when you walk down the street. On the other hand, Jimmy Choo is the epitome of luxe. Like its peers Manolo Blahnik and Christian Louboutin, a Jimmy Choo stiletto can easily sell for over $1,000.Kors, though, is hoping to use its own massive global infrastructure to expand Jimmy Choo’s footprint. Similar to what Coach did when the company acquired Stuart Weitzman, the company plans to “support the growth of Jimmy Choo through retail store openings and further development of its online presence as well as through an expanded assortment of additional fashion product offerings.” Jimmy Choo’s existing management team will stay in place as well, like renowned designer Sandra Choi, Michael Kors added.Founded in 1996 by designer Jimmy Choo and former Vogue accessories editor Tamara Mellon, Jimmy Choo is a luxury staple in the fashion industry. Its high price point didn’t stop the brand’s soaring popularity over the years, even appearing in movies and TV shows like The Devil Wears Prada and Sex and the City. In fact, sales have been booming these past few years, and the new deal could be an opportunity to double Jimmy Choo’s yearly sales to $1 billion.While the world will surely be getting a lot more Jimmy Choos, Michael Kors should be cautious in this new venture, making sure it does not cheapen the luxury legacy brand like it did its own.Want to learn more about mergers and acquisitions?

4374,KORS,"""Should you find yourself in a chronically leaking boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks.""- Warren Buffett.At the moment, the quote fits perfectly for Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) as the company’s near-term future looks bleak. Investors need to exercise extreme caution when it comes to the stock as it is unlikely to show any major improvement in the near term. Michael Kors has exhibited a bearish run year to date plunging 20.4% compared with the Zacks categorized Textile-Apparel Manufacturing industry’s decline of 2.8%. Let’s delve deeper and try to assess what’s taking this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company downhill.Stiff competition, falling comps, aggressive promotional environment and waning mall traffic are making things tough for Michael Kors. We noted that comparable sales had fallen 14.1% in the final quarter of fiscal 2017, following declines of 6.9%, 5.4% and 7.4% in the third, second and first quarters, respectively. The company is also struggling with its top-line performance. After registering a meager growth of 0.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, it had declined 3.7%, 3.2% and 11.2% in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017.Despite Michael Kors’ better-than-expected earnings and revenues in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, investor sentiments were hit hard due to year-over-year decline registered in both the top and bottom lines. Additionally, the company provided a bleak outlook. Michael Kors envisions fiscal 2018 total revenue to be approximately $4.25 billion and comparable sales to decrease in the high-single digit range. Management anticipates earnings in the band of 3.57–$3.67 per share for the fiscal year, significantly below the fiscal 2017 earnings per share of $4.24. For the first quarter, Michael Kors forecasts total revenue between $910 million and $930 million, and expects comparable sales to decline in the high-single digit range.Michael Kors’ wholesale segment continues to pose concern for the investors. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, wholesale segment sales declined 22.8% to $456.1 million primarily due to dismal performance of Americas and European region, while on a constant currency basis, it fell 22.3%. In the third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2017, wholesale segment sales declined 17.8%, 18.4% and 7%, respectively. In fiscal 2018, the company expects wholesale segment to decrease in the low-teens range.Still Interested in the Retail Space?

4376,KORS,"Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL  -  Free Report) has seen its shares gain as much as 17.7% since it reported solid results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. In fact, shares touched a 52-week high of $137.59 on May 25, closing the session lower at $137.30.A glimpse of the company’s price performance shows that the stock has surged a whopping 103.9% in a year’s time. It has outperformed both the industry’s increase of 46.1% and the Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 7.6% in the same time frame.Impressive Earnings History & OutlookRalph Lauren boasts a robust earnings surprise history. Fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 marked its 13th consecutive earnings beat driven by stringent focus on initiatives that focuses on core business, improving product assortments and delivering better quality of sales. Further, gross margin continued to expand, courtesy of the company’s efforts to enhance quality of sales through lower promotions, positive geographic and channel mix shifts as well as reduced product costs and mix. Also, foreign currency is aiding the company’s results.For fiscal 2019, operating margin is anticipated to rise marginally (on a currency-neutral basis) backed by higher gross margin. The same metric is anticipated to increase marginally in first-quarter fiscal 2019 on a currency-neutral basis. Foreign currency is also expected to benefit revenue growth by nearly 20-40 bps in the quarter.Uptrend in Earnings Estimates Robust quarterly results have raised analysts’ optimism as reflected by an uptrend in the earnings estimates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.23 for fiscal 2019 and $6.75 for fiscal 2020 moved north 11 cents and 16 cents, respectively, in the past seven days. Also, the consensus mark of $1.41 for first-quarter fiscal 2019 increased 16 cents in the same time frame.Robust StrategiesWe note that Ralph Lauren’s Way Forward Plan is on track. The plan focuses on evolving the company’s core business related to its product, marketing and customer experience as well as reviving its operating structure by developing a systematic way of building stronger assortments, a demand-driven supply chain, an excellent sourcing capability and a multi-channel global expansion strategy.Apart from this, Ralph Lauren is well on track with its restructuring plan, which is likely to generate savings of roughly $140 million by fiscal 2019 end. These restructuring activities include rightsizing the portfolio and cost-structure, alongside streamlining the structure of the organization. Ralph Lauren remains keen on bolstering international presence as well.The company is continually expanding in underpenetrated markets with new small-format stores that are highly productive. Moreover, it is on track to generate nearly $0.5 billion of revenues from Greater China in the next five years.Expansion of digital platforms is a major component of Ralph Lauren’s global growth strategy. In fiscal 2018, the company developed a winning digital ecosystem, including our directly-operated platforms, wholesale digital, pure plays and social commerce.Moving forward, management expects digital growth to accelerate as it has almost completed the development of its directly-operated North America e-commerce business. Also, in first-quarter fiscal 2019, the company targets upgrading technology platforms for the directly-operated European e-commerce business.This transition should eventually enhance shopping experience at its website with enhanced search, navigation and checkout process. Meanwhile, the company’s digital wholesale business has been witnessing marked improvements, which is driving market share gains in this channel at key retailers and categories.ConcernsRalph Lauren is witnessing softness across its North America segment since the last few quarters. Revenues at the North America unit slumped 14% on both reported and constant-currency basis in the fourth quarter due to lower wholesale sales. On a currency-neutral basis, comparable store sales at North America’s retail channel remained flat owing to a 6% rise in brick and mortar stores, which were compensated by an 18% fall in online channel.Moreover, management provided a soft sales view for first-quarter and fiscal 2019. The company expects fiscal first-quarter revenues in the range of flat to down slightly, excluding currency impact. In fiscal 2019, revenues are likely to decline by low-single digits, excluding currency impacts. Bottom LineWe believe these hurdles will be easily offset by this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s robust strategic actions. Also, Ralph Lauren has a Momentum Score of A and long-term earnings growth rate of 10.3%, which are impressive.Want Top-Ranked Textile-Apparel Stocks?

4377,KORS,"Semtech Corporation (SMTC  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal first-quarter 2019 results on May 30. In the last reported quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.44%.The company’s surprise history has been pretty impressive. It beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with an averageof 6.08%.Coming to share price movement, Semtech’s shares have returned only 21.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 15.96%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlaySemtech reported mixed fiscal fourth-quarter 2018 results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues matching the same.The company’s improved profitability was driven by differentiated growth drivers and diversification strategy. The key growth drivers for Semtech are product differentiation, operational flexibility, and a specific focus on the fast-growing segments and regions.However, in the fiscal fourth quarter, the company witnessed weak revenues due to inventory reductions at smartphone customers and softness in the China base station market. Also, industrial and communications end markets witnessed weak demand and both decreased sequentially, representing 27% and 11% of the total revenues, respectively.Nevertheless, the growing need for more efficient energy management in home and industrial settings, increasing electronic system requirements for mobile devices, and the propagation of green standards will continue to drive demand in these segments.However, concerns about the company’s exposure to seasonality, a competitive market and foreign exchange risk persist.For fiscal first-quarter 2019, on a non-GAAP basis, management expects revenues in the range of $147-$153 million. This implies a 7% sequential increase at the mid-point of the guided range.Non-GAAP gross profit margin is expected within 61.0-61.5%. Management projects SG&A expenses within $26-$27.5 million, and expenditure on research and development of $25-$26 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected in the range of 45-47 cents. This implies a 10% sequential increase at the mid-point of the guided range.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Semtech will beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.

4378,KORS,"Iconix Brand Group, Inc. (ICON  -  Free Report) has been in the red for a while, evident from bearish run in the market. Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock have plunged 88% in a year, against the industry’s rally of 20.2%.What’s Weighing Down the Stock?Iconix’s performance has been sluggish, thanks to persistent softness in women's and men's segments. Notably, in third-quarter 2017, sales in the women’s and men’s categories declined 13% and 5% respectively. Earlier, these segments depicted a decline of 12% and 18% during second-quarter 2017, respectively.The women’s and men’s segments businesses have mainly been marred by dismal brand performances, due to heightened competition in the retail market. Apart from the Danskin brand, the women’s segment performance was weakened by lower licensing revenues from OP brands and Mossimo during the third quarter. Additionally, in the men’s business portfolio, prolonged weakness in the Starter business has been a major drag. Consequently, the licensing agreement for this brand with Wal-Mart will not be renewed by the management. Apart from these, revenues at the Home segment also fell 6% in the third quarter, causing total licensing revenues to tumble 12% year over year. Also, management expects revenues for 2017 at the lower end of its previous range of $225-$235 million.To make matters worse, the company’s performance is also weighed down by debt. Iconix is striving to reducing its huge debt burden, through various initiatives. To this end, the company has already divested non-core brands such as Sharper Image, Peanuts Worldwide LLC and Strawberry Shortcake which have however weakened its top-line expansion capabilities. Until the third quarter, Iconix’s debt totaled $1,055 million.    Any Scope of Revival?Considering the growth depicted by the international business segment, management is on track with expanding Iconix’s global footprint. Incidentally, Iconix’s international segment grew 4% and 3% in the third and second quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. For 2017, the company projects international business to receive a boost from growth of global power brands such as Umbro and Lee Cooper and continued expansion of core brands which includes Starter, Ecko, OP Ocean Pacific and Zoo York.  Moreover, the company purchased the remaining 50% interest in Iconix Canada from its joint-venture partner in July 2017. This is expected to strengthen the company’s business in the region in the forthcoming periods.Although Iconix’s business growth strategies seem promising, we need to wait and see if they can manage to uplift business in the forthcoming periods.

4379,KORS,"There seems to be a lot of cheer in the Textile-Apparel industry with many companies putting up a stellar show — driven by favorable economic indicators and strategic growth endeavors. Ranked among the top 13% out of more than 250 Zacks industries, the industry has gained 11.1% in the past three months.On the contrary, we have Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) which has lost 10.8% in the same time frame, thereby being a drag on the otherwise buoyant space. Notably, other players like Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report), Lululemon Athletica (LULU  -  Free Report) and PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) have contributed to the industry’s rally, keeping pace with the evolving consumer trends, international expansion and brand enhancement efforts. While all these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Hanesbrands carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So, let’s delve deeper into the factors that have caused Hanesbrands to be the odd one out and see if there’s any scope for turnaround.Why is Hanesbrands the Odd One Out?Hanesbrands has been struggling with its domestic performance, owing to soft store traffic and a tough retail landscape. Evidently, these headwinds hurt the company’s back-to-school selling season performance, which along with the U.S. hurricanes and earthquake in Mexico have affected the company in third-quarter 2017.Apart from this, Hanesbrands is also battling soft sales at its Innerwear segment for quite some time now on account of soft brick-and-mortar performance stemming from sluggish traffic. In the third quarter, sales at this unit declined 5.2% to $644.1 million as the apparel category bore the brunt of a tough back-to-school retail landscape. Prior to this, sales for the segment fell 2.5% in the second quarter of 2017, 6% in the first quarter of 2017 and 8% in the fourth quarter of 2016.Well, the Intimate Apparel/Innerwear industry is highly competitive and extremely price sensitive. Therefore, the company’s strategy to focus more on premium brands and increase prices in these categories come with the inherent risk of consumers shifting to more competitively-priced brands. This, in turn, is a threat to Hanesbrands’ market share.Unfortunately, management expects the effect of the aforementioned natural disasters and a difficult retail sales environment to linger in 2017 as well. Moreover, it anticipates the fourth quarter to be impacted by additional marketing investments to capture market share, the recently announced Alternative Apparel buyout and effects of Sears Canada bankruptcy.Considering all the above factors, Hanesbrands had lowered the upper end of its sales and earnings guidance for 2017 during the third quarter earnings announcement. The company now projects net sales in the band of $6.45-$6.48 billion and adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the $1.93-$1.95 per share range.  Consequently, estimates for the fourth quarter and 2017 have moved south by a notch to 52 cents and $1.94, respectively, since the earnings announcement.Any Scope for Revival Ahead?Nevertheless, Hanesbrands’ international segment has been gaining from its focus on acquisitions, particularly Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia. On a currency-neutral basis, sales at the International segment jumped 14% in the third quarter, wherein Hanesbrands posted organic sales growth for the first time in eight quarters. Apart from the aforementioned factors, extensive online sales growth also bolstered sales improvement at the segment. Going forward, management expects organic sales growth to remain positive as it anticipates the fourth quarter to mark another quarter of organic sales growth.While these factors and cost savings from Project Booster make us hopeful about Hanesbrands’ revival prospects, it remains to be seen if these drivers can actually place the company in tandem with the other industry gainers.  Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

4380,KORS,"The year 2017 turned out to be a favorable one for Columbia Sportswear Company (COLM  -  Free Report) with its share price surging close to 23% compared with the industry’s gain of 8.4%. Despite persistent challenges in the U.S. region, the company’s international presence widened significantly in 2017, courtesy of brand popularity. Moreover, Columbia Sportswear’s continued efforts to enhance efficiency and improve brand presence are also expected to boost performance in the forthcoming periods.Let’s now analyze how the stock is placed for 2018.Strong Strides in International MarketsColumbia Sportswear has been gaining from solid sales growth in international regions, supported by significant footprint in close to 100 nations worldwide. In this respect, the company’s European wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses have been performing well. The company’s Columbia and SOREL brands have been depicting strong growth in the European and Canada regions. In third-quarter 2017, the company’s sales from Canada, the EMEA and Latin America/Asia Pacific regions increased 8%, 20% and 9%, respectively.Although the company has significant potential in a variety of markets, we believe that the largest opportunity is in China, considering the region’s strength in digital wholesale and e-commerce channels. Further, we expect the company to witness substantial growth in the emerging markets.Brand Strengthening EffortsColumbia Sportswear’s brand-enhancing efforts have played an essential role in augmenting the company’s business. In the past year, the company developed more than 150 shop-in-shops and increased the number of brand presentations in key partner store locations.Additionally, consumers are inclining toward a healthier lifestyle with enhanced participation in outdoor activities. This has been driving the active apparel and accessories industry. Sportswear is increasingly becoming a style statement and is being worn casually owing to advanced designs and greater comfort. Such trends are particularly benefiting the company’s prAna brand. The prAna brand is also attracting an expanding base of female consumers. Further, constant upgrades and effective management have boosted the consumer base for prAna and SOREL brands.Project CONNECTIn June 2017, Columbia Sportswear started a new operating model assessment project — Project CONNECT. The initiative focuses on connecting consumers, wholesale customers and international distributors with manufacturing partners and employees across the globe. The project is expected to have a wide-spread impact on the company’s operations in 2018 and includes a number of initiatives to enhance revenues, capture efficiencies, improve the marketing process and lower SG&A costs. These endeavors are anticipated to boost the company’s direct-to-consumer and wholesale channel performance.Final ThoughtsColumbia Sportswear has been facing challenges in the U.S. region, especially on the wholesale front. Several clients have either announced store closures or declared bankruptcy. Additionally, the company has been struggling against increased SG&A expenses, stemming from enhanced marketing spend and initiatives for improving performance.Nevertheless, we expect Columbia Sportswear to effortlessly tide over the aforementioned challenges backed by strong international presence, efficiency and brand building efforts. With such solid fundamentals rolled-up in its sleeves, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company seems well positioned to sustain growth momentum in 2018.  Do Consumer Discretionary Stocks Interest You?

4384,KORS,"Hanesbrands Inc’s (HBI  -  Free Report) top line has been gaining from the stellar performance of international business and sturdy growth in e-commerce channel. However, Hanesbrands domestic operations have been soft owing to a tough retail landscape.Let’s now delve into the factors impacting Hanesbrands performance of late.International Business Aids Organic Sales After reporting bleak performance for eight straight quarters, Hanesbrands posted organic sales growth for the first time during third-quarter 2017. The upside can be attributed to solid International sales, which represented nearly 31% of the top line. Extensive growth in online sales contributed toward the international segment’s performance. Moreover, management expects organic sales to continue gaining from international business in the upcoming periods.Strategic Acquisitions & e-commerce Bode Well Hanesbrands undertakes strategic acquisitions to strengthen portfolio and increase infrastructural capabilities. The company has been gaining from the buyouts of Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia. In October, the company announced the buyout of Alternative Apparel which is expected to generate net sales of roughly $70 million in 2017 and boost the Activewear business.Apart from strategic takeovers, Hanesbrands also relies on online business to drive top-line performance. The company’s online sales were impressive during third-quarter 2017, as sales growth from global online channels was in the high 20s range. Going ahead, Hanesbrands is focused on making incremental investments in online business to keep up with consumers’ evolving shopping patterns.Factors Denting Performance Recently, Hanesbrands performance in the United States has been dismal owing to a tough retail landscape and adverse weather conditions. Further, increased marketing investments in the region may also hamper the company’s profits.  Apart from this, the company has also been facing troubles in innerwear segment due to intense competition and soft brick-and-mortar performance. These factors, along with impacts from the bankruptcy of Sears Canada, compelled management to trim sales and earnings outlook for 2017. The curtailed view weighed upon investors’ optimism, who have long been troubled by the tough scenario in the apparel space. Shares of the company have declined 16.3% in the past three months, underperforming the industry’s 6.3% rally.Final ThoughtsWe expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to counter weak domestic business scenario through advancements in international segment. The positive synergies from strategic acquisitions and steadily expanding online sales platform are also expected to uplift price performance in the upcoming periods.Do Consumer Discretionary Stocks Interest You?

4385,KORS,"Generally, the investment community believes that only risky securities could generate lucrative returns. The strategy seems meaningful when the market is bullish. But investors should also be ready to accept lackluster returns when the market turns bearish.With intense research, we have developed a strategy which clearly shows that less risky assets can also provide investors with impressive returns only when some parameters are considered.Meaning of BetaBeta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market (we are considering the S&P 500 here). That is, beta measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market.If the beta is equal to 1 it means that the stock is as volatile as the market. So, a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1.For example, if the beta is 1.8 then the stock will witness 80% more movement than the market.  Hence, we can say that if the market goes up, the stock will outperform by 80%. Conversely, if the market plunges, the stock will lose much more value than the market.Building a Low-Risk PortfolioIn order to find stocks with lower-than-market volatility, we added beta between 0 and 0.6 as our main criterion for screening. However, we need to keep in mind that low beta is not the only metric to be considered for choosing stocks in a volatile market. Hence to reach the winning strategy, we have considered a few additional criteria.Percentage Change in Price in the last 4 Weeks: We considered those stocks that saw positive price movement over the last month.Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable.Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Here are five of the 15 stocks that fit the bill:Based in London, Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) is a global luxury lifestyle company, founded by designer Michael Kors.

4386,KORS,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in UAA.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 19 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 37 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 21 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Under Armour has seen 17 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 2 cents a share from 21 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock has also seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 24.4% in the past month.Under Armour, Inc.

4389,KORS,"We’ve got another busy week in store: more Q3 earnings and economic data, Republicans in U.S. Congress get busy working through the details of its massive tax reform program and the arrest in Saudi Arabia of a man known as “the Warren Buffett of the Middle East” are all grabbing headlines this morning. And we also see what appears to be a hostile bid by Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) to take over Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) for $70 per share, or $130 billion, including $60 billion in cash and Qualcomm debt.Should this merger deal be accepted, it would be the largest pure-tech deal in history, which would be accretive to Broadcom after the first year of the merge. But odds are very good Qualcomm will reject this proposal; though the company has acknowledged it has received the offer but given no indications that its board will find the terms favorable. Considering Qualcomm’s recent difficulties as a supplier of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) products, some may see this as Broadcom moving at a very advantageous time.Reports this morning are that Qualcomm officials are openly questioning the initial asking price, as well as antitrust issues, in what is understood to be an initially negative reaction. And would Apple’s involvement — behind the scenes, perhaps — somehow manage to facilitate this deal down the road in a way that puts Qualcomm’s issues with Apple behind them? One thing is for sure: this is a discussion just warming up; we expect to hear much more about this proposed deal throughout the rest of this week and beyond.Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, reportedly facing money laundering charges following a corruption purge by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, may cause some ripples through the U.S. markets this morning — especially in two of al-Waleed’s major holdings, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report). Questions regarding Middle Eastern countries surrounding and necessarily affected by the crown prince’s moves, such as rival major power in the region, Iran, and Lebanon, which has had its own issues with stability at the top recesses of government.Futures in U.S. markets are so far shaking all of this off. We are in the green again this morning, following 8 straight weeks of an up-market. As we’ve discussed before here and elsewhere, at least some of this positive sentiment is a result of hopefulness that corporate tax cuts will create new windfalls for companies and their shareholders, perhaps even before the year is out.Q3 Earnings UpdateCVS Pharmacy (CVS  -  Free Report) beat estimates by a penny to $1.50 per share this morning, on in-line quarterly sales of $46.18 billion. Earnings are down year over year, but revenues were up 3.5%. CVS also upped its earnings guidance for full-year 2017.Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) well outperformed expectations before today’s opening bell, with earnings of $1.33 per share easily surpassing the 83 cents in the Zacks consensus, up 37% year over year. Fiscal Q2 2018 sales of $1.147 billion topped the $1.046 billion we had been expecting. Guidance for both fiscal Q3 and full-year 2018, on both top and bottom lines, were also raised.Mylan Pharma (MYL  -  Free Report), however, missed expectations on both earnings and revenues, with $1.10 per share short of the $1.22 we were looking for, and $3.0 billion in sales beneath the $3.08 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Weaker-than-expected performance in North America, underscored by a fall in EpiPen sales in the quarter, were cited in the company’s report.

4390,KORS,"Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report) has recently concluded the two-year expansion of its manufacturing unit in La Tablada city in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. This facility is likely to manufacture front load washing machines with Sense Inverter technology.The latest expansion is in sync with the more than $20 million investment plan initiated last year, following commencement of manufacturing at the facility. With this expansion, the company has successfully introduced its global platform and innovations to the Argentina market, which is among its key business centers.Further, this calls for the addition of Argentina to Whirlpool’s roster of facilities that already include 70 manufacturing and technology research units across the globe. Not only this, the new facility is expected to add about 100 new and 300 indirect jobs in the region.Additionally, we expect this facility to enhance the sales of the company’s Latin America region. Notably, the Latin America segment contributed 15.7% to net sales in third-quarter 2017, reflecting a sales growth of 6.1% year over year. Though the region is performing well, its operating margin growth was somewhat hurt by raw material inflation and adverse product price/mix in the quarter.Notably, Whirlpool is among the few companies that heavily invest in technologies to produce differentiated products to suit the needs of their end consumers. Therefore, we believe the latest manufacturing facility strategically fits the company’s practice of providing innovative products to consumers, thereby helping them to develop the home ecosystem.However, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s shares have lost 8.9% in the past six months, narrower than the industry’s plunge of 20.9%. Much of the stock’s decline can be attributed to Whirlpool’s dismal surprise history. While the bottom line delivered fifth consecutive negative earnings surprise in the third quarter, sales marked its second straight miss.Nevertheless, we remain optimistic about the company’s 2020 goals, ongoing growth initiatives, global cost-based pricing and fixed cost reduction strategies, which are likely to drive growth and make Whirlpool investors’ favorite.Looking for Trending Picks, Check TheseSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Discretionary sector include Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL  -  Free Report), Guess?, Inc.

4391,KORS,"Despite facing challenges at its U.S. retail business, Guess?, Inc. (GES  -  Free Report) has been recording year-over-year growth in its top line for five straight quarters now. The robust top-line performance stems mainly from the superb performance in Europe and Asia. Sales in these regions have been booming, courtesy of store additions as well as solid e-commerce business.Notably, these factors have helped this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock surge 38.5% so far this year, crushing the industry’s growth of 2.2%. While weakness in the U.S. retail business, due to soft traffic, remains a hurdle, let’s see if the company’s international strength can offset these barriers and sustain its solid momentum.Europe & Asia vs Americas RetailGuess? has been delivering increased sales in these regions for roughly a year now, driven by higher comparable store sales (comps), impressive e-commerce business and focus on store expansion. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, sales in Europe advanced 19%, mainly owing to the company’s efforts to enhance sales quality and merchandising organisation. Comps jumped 10% thanks to store openings and strong e-commerce business, with the latter gaining from Guess?’s own website and its alliances with Auto and Zalando. As for the third-quarter store openings, the company opened 22 net new stores in Europe, of which 11 were introduced in Guess?’s fastest growing markets — Turkey and Russia. Notably, the company’s wholesale business also remained sturdy for the second straight season.In Asia, sales increased 17% led by store openings and comps growth (including e-commerce) of 3%. During the third quarter, Guess? Introduced 10 net new directly operated stores in China, where the company also sees robust prospects from its digital business. Well, Guess?’s digital footprint in China is on the rise, thanks to its partnership with Tmall and new deal with VIP.com. Additionally, the company’s operating margin in Asia expanded year over year for the fourth straight time, in the third quarter.On the contrary, sales in the Americas Retail tumbled 13%, marred by a 10% fall in comps (including e-commerce) and adverse impacts from hurricanes. Americas Retail has been posting soft results for a while now as the region is struggling with intense competition and sluggish store traffic stemming from consumers’ evolving preferences. Consequently, management is progressing well with its plans of curtailing its U.S. footprint by undertaking store closures.While these factors are likely to hurt sales, management expects strength in Europe and Asia to tide over these obstacles. Evidently, the company projects fourth-quarter revenues for the company to rise in a range of 5-7%, as robust growth in Europe and Asia is likely to compensate for the weakness in Americas Retail. Thus, we believe that Guess?’s sturdy international business, with its constant focus on store expansions and enhancing e-commerce business, is likely to propel the company further.Looking for More?

4393,KORS,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) has done exceedingly well and emerged as a strong contender to be an investment choice. This is quite evident from the stock’s surge of 92.6% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 23.4%.We believe there is still momentum left in this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, which is reflected from its long-term earnings growth rate of 7.5% and upward estimate revisions in the past 90 days. Stocks such as Columbia Sportswear Company (COLM  -  Free Report), Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL  -  Free Report) and V.F. Corporation (VFC  -  Free Report) which belong to the same industry have witnessed a gain of 31.3%, 9% and 39.6% in the past six months, respectively. Let’s delve deeper and find out the reason that kept Michael Kors ahead of its peers. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Turnaround StrategyMichael Kors’ acquisition of Jimmy Choo will help diversify portfolio and tap international markets. The buyout is likely to be accretive in the low single digits in fiscal 2020. In order to drive top-line growth, Michael Kors has been focusing on store expansion. In fiscal 2016, the company opened 142 new stores, which included 47 in the Americas and 95 worldwide. In fiscal 2017, it opened 159 net new stores openings, which includes 111 outlets related to the acquisition of the earlier licensed operation in Greater China. Given the scope for high profitability from company-owned stores, management is putting more emphasis on opening retail outlets. Moreover, the company stated that it will continue with the expansion drive in Asia and also believes it has a $1 billion opportunity in the long term.Michael Kors had earlier stated that its project Runway 2020 strategic plan, which focuses on product innovation, brand engagement and customer experience, has made rapid progress during the second quarter. As part of the company’s strategy of product innovation, it launched Bancroft in the Michael Kors collection line. The product innovation strategy aided the global Women's footwear comparable sales to increase by double digit. Moreover, e-commerce continues to post robust performance.Valuation PerspectiveA brief glance at some valuation metrics seems to indicate that Michael Kors has enough room to run in bourses.Michael Kors looks attractive with respect to a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 16.3x compared with industry’s 16.8x. A more-or-less similar picture emerges when comparing EV/EBITDA ratios. Michael Kors holds the edge here with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 9.4 lower than 16.6 for the industry.Earnings Trend & Estimate RevisionsMichael Kors continued with positive earnings surprise streak for the 10th consecutive quarter, when it posted second-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Further, revenues came ahead of the estimate for the third straight quarter. The bottom line was driven by lower effective tax rate and strategic efforts taken by the company.Let’s look at Michael Kors earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 has increased by 6.7% to $3.96. Further, earnings estimates have jumped by 6.3% to $4.06 per share for fiscal 2019.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes """"All In"""" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

Management intends to upgrade e-commerce platform and expects the channel to be a significant contributor in the long run. We note that despite the possibility of heavy investments weighing on margins in the short term, the company continues to take up strategic endeavors.Michael Kors’ Runway 2020 strategic plan, which focuses on product innovation, brand engagement and customer experience, is likely to drive the top line. The company had earlier launched Bancroft in the Michael Kors collection line as part of its strategy of product innovation.However, stiff competition, declining comps, aggressive promotional environment and waning mall traffic are making things tough. We noted that comparable sales dropped 3.2% in third-quarter fiscal 2018, following declines of 1.8% and 5.9% in the second and first quarter, respectively.

In fact, these constant endeavors have helped the company to stay afloat even in a challenging retail landscape. Some recent evidences of PVH Corp’s growth efforts include its latest agreement with Li & Fung, which is likely to enhance the former’s supply-chain network.Moreover, the company inked a deal to acquire True&Co, which is a direct-to-consumer intimate apparel online retailer. This deal underscores its focus on making innovations and developing omni-channel operations to enrich consumer experience.

4407,KORS,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 8. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?Michael Kors has a remarkable history, at least in terms of the bottom line. The company continued with its positive earnings surprise streak for the seventh straight quarter, as it reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 8.1%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is 62 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of over 29%. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $918 million, down over 4% from the year-ago quarter.Well the obvious question that comes to mind, will Michael Kors be able to sustain its positive earnings surprise streak in the fourth quarter. Well past trends do indicate toward that direction but it will not be wise to jump to a conclusion without analyzing the factors at play.Factors at PlayWe remained concerned about Michael Kors’ wholesale segment performance, which has witnessed a sharp decline in the previous few quarters. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, wholesale segment sales declined 22.8% to $456.1 million primarily due to dismal performance of Americas and European regions, while on a constant currency basis, it fell 22.3%. In the third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2017, wholesale segment sales declined 17.8%, 18.4% and 7%, respectively. In fiscal 2018, the company expects wholesale segment to decrease in the low-teens range.Stiff competition, waning comps, aggressive promotional environment and sluggish mall traffic are making things tough for Michael Kors. We noted that comparable sales had fallen 14.1% in the final quarter of fiscal 2017, following declines of 6.9%, 5.4% and 7.4% in the third, second and first quarters, respectively. The company is also struggling with its top-line performance. After registering a meager growth of 0.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, it had declined 3.7%, 3.2% and 11.2% in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017.For the first quarter, Michael Kors forecasts total revenue between $910 million and $930 million, and expects comparable sales to decline in the high-single digit range. Operating margin is anticipated to be approximately 13%. Management projects earnings in the range of 60–64 cents per share for the first quarter.However, the company has been constantly deploying resources to expand product offerings, open new stores, and build shop-in-shops along with upgrading information system and distribution infrastructure. Management intends to upgrade eCommerce platform and expects the channel to be a significant contributor in the long run. We note that despite the possibility of heavy investments weighing upon the margins in the short term, management continues to take up strategic endeavors.Michael Kors Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Michael Kors Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Michael Kors Holdings Limited QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils? Well our proven model does not conclusively show that Michael Kors is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.
