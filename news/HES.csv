But Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Boeing (BA) and Visa (V) rallied on strong results. Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) initially hit buy points Friday, but pulled back.Amazon's first-quarter earnings skyrocketed, more doubling the EPS estimate.

Fellow Dow Jones stock United Technologies (UTX) reported stronger-than-expected Q1 earnings and sales. The industrial giant also raised its full-year adjusted EPS and sales forecast.Lockheed Martin (LMT) topped first-quarter estimates and the defense contractor raised EPS and revenue targets. But the F-35 maker didn't raise its cash-flow expectation. Northrop Grumman (NOC) also reported Q1 earnings above estimates, but Northrop said it didn't submit a bid for the Air Force's GPS III contract, leaving Lockheed as the likely lone bidder. Raytheon (RTN) raised its full-year earnings forecast above consensus as its Q1 earnings and revenue topped estimates. General Dynamics (GD) beat on earnings and met revenue views. Shares of all four defense contractors sold off sharply for the week.The software kingpin earned 95 cents a share, up 36% year over year, on sales of $26.8 billion, up 16%, in its fiscal third quarter. Analysts expected 85 cents and $25.71 billion. Microsoft (MSFT) has been shifting its business from desktop PC software to cloud-computing infrastructure and applications, such as Office 365 and Azure. Microsoft's commercial cloud revenue rose 58% in fiscal Q3. The software giant initially reclaimed a recent buy point on Friday, but pared gains.Intel (INTC) earnings rose 32% as sales grew 9% to $16.1 billion, both well above analyst views. The chip giant guided higher for current quarter sales, indicating a third-straight quarter of top-line growth. Shares initially jumped to a 17-year high Friday but reversed to close slightly lower. Texas Instruments (TXN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) got boosts from upbeat earnings reports. But chip-gear maker Teradyne (TER) tumbled after warning of weak demand for equipment to test mobile devices. Western Digital (WDC), which makes disk drives and memory chips, tumbled Friday despite beating fiscal Q3 views. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fought for support at its 200-day moving average.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped views but a sharp rise in capital spending, margin pressure and higher traffic acquisition costs sparked a sell-off in the internet search giant. Capex jumped to $7.3 billion from $2.5 billion in the year-ago period, including $2.4 billion for a real estate purchase in Manhattan. Traffic costs — or what Google pays partner websites to generate advertising revenue — jumped 36% to $6.288 billion. Google has hiked spending on YouTube and video content, cloud computing, smart home consumer appliances and artificial intelligence projects.PayPal (PYPL) topped earnings and revenue expectations as total payment volume rose 27% to $132 billion year over year, vs. estimates of $128 billion. The company raised its 2018 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance.

U.S. crude oil futures briefly topped $69 a barrel, the highest level since late 2014, but traded little changed for the week.General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) beat quarterly estimates. Ford will not invest in traditional sedans for North America going forward, and will almost phase out passenger cars by 2020, as consumers migrate to SUVs and light trucks. GM still sees small cars as an opportunity at home and abroad, even as it too shifts focus to larger and more profitable vehicles.Casino operator Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped first-quarter results estimates, helped by strong demand in global gaming hub Macau and in Singapore. Macau also helped Q1 results for Wynn Resorts (WYNN), but its overall and Macau sales disappointed some analysts. Wynn Resorts also approved a dividend increase. The earnings report from Wynn was the first since Steve Wynn resigned as CEO and sold his stake following allegations of sexual misconduct. MGM Resorts (MGM) narrowly beat, but the stock tumbled on declining traffic at its U.S. locations. MGM is more U.S.-focused than Sands or Wynn.Amgen (AMGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) broadly topped Q1 views, though Amgen's sales and adjusted profit outlook for 2018 were a bit soft at the midpoints. Sales of Alexion's blockbuster Soliris missed some estimates, but shares popped on a promising study for new drug ALXN1210. Biogen (BIIB) sales lagged on sluggish Spinraza and multiple sclerosis drug revenue. Prothena (PRTA) tanked 69% on Monday after it scrapped a rare disease drug on a failed Phase 2 study.

Shares rose 7.3% on Thursday. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) stock vaulted 24% to a 10-month high after EPS unexpectedly jumped 33%. Same-store sales also topped. Starbucks (SBUX) was on par on earnings with an 18% EPS rise to 53 cents, though a 14% rise on sales to $6.03 billion outdid analyst predictions.New Oriental Education (EDU) earned 67 cents per share as revenue grew to $618 million. Total student enrollments rose 7.7% year over year to about 861,400. IBD 50 stock TAL Education's (TAL) EPS jumped to 14 cents a share as revenue soared 59% to $504 million. Student enrollments ballooned 96% vs. a year earlier to 2.62 million. New Oriental and TAL shares popped on their respective earnings days, but were slightly lower for the week intraday Friday.PulteGroup (PHM) on Tuesday crushed views with a 111% EPS jump to 59 cents, with home sale revenue leaping 21% to $1.9 billion. Homebuilder stocks were generally muted due to rising interest rates. But D.R. Horton (DHI), the biggest U.S. builder, on Thursday bested views with a 52% EPS surge as revenue swelled 17% to $3.795 billion. Homebuilder stocks rallied for solid gains, helped by cooling Treasury yields. New-home sales rose in March to an annualized sales pace of 694,000 units, a four-month high. Meanwhile existing-home prices rose 6.8% in February vs. a year earlier.China search-engine leader Baidu (BIDU) reported a Q1 profit that blew past estimates, lifting shares. Baidu still owns a majority of iQiyi (IQ), which held its IPO in March. Video streaming website iQiyi accounts for roughly 20% of the parent's revenue. Shares in iQiyi fell after it released earnings in tandem with Baidu.Visa (V) reported a 29% EPS gain on a 13% revenue rise, both beating fiscal Q2 views. The credit- and debit-card giant raised its full-year revenue outlook. Shares leapt 4.8% on Thursday.3M (MMM) met EPS views as revenue rose 8% to $8.278 billion, just above consensus. But the Dow Jones giant slashed its full-year EPS target. 3M stock plunged.Caterpillar (CAT) reported strong Q1 earnings and sales, but shares of the heavy construction and equipment maker reversed sharply lower Tuesday after warning that operating margins hit a ""high watermark"" for the year.ServiceNow (NOW) reported Q1 profit and revenue above estimates. Fifty-two customers now spend over $5 million annually, a metric that is up 108% year over year.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) topped sales and adjusted profit views, but shares tanked as sales of transcatheter heart valve replacements lagged.Illumina (ILMN) beat the consensus. Adjusted profit rose 127% per share as sales swelled 31% to $782 million.Align Technology (ALGN) reported adjusted earnings of $1.17 per share and $436.9 million in revenue, handily beating views for 98 cents and $408 million, respectively.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) delivered impressive Q1 EPS and revenue growth, but fell short of some lofty expectations. Shares fell 4.7% for the week. E-Trade Financial (ETFC) continues to rise after last week's strong results.First Solar (FSLR) hit a six-year high after Q1 earnings topped expectations due to the sale of several solar projects, as it expanded U.S. production.Proofpoint (PFPT), a cybersecurity firm, topped adjusted first-quarter earnings and revenue views, but guided low on Q2 profit. Shares fell 5.2% Friday. In Q1, advanced protection solutions nearly doubled to make up 20% of new and add-on bookings, up from 15% in the prior quarter.

Stock markets tumbled around the world, and confidence crumbled in emerging markets and the riskiest forms of debt. The S&P 500 energy index fell 4.4% Monday, led by Chesapeake Energy (CHK)and Hess (HES), which slid 7.2% and 6.9%, respectively.Meanwhile, the number of rigs searching for crude in American shale fields jumped to the highest in more than five months last week, a harbinger of ever-greater oil output.""This is contagious from the financial markets and the equity market, especially,"" Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass., said by phone. ""People worry that the demand may not be as robust over the next couple of quarters as people have been anticipating.""West Texas intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, topped $66 a barrel this year for the first time since 2014, extending a rally driven by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' decision to extend production cuts among its members and allies. While crude's strong start to the year was also helped by dwindling American inventories and a weakening dollar, analysts have raised concerns that a potential surge in U.S. shale output could hurt prices.""There is more supply coming to this market, and we are entering the period of the refineries' maintenance,"" John Kilduff, founding partner at Again Capital LLC, said in a phone interview. ""We are going to see a hit to demand globally that is lowering global prices today.""WTI for March delivery dropped $1.30 and settled at $64.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 69% above the 100-day average.Brent for April settlement lost 96 cents to close at $67.62 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $3.79 to April WTI.U.S. drillers last week added six rigs to raise the number of machines drilling for crude to 765, the highest since Aug. 11, Baker Hughes data showed Friday. That may lead to a further increase in U.S. crude production, which breached 10 million barrels a day in November to the highest level in more than four decades.

The small cap Russell 2000 rose 0.2%.Volume was running lower on both major exchanges. In the past dozen sessions, only one day showed strong volume on the Nasdaq: Wednesday's turnover was 15% above average.Oil stocks were enjoying a boost. The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil rose 1.5% to just above $53 a barrel. The U.S. attack on Syria has added a risk premium to the price of oil, even though Syria is not a major oil producer.Hess (HES), an international oil explorer and producer, advanced 3.5% in volume about 15% above average.

39,HES,"U.S. equities shaved off some of Monday morning's steep losses, yet the broad decline remained largely intact with one hour left in the trading session.Higher volume on both exchanges vs. the same time on Friday indicated some intense profit-taking by large money managers. Oil and gas, wood products, fiber optic tech, and internet content firms led the market's downside.Given the sell-off, IBD investors need to pay close attention to the degree of pullback by their stocks that have broken out of well-formed bases or rallied off a key support level, including the 10-week moving average. And a few in techland appear to be doing just fine.They include megacap consumer tech play Apple (AAPL), sinking just 0.6% to 121.23, still above a cup-with-handle breakout at 118.12; Applied Materials (AMAT), an emerging play for actuator chips, down 2.1%; and fellow chip-equipment firm KLA-Tencor (KLAC), off only 0.3% to 85.88 and holding above an 83.33 flat-base entry.Actuators convert digital signals into physical motion, light or sound and pose as the next step in the Internet of Things megatrend. Applied Materials, down nearly 2% to 34.31, is still more than 10% past a recent flat-base breakout at 31.17; and its RS line continues to rise.IBD'S TAKE: Apple is one several blue-chip stocks that have broken out in recent weeks. Apple is one of six Dow stocks in buy range to start the week. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) continues to hint that it's not ready to succumb to a big sell-off, even after rallying more than 260% from a March 2016 breakout past an early-stage cup with handle at 33.16 and flashing climax-run-like action at the end of December. Shares in the leading graphics processors firm edged 1.6% lower following a sharp rebound over the prior nine trading sessions.Watch to see if Nvidia has the strength to form a new cup-type base, which must be a minimum six weeks in length.The Nasdaq composite, falling as much as 1.4% early, was off nearly 1% as of 3 p.m. New York time. The Nasdaq 100 slipped 0.9%.The Dow Jones industrials and the S&P 500 dropped 0.8%; both key indexes also were rebounding from midmorning lows, while the Russell 2000 suffered the worst slide, down around 1.2%. The small-cap gauge, as well as the S&P SmallCap 600, are now both down for the year after leading the major indexes with stout rallies in 2016.Returning to Apple, the iPhone maker is set to report December quarter-ending fiscal Q1 results after the close on Tuesday. One big question: Will the Silicon Valley titan finally snap its three-quarter string of shrinking earnings per share?Overall, though, the action in Apple has been steady since the stock climbed out of its long bottoming base pattern with a Sept. 14 breakout past 110.33. Back then, it formed a nice cup with handle that lasted roughly five months. The decline from head to toe in that cup was a little more than 20%. But in the latest cup-with-handle pattern, which began with a stalling day-like session on Oct. 11, Apple corrected merely 12% from high to low within the base.What does that mean? It may indicate that institutions have become more comfortable with holding their shares or even adding to positions.Both today and in the next few days, keep a close eye on those stocks that bounce hard off this week's intraday lows, as well as those highly rated companies that actually make the positive side of IBD's long-running ""Stocks On The Move"" table, part of IBD's proprietary list of screens to help you find the greatest stock market winners.Often, the biggest growth plays will show up repeatedly on Stocks On The Move as they bottom out after a sharp correction, shape the right side of symmetrical-looking base patterns, and break out amid a confirmed uptrend.No doubt, a few stock in energy, telecom and manufacturing sectors are performing poorly after attempting breakouts. They included international oil and gas explorer Hess (HES) (rising just 3% past a 63.86 pivot point); July 2016 IPO Impinj (PI) (breakout past 37.80 flawed cup with handle lasts just five days, now in new basing formation); and Verizon (VZ) (fails to complete a new base after the June 2016 breakout past 54.59 sees limited daylight).The point: Not all breakouts succeed. So one must always have the psychological strength to cut losses short, at a maximum of 7% to 8% but preferably less, at 4% to 5% from the purchase price.Meanwhile, fear is up sharply in the stock market today, at least among options traders; keep an eye on CBOE Market Volatility Index, or the VIX, which tracks the volatility premiums on S&P 100 index options.

Brent crude climbed 1.7% to $56.01.Top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia has reduced deliveries to Asia, as it implements its promised output cuts. Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam Al-Marzouq said at a conference Thursday that Kuwait has already cut output by more than what it pledged to cut, according to CNBC. His Iraqi counterpart said that country reduced its exports by 170,000 barrels per day and cut them by another 40,000 barrels this week.Meanwhile, China said net crude imports will rise 5% this year as total demand hit a record high amid a jump in car sales.IBD'S TAKE: The pact between OPEC and non-OPEC countries seems to be holding, but a reinvigorated OPEC may not be enough to overcome U.S. shale's long-term disruption.As prices recover from a two-year slump, Hess Corp. (HES) said Thursday it will spend $2.25 billion on exploration and production in 2017, up from $1.9 billion in 2016, and will add four rigs in the Bakken shale formation this year.But the company also said it booked $4.6 billion in charges in Q4 to account for tax valuation adjustments and deferred development of natural gas fields, sending shares down 4.8% on the stock market today.On Tuesday, Parsley Energy (PE) said it plans to spend $750 million-$900 million this year, with 60% headed for the Midland Basin in the Permian formation, vs. its estimated 2016 capital budget of $460 million-$510 million.Parsley also said it expects net production to surge 60% this year to 57,000-63,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and announced a deal to buy 23,000 net leasehold acres in the Permian for $607 million.As oil prices topped $50, other shale companies like Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), Diamondback Energy (FANG) and RSP Permian (RSPP) have ramped up spending and output forecasts for this year.On Monday, Barclays predicted North American oil companies will boost exploration and production spending by 27% in 2017, with large-cap companies increasing upstream outlays by 58%, with small- and midcap companies spending 43% more.But the net effect of the added spending on drilling activity and output will be more muted as costs go up.Parsley shares rose 1.3% Thursday, Pioneer dipped 0.2%, Diamondback lost 0.3% and RSP Permian was down 2 cents at 43.38.RELATED: Oil Prices Near $50 Floor As Iraqi Exports Raise OPEC Deal Doubts

He said that ""new bidding procedures"" are needed, suggesting support for legislation traditionally favored by Democrats, not Republicans. Drug and biotech stocks sold off hard on the comments. Trump also returned to attacking the costly Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jet, saying he'll save billions of dollars as he pushes more competition. Lockheed, which has said that it is reducing per-jet costs after years of overruns and delays, said that it's promised to ""aggressively"" reduce F-35 expenses.

42,HES,"Alaska's oil reserves may have just gotten 80% bigger after Dallas-based Caelus Energy announced the discovery of 6 billion barrels under Arctic waters.The light-oil reserves were found in the company's Smith Bay leases between Prudhoe Bay and Barrow along the Arctic shore, according to a statement from Caelus on Tuesday. As much as 40% of the find, or 2.4 billion barrels, is estimated as recoverable, the company said. That compares with the state's proven reserves of 2.86 billion barrels in 2014, almost 8% of the U.S. total, Energy Department data show.""It's a really exciting discovery for us, and we think it's really exciting for the state of Alaska,"" Caelus CEO Jim Musselman said in a phone interview. ""They need a shot in the arm now.""Alaska's oil output has been gradually declining, to 483,000 barrels a day last year from a peak of more than 2 million barrels a day in 1988, Energy Department data show. The last major field brought on line was Alpine in 2000, which averaged 62,000 barrels a day in September, Alaska Department of Revenue data show.Musselman, the man who engineered the $3.2 billion sale of Triton Energy Ltd. to Hess (HES) in 2001, founded Caelus in 2011 to explore and develop petroleum resources on the North Slope. In 2014, the company formed a partnership with affiliates of Apollo Global Management to invest in oil and gas properties in Alaska.The development will cost between $8 billion and $10 billion over the life of the project, which could be brought into operation by the fall of 2022, Musselman said. Located about 125 miles from any other facilities, the company will need to build pipelines and roads. An oil price of about $65 a barrel and greater certainty on state tax policy and incentives is needed to develop the field, he said.""A lot of the investment decision is going to revolve around what happens within the state from a regulatory standpoint,"" he said.Caelus said its newly discovered field could produce as much as 200,000 barrels a day.The discovery of light oil was made after seismic data were collected and two wells were drilled this year, the company said. Another well will be drilled in early 2018, Casey Sullivan, a company spokesman, said in a phone interview. The discovery would be the biggest in four decades, the company said. Prudhoe Bay, the state's biggest field, was discovered in 1967.The fall in oil prices to a 12-year low of $26 a barrel in February from almost $108 a barrel in 2014 prompted companies including Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and ConocoPhillips (COP) to withdraw from expensive and risky Arctic operations. Shell ended a nearly $8 billion quest to drill for crude in the Chukchi Sea after disappointing test well results. ConocoPhillips formally relinquished its 61 Chukchi Sea leases in April.The pretax cost to produce crude on the North Slope and transport it to market is about $40 a barrel on average, Sarah Erkmann, external affairs manager at the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, said in a phone interview. Oil futures closed at a three-month high of $49.83 a barrel on Wednesday in New York. They're still at less than half their peak level in 2014.Alaska North Slope oil production averaged about 475,000 barrels a day last month, down from roughly 494,000 a year earlier, according to Alaska Department of Revenue data.

43,HES,"Divining the future. That's what the Morningstar Investment Conference is all about.Financial advisors attending the conference aim to do that by listening to the sage comments from panelists and assorted experts. Speakers will offer their insights into what all hope are winning strategies for building wealth, generating income and preserving principal.Eventual success? It all hinges on speakers' abilities to figure out in advance what the markets will do in the weeks, months and years from now. There are no guarantees, of course. But the speakers bring impressive track records to the task. And the longevity of the conference attests to advisors' satisfaction with past performance by speakers and the prospects for future results.For advisors, one challenge is simply where to go. Decisions, decisions. So many panel sessions, and so little time.That conundrum is a little trickier this year for the roughly 1,700 people, including 1,000 financial advisors, who are attending the Morningstar Investment Conference, which runs June 13-15 in Chicago.Unlike past conferences -- this is the 28th annual edition of the gathering -- this year's edition does not feature encore sessions of panel discussions. This year, if two panels that you wish to watch occur at the same time, you must choose one over the other. There are no repeat sessions of panels.Still, summaries of panels and general sessions, follow-up news reports and in many cases videos are available online.There's also IBD's introductory news report about the conference, which focuses on Monday's conference events.Tuesday is slated to kick off with a discussion of portfolio construction and risk management, among other topics, by Rob Arnott of Research Affiliates and Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management.Following that, a panel will explore fund managers' strategies for buying stocks at bargain prices in the late 2015-early 2016 downturn.Another will discuss how women should prepare for retirement success.A third will examine the role that high-yield bonds should play in a diversified portfolio. Commodities have wreaked havoc in the category for two years. Still, investors can find investment opportunities, panelist Mark Vaselkiv, manager of $9.7 billion T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund (PRHYX), told IBD before the conference convened.Vaselkiv bought debt from Hess (HES) when it was Amerada Hess. ""The company has an $18 billion market cap and $4 billion cash on its balance sheet, and was downgraded to high yield by Moody's earlier this year,"" he said. ""Compared to legacy high-yield energy companies, this business is real with a quality, sustainable balance sheet. We bought the bonds below par and sold roughly 15 points higher.""He said he also likes floating rate bank loans for their current income and interest-rate protection, ""although it looks like Fed hikes have moved farther out."" He also said, ""The European high-yield market likewise continues to grow and offer compelling value with a lot of first-time issuers, so credit analysis is essential.""Yet another panel will discuss bond investment strategies in general. A fifth panel will look into so-called sustainable investing -- investing based on environmental, social and governance criteria.A sixth panel will take on how the fiduciary rule recently created by the Department of Labor is likely to impact the advisory industry.The Tuesday luncheon keynote presentation will be by Austan Goolsbee, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors.Wednesday morning, Vanguard Group CEO William McNabb will deliver the closing keynote address.Before the conference folds its tent for another year, on Wednesday a panel of marquee managers will talk about their strategies and favorite investment ideas. The session will feature Yacktman Funds' Stephen Yacktman, Brown Brothers Harriman's Michael Keller and Morgan Stanley's Dennis Lynch.Other panels will include one discussing strategic beta, often called smart beta. These hybrid funds mix passive and active strategies. Panelist Joel Dickson of Vanguard told IBD beforehand, ""The biggest threat of smart beta is to traditional, high-cost active management because the rules-based nature of the (smart beta) approach provides an ability to take active risk (against) the market at a lower cost than most traditional mutual funds provide.""In another Wednesday session, panelists will discuss whether the popular 4% for sustainable withdrawals from retirement nest eggs should be replaced by a 3% annual withdrawal target rate because of low interest rates and yields.Panelist Jonathan Guyton gave IBD a preview of points he hoped to make by noting that he thinks a yearly withdrawal rate of 5.5% has a 95% chance of being sustainable for at least 40 years for retirees whose nest egg is 65% globally diversified stocks or stock funds.That's largely because bonds hold their value and can fund withdrawals in years when stocks decline, whereas average annual stock returns make up for lower bond returns. The strategy applies to retirees who can decrease their annual withdrawal by 3% to 5% after years when markets fall a lot.

44,HES,"Like old-time prospectors panning for gold, financial advisors are descending on the 28th annual Morningstar Investment Conference -- which runs June 13-15 in Chicago -- hoping to strike it rich.The aim they all share is to find winning strategies for building wealth, generating income and preserving principal. Like merchants who provided prospectors with their pick-axes, maps and lanterns, conference organizers and speakers want to provide advisors with the tools they need to succeed.The annual pow-wow's opening general session theme says it all: practical advice for an evolving world. In various forms, panel moderators and speakers during the three-day conclave hope to offer advice that advisors can take home and put into practice for their clients.Sessions will examine market and industry trends, including pressures on advisors to automate services and cut costs. They will also look at advisors' investment ideas in stocks, bonds and alternative assets, domestic opportunities and foreign ones.Morningstar expects this year's conference to draw slightly fewer people than last year's gathering: about 1,700 attendees, including 1,000 financial advisors this year.The Gordian knot that confounds so many investors these days is how to make money in a low-interest rate world characterized by uncertain markets. Basically, all of the conference speakers will offer suggestions for untying that knot.At least one speaker appears poised to talk about ways to pick apart the strands in that mystery. Michael Hasenstab, executive vice president and chief investment officer for Franklin Templeton Investments' Templeton Global Macro analytical arm, is slated to deliver the gathering's opening keynote address.Before the conference, Hasenstab told IBD he intends to talk about monetary policy divergences in the U.S. and abroad, the ""puzzling"" low rate of inflation, China's ""two-speed economy,"" the ""disaggregation of emerging markets"" and how investors should position themselves for rising interest rates.Also Monday, as attendees arrive for the start of formal panels and other sessions, preliminary presentations will tackle a wide range of topics.In one, Morningstar analysts will brainstorm about investment ideas suitable for unconstrained bond funds, dividend-seeking funds and multi-asset strategies using, for example, stocks, bonds and additional securities.Another session will tackle how advisors can meet client demand for new technologies. Panelist Mark Balasa, co-CEO of suburban Chicago wealth management firm Balasa Dinverno Foltz, told IBD his shop has upgraded its client portal in the past 12 months and introduced live planning.""We want to do more interactive planning with clients,"" Balasa said. Using MoneyGuidePro software, he can post material to the portal for clients or use it during a planning session. His firm also now uses Microsoft Surface Hub, a 55-inch high-clarity computer screen on wheels. ""It's like a computer-based white board,"" Balasa said. ""We can put projections on it. We can wipe it clean and show something else. We can print from it, grab an image and enlarge it. We've also got a high-def camera for Skyping sessions.""The firm has also embraced the Laserfiche document management system.In the ""Practical Advice for an Evolving World"" forum, panelists will discuss such topics as the rise of passive investing and changes in the way advice is prepared and delivered. Panel member and financial theorist William Bernstein told IBD, ""Probably the most useful advice is to ignore the asset classes and strategies (that have) the greatest amount of surrounding buzz.""The 130/30 strategy -- which involves shorting up to 30% of the portfolio value and taking a long position in stocks the investor expects will outperform the market -- was a fad strategy worth ignoring a decade ago, Bernstein says. Today he urges investors to ignore nonpublicly traded REITs, the ""risk parity"" strategy, using high-dividend stocks as bond equivalents, managed futures and ""liquid alts"" assets.Monday's chapter of the conference aims to give attendees relief from the weighty issues of the day by offering them a presentation by comedian Darrell Hammond.On Tuesday, Austan Goolsbee is scheduled to deliver the luncheon keynote speech. Goolsbee is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and a member of the President Obama's cabinet.Wednesday morning, Vanguard Group CEO William McNabb will deliver the closing keynote address.For more information about the Tuesday and Wednesday sessions, see IBD's companion report.

45,HES,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- As U.S. oil prices near $45 per barrel, some producers could start bringing wells online, with more than 1 million barrels a day in Texas alone ready to be tapped.Shale companies have held off on completing thousands of wells, choosing to save money and wait for oil prices to rebound. Drilling accounts for 40% of a new well's cost, while completion accounts for 60%, according to Suzanne Minter, manager of oil and gas consulting at Platts Analytics, in prepared remarks to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Tuesday.Producers also have been improving efficiency and slashing costs, which means that they can pump oil profitably at lower prices. The breakeven price is now about $45-$55 per barrel, depending on the play, Minter said, adding that she wouldn't be surprised if some producers start to pump at $40 a barrel.On Tuesday, U.S. crude futures rose 3.3% to settle at $44.04 a barrel, and Brent climbed 2.8% to $45.74.If producers in Texas alone decided to complete all their 2,500 drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells at once, they could add 1.25 million barrels of oil per day to the world market, Minter estimated.Production from Texas DUCs could come back on fairly quickly, as completion times average 30 days. But Minter cautioned that the response could take longer if producers don't have enough cash or labor on hand.Some shale producers with major operations in Texas are already seeing some growth.On Monday, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), which is active in the Permian Basin in West Texas, boosted its 2016 production growth outlook to 12% from an earlier outlook of 10%, helped in part by increased output from the Spraberry/Wolfcamp zones.Last week, Sanchez Energy (SN), which operates in south Texas, reported a 25% rise in first-quarter production to 56,500 barrels of oil per day, above its 48,000-52,000-barrel guidance, on better-than-expected results in the Eagle Ford’s western Catarina region. The producer brought 11 new wells online in the area.Energy research firm Wood Mackenzie reportedly has said that Pioneer plans to complete some of its wells this year, along with Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), Oasis Petroleum (OAS) and Hess (HES).Pioneer shares jumped 7.6% in the stock market today. Sanchez shares were up 1.3%. Cabot added 2.3%, Oasis rose 3.5%, and Hess gained 2.2%.With more production potentially coming back back online, more dramatic price swings could be ahead, warned Minter.Jason Bordoff, founding director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, also noted that bringing wells online may not happen that quickly.""It will take a little longer than what people think -- nine months, 12 months -- because you have to get the capital markets back open again, workers to come back and rigs to come back,"" he told the Senate committee.Meanwhile, Iran is also working on bringing more crude back to the market as it looks to boost production to presanction levels.So far this month, exports rose to 1.75 million barrels per day, up from 1.6 million barrels a day in March, according to Reuters, citing an industry source.But an Iranian official said that production is around 3.5 million and that exports will hit 2 million in May.

The statement indicates that it's passed Amazon in volume shipments, although its revenue of about $14.9 billion a year is dwarfed by Amazon's $107 billion. Alibaba rose a few cents late after closing 2.2% lower at 77.32.Cree shares plunged 18% late after closing down 0.6% at 29.05 after the LED lighting and power chipmaker pre-announced fiscal third quarter earnings that fell far short of Wall Street estimates. Cree now expects fiscal Q3 sales of $367 million and earnings per share of 13-15 cents. Wall Street expected $414.4 million in revenue and 24 cents EPS.Also late Tuesday, crude prices rose late after the American Petroleum Institute said U.S. inventories of crude oil fell by 4.3 million barrels last week, the biggest drop of the year. The trade group had expected inventory to rise by 2.6 million barrels for the week ending March 25. The Energy Information Administration will issue its weekly report Wednesday morning.

It also plans to cut 2016 oil output by 10% to 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.The company plans to spend most of its 2016 budget in the Bakken shale with Oklahoma's SCOOP formation receiving the second-largest budget.  Continental Resources said it would not be profitable until oil returns to $37.Continental shares fell 2.5% to 18.37.Late Tuesday, Noble Energy (NBL) issued its 2016 capital spending budget at $1.5 billion, 50% less than spending in 2015, pro forma for the acquisition of Rosetta Resources. Noble also cut its Q4 cash dividend by 44% to  10 cents per common share.Noble shares dipped 0.1% to 28.74.But others in the energy sector are focused on keeping their dividends to keep investors happy. Oil majors ConocoPhillips (COP), Chevron (CVX) and others have said they would keep their dividends despite crashing oil prices.Oil prices fell Wednesday as U.S. crude inventories rose by 8.38 million barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration, more than double what analysts had expected.

81,HES,"Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) has inked an agreement with Ascent Resources – Utica, LLC to divest joint venture interests in the Utica shale play in eastern Ohio.Effective Apr 1, the transaction is expected to raise net cash consideration of about $400 million. The sale comprises net acres of about 39,000, of which 26,000 acres is net undeveloped. In 2018, the assets are estimated to produce an average of 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which about 70% is expected to be residue gas. In the joint venture, Hess has a working interest of 50%. The other partner is CNX Resources (CNX  -  Free Report). The transaction is expected to close by the end of third-quarter 2018.Update on Denmark SaleHess, as the operator of the South Arne Field in Denmark, decided to retain its interest of 61.5% in the field as the offers received for the earlier announced sale did not meet expectations.

The company is planning to allocate the proceeds from the sale toward offshore Guyana project. Till date, Hess has made seven world-class oil discoveries at the Stabroek Block, located off the coast of Guyana. Hess raised gross recoverable resources projection to 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) from 2.25-2.75 billion boe.

82,HES,"Kosmos Energy Ltd. (KOS  -  Free Report) recently announced that the company has finished drilling and abandoning the Anapai-1A exploration well, which is located off the coast of Suriname in block 45. The company failed to find any oil at the site although there were high-quality lower Cretaceous reservoirs.The well was drilled to 4,556 meters (14,947 feet) of depth for examining the reservoirs. In May, Kosmos declared that it has reconfigured the design of the well and spent $20 million until then for drilling purposes.Notably, the company kept its drilling program unchanged and unaffected by the Anapai-1A exploration well findings. Kosmos will continue with the exploration work in the basin. The company owns 50% operating interest in the block, with Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) partnering the project, holding the rest of the stake.Per Kosmos’ plans, it will move forward with the test of new prospects in the third quarter. The company will test Pontoenoe next, which is the first prospect of the three planned ones in Block 42, also located offshore Suriname. Kosmos is also the operator in Block 42, with Chevron and Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report) as partners.

83,HES,"It was a week where oil prices were buoyed by OPEC’s plans for a smaller-than-expected output raise. Meanwhile, natural gas futures again fell below the critical $3 threshold.On the news front, Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A  -  Free Report) said it has committed to the Fram gas field in the North Sea, while Canada’s Baytex Energy Corp. (BTE  -  Free Report) agreed to snap up rival Raging River Exploration Inc. for $2.3 billion. Meanwhile, Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) lost a wage dispute potentially costing the company 4.5 billion in U.S. dollars.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 5.8% to close at $68.58 per barrel, natural gas prices fell some 2.6% to $2.945 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: ExxonMobil, Chevron, Transocean & More)The U.S. oil benchmark rallied after OPEC agreed to stabilize the market by making modest increase in crude output. At the Vienna meeting, top producers came together and decided to raise volumes by about 1 million barrels per day from July to make up for falling production in Venezuela.Friday’s consensus figure was well below some of the numbers that had been floated ahead of the meeting, while the actual addition is expected to be even lesser – at around 700,000 barrels a day – due to several member countries’ inability to boost exports.Earlier in the week, oil futures were buoyed by the federal government’s EIA report that showed a large draw in crude stockpiles due to strong refinery runs. Data showing a reduction in U.S. oil drilling rig count brought further upside.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved southward last week as a larger-than-expected increase in supplies overshadowed the commodity’s growing use for air-conditioning.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Royal Dutch Shell plc recently announced its intention to forge ahead with development of the Fram natural gas field in the North Sea. Banking on improving economics and recovering energy landscape, this is notably the second North Sea project approved by the European energy giant in the past six months.Shell, along with Exxon Mobil, which is its co-partner in the Fram project, intends to produce around 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (comprising about 41 million cubic feet of gas along with 5,300 barrels of liquids a day) from the two wells in the Fram field by 2020. This will increase the The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s output in the North Sea by 10%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Fram field, located 137 miles east of Aberdeen, will be connected using a subsea infrastructure to a processing facility, Shearwater, from which gas will be transported to the shore. Basically, the two wells will transport gas via a subsea pipeline to the Starling field, from which it will be further transported to the Shearwater platform through existing pipelines.Utilizing the existing infrastructure from the nearby hubs will result in huge cost savings associated with the development of new fields. Reduction in development costs has in fact prompted Shell to reinvest in projects in the U.K. once again.

Notably, it marks the biggest buyout in the Canadian oil patch this year.However, the deal failed to garner positive response from its shareholders, as evidenced by the dismal stock movement post the announcement of the merger. Shares of Baytex have dropped 11.92% to close at $3.40 on Jun 18, reflecting investors’ rough initial response toward the pricey deal. Investors are mainly concerned about the company’s intent to finance the deal by the issuance of new stocks that in turn are likely to hurt its earnings per share metrics.Baytex’s operations are mainly focused on Eagle Ford, Peace River and Lloydminster regions while Raging River’s activities are mainly concentrated in East Duvernay (where it holds 260,000 acres of land), and Viking areas. Thus, the buyout expands the geographical footprint of Baytex, creating an enviable diverse portfolio of oil assets in five core areas namely Viking, Peace River, Lloydminster and East Duvernay Shale regions in Canada, and the Eagle Ford play in Texas. (Read more Baytex to Buy Raging River: A Closer Look)3.    Petrobras recently lost a wage lawsuit when Brazil’s Labor Court voted in favor of the workers of Petrobras seeking higher wages. This is notably the biggest lawsuit that the company has faced in the Brazil’s Labor Court, which is expected to cost the company around 17 billion reals or 4.5 billion in U.S. dollars.The case is mainly centered on the Minimum Remuneration Level Regime (RMNR) policy, adopted by Petrobras in 2007. The employees argue that the payments related to special working conditions such as night shifts and hazardous working environment should not be included in the base wage calculation, which will thus lead Petrobras to make additional payment to comply with RMNR. In contrast, the company is of the opinion that such payments should be included in the base wage calculations itself.The ruling in favor of the workers is likely to result in wage increase of around 35% for 59,000 employees. Petrobras intends to appeal the decision in the Supreme Federal Court. (Read more Petrobras Loses Wage Lawsuit, to Pay $4.5 Billion)4.    Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) recently won a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, which enabled the company to recover the profits lost due to unaccredited use of its patented technology outside the country by ION Geophysical Corporation. The ruling countermanded a previous decision from a lower court that constrained the usage of U.S. patent law abroad.The previous ruling from the lower court reduced the damage compensation by $93.4 million. The said Schlumberger technology is used for finding oil and gas under the ocean floor. The significance of the latest ruling is that it enhances the ability of the patent holders to stop rivals and other companies from using their technologies abroad. It also helps them recover profits that were lost due to unauthorized usage of its technologies.WesternGeco, a subsidiary of Schlumberger, was the one fighting the case against ION Geophysical regarding the use of four patented methods, used while conducting marine seismic survey. Notably, Schlumberger received compensation for damages caused due to the occurrence of infringement in the United States. Now the compensation basket includes the lost profits from overseas as well.

(HES  -  Free Report) reiterated the exploration potential of the Stabroek Block, following the announcement of the eighth oil discovery at the Longtail-1 well, offshore Guyana. Stabroek Block is spread across acreage of 6.6 million (26,800 square kilometers).Located about five miles west of the Turbot-1 well, the Longtail-1encountered about 256 feet (78 meters) of superior, oil-bearing sandstone reservoir. The drilling of the well commenced on May 25, 2018, using the Stena Carron drillship to reach a total depth of 18,057 feet (5,504 meters) in 6,365 feet (1,940 meters) of water.The previous outstanding discoveries on the Stabroek Block include Liza, Payara, Liza Deep, Snoek, Turbot, Ranger and Pacora. Currently, drilling results of Longtail are under appraisal. The combined gross recoverable resources of Turbot and Longtail are projected to surpass 500 million barrels of oil equivalent.

84,HES,"U.S. stock markets witnessed mixed trends on Friday. The Dow 30 and S&P 500 reversed their losing streak primarily attributed to an energy sector rally following the meeting between OPEC and Russia led consortium that took place in Vienna on Jun 22. However, the Nasdaq Composite ended in negative territory due to losses in the technology sector. Moreover, investors are yet to recover from trade related tensions.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,580.89, up 0.5% or 119.19 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) also increased 0.2% to close at 2,754.88. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,692.82, losing 0.3%. A total of 9.7 billion shares were traded on Friday, higher than the last 20-session average of 7.17 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2.05-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, advancers had an edge over decliners by 1.16- to-1 ratio.  The CBOE VIX decreased 5.9% to close at 13.77.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow gained 0.5% reversing eight-session long losing streak. This was the blue-chip index’s longest stretch of losses since March 2017 and was just one day short of its all-time longest losing streak since 1978.  Notably, 24 of the 30-stocks index closed in the green while 6 traded in the red.The S&P 500 rose 0.2% led by 2% gain of the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) and 1.4% increase of Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB). Notably, eight out of 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in positive territory.The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite decreased 0.3% reflecting the index’s second straight losing session. The index ended in the red mainly due lower-than-expected earnings results of some leading tech companies.OPEC Meeting Leads Energy Sector RallyOn Jun 22, a congregation of OPEC (Oil and Petroleum Exporting Countries) countries and non-OPEC allies led by Russia assembled in Vienna to take a decision regarding an 18-month old agreement to curb output in order to meet strong global demand for crude oil. The production barrier was imposed to support global oil prices.Saudi Arabia and Russia were in favor of elimination of output restrictions even if that means lower oil prices. These two countries want to increase oil supply by 1.5 million-barrels-a-day. However, Iran, Iraq, Venezuela, Libya and some other OPEC members were in favor of maintaining status quo. Finally, OPEC decided to raise production quota by 624,000 barrels a day, much lower than 1.5 million barrels a day demanded by Saudi Arabia and Russia.Higher oil prices will be major boon for the U.S. oil exploration industry. The U.S. shale production of crude oil is currently going on in full swing. After the OPEC decision, U.S. crude prices surged 4.6% at $68.58 a barrel and Brent crude price soared 3.4% at $75.55.Higher oil price and higher volume sales will significantly increase revenues of U.S. oil majors. Consequently, stock prices of both Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) increased around 2.1%. While Exxon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Chevron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Trade War Fears RemainThe ongoing trade conflict between the United States and China took a worse turn as President Trump requested the United States Trade Representative identify $200 billion worth of Chinese goods for additional tariffs at a rate of 10%. This was in addition of 20% tariffs imposed on $50 worth of Chinese goods earlier. Further, Trump threatened China that another phase of tariff on additional $200 billion of Chinese goods will be imposed if China retaliates on U.S. tariffs.Moreover, President Trump indicated that United States may impose 20% tariffs on auto imports from the European Union (EU). Notably, since Jun 1, the United States has imposed 20% tariffs on steel and 10% tariffs on aluminum imported from the EU. Most of the EU members are closed allies of the United States. The EU has retaliated with tariffs on $3.2 billion U.S. imports.Weekly Roundup Last week was a disappointing one for Wall Street. All three major indexes posted weekly losses. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite shed 2%, 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively. The Dow 30 witnessed its largest weekly decline since Mar 23 as well as its second straight weekly fall. However, Nasdaq posted its first weekly loss ending its winning streak of four straight weeks. Notably, on Jun 20, the Nasdaq Composite hits a new all-time high.The Dow and the S&P 500 declined modestly while Nasdaq Composite gained modestly on Monday, as trade war fears once again escalated making investors jittery.

85,HES,"The trade tensions between the United States and China have hit a fever pitch. Both will now enact a 25% tariff on each other’s $34 billion worth of goods from Jul 6. The remaining $16 billion worth of goods will be under public review. But the situation may take an uglier turn as White House plans to enact tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, if China keeps retaliating.Per an article published on CNBC, the following sectors have the highest revenue exposure to China and are thus more susceptible to the trade war.Source: Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley Research EstimatesOn the basis of the above-mentioned chart, we dig a little deeper into these sectors amid tariff tensions.Semiconductor Per Morgan Stanley equity strategists, “semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies have the highest revenue exposure to China at 52%” and are thus exposed to maximum risks on rising trade tensions (read: Apple's iPhone Order Cut Report May Hurt These ETFs).Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) has 65% revenue exposure to China and Nvidia’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) sales exposure to China is 56%, per Goldman Sachs. Apart from these, some other tech and semiconductor companies, which have sales exposure to China in the range of 22% to 55%, include the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials AMAT. This clearly explains why the mood is somber in the semiconductor space. So, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report) may face troubles.Energy It is a two-edged sword for energy companies. First, Donald Trump’s levy of a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports from China, Canada and Mexico became a pain for U.S. oil pipeline companies. This should push up raw material prices for pipeline operators.The article published on Reuters indicated that the U.S. pipeline industry is likely to suffer cost pressure from tariffs as the industry imports about 77% of its steel requirement, according to a 2017 study on the pipeline industry (read: Is $100-a-Barrel Oil Possible? ETFs in Focus).Major U.S. energy companies including Plains All American Pipeline (PAA, Hess Corp (HES  -  Free Report) and Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI  -  Free Report) are thus on the lookout for an exemption from steel-import tariffs, per Reuters. On the other hand, China proposed “25% levies on about $1 billion a month in U.S. oil imports in retaliation for U.S. tariffs.” Energy companies have about 14% exposure to China. So, Chinese energy tariff dealt another blow to the sector.ETFs that could come under pressure are Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE  -  Free Report) and Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP  -  Free Report).Tech Hardware & Equipment Tech companies that have extensive trade relations with China would be at high risk of falling prey to the trade war. In fact, Goldman Sachs has compiled a list of companies with considerable revenue exposure to China. These companies’ revenues are 14% exposed to China, per a CNBC article. SPDR S&P Technology Hardware ETF (XTH  -  Free Report) should thus be followed carefully.AutoBoth steel and aluminum are vital to the production of cars and trucks sold in America and would push up the sale prices of those vehicles considerably. Adding fuel to the ongoing trade tensions, the Trump administration has initiated a national security investigation into auto imports that may result in fresh tariffs (read: U.S. Auto Tariff Risk Put These ETFs and Stocks in Focus).U.S. auto companies earn about 12% revenues from China. With Beijing slamming tariffs on U.S. auto imports, First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund (CARZ  -  Free Report) would come under pressure.Consumer ServicesAs tariff tensions heat up, inflation in the U.S. economy should perk up. Along with most market watchers, we too believe that companies will try to pass on some cost escalation to consumers. Moreover, higher inflation would give a boost to bond yields. This, in turn, might push up consumers’ borrowing costs and hurt iShares U.S. Consumer Services ETF (IYC  -  Free Report). In any case, U.S. consumer services have about 10% sales exposure to China. That is yet another risk to consumer funds.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

86,HES,"The sentiments of investors have changed drastically regarding businesses in the U.S. shale spaces. Oil producers are not in a position to give more focus on drilling in the domestic shale resources as investors are demanding further returns from the explorers, stated John Hess — CEO of Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report).Hess added that since 2017, investor’s current priority has changed to ‘show me the money’, from ‘drill, baby, drill’. Lower focus on production will eventually draw less money toward investment. This will be a serious concern as low long-term capital spending will further reduce production in the coming years.Per our proprietary model, through 2017, the companies belonging to the Zacks U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration industry collectively generated $1.2 billion of net operating cashflows, from which $0.9 billion was allocated toward capital spending. The remaining amount of $239 million was free cashflow, from which only $65 million was paid as dividends to the investors. Hence, investors received 6% of the entire operating cashflows.  It seems that investors are not happy with the percentage of return — considering only dividend payments and excluding share buybacks. In other words, they are asking shale explorers not to spend so much capital for operations.Along with long-term production threat, the U.S. shale players are exposed to limited short-term domestic production possibilities — especially in the Permian Basin — following pipeline bottleneck problems. Producers that are exposed to Permian pipeline bottleneck are Energen Corporation (EGN  -  Free Report), Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) and Noble Energy Inc (NBL  -  Free Report).The Permian region has always been in the spotlight when it comes to oil and natural gas production in the United States. In terms of production, Permian has recorded higher reserve than Anadarko, Appalachia, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Niobrara. From nearly 1 million barrels a day of crude at the beginning of 2009, Permian’s daily production is now heading toward 3.5 million barrels, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).  However, Permian is now facing limited pipeline capacity for transporting oil to Gulf Coast export facilities, major refinery terminals and principal hubs like Cushing. This is because drillers have been pumping out more oil as crude prices are favorable, which exceeds the capacity of the Permian.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

88,HES,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a large weekly draw on the back of strong refinery runs. As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1.8% (or $1.15) to $66.22 per barrel yesterday.The federal data sparked widespread buying in energy stocks. In fact, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report), Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report) and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, the commodity continues to remain under pressure from reports that top suppliers Saudi Arabia and Russia are likely to step up output amid reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela. As of now, all eyes are on the oil producers’ meeting set for Jun 22 in Vienna, which will decide what happens next regarding their supply curb policy.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 5.9 million barrels for the week ending Jun 15, following a decrease of 4.1 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 3.7 million barrels.Record refinery throughput led to the larger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production remains at 10.9 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 43 of the last 63 weeks and are down more than 80 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 426.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 16% below the year-ago figure and 2% under the five-year average.Moreover, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – fell 1.3 million barrels to 32.6 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 25.2 days in the previous week to 24.5 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.5 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies were up for the fourth time in five weeks as demand weakened. The 3.3 million barrels gain – defying the polled number of one million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 240 million barrels. Following last week’s addition, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product inched closer to the year-earlier level and is 6% over the five-year range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went up 2.7 million barrels last week, again contrary to analysts’ expectations for 700,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to lower demand. At 117.4 million barrels, current supplies are 23% below the year-ago level and 14% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1% from the prior week to 96.7% - the highest in 2018.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) may be an excellent selection.

89,HES,"Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) reiterated the exploration potential of the Stabroek Block, following the announcement of the eighth oil discovery at the Longtail-1 well, offshore Guyana.Located about five miles west of the Turbot-1 well, the Longtail-1encountered about 256 feet (78 meters) of superior, oil-bearing sandstone reservoir. The drilling of the well commenced on May 25, 2018, using the Stena Carron drillship to reach a total depth of 18,057 feet (5,504 meters) in 6,365 feet (1,940 meters) of water.The previous outstanding discoveries on the Stabroek Block include Liza, Payara, Liza Deep, Snoek, Turbot, Ranger and Pacora. Currently, drilling results of Longtail are under appraisal. The combined gross recoverable resources of Turbot and Longtail are projected to surpass 500 million barrels of oil equivalent.On completion of the Longtail-1 well, the Stena Carron drillship will move to operate in the Hammerhead-1 well located about 9 miles southwest of the Liza discovery. To accelerate exploration of high value prospects, the operator intends to add a third drillship that will commence drilling parallel to the Stena Carron. The discovery of oil at the Longtail-1 exploration well raises the potential for additional resource development in the southeast area of the Stabroek Block.Stabroek Block is spread across acreage of 6.6 million (26,800 square kilometers). ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) affiliate, Esso Exploration, and Production Guyana Limited, the operator, holds 45% interest in the Stabroek Block.

90,HES,"Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) has accelerated the development of the Liza Phase 1 after commencing development drilling offshore Guyana.Development drilling for the first of 17 wells planned for Phase 1 was initiated in May. This facilitated the start of production scheduled for 2020.The Liza prospect, operated by Exxon Mobil, is located about 120 miles (193 kilometers) offshore Guyana in the Stabroek block and spreads across 6.6 million acres (26,800 square kilometers). Exxon Mobil and its co-venturers have encountered estimated recoverable resources of more than 3.2 billion oil equivalent barrels on the Stabroek block.The Liza Phase 1 is estimated to generate more than $7 billion in royalty and profit oil revenues, which will prove beneficial for Guyana. The country will also gain from other development projects currently being planned. An oil tanker will be converted into a floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel named Liza Destiny as part of Liza Phase 1 development along with four undersea drill centers with 17 production wells. More than a dozen countries are constructing FPSO and subsea equipment.Liza Destiny will have a production capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day. A second FPSO is being planned as part of the Liza Phase 2 development and expected to have a capacity of 220,000 barrels per day. The third one is under consideration for the Payara development. Cumulatively, these three developments will yield more than 500,000 barrels of oil per day.More than 50% of Exxon Mobil’s workforce including employees, contractors and subcontractors are Guyanese. The number of Guyanese employees is expected to increase with more operations in the region. In 2017, Exxon Mobil spent about $24 million with more than 300. Consequently, the company opened the Centre for Local Business Development in Georgetown, Guyana, to support the establishment and aid growth of small- and medium-sized local businesses.

91,HES,"Posting its fourth quarterly gain in a row, oil prices ended June 2018 up more than 14% sequentially. The commodity continued its bullish path during the April-June quarter after it got off to a strong start this year with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures climbing about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018.The first half of the year saw oil benchmark in the United States attain its highest settlement since November 2014 despite record high domestic production. Crude was supported by a variety of catalysts, including a series of buoyant weekly EIA crude inventory numbers, worries about tightening global supplies in the midst of strong demand, and doubts over OPEC’s ability to boost production.What’s encouraging is that the half yearly price appreciation extends an upbeat tone in crude trade into the final six months of 2018 following the futures contracts’ back-to-back yearly increases. To be precise, the commodity rose about 23% in the first six months of 2018 to finish June at $74.15 per barrel.Reasons for Oil's Half-Yearly SurgeSharp Inventory Drawdowns: The U.S. Energy Department's inventory releases have shown multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles, a pointer to a tightening oil market. Oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 44 of the last 64 weeks and are down more than 90 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall – stemming from a combination of lower imports and spiraling exports – has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 416.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 18% below the year-ago figure and 4% under the five-year average.Red-Hot Demand: The major factor fueling higher oil prices is the fast-growing demand for the commodity, which continues to tighten the market. The International Energy Agency (IEA) in its closely watched monthly oil-market report, said that global demand is likely to grow by 1.4 million barrels a day this year as well as in 2019.OPEC Supply Concerns: Oil prices have also been supported by OPEC’s recent plans for a smaller-than-expected output raise. In June, OPEC agreed to stabilize the market by making modest increase in crude output. At the Vienna meeting, top producers came together and decided to raise volumes by about 1 million barrels per day from July to make up for falling production in Venezuela. The consensus figure was well below some of the numbers that had been floated ahead of the meeting, while the actual addition is expected to be even lesser – at around 700,000 barrels a day – due to several member countries’ inability to boost exports.Dwindling Venezuela Output: Fast-falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters. With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse, oil output has dwindled by more than 40% since 2016. Venezuela currently churns out around 1.4 million barrels per day, the least since the 1950s and much lower that its pledge per the OPEC-led supply cuts. Fresh U.S. sanctions on the Maduro regime will further strangle the Latin American nation’s struggling energy sector.Potential Decline in Iranian Exports: Oil prices have also run up on United States’ refusal to issue any waivers on cutting crude imports from Iran by Nov 4 when sanctions are imposed against the Islamic Republic. Last month, President Trump withdrew from a nuclear deal with OPEC’s third-largest producer and pledged to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The action has stoked worries about an expected cut in Iranian oil exports – at 2.7 million barrels a day – by around one million barrels and lead to a supply shortage in an already tight oil market.How to Identify the Outperformers?The strong half-yearly rally does not necessarily indicate that all energy scrips would be wise picks.

92,HES,"Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) stock looks promising at the moment. We are positive about the company’s prospects and believe that it is the right time for you to add the stock to portfolio as it is poised to carry the momentum ahead.Evidently, shares of Marathon Oil have increased 81% in the past year, vis-à-vis the stocks in this industry that have collectively gained about 41%.Let’s take a look into the factors that make this leading upstream player a compelling choice for investors right now.What’s Working in Favor of Marathon Oil?Strategic Portfolio Puts Up a Stellar Show: As most of the drilling activities in the United States are centered in the Permian Basin, the shale play suffers from lack of takeaway capacity and widening differentials. However, with Permian accounting for just about 4% of Marathon Oil’s total production, the company remains largely unaffected by infrastructural bottlenecks and differential issues of the region.Instead, Marathon Oil has accelerated its growth momentum in resource shales like Oklahoma, Eagle Ford and Bakken shale plays. These low-cost high-margin shale plays have less traffic than Permian, therefore leading to narrower differentials and higher pipeline capacity.In the last reported quarter, the company recorded production available for sale of 284,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d), up from 208,000 BOE/d in the first quarter of 2017. With enhanced completion designs and effective spacing strategies, it has been improving the quality of its assets, and is well positioned to improve production and revenues.In fact, Marathon Oil raised its 2018 production growth guidance for these shale plays to 25-30% from the prior projection of 20-25%. The firm’s strong development inventory will enable visible production growth over the coming years.Divestment Spree Streamlines its Portfolio: Over the past few years, the Texas-based energy explorer inked several deals to sell non-core assets that do not fit into the company’s long-term growth plan.In August 2015, the company divested its Wilburton, OK assets worth $102 million. In November 2015, Marathon Oil jettisoned Gulf of Mexico (GoM) assets for a total price of $205 million. In April 2016, the company inked a deal to divest its Wyoming upstream and midstream assets to Merit Energy for $950 million. Further, in October 2016, the upstream player signed a deal to sell some of its non-core assets in West Texas and New Mexico for $235 million. Additionally, in March 2017, the company exited the high-cost Canadian oil-sands operations for $2.5 billion. This year Marathon offloaded its oil acreage in Libya to France-based supermajor TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) for $450 million. Notably, Marathon Oil exited from seven countries since 2013.These strategic sell-offs not only bolstered its portfolio, but also boosted financials. In fact, over the past two years, the company garnered proceeds of around $5 billion from its divestment deals.Healthy Financials Bode Well: Marathon Oil’s balance sheet seems quite strong, with adequate liquidity and manageable leverage of around 31%, which increases financial flexibility and helps it to tap the profitable growth opportunities. Following the divestment of Libyan operations in March 2018, the company had a hefty cash balance of around $1.6 billion. While the company plans to grow its annual production, it has kept its capital expenditure budget for 2018 unchanged with the prior levels and is also gaining from operational efficiencies.Delivering on its commitment, MRO achieved cash flow neutrality last year and is poised for strong free cash flow generation through the end of the decade. Needless to say, with improving FCF generation, we don’t expect management to shy away from resorting to more shareholder-friendly moves including dividend hike and potential buybacks like most peers including Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report), Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Devon Energy Corporation, among others.Other Favorable ReadingsConsidering the above factors, it should not come as a surprise that Marathon Oil sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) along with a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities for investors. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Investors should note that the company displays a decent earnings history, having surpassed estimates in each of the last three quarters. What’s more encouraging is the solid estimate revision that the company is witnessing of late. In the past 60 days, eight estimates have moved north, while none moved south for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has been revised upward by 47.5% for the same period. The company expects long-term earnings per share to grow 15.10%, higher than the industry’s growth rate of 12%.Marathon Oil currently has an average trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio — which is one of the best multiples for valuing oil and gas companies as they have large amounts of debt — of 6.87, which is cheaper compared with the industry average of 9.09.In ConclusionMarathon Oil appears to be a solid bet based on strong fundamentals, impressive portfolio/production profile and robust financials, along with healthy share price performance. Hence, if you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

93,HES,"It's usually the U.S. shale plays that are in news given the stupendous production growth in these regions. However, there is a quiet revolution taking place elsewhere – in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) – where operators are eyeing resurgence, with record high output.The oil crash that began late in 2014 forced upstream companies to reduce their exploration capital expenditure to a bare minimum. The shrinking spending meant that investments in the GoM region started falling as well. Meanwhile, low cost shale plays attracted a huge amount of investment as companies started looking away from expensive offshore production. But it seems that things are looking up.Last year, crude production from the Federal GoM reached a record level of 1.65 million barrels per day (BPD), in spite of the hurricane related outages. Per U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), production is expected to surge in 2018 further, accounting for 16% of the country’s total output.Here are the reasons that are likely to contribute to the surge.Project Ramp-upsProduction in the region is expected to increase to 1.7 million BPD in 2018 and 1.8 million BPD in 2019, with support from existing as well as new fields. Seven new projects became operational in 2016, which boosted output in 2017. These projects contributed around 126,000 BPD of crude on average last year. Moreover, addition of two new projects in 2017 with 10,000 BPD of production contributed to the pile. Surging production from these nine projects (that came online in 2016 and 2017) are expected to get four new projects this year and another six in 2019, which will push the total output in the region to new heights.Some of the major projects, which are slated to come online and might ramp up in the 2018-2019 period include Tomcat of Talos Energy Inc. (TALO  -  Free Report), Stampede-Knotty Head and Stampede-Pony of Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report), Rydberg of Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) and others.Cost EfficiencyAs has been mentioned above, the top energy companies cut spending (particularly on costly drilling projects) due to lower profit margins. At the same time, the tough environment forced operators to make cost control their primary focus. And they did just that by reducing operational costs through simplifying designs and cutting unnecessary costs.In keeping with the lessons learnt in the low oil price environment, Shell declared a final investment decision for the deepwater project Vito in April, which showed breakeven at a price level less than $35 per barrel. In 2015, the Hague-based energy company started redesigning the project, which slashed costs by more than 70% from its original strategy. Moreover, in June, Shell brought Kaikias deepwater development online in the GoM, which has a breakeven price level less than $30 a barrel. The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.British energy giant, BP p.l.c. (BP  -  Free Report) reduced project cost for its Mad Dog Phase 2 project – on which it is partnered by BHP Billiton Limited (BHP  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) – to $9 billion from $20 billion. The partners in the project approved the updated plan toward the end of 2016.Offshore Drilling is Competitive AgainLower operating costs and recovering oil prices have made offshore operations viable again. There is also a fundamental difference between offshore and onshore operations. In terms of development of resources, onshore production reaches peak levels faster than its offshore counterpart. However, once online, offshore developers can produce from the vast resources for decades and that too at a higher rate.Moreover, the pipeline bottlenecks in most of the shale plays have reduced producers’ margins in recent times. Improving the infrastructure will take time and investments, which makes investing in offshore production an attractive option at the moment.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

94,HES,"Energy Transfer Partners L.P.’s (ETP  -  Free Report) mega project, Dakota Access Pipeline, recently marked its one-year anniversary. Disregarding criticism from Native American tribes and environmental groups, the pipeline has been operational for a year now and proved to be a silver bullet for North Dakota’s economic potential.Clears Many ChallengesThe pipeline was supposed to become operational by the end of 2016. However, it received immense censure from a Native American tribe that delayed the commencement of its services. The Obama administration halted pipeline construction amid protests, blocking the building of the final part of the pipeline through North Dakota.The protests drew international attention as the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe objected the project. They were of the opinion that the pipeline would desecrate their sacred burial ground as well as contaminate water supply.However, making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and brushed aside former Obama’s efforts of blocking the pipeline's construction. Efforts to complete the Dakota Access Pipeline were thus reinvigorated, as Trump signed an executive order to smoothly execute the pipeline’s operations. The pipeline finally came online on Jun 1 last year.Dakota Pipeline: Trump Card for North Dakota?Though the opening of the pipeline was mired in controversy, the $3.8 billion Dakota Pipeline has proved to be quite a game changer for the producers in the Bakken shale play.While Bakken in North Dakota has significant accumulations of profitable oil reserves, production in the area fell sharply during the oil slump. However, with rebounding crude prices, Bakken has been regaining strength, with output gradually approaching the peak levels that was achieved in 2014.Apart from improving energy landscape, another factor that has been boosting its production prospects is the 1,172-mile-long Dakota Access pipeline. While North Dakota production volumes lag Texas and Gulf of Mexico levels, the output growth has enhanced domestic energy independence, with the pipeline already carrying around 182.5 million barrels of oil.In March 2018, oil production hit 1,162,071 barrels per day(bpd) as against 1,025,638 bpd a year-earlier, gaining impetus from the pipeline project. North Dakota’s total number of producing wells totaled 14,457, banking on improved energy landscape and midstream network.The pipeline, with a capacity to carry about 520,000 barrels of oil per day, has successfully bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil-producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins.The commencement of the pipeline’s service has bolstered the revival of Bakken output, with large operators like Oasis Petroleum Inc. (OAS  -  Free Report) counting on the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their products to market. Oasis Petroleum currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Products from companies like Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) and Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report) were among the first to reach the international markets (China and Netherlands), with the help of the Dakota Access pipeline.In fact, around 78% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from more than 24% in the early part of 2017 to little in excess of 10%.The geographically constrained Bakken Shale's crude has now better access to the Gulf and East Coast refineries, and also reaches the international markets. As expected, the pipeline, in which energy majors like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) have invested, helped to improve the region’s drilling economics. It helped in lowering transportation costs for operators from $8 a barrel to around $4-$5 per barrel. Reportedly, the number of operational rigs in the region totaled 60 in April, witnessing more than 50% year-over-year increase.The pipeline project also generated huge employment opportunities in its construction, engineering, manufacturing and technology activities, creating around 40,000 jobs.Although the pipeline has been subject to several minor leaks since its inception, it hasn’t recorded any major incident. Minor spills were in fact effectively contained and cleaned up, without leading to severe loss of volumes. Reportedly, in the first six months of its operation, the pipeline transported 61.25 million barrels with a nominal loss of less than 4 barrels of oil during the same period of time.Final ThoughtsWhile a years’ time is certainly not enough to gauge success or failure, the pipeline has definitely been a big booster in many ways. Overall, rebounding oil prices together with the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline are expected to support further increase in Bakken output by providing the companies a chance to push their produce outward at a lower cost. Reportedly, a conducive oil pricing environment is likely push the state’s output beyond the all-time high of 1,227,483 barrels/day sometime during the next few months.However, with the opponents still concerned of emission levels and safety issues, they want the pipeline operator to have proper oil spill response plan in place.Nonetheless, with surging production volumes, effective infrastructural development is the need of the hour. With pipelines being the efficient and preferred choice of transportation, prospects of Dakota Access Pipeline look encouraging.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

95,HES,"Markets closed higher on Friday, the last trading session of the first half of the year, as energy stocks rallied. However, trade war fears saw all three major indexes ending lower for the week. Friday also marked the end of the month, the second quarter and the first half of the year.  Markets saw mixed performance during this period.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.2%, to close at 24,271.41. The S&P 500 rose 0.8% to close at 2,718.37. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,510.30, increasing 0.9%. A total of 7.16 billion shares were traded on Friday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.28 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.51-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.How did the Benchmark Perform?The Dow gained 55.36 points, with shares of Nike, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report) soaring as much as 11.1% to touch an all-time high. The company reported a return to growth in North America. Nike has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The S&P 500 added 2.06 points, lead by a rally in energy stocks. The blue-chip index rose as much as 200 points at one point but shed most of the gains in the afternoon. The Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) gained 0.7%, on concerns of oversupply, while the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) increased 0.4%. The tech heavy Nasdaq gained 6.62 points.For the week, the Nasdaq lost 2.37%, while the Dow and S&P 500 lost 1.26% and 1.33% respectively. The Dow declined for the third consecutive week, the first time in more than two years.Energy Stocks Gain, Late Selloff Hit Bank Stocks Energy and materials stocks helped markets on Friday, which saw the Dow increase as much as 293.47 points at one point. However, a huge selloff in banks stocks erased early gains. Bank stocks performed well almost throughout the day after the Fed announced the second round of the stress test results. This saw most major U.S. lenders announcing high dividend payouts and share buybacks, which saw bank shares rallying.However, a late session selloff saw markets shedding the initial gains. Shares of Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) lost 1.7%, 0.7%, 1.8% and 1.3%, respectively.Monthly RoundupMost of the month saw volatility in markets with stocks returning mixed performances. Trade war fears, which have gripped markets for quite some time, took its toll on stocks throughout the month. President Donald Trump once again threatened to impose tariffs of $200 billion worth of goods imported from China, which led top huge selloffs.June was also an eventful month that saw the historic meeting between Trump and North Korea’s premier Kim Jong-un. However, markets had high expectations from the meeting but not much impact was seen with stocks tumbling the day after the meeting.Moreover, as anticipated the Fed increased interest rates by 0.25% and hinted at two more hikes by the end of this year. Also, the Fed announced the annual stress test results for banks and gave OK to 32 of the 35 biggest banks in the United States to raise their dividends and buy back shares. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 gained 0.9% and 0.5% for the month, while the Dow lost 0.6%.Quarterly Round UpThe second quarter was marked by tremendous volatility in markets. Trade war fears, which had started taking its toll on stocks in the end of first quarter, escalated in the second quarter. While Trump continued to create pressure on China to decrease the trade deficit by imposing tariffs on a wide range of Chinese imports, China too imposed retaliatory tariffs.This dented investors’ confidence leading to huge sell offs. Tech stocks, which have been driving markets for quite some time, too weren’t spared with all major tech gains suffering. However, a series of meetings between U.S. and China to reach a possible agreement saw trade war fears easing for some time, resulting in a rally in stocks.However, the quarter again ended with geopolitical tensions escalating as Trump continued with his tariff threats.  Despite trade related concerns, the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow gained 2.9%, 6.3% and 0.7%, respectively, for the quarter.Half-Yearly Round UpAfter an outstanding 2017, markets touched record highs in January. However, the joyride came to a halt in February, when Trump for the first time announced his plans of imposing additional tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from China. Things soon took the shape of a trade war, as China too threatened to retaliate.The EU, Canada and Mexico too opposed Trump’s plans of imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum. After the United Stated finally imposed tariffs on $60 billion worth of Chinese goods, China retaliated with tariffs worth $50 billion worth of U.S. goods. This raised fears of a trade war making investors jittery and leading to huge selloffs.Moreover, tech stocks, which have been on a rally since 2017 also took a hit after Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) got embroiled in a data-misuse scandal that affected more than 80 billion users. This saw not all tech stocks plummeting on fears of regulatory clampdown.That said, the U.S. economy showed signs of bullishness. The unemployment rate hit a 18-year low. The Fed, as expected, raised interest rates twice and hinted at another two hikes by the end of this year. The last week of the first half of the year also saw U.S. inflation rate hitting a six-year high. The Fed preferred price gauge, PCE, rose 2.3% from the year ago, the most in six years.Stocks That Made HeadlinesBHP Board Approves South Flank Project to Replace YandiLaboratory Corporation of Americas Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), popularly known as LabCorp, recently collaborated with Royal Philips (PHG  -  Free Report).

97,HES,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 6.4% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is HES due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.First-Quarter ResultsHess Corporation reported adjusted first-quarter 2018 loss from continuing operations of 27 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 54 cents and the year-ago quarter loss of $1.07.Revenues increased to $1,390 million in the quarter from $1,254 million a year ago. The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,150 million.Higher realized oil and natural gas prices, rise in throughput volumes and the plunge in operating expenses supported the first-quarter numbers. The results were however partially offset by lower oil equivalent production.Through first-quarter 2018, Hess spent roughly $380 million for buying back 8 million shares. The energy player also announced that it has boosted the buyback program to $1.5 billion, reflecting an increase of $1 billion.Q1 Operational UpdateExploration and Production:In the quarter under review, the Exploration and Production business incurred a loss of $25 million, way narrower than the year-earlier loss of $233 million.Quarterly hydrocarbon production was 255 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 18% year over year owing to unscheduled downtime at Gulf of Mexico’s Enchilada platform.Crude oil production was 131 thousand barrels per day compared with 175 thousand barrels in the year-ago quarter. Natural gas liquids production totaled 37 thousand barrels per day compared with 40 thousand barrels in the prior-year quarter. Natural gas output was 504 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) per day versus 484 Mcf a year ago.    Worldwide crude oil realization per barrel of $59.32 (including the impact of hedging) showed an increase of 22% year over year.Worldwide natural gas prices rose 20.6% year over year to $3.86 per Mcf. The average worldwide natural gas liquids selling price also increased to $21.11 per barrel from $18.71 in the year-ago quarter.Midstream: From this business, the company generated profits of $28 million, significantly higher than $18 million in the January-to-March quarter of 2017. Rise in throughput volumes primarily contributed to the segment’s profits.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses in the first quarter totaled $288 million, down more than 19% from the year-ago $358 million.FinancialsQuarterly net cash flow from operations was $210 million at the end of the first quarter. Hess’ capital and exploratory expenditures totaled $384 million, down 2.3% from $393 million in the prior-year quarter.As of Mar 31, 2018, the company had approximately $3,726 million in cash and $6,397 million in long-term debt. The debt-to-capitalization ratio at the end of the quarter was 35.5%.  How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to four lower. Last month, the consensus estimate has shifted by 24.2% due to these changes.Hess Corporation Price and Consensus  Hess Corporation Price and Consensus | Hess Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, HES has a strong Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for growth and momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, HES has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

98,HES,"Integrated oil and gas company Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has agreed to divest its subsidiary Hess Norge that holds stakes in Norway's Valhall and Hod fields to Aker BP ASA. The deal will bring Hess a total of $2 billion. Also, recently, the company agreed to sell its offshore Equatorial Guinea interests to Kosmos Energy (KOS  -  Free Report) and Trident Energy for a total of $650 million. Hess also intends to divest its interests in Denmark's South Arne Field.Details of the DealsIn the first two quarters of 2017, net production from the Valhall and Hod fields was 26,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) on an average. Hess owns 64.05% and 62.5% interest in Valhall and Hod fields, respectively. The sale of the assets still requires approval from the Ministry of Oil and Energy, Ministry of Finance, and related competition clearance. Effective Jan 1, 2017, the deal is expected to close by the end of 2017.In Equatorial Guinea, Hess has 85% operating interests, where production for the first two quarters of 2017 averaged 28,000 barrels of oil per day. The deal is expected to be over by the end of 2017.The sale of South Arne Field, where it owns 61.5% interests, is expected to close in 2018. In the first two quarters of 2017, net production from the field was 11,000 (BOE/d) on average.Sale RationaleThe company said that the divestitures including the Norway assets, Equatorial Guinea assets and the Permian Basin assets obtained $3.25 billion in cash proceeds year to date.The deals are in line with the company's strategy of divesting assets in order to shift its focus to high return assets. The company plans to use the proceeds from the deals, added with the available cash on its balance sheet, for the development of its offshore Guyana asset. Hess believes this will give it the opportunity to receive growth, which will generate cash for more than a decade. The company also expects the proceeds from the divestment program to reduce its debt level by $500 million in 2018.About HessNew York-based Hess, previously known as Amerada Hess Corporation, is a global exploration & production company. The company engages in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas. Currently, the company has two operating segments, Exploration and Production and Bakken Midstream.Hess is among the leading producers of crude in the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota. The company has interests in the best areas of the play. With crude prices improving after OPEC’s decision to curb output, we expect the Bakken play to contribute to production growth in the long run. Moreover, new output from Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia could add considerably to the company’s output. However, in order to support its capital expenditures through 2017, the company continues to be highly dependent on major asset sales. The company’s growth and returns picture will likely be hindered by the asset sale programs in the near term.Price PerformanceHess has lost 27.5% of its value year to date compared with 11% fall of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderHess currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. (PARR  -  Free Report) and Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR  -  Free Report). Both sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Par Pacific’s sales for the third quarter of 2017 are expected to increase 28.5% year over year. The company delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 9.1% in the last four quarters.Denbury Resources’ sales for 2017 are expected to increase 5.8% year over year. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 100% in the second quarter of 2017.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

100,HES,"West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude recently touched the $75-a-barrel psychological mark, showing a more than 186% improvement from February 2016 when the commodity had hit its lowest level of $26.21 since 2003. The surge in oil price is definitely a boon for upstream and midstream businesses of integrated energy companies.Healthy crude price will likely convince energy players to ramp up production in domestic shale plays. From storing and transporting new oil volumes, integrated energy firms are expected to get additional fee-based revenues from shippers.Moreover, the abundance of natural gas in the United States following the shale revolution will continue to back the integrated energy firms’ chemical/downstream activities since the players’ petrochemical crackers should benefit from cheaper natural gas feedstocks like ethane instead of naphtha — which is derived from the pricier crude.Industry Rewards Shareholders with Huge ReturnsLooking at shareholder returns over the past year, it appears that the crude price recovery was enough for boosting investors’ confidence in the industry’s prospects. The Zacks Oil & Gas-US Integrated Industry, part of the broader Zacks Oil and Energy Sector, has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its sector over the past year. We can see that stocks in this industry have collectively gained 44.3% over the past year, while the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Oil and Energy Sector have rallied a respective 14.2% and 18.7%.One-Year Price PerformancePlenty of Room to RunIn order to determine the value of the oil sector, we have used the trailing 12-month Enterprise Multiple. This is because oil energy players typically shoulder significant debt pertaining to investments in growth projects and EV includes debt for valuing company or industry.Enterprise Multiple = Enterprise Value (EV)/EBITDAThe industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 9.09. When compared with the highest level of 10.49 over that period, there is apparently room for more upside.Enterprise Value/EBITDA Ratio (TTM) The space also looks cheap when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio for the S&P 500 is 11.48 and the median level is 11.38.  Comparing the group’s EV/EBITDA ratio with that of its broader sector shows that the industry is trading at a considerable premium. In fact, the solid business potential has convinced investors to persistently pay premium for the industry as compared to the broader sector over the past few years.  Enterprise Value/EBITDA Ratio (TTM) Outperformance May Sustain on Strong Earnings OutlookPer our proprietary model, the industry’s trailing 12-month free cashflow as of Dec 31, 2017 was $6.4 billion, significantly up from $542 million in 2016. This reflects that the industry has sufficient cashflow left for financing growth projects without the need to rely on debt and equity capital.Moreover, the industry has considerable lower exposure to debt as compared to the S&P 500. This is reflected in the industry’s debt-to-capitalization ratio of 34.7% against the S&P 500’s 47.2%. Hence, apart from adequate free cashflow, the industry has sufficient space for sponsoring future developments by debt capital if need arises. While the ratio analysis shows that there is a solid value-oriented path ahead, one should not really consider the current price levels as good entry points unless there are convincing reasons to predict a rebound in the near term. One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects for a solid price performance is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences its stock performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for it as well as the industry's aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019 while the light blue line represents the same for 2018.Price and Consensus: Zacks US IntegratedIndustry This becomes clearer by focusing on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revision trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Please note that the $2.69 EPS estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up dollar estimate for every company within the Zacks Oil & Gas-US Integrated Industry but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the industry’s earnings per share for 2018 but how this estimate has evolved recently.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions As you can see here, the $2.69 EPS estimate for 2018 is up from $2.03 at the end of April and 55 cents at the end of August 2017. In other words, the sell-side analysts covering the companies in the Zacks US integrated industry have been steadily raising their estimates.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks.The Zacks Oil & Gas-US Integrated Industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #18, placing it in the top 7% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.On top of that, our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has been in the top 50% for the past eight weeks with an overall steady upward trend.The solid near-term prospects are strengthened further by the recovery in top and bottom lines that integrated energy firms have been showing since the start of 2017.Revenues: Zacks US Integrated IndustryNet Income: Zacks US Integrated IndustryBottom LineProspects for upstream businesses seem promising as the current crude rally is expected to continue on numerous factors.Possibility of higher oil output from Saudi Arabia and Russia will not be able to offset global supply concerns emanating from Venezuela’s supply and Iran’s sanction issues. This is constantly driving WTI crude price. On top of that, a booming domestic economy, as reflected from robust job additions and the increase in labor force participation rate, is fueling the oil rally.  Midstream businesses are also picking up pace given the mounting demand for new pipeline networks in the domestic shale plays. Also, integrated energy firms are investing in petrochemical crackers in the Gulf Coast areas for capitalizing on cheap domestic natural gas feedstocks like ethane.Overall, it seems to be the ideal time to bet on four integrated energy companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and positive earnings estimate revisions.ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report): This Houston, TX-based firm has gained 66% over the past year. The #1 Ranked company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year EPS has been revised 15.8% upward over the last 60 days.One-Year Price Performance: COPMarathon Oil Corp.

(HES  -  Free Report): This New York-based company has rallied 66.2% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year loss has been narrowed from $1.07 a share to 67 cents.

104,HES,"Broader markets rallied on Friday due to optimism built around the implementation of the GOP Tax Bill. Such broad based gains ensured gains for three major benchmarks, negating the effects of dismal economic data. Benchmarks closed in the positive territory and posted outstanding weekly gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.9% to close at 25,295.87. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% to close at 2,743.15. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,136.56, gaining 0.8%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 1.3% to close at 9.22. A total of around 6.3 billion shares were traded on Friday, same as the last 20-session average of 6.3 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.52 -to-1 ratio.

This marked its third straight record close in last four trading sessions — its best opening week since 2006. Gains for the blue-chip index were rather broad-based. Markets have rallied in the first trading week of 2018 because of the implementation of tax reforms.Republicans successfully passed the tax bill on Dec 28 last year which slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. It also repealed the 20% corporate alternative minimum tax, while any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%. Immediate offset of spending on short lived capital equipment is expected to further save U.S. companies around $32.5 billion in 2018, as per Congress’s joint committee on taxation.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq gathered 3.4% on Friday to end in the green. Gains for the tech-laden index were also broad based; however, a surge in the shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) by 1.6% and 1.3%, respectively also boosted gains for the Nasdaq. The index also posted its fourth record close for 2018.Finally, the S&P 500 rallied 19.2 points on Friday to post its fourth record close this year. The index posted record closes on all the four trading days for the first time since 1964.

The blue-chip index registered its fastest 1,000-point rise since its inception in May 1896. Also, the 30-stock index posted 1,000-point increase five times in 2017 on the back of Trump’s pro-growth economic policies, upbeat economic data and strong corporate earnings.Stocks That Made HeadlinesNVIDIA Promises Progress in Autonomous Vehicles at CES 2018The technology sector is in focus this week with the Customer Electronics Show (CES) 2018 set to begin tomorrow and run through this Friday.

105,HES,"Oil production is surging in Canada but producers are far from happy as their profit margin is sinking and they are striving to stay competitive with their U.S. counterparts. While upstream companies like Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report), Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) and others are enjoying the shale boom and rebound in prices in the United States, their Canadian counterparts like Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE  -  Free Report) and others are thinking of reducing production. The primary reason behind this is the shortage of pipelines in the country. In short, pipeline construction in Canada has failed to keep pace with rising domestic oil production – the heavier sour variety churned out of the oil sands –  resulting in infrastructural bottlenecks. This has also forced producers to give away their products at a discounted rate.Price Differences Leading to Lower RevenuesPipeline capacity constraints mean that Canadian oil explorers are selling their products in the United States – their major market – at highly discounted prices, causing tremendous loss in revenues. In fact, the discounts have led to a huge difference between Alberta’s Western Canada Select and New York-traded West Texas Intermediate oil benchmark. After adjustments made for differences in quality and shipping costs, the Fraser Institute in Canada found the difference between oil prices in the United States and Canada at $26.30 per barrel for 2018. This is expected to land a C$15.8 billion blow to the energy sector’s revenues. Notably, the price difference between the two averaged at $16.54 per barrel during the 2012-17 period, which resulted in lost revenues of C$20.7 billion.As it is, extraction from oil sands is a high-risk strategy considering the extra costs involved compared with production from conventional oil wells. Add to it limited pipeline capacity and things do not look too promising for Canada’s upstream players.Now the question is what led to this infrastructural scenario.Environmental and Political TurmoilThough several major pipeline projects received the green light from the review agencies in the country, their future is still uncertain due to political turmoil. Moreover, environmental protests are on the rise, thereby further derailing construction. The crusaders believe that the rapidly growing movement of oil around the country is unsafe.For example, the C$7.4 billion Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project of Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) – a Zacks Ranks #3 (Hold) company – faced opposition from British Columbia residents and indigenous communities, who are wary of the potential impact of the project on the environment. The NDP government in British Columbia also opposed the expansion project. Currently, the Canadian government is planning to provide a financial shield to the company from the politically motivated delays.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Moreover, TransCanada Corporation’s (TRP  -  Free Report) $8 billion Keystone XL pipeline – expected to carry heavy crude from Alberta to refineries in the United States – is yet to get a final investment decision. The midstream company had secured 20 years commitment for 500 thousand barrels per day for the pipeline and received Alberta government’s support. However, the Nebraska government sanctioned the Mainline Alternative Route for the controversial project, which is longer than the company’s preferred route and has forced it to review the alternative route keeping the final decision on hold.Enbridge Inc.’s (ENB  -  Free Report) Canada-United States connecting Line 3 replacement project faced criticism from the Ojibwe communities. The capital cost of the project in Canada is estimated to be C$5.3 billion while the portion in the United States will cost $2.9 billion. The preferred route of the company goes against the interests of the Native Americans. The fate of the project is expected to be decided by Jun 27, 2018. The situation has become discouraging for investors in the oil energy space in Canada.Related ProblemsApart from Canadian oil’s massive discount relative to WTI, the pipeline shortage created another problem for the energy sector, as crude shippers increased their dependence on railway and trucks, which is costlier than pipelines as well as less safe. Carrying oil by railways and roads makes crude transportation more prone to spills, which is ironically the primary concern for environmentalists. Hence, it can be said that the pipeline shortage is causing both economic and environmental problems for Canada.Additionally, the farmers who ship their grains via railroads are experiencing difficulties as they are left with stranded cargos and cash crunch. Rise in demand for shipping crudes by rail is pushing other cargoes off the rail. It created grain backlog due to lack of lower availability of crop cars. In short, the pipeline bottleneck is slowly squeezing Canada’s two most important sectors and giving investors a hard time. It has also put the government in a tough spot.ConclusionEven if implementation of the pipeline policies accelerates, it will take considerable time to actually finish the projects. Until then, the economy is likely to take a blow on two fronts, energy and agriculture. In case of Trans Mountain, the government’s plan to provide financial assurance, taking the burden of politically-motivated delays, will further create a hole in tax payers’ fund. Hence, a sound regulatory and environmental policy framework is the need of the hour. The sooner it is devised, the better it is for the Canadian economy. Otherwise, it will become increasingly difficult for energy companies to find new routes to take the country's landlocked oil to foreign markets.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

106,HES,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed that crude stockpiles registered a fall of 1.4 million barrels as exports jumped to a new record. On a further bullish note, the report revealed that refined product inventories, gasoline and distillate, both dropped from their week earlier levels. Importantly, the positive data sets have added to the strong sentiment in the oil market.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 0.3% (or 18 cents) to $71.49 per barrel yesterday – the highest settlement since November 2014.Over the past month, the commodity has been supported by speculation that the United States could renew sanctions on OPEC-member Iran. True to predictions, U.S. President Donald Trump recently withdrew from a nuclear deal with the cartel’s third-largest producer and pledged to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The action has stoked worries about a cut in Iranian oil exports by around 1 million barrels per day from the current levels and a supply shortage in an already tight oil market.Energy Stocks on a RollThe bullish oil market sentiment has encouraged buying in energy stocks, which lifted the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – more than 7% over the past month.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 4.7% and 6.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report), Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) and National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 1.4 million barrels for the week ending May 11, following a decrease of 2.2 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 2.3 million barrels.Soaring exports in the wake of widening Brent premium to WTI led to the draw with the world's biggest oil consumer. This was partly offset by record high domestic production, which restricted the decline below expectations.In particular, U.S. output rose by 20,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.72 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.Meanwhile, stockpiles have shrunk in 40 of the last 58 weeks and are down nearly 90 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 432.4 million barrels, current crude supplies are 17% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – edged up by 53,000 barrels to 37.2 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 26.0 days in the previous week to 26.1 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.5 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies were down a second week in a row as imports dropped, while demand remained strong with the onset of the summer driving season. The 3.8 million barrels decline – outpacing the polled number of 2 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 232 million barrels. Following last week’s draw, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 3.6% below the year-earlier level though it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) inched down 92,000 barrels last week, unable to match up with analysts’ expectations for 1.3 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to lower imports and strong demand. At 114.9 million barrels, current supplies are 21.7% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up 0.7% from the prior week to 91.1%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) may be an excellent selection.

107,HES,"The United States has pulled out of the landmark deal curbing Iran’s nuclear program and reimposing sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Trump said that it was a “horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.” He added that the “Iran deal is defective at its core” and it’s an “embarrassment” that the United States did little to restrain Iran’s nuclear ambition.In the run-up to the U.S. decision, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that he has evidence that the nuclear deal was nothing but fabrications and Iran was hiding nuclear weapons. Trump agreed that Netanyahu’s claims corroborated his own view.So, what is the Iran nuclear deal? It was a historic agreement reached by Iran and several other world powers including Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States to reduce the Islamic Republic’s ability to produce two major components of nuclear weapons — plutonium and uranium. In return, Iran will be able spared of crippling financial sanctions. The deal also permitted Iran to export more crude provided the nation restricted its nuclear activities.Let us now take a look at the potential winners and losers emerging from the end of the Iran nuclear deal:Oil Near $70, Energy Stocks GainWith the United States poised to reimpose sanctions on Iran’s petroleum sales, oil prices initially dropped but rebounded soon after. This has disrupted global oil production at a time when the crude market is tight. The international benchmark, Brent crude oil, rose as high as 3.1% to $77.20 in early trading in London on May 9, while the benchmark price for U.S. crude oil climbed to $70.93. Shares of energy companies are, undoubtedly, rallying as crude prices hover near $70 a barrel. Energy shares are looking up after they fell out of favor when oil price slipped from $100 a barrel to under $30 in 2014. In fact, the energy sector of the S&P 500 has risen more than 10% in the past month to total gains of 3.1% so far this year.From exploration and production firm Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) to petroleum refiner Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report), all have seen a rally in shares of more than 20% to date, easily outperforming the broader S&P 500’s decline of less than 0.1%. Meanwhile, smaller energy equipment and services companies, whose shares tend to rise with an uptick in oil prices, have gained even more.At the same time, companies like Encana Corporation, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) and Pioneer Natural Resources Company’s (PXD  -  Free Report) earnings are poised to improve further as oil prices scale north. This is because these companies have already posted better results in the most recent quarter when oil prices were between $50 and $60 a barrel.As oil continues to hover around $70 a barrel and is probably heading toward $80 soon, these energy players will not only make the most of the higher spot prices but will also hedge into next year at higher oil prices.But let’s admit that it’s just not oil prices that are changing investors’ attitude toward energy companies. Stronger balance sheets, steady rise in profitability and focus to boost shareholders’ returns are shaping the turnaround in the energy space.Oil majors Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) have already seen the best first-quarter performance in years last month. In all, the highest first quarter year-over-year earnings growth is likely to be recorded in the energy sector, which is expected to surge 73.9% from the same period last year on 14.4% higher revenues.Given this bullishness, some of the top-ranked energy shares one could consider are Evolution Petroleum Corporation (EPM  -  Free Report), Pioneer Energy Services Corp. (PES  -  Free Report), Oasis Midstream Partners LP (OMP  -  Free Report) and Rice Midstream Partners LP (RMP  -  Free Report). These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners (read more: Oil Hits $70 for First Time in 4 Years: 5 Top Energy Picks).Travel Shares Go Down, Boeing in TroubleThe surge in oil prices incited investors to dump travel and leisure stocks, put off by the prospect of increasing fuel costs for airlines. Travel and leisure stocks dropped as much as 2.1% on May 8.Trump’s announcement to withdraw from what he considers a “defective” Iranian nuclear deal, in the meantime, is expected to heighten tensions in the Middle East region. This doesn’t bode well for The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report). The airline manufacturer stands to lose a whopping $20 billion in business with Iran. After all, it has an agreement to sell around 110 planes worth the said amount to Iranian airlines.The U.S. withdrawal also affected Boeing’s French rival Airbus SE, which had a multibillion-dollar sale planned.

109,HES,"Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) reported adjusted first-quarter 2018 loss from continuing operations of 27 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 54 cents and the year-ago quarter loss of $1.07.Revenues increased to $1,390 million in the quarter from $1,254 million a year ago. The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,150 million.Higher realized oil and natural gas prices, rise in throughput volumes and the plunge in operating expenses supported the first-quarter numbers.

111,HES,"Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) announced that the sixth oil discovery — Ranger-1 exploration well — since 2015 in the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, was a success.The five world class discoveries in the block — Liza, Payara, Snoek, Liza Deep and Turbot —are projected to have total recoverable resources of over 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Further, resources related with the Ranger-1 discovery will raise this estimate.The drilling of the Ranger-1 well was started by partner ExxonMobil Corporation’s (XOM) associate Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Ltd. on Nov 5, 2017. It hit about 230 feet (70 meters) of high-quality, oil-bearing carbonate reservoir. The well was drilled to a total depth of 21,161 feet (6,450 meters) in water depth of 8,973 feet (2,735 meters).The Stena Carron drillship, which is being used to drill the Ranger-1 well, will be mobilized to the Pacora prospect, 4 miles from the Payara discovery, on completion of the same. For 2018, additional exploration drilling is planned in the Stabroek Block, which is spread across 6.6 million acres (26,800 square kilometers). Potential appraisal drilling at the Ranger discovery is also planned to be executed during 2018.ExxonMobil, the operator of Stabroek Block, holds 45%, while Hess and CNOOC Nexen Petroleum Guyana Limited hold 30% and 25%, respectively.The discovery further validates the significant potential of Guyana.

112,HES,"A number of debt holders have raised objection against downstream petroleum distributor Sunoco LP’s (SUN  -  Free Report) $3.3 billion deal with Japan-based retail conglomerate Seven & I Holdings Co., Ltd. Bondholders have apparently raised an objection against a reported modification in the terms of the $1.6B-credit agreement. They demand higher monetary grants and enhanced protection to agree to the changes in the bond indentures.The deal with 7-Eleven was announced in April and is scheduled to close by the second half of 2017. Per the deal, Sunoco is to sell around 1,100 convenience stores and gas stations in Texas and other states to 7-Eleven. Per the deal, the partnership will also enter a 15-year agreement with 7-Eleven to sell 2.2 billion gallons of fuel annually.The deal will help the partnership to partially pay down $4.51 billion debt. The 15-year supply agreement will also provide the partnership with regular long-term income thereby improving Sunoco’s financial profile.Sunoco will utilize cash proceeds to repurchase equity, including the $300-million investment made by its parent company Energy Transfer Equity (ETE  -  Free Report) in March  along with some of the units owned by Energy Transfer Partners (ETP  -  Free Report) from the drop-down transactions last year.Sunoco plans to sell another 200 stores and fuel outlets in North and West Texas by the end of the fourth quarter and expand its distribution business through acquisitions.Energy companies like Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report), Valero Energy Corporation and others have divested gas stations to focus on the core business of exploring, transporting and refining oil and gas.The divestiture is likely to improve the weak financial profile of Sunoco and enable it to pursue acquisitions. However, these retail stores are a major contributor to Sunoco’s earnings.

113,HES,"Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report) decided to reduce its current workforce by 9% or 300 workers with an objective to streamline its operations, improve returns and boost margins, per a media report. The layoffs will begin in the next few weeks and impact all areas of the company’s operations, including its headquarters.Devon Energy expects the decision to cut down its existing workforce to result in savings within $150-$200 million in 2020.In 2016, Devon Energy announced plans to reduce its workforce by nearly 1,000 to cope with the low commodity price environment. The reduction of workforce helped the company to lower operating expenses and allowed it to remain financially flexible.Devon’s Initiatives to TransformDevon Energy is planning to transform itself by divesting more than $5 billion of its non-core assets in the next three years under its Vision 2020 initiative. The company has already announced to sell its non-core assets worth $1 billion.The strategy to divest the non-core assets is actually helping Devon Energy to concentrate on its high-margin oil production region. The company will in turn utilize the cash flow to lower its existing debts levels, and work to increase shareholders’ value through share buybacks and dividend growth.In 2018, Devon Energy plans to lower $1 billion of its outstanding debt to strengthen its balance sheet and lower interest expenses. The company also made an announcement of repurchasing $1.0 billion shares of its common stock over the next year to increase the value of its existing shareholders.Job Cuts to Lower CostsDevon Energy is not the only player in the Oil and Energy sector taking the difficult call to cut down on existing workforce for lowering operating costs.

114,HES,"Shares of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) have scaled a new 52-week high of $74.92 in yesterday’s trading session, before eventually closing at $72.88, generating a healthy year-to-date rate of more than 10%. The stock displays impressive price movement both in absolute and relative terms. The company has had a great run over a year with its shares rallying in excess of 48%, outperforming its industry’s gain of 22.8% in the same time frame.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has the potential for further price appreciation with long-term earnings growth expectation of 14.49% and looks poised to touch new highs in coming period. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)  stocks here.The company fared well in 2017, delivering a net income of $3.4 billion and marking a whopping year-over-year surge of more than 192%. Marathon Petroleum — whose peers include HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC  -  Free Report) and Delek US Holdings, Inc. among others — pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 182.62% in the trailing four quarters on the back of improved performance in all its segments — Refining, Retail and Midstream.The company’s strategic initiatives to enhance growth are expected to boost performance in the future. Marathon Petroleum expects to deliver year-over-year growth of 24.21% in its earnings in 2018.Let’s delve deeper to analyze what’s driving the stock.Drop-Down Deals Leading to Cash InfluxTo accelerate value accretion for shareholders and boost growth, Marathon Petroleum has been actively engaged in drop-down transactions lately. As part of that effort, the company divested some of its terminal, pipeline and storage assets to its midstream subsidiary, MPLX L.P. (MPLX  -  Free Report). The $8.1 billion dropdown deal with MPLX that closed last month has resulted in huge cash influx and increased equity participation in the partnership. Moreover, the transaction also ensures the generation of a steady revenue stream for the company.The cash influx has bolstered the share buyback and dividend programs of the company, boosting investors’ confidence. Marathon Petroleum returned more than $3 billion of capital to its shareholders through dividends and buybacks in 2017. The downstream operator is known for raising dividends since it became a standalone public company in mid-2011. Notably, the dividend hikes and buybacks, since the company's inception, have totaled in excess of $13 billion.Midstream Segment Set to GrowthIn 2017, the MPLX unit generated income of more than $1.3 billion compared with more than $1 billion in 2016. MPLX’s robust portfolio of projects in the Permian, Marcellus and STACK shale plays offers significant growth opportunities. The drop-down deals have enhanced MPLX’s scale and increased its distributable cash flow per unit. It will also enrich its earnings by diversifying it with fee-based stable revenue streams, which will get reflected in the profitability of its parent company in the future.MPLX’s new Cushing-to-Patoka Expansion project concluded its binding open season late last month and garnered a substantial interest from potential shippers. The expansion process is expected to be over by the second quarter and come online in the third quarter of 2018. Moreover, the expansion project is expected to increase the partnership’s revenue opportunities and augment its distributable cash flow in the long term.Speedway a DriverMarathon Petroleum’s retail unit, Speedway — the second largest gasoline and convenience-store chain in the United States — achieved a robust full-year performance in 2017, generating revenues of $19,033 million, up 4.1% from $18,286 million recorded in 2016. The segment remains primed for solid earnings and growth on healthy merchandise margins, and its marketing enhancement opportunities and acquisition synergies, including the retail arm of Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report).Notably, Marathon Petroleum intends to make an investment of around $530 million in Speedway in 2018 by the construction of new stores and remodeling the existing ones, thus focusing on organic growth opportunities. Marathon Petroleum intends to strengthen the geographical foothold of its Speedway unit by entering new markets including Georgia, South Carolina and upstate New York. The company believes that the improving market conditions are likely to boost margins and the financial position of the Speedway unit in the coming quarters.Refining Margins Fuel IncomeOperating income from the Refining & Marketing segment surged 71% year over year in 2017. The jump was led by wider crack spread leading to stronger refining margin and higher capacity utilization. Refining margins averaged $12.60 in 2017 against $11.16 in 2016.We expect the margin strength to continue in the near-to-medium term, thus boosting the overall performance of the company.Other Growth CatalystsMarathon Petroleum's financial flexibility and strong balance sheet are its real assets.  As of Dec 31, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $3,011 million and a manageable debt-to-capitalization ratio of 38.4%.The corporate rate cut from 35% to 21% has also benefited the company, reducing its cash burden. Notably, earnings for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 included a tax benefit of around $1.5 billion.We expect Marathon Petroleum’s impressive asset quality, extensive midstream/retail network along with its commitment to return more value to investors to keep the stock poised for growth trajectory for the remainder of 2018.  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

115,HES,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output rose 1.4% in July after dropping 0.8% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (""DMR"") latest data said that oil production in July averaged 1,047,526 barrels a day, up 14,653 barrels a day from June.Along With Oil, Gas Production Rises TooReflecting a healthy increase and trumping expectations, the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation. As daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the sixth month in a row, the state’s total number of producing wells numbered 13,981 at the end of July, a new all-time high.Interestingly, natural gas output was up 1.3% in July to 1,876,460 thousand cubic feet per day – another record – as operators scrambled to the core areas of the Bakken where wells tend to produce more gas along with crude.Despite the Increase, Production is a Shadow of Earlier HighsChurning out as high as 1,227,483 barrels/day in December 2014, the current production statistics highlight oil’s horror show that has seen prices come down from $110 per barrel in mid-2014 to around $50 now, in between falling to a 12-year low of $26.21 in February 2016. The commodity’s collapse has fueled spending cuts and layoffs while threatening the industry’s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows, drying up liquidity and narrowing profit margins.Rig Count Clawing Back SteadilySome 58 drilling rigs were active in the state in July, up from 55 in June and 50 in May. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 31 rigs operating. A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the steady rise in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates increase in drilling activities and essentially steady production. Notwithstanding recent gains, the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling.Increase in Wells, Rig Count Supported by Enough Fracking CrewsEven as the rig count in North Dakota continues to rise and the number of producing wells in the state reach record highs, production was being stymied recently by the lack of hydraulic fracturing crews. However, the situation seems to have improved now.At present, there are around 24 or 25 frack crews in the state, sufficient to complete wells and keep pace with the rig count.Shale Industry Caught in a “Catch-22” SituationWhile more rigs in operation and stable production could be construed as positive developments for the state of North Dakota, the current oil prices of around $50 will render a lot of drilling as unprofitable. And at the crux of the matter is the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.Therefore, the U.S. shale (including the likes of North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) is perhaps the biggest reason why crude prices are floundering again.What Lies Ahead?As one can conclude from the above discussion, the improvement in July production does not mean much with the oil bust now anticipated to last through this year and well into 2018. While the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being, there are chances that volumes could fall below that figure if prices revisit the $45-a-barrel level.Dakota Access Pipeline: Can It Revive Production?While the oil weakness is expected to persist at least till the first half of 2018, there is one factor that might speed up the revival of Bakken output – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners L.P.’s (ETP) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration. As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor brought the controversial conduit online in early June.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 78% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% earlier in 2017 to less than 10%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 500,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins.This, industry observers hope, will set the ball rolling for Bakken’s production revival and help producers like Continental Resources Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report), Whiting Petroleum Corp. (WLL  -  Free Report), EOG Resources Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report), Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report), QEP Resources Inc. (QEP  -  Free Report), SM Energy Co. (SM  -  Free Report).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

116,HES,"Energy Transfer Partners, L.P.’s (ETP  -  Free Report) Dakota Access pipeline has been benefiting oil producers in Bakken Shale.  We note that the opening of the pipeline was mired in controversy. However, once it became fully operational in June 2017, this 1,172-mile pipeline has proved to be beneficial for producers in the region.How?The pipeline, with a capacity to carry about 520,000 barrels of oil per day, was targeted to bridge the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil-producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins. The geographically constrained Bakken Shale's crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets. As expected, the pipeline, where oil majors like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) have invested,    has helped to improve the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators and benefit the state financially.  Products from companies like Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) were among the first to reach the international markets (China and Netherlands), with the help of Dakota Access.Owing to improved access to the markets, discount for Bakken crude has gone down from $7 or $8 to $5. This has increased the number of operational rigs in the region from 38 in January 2017 to 53 at the end of 2017. If the current oil price environment persists, the number of active rigs is expected to increase in the coming quarters. Production per rig is higher in the Bakken Shale than most of the other shale plays in the United States. The rise in rig count pushed oil production from around one million barrels per day (bpd) to 1,185,000 bpd. Moreover, in October alone, the state witnessed an all-time high total output of more than 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day.With an increase in output, revenues are expected to surge for oil producers and the state as well. During the first year of operations, the state is expected to receive $250 million in tax. It had put North Dakota state-revenue 17% higher than estimated. Notably, during the first five months of the pipeline’s operation, state revenues were $43 million higher than previous projection.  Crude transportation has become much easier since the introduction of the pipeline. Previously, 12 trains with 100 cars used to ship oil out of the state, which now has reduced to two. It has lessened the risk of accidents and spills.In addition with the financial perks, the pipeline has provided jobs for locals both directly and indirectly. It has lowered the rate of unemployment in the North Dakota state to 2.8%, while the U.S. unemployment rate is 4.1%.The Dakota Access Controversy The pipeline, which was supposed to become operational by the end of 2016, faced immense objection delaying the commencement of services. Work on the project was halted by the Obama administration amid protests from a Native American tribe, blocking the construction of the final part of the pipeline through North Dakota. The protests of Standing Rock Sioux Tribe drew international attention. They were of the opinion that the pipeline would desecrate their sacred burial ground as well as contaminate the water supply. Efforts to complete the Dakota Access Pipeline were restarted after President Trump brushed aside former President Obama’s efforts of blocking the pipeline's construction. Trump ignored the bitter opposition from environmental activists and ordered the completion of the pipeline.The pipeline, despite the pending litigation against its operator, has already leaked at least three times. However, in early December 2017, a judge paid heed to the request of the tribe. It asked Energy Transfer Partners and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to develop an oil spill response plan for the stretch of pipe below the Missouri River, which is due in April 2018.Although the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline by Energy Transfer Partners, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, has faced criticism, it has also proved to be beneficial in some respects. With the expected positive results from the project, it will be hard to cast a vote against the pipeline.

117,HES,"The energy sector is currently looking bright after witnessing impressive year-over-year earnings growth of 157.2% driven by 23.8% higher revenues in the last quarter. In fact, among all the 16 Zacks sectors, energy was the only one that witnessed triple-digit earnings growth in the October to December quarter. The sector generated $39.3 billion in earnings through 2017. Recovering commodity price and successful cost-cut strategies adopted during the slump period aided it in delivering stellar results.More importantly, the companies were able to cover their investment and payouts with cash from operations — a quality that investors really desire in stocks. In fact, riding on improving commodity prices, stronger production outlook and healthier cash flows, the companies look poised to continue the momentum in the coming years. Notably, we expect energy to report profit of $66.9 billion and $72.6 billion in 2018 and 2019, respectively.The companies are set for more cash generation and the top priority of most of the CEO’s is to seamlessly shift from cost-containment efforts to boosting shareholder value with dividend hikes and share buybacks.Pricing Gains and Cost Cuts Drives Energy PlayersWith the crude markets having recovered from the historic lows and comfortably trading above $60 a barrel since a couple of months, the impact of improving energy landscape is clearly visible on the oil majors. Unlike other short-lived rallies over the past three years, we believe that the current higher oil prices are a result of improving fundamentals. Declining inventories, bright demand outlook and the extension of OPEC-led supply cuts until the end of 2018 are the major factors helping balance the market and supporting the strong uptrend.The companies have also reaped benefits of cost-containment strategies adopted during the historic downturn period. They focused on realigning their business models to a more lean and efficient structure so as to stay competitive in the long run.As evidenced by the stellar full-year results, it won’t be a stretch to say most of the major energy companies have successfully come out of the slump. In fact, the resilience to reduced crude prices has made the stocks more durable as they are not just surviving but thriving at $50 a barrel threshold mark.Robust Cash Flows Fuel Shareholder RewardsLeaner strategies adapted by the company during the industry downturn including reducing headcount, streamlining operations, divesting non-core projects, slashing capex, dividend, buyback programs and operating costs are all yielding desired results.Thanks to the rebounding prices and strategic initiatives, cash flow from operating activities — which is a key metric to gauge the financial health of the firms — was the highest in 2017 since the downturn period. Having positive cash flows indicates enhanced liquidity, giving the company more power for debt repayment, expenses, dividend payouts, stock buyback and reinvestment in business.The companies generated enough cash to pay off debt along with funding capex and dividend payments. Further, the energy stocks look poised for growth and greater investor rewards.Buybacks Boost on Robust Business ScenarioAmid higher oil prices, robust cash flows and other strategic initiatives, energy players are now inclining toward bolstering shareholder returns through buyback programs. With the buyback, the companies will be able to overcome the dilution problem under their scrip dividend policies adopted during downturn that entitled the investors’ options for choosing stocks as payout instead of cash.Delivering solid results, BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) became the first European supermajor to recommence buybacks after 2014, when repurchases were stalled as crude price started declining on supply glut woes. Per the program, the European energy giant planned to repurchase a maximum of 1.96 billion shares between Nov 15, 2017 and annual general meeting 2018.Following BP closely, Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) also announced its plans to buy back shares of at least $25 billion by the end of 2020 owing to brighter prospects and improving cash flow generation.In late 2017, Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) also declared a $500-million stock buyback plan. Additionally, this month, it announced a new share repurchase plan after receiving authorization from its board of directors. Per the plan, through 2018, the explorer is likely to buy back shares worth $1 billion. The recent announcement reflects the firm’s strong commitment toward returning cash back to stockholders on a regular basis.Last month, TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) also announced plans to buyback up to $5 billion shares over the period of 2018-2020, thanks to the improving energy landscape and solid 2017 financial results.In February 2018, Noble Energy Inc. also declared a $750 million share purchase program to be executed through 2020. Pioneer Natural Resources Company also joined the bandwagon of energy players who are resorting to share repurchase programs. The company will buy back about $100 million shares this year to offset the dilution related to the stock compensation plans.In its annual analyst day this month, Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) also hinted the resumption of share repurchase program. While the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company did not disclose anything specific regarding the program, it did signal that the increasing free cash generation through production boost and cost cuts may help it to carry out share buybacks sometime this year after a three-year long hiatus. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Just a day after Chevron signaled buyback plans, U.S. explorer Devon Energy Corporation also announced $1 billion buyback accounting to about 6% of its outstanding stock.Amid improving environment for the U.S. energy sector, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation also announced $2.5 billion share buyback program extending through 2018.However, ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) seems to have skipped the trend with no buybacks in the horizon at the moment. Nevertheless, while the company has not notified anything in particular about its buyback plans, it did mention that unless it utilizes its cash flows toward some strong growth opportunities, it might as well resume the repurchase program.Bottom LineShare buybacks represent a highly attractive return opportunity for the investors. Stock buybacks lead to a decrease in the number of outstanding shares for a company, boosting the earnings per share. With recovering energy landscape and improving financial picture of the companies, we can anticipate more energy players to focus on rewarding shareholders with compelling buyback programs.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

118,HES,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output fell 0.6% in January after decreasing 1.2% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (‘DMR’) latest data said that oil production in January averaged 1,175,638 barrels a day, down 7,198 barrels a day from December.With crude, natural gas output came down, too – from December’s 2,084,925 thousand cubic feet per day to 2,068,244 thousand cubic feet per day. Meanwhile, North Dakota’s total number of producing wells numbered 14,313 at the end of January, unchanged from the previous month.While the slight drop in oil activity – primarily attributed to winter weather – is the second month-over-month production decrease in a row, the decline was much smaller than anticipated. Moreover, daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the twelfth month.Therefore, notwithstanding the temporary blip, the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation.Rig Count Pushes HigherSome 56 drilling rigs were active in the state in January, up four from the December average. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 38 rigs operating. A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the improvement in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates rebounding drilling activities and production.Though the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling, one must note that sophisticated drilling rigs have enabled producers to get more oil out of each well. In other words, modern rigs have helped boost the per-unit output.$60 Is the New $80 for Shale IndustryMore rigs in operation and stable production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota, but also points to the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers (in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50-$60 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.What Lies Ahead?The U.S. West Texas Intermediate benchmark hit a more than three-year high of around $66 recently. Also, we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being. While we do not rule out chances for short-term pullbacks on oversupply concerns and a stronger U.S. dollar, we remain extremely confident of an extended period of gains in the near future.In this context, the steady recovery in North Dakota’s production bode well for the region. With oil prices likely to head higher, the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being.Dakota Access Pipeline: Safe and Reliable Method for Transporting OilApart from the strength in crude prices, there is another factor that might speed up Bakken output growth – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners’ (ETP  -  Free Report) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration.

(CLR  -  Free Report),  and Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report) were among the first to reach the international markets (China and Netherlands), with the help of Dakota Access.Overall, rebounding oil prices, together with the start of the Dakota Access Pipeline, are expected to support further increase in Bakken output by providing the companies a chance to push their produce outward at a lower cost.In fact, Lynn Helms – the director of DMR – feels that a conducive oil pricing environment is likely push the state’s output beyond the all-time high of 1,227,483 barrels/day sometime by mid-2018, eventually hitting 1.3 million barrels by the end of the year.Want to Own a North Dakota Play Now?If you are looking for a near term North Dakota play, Continental Resources may be a good selection.

119,HES,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices logged gains.On the news front, integrated majors ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) earmarked their growth actions in respective annual analyst meetings. Meanwhile, energy explorer Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 1.3% to close at $62.04 per barrel, while natural gas prices increased 1.4% to $2.732 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Marathon's Libya Sale, SeaDrill's Restructuring, Canadian Natural's Q4 & More)Oil rebounded from its mid-week slump, with the U.S. benchmark rising more than 1%. The commodity declined in earlier sessions after the Energy Department's inventory release revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another weekly build. Crude was further pressured by soaring U.S. production, wherein output rose to 10.4 million barrels per day -- the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.However, a strong jobs report, falling U.S. oil rig count and news of more countries likely to be excluded from Trump administration’s planned tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, helped turn things around. Oil’s recovery was further facilitated by weakness in the U.S. dollar and reduced geopolitical fears on the back of reports that President Trump has agreed to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved higher last week on strong demand and a supportive weather outlook.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    ExxonMobil has outlined its growth strategy, which intends to more than double earnings and cash flow from operations by 2025 based on current oil prices. Per the growth plans, the company expects earnings of $31 billion by 2025, up more than 100% from last year’s adjusted profit of $15 billion. The figure does not include the impact of U.S. tax reform and impairments.ExxonMobil has set capital spending at $24 billion for 2018, $28 billion for 2019 and $30 billion from 2023 to 2025, to meet its target to achieve high growth. However, its peers including Chevron are cutting down on spending and keeping budgets unchanged.Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive officer of ExxonMobil, also emphasized that the plan estimates double-digit rates of return in all three segments of ExxonMobil’s business — upstream, downstream and chemical.Overall, ExxonMobil’s growth strategy aims to fully leverage competitive advantages to boost shareholder value in three of its world-class businesses. The increased investments are expected to enhance and boost returns on capital employed to about 15% by 2025.(Read more ExxonMobil's Growth Strategies to Double Earnings by 2025)2.    Chevron recently issued a statement at its latest annual analyst day, bringing in pleasant news for its investors. The California-based supermajor highlighted its commitment toward dividend growth as its top priority. It also laid emphasis on prudent reinvestment in the business, strengthening of financials and cash flow generation. It updated its guidance related to capex, production, margins and other details along with emphasizing on its growing free cash flows.While dividend growth remains the topmost priority for management, Chevron still emphasizes the need of operational efficiency and capital discipline to strengthen its cash flows. The company now plans to spend $18-$20 billion per annum through the end of the decade versus the prior guidance of $17-$22 billion per annum.Despite the capital discipline, the supermajor forecasts a year-over-year increase in net production of 4-7% in 2018, with 2-3% output gain from the base and shale/tight oil assets. This compares with the 5% net production growth achieved by the company in 2017 on a yearly basis.Chevron also targets asset disposal worth $5-$10 billion through 2018-2020 in an attempt to exit the non-core holdings and strengthen its cash flows. The company also plans to tap strategic acquisition opportunities to streamline and high grade its portfolio, thereby increasing shareholder value. (Read more: Chevron Sets Dividend Growth & Other Priorities for 2018)3.    Hess announced a new share repurchase plan after receiving authorization from its board of directors. Through 2018, the explorer will likely buy back shares worth $1 billion. Late 2017, the company declared a $500-million stock buyback plan. The recent announcement reflects the firm’s strong commitment toward returning cash back to stockholders on a regular basis.The company foresees higher oil and gas production which when combined with healthy oil prices will likely boost cashflow. Hess added that with the new buyback program, it will not compromise with its potential to invest in key developments like Guyana and Bakken.Earlier, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company had announced that majority of its 2018 capital budget will likely get allotted toward low-cost resources in Bakken and projects located off the coast of Guyana. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Overall, with the robust business outlook, the management might think the company’s shares are undervalued and hence is the right time to boost share buyback.(Read more Hess Boosts Buyback Plan on Favorable Business Scenario)4.    Devon Energy Corp. (DVN  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell the southern portion of its Barnett Shale position for $553 million. This deal is part of the company’s plan to divest more than $5 billion of its non-core assets in the next three years under its Vision 2020 initiative. The transaction is subject to customary terms and conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.The assets, which are earmarked for monetization, are currently averaging 200 million cubic feet of gas-equivalent per day. Combined with other recent asset divestitures announced by the company, it has already announced to sell non-core assets worth $1 billion.In 2018, Devon Energy plans to lower $1.5 billion of its outstanding debt to strengthen its balance sheet and lower interest expenses. Devon Energy might utilize the sale of proceeds from Barnett Shale to lower its outstanding debt level.The strategy to divest non-core assets is actually helping Devon Energy to concentrate on its high-margin oil production region. The company will in turn utilize the cash flow to lower its existing debts levels, and work to increase shareholders’ value through share buybacks and dividend growth. (Read more Devon Divests Non-Core Assets in Barnett for $533M)5.    Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) has agreed to divest 10% of its stake in the Shorouk concession, offshore Egypt, to a wholly owned subsidiary of Mubadala Investment Company, Mubadala Petroleum. Eni will generate about $934 million from this sale.Eni currently holds 60% stake in the Shorouk concession through its subsidiary, IEOC. Other partners are Rosneft and BP plc with the respective 30% and 10% interests in the concession. The transaction’s closure is subject to fulfillment of certain standard conditions including all essential authorizations from Egyptian authorities.The super-giant gas field of Zohr is also located at the Shorouk concession, producing 400 million standard cubic feet per day. It was brought online in December 2017 within 28 months after its discovery. The yield from Zohr is expected to eventually reach the plateau by the end of 2019. In 2018, Zohr is likely to add 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for Eni.The deal is in line with Eni’s dual exploration strategy, via which, the company seeks to farm out stakes in the fields it operates so as to raise cash for financing future development as well as meting out dividends.  (Read more Eni to Divest 10% in the Shorouk Concession for $934M)Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months.CompanyLast Week Last 6 MonthsXOM-0.9%-5.4%CVX+4.6%+3.8%COP+2.2%+21.9%OXY-3%+5.1%SLB+5.5%+2.5%RIG+2.2%+12.6%VLO+3.9%+32%ANDV+12.2%-3.3%In line with the week’s positive oil market sentiment, the Energy Select Sector SPDR – a popular way to track energy companies – generated a +2.7% return last week.

121,HES,"Crude mostly traded above the $100-per barrel mark before August 2014, arguably the most glorious days for energy explorers. This helped the upstream players rake in significant cash and reward investors handsomely. The healthy pricing scenario convinced U.S. shale players to ramp up production by utilizing new methods such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (or fracking).While major oil producers started ramping up crude production, the energy space changed from an oil deficit one to an oversupplied market which resulted in low oil prices. Even as oil is currently trading above the $55-a-barrel mark, the commodity price is way lower than the mid-2014 level.Along with OPEC’s production cut extension agreement, the tax reform bill will provide a breather to energy players.Senate & House Agree on 21% Corporate TaxThe Republicans in the Senate and House have decided to put the corporate tax rate at 21% instead of 20%, per the accord signed on Dec 13. Even after the slight bump up, the rate is way lower than the current 35%. Meanwhile, President Trump applauded the move and is content with the 21%.How Will the Energy Sector Benefit?The Energy sector has long been a major tax payer with a median tax rate of 36.8% for the last 11 years, as per the corporate tax calculator of MarketWatch. Over the same time frame, the average tax rate for the S&P 500 universe has been estimated at 30% by MarketWatch. Hence, energy companies in general have been losing money more than the majority of S&P 500 companies in the form of taxes.  To date, energy firms like Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report), ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report), Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) have paid high median effective annual tax rates of 49.9%, 46.9%, 45.5%, 42.6%, and 42.4%, respectively, per MarketWatch.Marathon Oil, Hess, Apache and Chevron carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while ConocoPhillips carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.With a 21% tax rate, oil and gas companies will definitely save a lot of money, which could be directed toward growth and maintenance projects.More DetailsEnergy companies invest significantly as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. For example, the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), has announced a $22-billion capital plan this year, while Chevron has set its capital spending budget for 2017 at around $20 billion.In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. Consequently, U.S. companies need to plan their capital expenditure judiciously. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately, as per the provisions of the tax reform bill. Naturally, this aspect of the bill hugely favors the oil industry.In the event of companies being able to deduct capital expenses in the year of their occurrence, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This will leave more cash in the hands of these companies which can be used to make capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

122,HES,"Oil refining and marketing giant Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) recently took a final call regarding retaining its retail network unit — Speedway LLC — as a fully-integrated business within the company. The company had been contemplating the spin-off of Speedway of late due to pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management Corporation. However, the company now plans to retain the convenience store based on a recommendation by an independent special committee.  Marathon Petroleum had been considering the spin-off to unlock shareholders value, streamline its portfolio and enhance core competencies. It had formed a special committee in January to assess the financial and strategic alternatives of Speedway. However, after a thorough review process, the members of the committee unanimously concluded that holding on to the Speedway unit will help in generating long-term returns for shareholders.Based in Ohio, Speedway is the second-largest gasoline and convenience store chain in the United States with around 2,730 stores across 21 states. The unit provides support to the company’s earnings in times of high volatility in commodity prices. Having Speedway integrated into its chain of business along with refining operations will lead to ample cost savings. Thus the committee believed that the Speedway spin-off would make the company vulnerable to industry downturns and lead to considerable loss of integration synergies.The committee estimated that the spin-off would cost Marathon Petroleum $270-$390 million per year and result into long-term deterioration in shareholders’ value. The move would also result in lower dividends and cash flows.Notably, the talks of Speedway spin-off deteriorated the company’s ratings in January when Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings downgraded the company to negative outlook and negative watch respectively. Given the unstable business environment, it’s important for Marathon Petroleum to maintain solid credit metrics to weather market downturns. The spin-off could have led to increased debt. Thus the decision to retain Speedway stores will position the company for long-term values to the shareholders.Speedway has been contributing to the company earnings significantly amid the changing dynamics of the oil industry. The segment contributed around 23% of the company's total earnings in 2016. In the recent quarter, income from the Speedway retail stations totaled $239 million, 24% higher than the $193 million earned in the year-ago period. The segment remains primed for solid earnings and growth on healthy merchandise margins. Speedway which is banking on its marketing enhancement opportunities and acquisition synergies, including the retail arm of Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report), is poised for growth and is expected to deliver a better performance as a separate entity in future.Marathon Petroleum is committed to accelerate long-term value for investors and is thus engaged in various share buyback programs and drop down transactions lately. The company recently announced that its board has authorized additional share buyback worth $1 billion. The company is likely to purchase $450 million of its shares by the end of the third quarter and additional $550 million by the year end.The decision is in line with the company’s value creation strategy of increasing capital return for shareholders.  Marathon Petroleum has already returned $1.55 billion capital to shareholders in the first half of 2017. The current share buyback program follows the drop down transaction announced by the company a few days back, when it divested some of its pipelines and storage assets worth $1.5 billion to MPLX LP (MPLX  -  Free Report). In March, the company divested of some of its terminal, pipeline and storage assets to MPLX for $2.02 billion.Zacks Rank and Key PickFindlay, OH-based Marathon Petroleum is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. Shares of Marathon Petroleum have gained 8% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 5% decline. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked player in the same industry is Galp Energia, SGPS, S.A.

123,HES,"CNX Resources Corporation (CNX  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered in an agreement with Ascent Resources-Utica, LLC to sell its 50% interest in Ohio Utica joint venture (JV) assets to the latter for $400 million. CNX Resources’ Utica shale JV was formed with Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) and the latter, in a separate agreement, decided to sell its 50% interest in the JV to Ascent Resources for $400 million.This company expects this transaction to close in the third quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and adjustments. CNX Resources has plans to utilize the sell proceeds to lower its outstanding debts and continue with ongoing share repurchase program. In addition, the company will try to expand acreage through acquisition, and invest in drilling and completion activities.The net annual production from the assets earmarked for sell to be nearly 31 Bcfe (billion cubic feet equivalent), resulting in EBITDAX of approximately $50 million.Revision in Guidance As a result of divestiture of its Utica Shale interest, CNX Resources expects 2018 production to decline 10 Bcfe at both ends and drop to 490-515 Bcfe. The company expects 2018 EBITAX to drop $15 million to a range of $810-$835 million compared with the prior guided range of $825-$850 million.For 2019 and 2020 each, CNX Resources expects divestiture of Utica Shale interest to lower total production volume by 20-25 Bcfe and adjusted EBITDAX by $25-$35 million.Looking AheadCNX Resources’ divestiture of Ohio Utica Shale interest will result in increasing focus on its Marcellus Shale holding. However, the company will retain some interest in Southwest and Central Pennsylvania in the Utica Shale.The sell of assets will allow the company to continue with share buyback program and thereby increase the value of its shareholders. CNX Resources has nearly $250 million remaining on its $450 million share repurchase authorization for 2018.Future of Natural GasDemand and usage of natural gas is rising in the United States due to its clean burning nature, low price and wide availability in the country. A release from U.S. Energy information Administration (EIA) indicates that total consumption of natural gas will increase 7.2% year over year to 79.57 billion cubic feet per day in 2018.CNX Resources will gain from increased usage of natural gas. The enhanced usage will also create opportunity for further growth of Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK  -  Free Report) and Southwestern Energy Company (SWN  -  Free Report), among other natural gas producers in the space.Price MovementIn the past six months, CNX Resources’ shares have gained 16.7%, outperforming its industry’s growth of 3.9%.Zacks RankCNX Resources Corporation currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

124,HES,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output rose 2.1% in September after climbing 3.5% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (""DMR"") latest data said that oil production in September averaged 1,107,104 barrels a day, up 22,414 barrels a day from August.Record Number of Producing WellsReflecting a healthy increase and trumping expectations, the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation. As daily output consolidated above 1 million barrels for the eighth month in a row, the state’s total number of producing wells numbered 14,190 at the end of September, a new all-time high.Despite the Increase, Production is a Shadow of Earlier HighsChurning out as high as 1,227,483 barrels/day in December 2014, the current production statistics highlight oil’s horror show that has seen prices come down from $110 per barrel in mid-2014 to around $55 now, in between falling to a 12-year low of $26.21 in February 2016. The commodity’s collapse has fueled spending cuts and layoffs while threatening the industry’s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows, drying up liquidity and narrowing profit margins.Rig Count Clawing Back SteadilySome 56 drilling rigs were active in the state in September, flat from the August count. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 34 rigs operating. A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the steady rise in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates increase in drilling activities and essentially steady production. Notwithstanding recent gains, the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling.Shale Industry Adjusting to $50 OilMore rigs in operation and stable production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota, but also points to the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers (in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.What Lies Ahead?The U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark hit a more than two-year high of $57 recently. Also, we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being. While we do not rule out chances for short-term pullbacks on oversupply concerns and a stronger U.S. dollar, we remain extremely confident of a bull run in the near future.In this context, the improvement in North Dakota’s September production bode well for the region. With oil prices likely to head higher, the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being.Dakota Access Pipeline: Can It Increase Production Further?Apart from the strength in crude prices, there is another factor that might speed up Bakken output growth – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners L.P.’s (ETP  -  Free Report) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration. As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor brought the controversial conduit online in early June.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 78% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% earlier in 2017 to less than 10%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 500,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Permian Basin.This, industry observers hope, will support the increase in Bakken output and help producers like Continental Resources Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report), Whiting Petroleum Corp. (WLL  -  Free Report), EOG Resources Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report), Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report).Want to Own a North Dakota Play Now?If you are looking for a near term North Dakota play, Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report) may be a good selection.

125,HES,"Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) announced a new share repurchase plan after receiving authorization from its board of directors. Through 2018, the explorer will likely buy back shares worth $1 billion.Late 2017, the company declared a $500-million stock buyback plan. The recent announcement reflects the firm’s strong commitment toward returning cash back to stock holders on a regular basis.The business scenario has improved owing to the partial recovery in crude. From the historical low-mark of $26.21 per barrel touched in February 2016, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude crossed the $60 psychological level. A rally in oil price is highly favorable for key upstream energy players like Hess.The company foresees higher oil and gas production which when combined with healthy oil prices will likely boost cashflow. Hess added that with the new buyback program, it will not compromise with its potential to invest in key developments like Guyana and Bakken. Earlier, the company had announced that majority of its 2018 capital budget will likely get allotted toward low-cost resources in Bakken and projects located off the coast of Guyana.Overall, with the robust business outlook, the management might think the company’s shares are undervalued and hence is the right time to boost share buyback.Headquartered in New York, Hess is a leading explorer with a solid balance sheet. Through 2017, the company’s cash balance surged 77.4%, while long term debt contracted 4.4%.However, the company’s pricing chart is unimpressive. Over the past year, the stock has lost 3.5%, against the industry’s 4.3% gain. Hess carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The reported figure was substantially wider that the loss of $1.29 in the year-ago quarter attributed to the plunge in gas prices.Revenues plunged more than 3% year over year to $1,228 million from $1,269 million. However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,192 million. Second-Quarter Operational PerformanceIn the reported quarter, the company’s Exploration and Production (E&P) business incurred adjusted loss of $354 million, narrower than the year-earlier loss of $328 million.Quarterly hydrocarbon production totaled 300 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), down 4.2% year over year.Crude oil production was 177 thousand barrels per day compared with 179 thousand barrels per day in the year-ago quarter.

130,HES,"Digesting a bunch of recent events and guessing which way ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) is going can be tricky for investors. However, there is an easy way to understand how the events are going to shape the company's future.Streamlining Assets The company's divestment portfolio recently included its stakes in the Scarborough gas field offshore Western Australia and Terra Nova oil project offshore Canada. It gives the company an opportunity to look for better prospects. It will increase the company’s profitability ratios, which is already much higher than the industry.Investors should know that Exxon Mobil’s plan to divest the risky offshore operations reflects strong focus on growth projects. In fact, the integrated energy player divested $3.1 billion worth assets during 2017.With a stable cash position, the company’s balance sheet is one of the best in the industry. Apart from shale production, the company is currently concentrating on projects in Papua New Guinea, Guyana and others, where production is highly profitable and can bring higher returns.However, the $19 billion Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas (LNG) project has witnessed a setback recently due to an earthquake in the area. ExxonMobil is now assessing the damages at the site, which will help to determine when production can be revived.New DiscoveryExxonMobil's oil and gas reserves grew 19% in 2017. The company is adding more to the reserves with new terrific discoveries. Recently, it made its seventh oil discovery offshore Guyana. The company found around 20 meters of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoir in the Stabroek Block. The company plans to develop the new well Pacora-1 in conjunction with the Payara field. The latest addition is expected to push the company's production in Guyana above the 500,000 barrels per day (BPD) mark. ExxonMobil (45% interest) is the major stakeholder in the project with Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) and CNOOC Limited (CEO  -  Free Report) as partners holding 30% and 25% stake, respectively.Abiding by the SanctionsMore secure production possibilities are putting ExxonMobil in a comfortable place where it can let go of the oil-rich Russian Arctic. Following the U.S. and European sanctions against Russia, the company decided to pull out of a joint venture (JV) with Rosneft, which is controlled by the Moscow government. Although this move can make ExxonMobil incur an after-tax loss of around $200 million, it can hardly affect the oil behemoth that earned $19,710 million profit in 2017.Other Government DecisionsThe U.S tax reform has left $7.1 billion non-cash positive impact on the company’s 2017 results. It has also helped the company to make a huge decision. ExxonMobil will spend around $50 billion in the United States over the coming five years. However, the recent steel tariff proposed by the government may spoil the spirit a bit. A 25% tariff on imported steel can increase costs, which can potentially impact the company’s refinery expansion plans, according to Reuters.Stanford Strategic Energy AllianceAll the moves from ExxonMobil stated above show that the company is reasoning for the long term. Every step the company is taking will prove beneficial in the future. ExxonMobil becoming one of the founding members of the Stanford Strategic Energy Alliance, along with the Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), is another positive. The program has the objective of improving the global energy infrastructure, which can help it to become more sustainable, affordable and secured. The largest publicly traded energy company, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), will provide $20 million over the next five years in the program. Through research and development, ExxonMobil expects to find lower-carbon energy solutions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price PerformanceExxonMobil has lost 8.8% in the last year against 6.1% rise witnessed by the industry it belongs to.About the CompanyIrving, TX-based ExxonMobil is the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas firm. The company has a leading position in the energy industry owing to the size and diversity of its asset base, both in terms of business mix and geographical footprint. It has three operating segments: Upstream, Downstream and Chemical.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read This The most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more. Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk. Bitcoin sank 25% or more 3 times in 2017.Zacks has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.See 4 crypto-related stocks now >>

131,HES,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output fell 1.3% in December after climbing 1.1% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (""DMR"") latest data said that oil production in December averaged 1,181,319 barrels a day, down 15,657 barrels a day from November.With crude, natural gas output came down too – from November’s record 2,096,440 thousand cubic feet per day to 2,081,522 thousand cubic feet per day. North Dakota’s total number of producing wells numbered 14,293 at the end of December, again down marginally from the previous month’s all-time high of 14,338.While the slight drop in oil activity – primarily attributed to winter weather – is the first month-over-month production decrease since July, daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the eleventh month in a row. Therefore, notwithstanding the temporary blip, the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation.Rig Count Clawing Back SteadilySome 52 drilling rigs were active in the state in December. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 40 rigs operating. A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the year-over-year improvement in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates essentially rebounding drilling activities and production. However, the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling.Shale Industry Adjusting to New Oil RealityMore rigs in operation and stable production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota, but also points to the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers (in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50-$60 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.What Lies Ahead?The U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark hit a more than three-year high of around $66 recently. Also, we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being. While we do not rule out chances for short-term pullbacks on oversupply concerns and a stronger U.S. dollar, we remain extremely confident of a bull run in the near future.In this context, the steady recovery in North Dakota’s production bode well for the region. With oil prices likely to head higher, the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being.Dakota Access Pipeline Set to Increase Production FurtherApart from the strength in crude prices, there is another factor that might speed up Bakken output growth – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners’ (ETP  -  Free Report) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration. As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor brought the controversial conduit online in early June 2017.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 787 of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% in the early part of 2017 to less than 10%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 520,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Permian Basin.The geographically constrained Bakken Shale's crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets. As expected, the pipeline, where energy majors like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) have invested, has helped to improve the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators and benefit the state financially.Products from companies like Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report),  and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) were among the first to reach the international markets (China and Netherlands), with the help of Dakota Access.Overall, rebounding oil prices, together with the start of the Dakota Access Pipeline, are expected to support further increase in Bakken output by providing the companies a chance to push their produce outward at a lower cost.With the current operators planning to put more rigs to work in the second and third quarters of 2018 amid a conducive oil pricing environment, the state’s output is expected to break the all-time high record of 1,227,483 barrels/day sometime in the next few months.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

132,HES,"Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) recently provided a sneak peek into its business strategies, including a stock buyback plan and debt-reduction initiatives. At the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2017 Global Energy Conference, the upstream energy player announced its intention to buy back up to $500 million shares within 2018. With this, the company will be able to return significant cash to its shareholders.Hess is also planning to strengthen its balance sheet by lowering debts by $500 million. On top of that, the company will likely increase the rig count from four to six for the development of the Bakken play. In the play, Hess has prospective drilling areas that will boost the company’s production over the long haul.  During 2018, Hess is expected to prefund lucrative crude projects at the Stabroek Block, located off the coast of Guyana. The company estimated the gross recoverable resources from the block at 2.25-2.75 billion barrels of oil equivalent.Investors should know that the company is planning to utilize the proceeds from asset divestment programs for financing these developments. During 2017, Hess will likely gain as much as $3.4 billion from divesting mature, non-core and less profitable properties.New York-based Hess is among the leading producers of crude in the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota. The company has interests in the best areas of the plays. With crude prices trading above $50-a-barrel mark, we believe that the Bakken play will contribute to production growth in the long run.However, Hess’ stock has underperformed the industry year to date. During the aforesaid period, the stock has lost 29.3%, underperforming the industry’s 10.3% decline.Presently, Hess carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), signifying that the stock will perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.A few better-ranked players in the energy space are ExxonMobil Corp.

137,HES,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded its biggest drop since Sep on continued strong refinery runs. With oil supplies falling for the seventh week, investor sentiment has turned slightly positive on dissipating fears about a meltdown to sub-$40 levels. Analysts also believe that the trend, if sustained, could help tighten the market significantly.However, the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was more than offset by the steadily rising domestic oil output that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. At 9.502 million barrels a day, production is at the highest level in more than two years, thereby cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies. Surprise builds in refined product inventories – gasoline and distillate – added to the pessimism.As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures shed 1.6% (or 77 cents) to $46.78 per barrel Wednesday.Investors Dump Energy StocksThe federal data sparked widespread selling in energy stocks, which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – down almost 1% Wednesday.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) were down 0.7%. Meanwhile, some of the biggest casualties of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report) and Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories slumped by 8.95 million barrels for the week ending August 11, 2017, following a decline of 6.45 million barrels in the previous week.The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 3.6 million barrels. Continued strength in refinery crude runs led to the massive stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production rose to the highest level since Jul 2015.The seventeenth inventory reduction in 19 weeks has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. Nevertheless, U.S. still remains awash with excess oil. At 466.49 million barrels, current crude supplies are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up a second week (this time by 678,000 barrels) to 57.05 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 27.4 days in the previous week to 26.7 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.2 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the second successive week as demand weakened. The nominal 22,000 barrels addition – contrary to the polled number of 400,000 barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 231.13 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 0.7% below the year-earlier level but is close to the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went up by 702,000 barrels last week, as opposed to analysts’ expectations for 700,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The first weekly rise in five weeks could be attributed to fall in demand.

The top line also improved from $5,575 million in the year-ago quarter.  Higher realized prices from commodities sold primarily led to the strong Q2 numbers. Production ramp up from numerous key developments also supported the numbers.Exploration and ProductionProduction from continuing operations averaged 1,437 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) in the quarter, as compared with 1,546 MBOED in the year-ago quarter. The decline was led by field decline, which was negated partially by production ramp up from numerous key developments.Price RealizationAverage realized price for oil was $48.16 per barrel, compared with $42.72 in the year-earlier quarter. Natural gas liquids were sold at $20.99 a barrel versus $16.55 a year ago.

It seems that ConocoPhillips is following the likes of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) in this regard.Zacks Rank & Key PickConocoPhillips currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

140,HES,"North American energy firm The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 15 cents per share missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents. Higher impairment charges incurred during the quarter along with unfavorable changes in the income tax provision led to the weaker-than-expected results.Further, the bottom line also deteriorated from the prior-year figure of 20 cents per share. This was mainly due to the absence of gains associated with the Geismar olefins facility which was divested on Jul 6.  Higher costs and lower adjusted profit from William Partners L.P. (WPZ  -  Free Report) also led to lower year-over-year earnings.For the quarter ended Sep 30, 2017, Williams Companies reported revenues of $1,891 million, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,825 million. However, revenues decreased from the year-ago quarter figure of $1,905 million.  Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Williams Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteSegmental AnalysisWilliams Partners: This segment reported adjusted operating profit of $1,101 million, down 7.4% from $1,189 million in the year-ago quarter. Unfavorable impacts from the disruptive hurricanes along with the absence of results from the Geismar facility and higher costs led to weaker results. Other: The segment posted adjusted operating profit of $12 million compared with the year-ago profit of $3 million. Results were mainly driven by the absence of unfavorable results from certain former Canadian operations which were offloaded in September 2016.Expenses SummaryThe total cost and expenses increased 3.5% to $1,614 million in the reported quarter compared with $1,560 million in the prior-year quarter. Increased costs were primarily driven by higher impairment charges of $1,210 million incurred in the reported quarter as against $1 million in the third quarter of 2016. However, this was mainly offset by $1,095 million gain on sale of Geismar facility.Further, operating and maintenance costs (O&M) and product costs also rose in the quarter under review.Capital Expenditure & Balance SheetDuring the reported quarter, Williams Companies’ capital expenditure was $644 million. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of 1,172 million, as against $77 million in the year ago quarter.

141,HES,"ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) recently announced that its oil and gas reserves grew 19% in 2017 owing to growth in several places like the U.S. shale, the United Arab Emirates and Guyana. ExxonMobil reported its reserve update following its fourth-quarter earnings, which failed to meet expectations. In 2017, the company added 2.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) to its reserves, which marks 183% production replacement. It brings the company's total proved reserves to 21.2 billion BOE. ExxonMobil believes that the proved reserves hold significant development opportunities, which can grow shareholder value in the coming years. Of the total proved reserves, 57% was liquids, which increased by 4% from 53% in 2016. At the current production rate of the company, its reserves are expected to last for 14 years. The company, with higher profitability ratios and lower leverage than the industry, is poised to yield higher values in the long run. ExxonMobil spent more than $6 billion in 2017 to increase its presence in the Permian Basin. The company added more than 800 million BOE to its reserves in the basin. The Upper Zakum field in the United Arab Emirates contributed another 800 million BOE. The company's Guyana assets provided proved reserves of 3.2 billion BOE, where it is partnering with Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) and others.We note that ExxonMobil had reduced its proved reserves in 2016 by 3.3 billion BOE, most of which was due to the writedowns of the Canadian oil sands assets' value in the low crude-price environment. The current rebound in oil prices has made some of those devalued assets profitable for the company. It provided ExxonMobil 900 million BOE of proved reserves. The company's press release stated, ""ExxonMobil’s resource base totaled approximately 97 billion oil-equivalent barrels at year-end 2017, taking into account field revisions, production and asset sales.""About the CompanyIrving, TX-based ExxonMobil is the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas firm.

149,HES,"Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 5.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 17.05%. Moreover, Hess reported an average positive earnings surprise of 3.91% for the last four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s take a look at the estimate revision trend for Hess to gain a clear picture of what analysts think about the company's fourth-quarter release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 84 cents for the fourth quarter has seen three upward and three downward revisions in the last 30 days. This reflects  year-over-year improvement of about 16.8% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of $1,294 million for the fourth quarter, down 6.83% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for average worldwide realized price of oil (including hedging) is $53 per barrel, up from $46.97 in the last quarter and $45.97 in the year-ago quarter.Analysts polled by Zacks expect average worldwide realized natural gas price to rise 19.4% from the preceding quarter and 23.5% from the year-ago quarter to $4 per million cubic feet (mmcf).Analysts polled by Zacks expect average worldwide realized natural gas liquids price to rise 14.5% from the preceding quarter and 34.3% from the year-ago quarter to $19.72 per barrel. The positivity in the oil and gas prices will benefit upstream players like Hess.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for oil production per day is 162 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d), down from 176 Mboe/d in the preceding quarter and 186 Mboe/d in the year-ago quarter.Analysts polled by Zacks expect natural gas production per day of 565 mcf, up from 552 mcf in the preceding quarter and 512 mcf from the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for natural gas liquids production per day is 40.8 Mboe/d, down from 43 Mboe/d in the preceding quarter but up from 40 Mboe/d in the year-ago quarter.Oil production is anticipated to decline, while gas production is expected to increase.

150,HES,"GoPro, Inc. (GPRO  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results, after the closing bell on Feb 1.The company has had a decent earnings history, having beaten estimates each time over the trailing four quarters. Last quarter, GoPro reported adjusted earnings of 15 cents per share, far ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate which was at breakeven level.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderEarlier this month, GoPro released a profit warning ahead of fourth-quarter 2017 earnings results. The company lowered its projected revenues for the critical holiday season to about $340 million, marking it as its worst holiday quarter since the company went public. This marks a significant slump from an already disappointing previous sales projection of $470 million.Also, it represents a 37% year-over-year sales plunge in the key holiday quarter, and is behind the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $384 million. The company stated that its revenues took a hit of about $80 million due to discounting for its Karma drones, as well as the Hero line of cameras, during the holiday quarter.The company also decided to abandon its drone business and slash 20% of workforce after a witnessing sub-standard holiday quarter. Karma has been a roller-coaster ride for the company, punctuated mostly by lows rather than highs. Karma was facing mounting margin challenges in a tremendously competitive aerial market, even as a hostile regulatory environment in Europe and the United States severely limited its total addressable market. The failure of this unit will likely have a deep depressing impact on GoPro’s upcoming financials.Further, the company stated that it saw soft demand for the flagship HERO 5 cameras at the beginning of the holiday quarter. This would also hamper the top line for the quarter under review. Additionally, the company was forced to offer the cameras at discounted prices to shore up sales, which would also put pressure on margins, consequently.With this major fourth-quarter revenue shortfall, the company’s full-year growth is in serious jeopardy. In addition, GAAP losses might result in additional cash burn, further weakening the company's balance sheet.Not surprisingly, the company’s stock has had a dismal run on the bourse — having depreciated 31.4% over the past one year — in stark contrast to the industry’s average position return of 20.2%. GPRO is playing in a brutally competitive market, and has not been able to hold its own against camera makers such as Nikon, Olympus, and Canon, as well as electronic players, including Samsung, Panasonic, and Sony. Its market share has been continuously threatened by lower-cost alternatives from Sony, Xiaomi, Garmin and HTC. The result has been consistent — sharp revenue and earnings declines in the last couple of years — and this quarter is expected to fare no better.In light of the recent dreadful developments at the company, the analysts’ community has become increasingly bearish on the stock, with the company’s estimates plunging headlong over the past month. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has nosedived from earnings of 4 cents to a loss of 50 cents over the past month, highlighting acutely negative expectations from the company.GoPro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise GoPro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | GoPro, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that GoPro will likely beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

153,HES,"This is a big week for earnings, with over 800 companies expected to report. Included in that big group is a handful of energy stocks.This group has been out-of-favor with investors for over 2 years and the earnings picture hasn’t looked great either thanks to a reduction in oil production.But not all energy companies are created the same. Some are being impacted by lower oil prices while others are not.Which energy companies have the best earnings charts this week?And which should you be watching for the best read on what is happening in the sector?5 Top Energy Earnings Charts 1.    Hess (HES  -  Free Report) is an E&P which gets about half of its revenue from the US and half from international. Shares have sunk near 5-year lows as the price of oil continues to be at multi-year lows. It’s coming off a miss last quarter.2.    ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) has actually beat 3 out of the last 4 quarters which has been hard to do for the big E&P companies. But much like Hess, shares are still near multi-year lows.3.    Valero (VLO  -  Free Report) has only missed twice in the last 5 years. That’s an impressive track record for ANY company. Valero is the largest US refiner and also owns over 7,000 service stations. Shares are at new 5-year highs. Maybe energy stocks aren’t so bad after all?4.    ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) has a great track record of beating, with just 4 misses in the last 5 years. During the oil price plunge, it has gotten a boost from its petrochemical and refining divisions. Will that still hold for the rest of 2017?5.    Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) shares are well off their 2015 lows even though it has missed more than it has beat on earnings. Still, investors have found comfort in Chevron’s large dividend, which is currently yielding 3.6% even as shares are trading near 1-year highs.Want to Learn How to Trade Options?Have you always wanted to trade stock options but are unsure where to begin or what to look for?Each week, Zacks’ Dave Bartosiak will bring you a detailed explanation of the trades “live” on YouTube.Watch him go through the trade as he answers your questions in real time.Become one of Dave’s minions.

154,HES,"Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report), a global exploration and production (E&P) company, is expected to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 26, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company had delivered an impressive 2.73% positive earnings surprise, courtesy of an uptick in oil prices. Also, Hess has an average positive earnings surprise of 8.23% for the last four quarters.  Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider This QuarterSince the beginning of 2014, long-term debt load has been on the rise. Our proprietary model shows that from 2014 to 2016, the company’s long-term debt increased from nearly $5,500 million to almost $6,700 million.Also, net cash flow from operations has been declining steadily over the last three years, reflecting weak operations owing to persistently low commodity prices.  Oil and gas prices have been low for almost three years now and during second-quarter 2017, the prices of both the commodities deteriorated further. The prolonged weakness can be attributed to the supply glut in the commodity market. During the second quarter of 2017, oil and natural gas prices fell 8.4% and 5%, respectively. Hence, the OPEC’s historical production cut extension deal until Mar 2018 has failed to drive oil.This development is not favorable for explorers like Hess as the company’s cashflow might get affected further.Price Movement in Q2Hess has lost 9% in the April-to-June quarter versus the 9.5% decline of the industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show a beat for Hess this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -2.50%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of $1.23, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of $1.20. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Hess carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Please note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the energy space which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP (BWP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.90% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report), has an Earnings ESP of + 7.84% and a Zacks Rank #1.C&J Energy Services Inc. (CJ  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +100.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

155,HES,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output fell 1.1% in March after edging down 0.4% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (‘DMR’) latest data said that oil production in March averaged 1,162,071 barrels a day, down 13,245 barrels a day from February.But unlike crude, natural gas output went up – from February’s 2,106,121 thousand cubic feet per day to 2,116,294 thousand cubic feet per day – a new all-time high. As operators scramble to the core areas of the Bakken, wells here tend to produce more gas along with crude (present gas flare rate of around 12%).Record Number of Producing WellsMeanwhile, North Dakota’s total number of producing wells numbered 14,457 at the end of March, the highest on record.While the slight drop in oil activity – primarily attributed to windy weather – is the fourth month-over-month production decrease in a row, daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the fourteenth month.Therefore, notwithstanding the temporary blip, the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation.Rig Count ImprovesSome 59 drilling rigs were active in the state in March, up two from the February average. The drilling rig count increased further to 60 in April. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 46 rigs operating.A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the improvement in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates rebounding drilling activities and production. Going by the outlook of crude producers, seven to ten more rigs are likely to join the fleet by the end of this year. Though the current rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling, one must note that sophisticated drilling rigs have enabled producers to get more oil out of each well. In other words, modern rigs have helped boost the per-unit output.Shale Industry Adjusts to the New RealityMore rigs in operation and stable production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota, but also points to the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers (in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50-$60 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.Crude Prices on a Steady Climb UpwardThe U.S. West Texas Intermediate benchmark hit a three-and-half-year high of $72.24 recently. Also, we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being. While we do not rule out chances for short-term pullbacks on surging domestic production and a stronger U.S. dollar, we remain extremely confident of an extended period of gains in the near future.In this context, the steady recovery in North Dakota’s production bode well for the region. With oil prices likely to head higher, the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being.Dakota Access Pipeline Increased Takeaway CapacityApart from the strength in crude prices, there is another factor that is set speed up Bakken output growth – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners’ (ETP  -  Free Report) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration.As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor – carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) – brought the controversial conduit online in early June 2017. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 73% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% in the early part of 2017 to some 17%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 520,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Permian Basin.The geographically constrained Bakken Shale's crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets. As expected, the pipeline, where energy majors like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp.

157,HES,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output rose 0.9% in November after climbing 6.9% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (""DMR"") latest data said that oil production in November averaged 1,194,920 barrels a day, up 11,110 barrels a day from October.Record Number of Producing WellsReflecting a healthy increase, the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation. As daily output consolidated above 1 million barrels for the tenth month in a row, the state’s total number of producing wells numbered 14,324 at the end of November, a new all-time high.Interestingly, natural gas output was up 1.4% in November to 2,095,342 thousand cubic feet per day – another record – as operators scrambled to the core areas of the Bakken where wells tend to produce more gas along with crude.Rig Count Clawing Back SteadilySome 54 drilling rigs were active in the state in November. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 37 rigs operating. A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the year-over-year improvement in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates essentially steady drilling activities and production. However, the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling.Shale Industry Adjusting to ‘Low’ OilMore rigs in operation and stable production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota, but also points to the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers (in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50-$60 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.What Lies Ahead?The U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark hit a more than three-year high of $65.61 recently. Also, we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being. While we do not rule out chances for short-term pullbacks on oversupply concerns and a stronger U.S. dollar, we remain extremely confident of a bull run in the near future.In this context, the improvement in North Dakota’s November production bode well for the region. With oil prices likely to head higher, the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being.Dakota Access Pipeline Set to Increase Production FurtherApart from the strength in crude prices, there is another factor that might speed up Bakken output growth – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners’ (ETP  -  Free Report) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration. As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor brought the controversial conduit online in early June.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 78% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% in the early part of 2017 to less than 10%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 520,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Permian Basin.The geographically constrained Bakken Shale's crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets. As expected, the pipeline, where energy majors like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) have invested, has helped to improve the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators and benefit the state financially.Products from companies like Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report),  and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) were among the first to reach the international markets (China and Netherlands), with the help of Dakota Access.Overall, rebounding oil prices, together with the start of the Dakota Access Pipeline, are expected to support further increase in Bakken output by providing the companies a chance to push their produce outward at a lower cost.With the latest monthly production attaining highest levels since July 2015, Lynn Helms – the director of DMR – feels that a conducive oil pricing environment is likely push the state’s output beyond the all-time high of 1,227,483 barrels/day sometime in the first half of 2018.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

158,HES,"Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 31.The company has a dreadful earnings history, with repeated, colossal earnings misses. Last quarter, the company missed estimates for the seventh consecutive quarter, recording a massive negative surprise of 700%. Ericsson witnessed an average negative surprise of 449.1% for the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement and whether Ericsson is set to add yet another earnings miss to its losing streak.Factors to ConsiderEricsson is in the midst of its worst crisis in a decade, grappling with shrinking markets and stiff competition from China's Huawei and Finland's Nokia. Slowdown in spending by wireless carriers severely hurt the company’s financials over the past few quarters and is expected to hurt the fourth-quarter results as well.Most of the company’s troubles have stemmed from drying-up investments by major telecom equipment makers across the world. Particularly, uncertainty in the financial markets, reduced consumer telecom spending and delayed auctions of spectrums pose significant threats for Ericsson. The company’s revenues and margins in the Networks and IT & Cloud segments continue to take a grave beating from adverse industry trends, which are expected to reflect in the upcoming results as well.Further, Ericsson foresees sustained weakness in the market for radio access networks to continue. Network equipment sales, particularly in the North America and Europe markets, continue to contract. Europe and Latin America — the markets with the biggest impact — are likely to have an increasingly challenging investment environment in the quarters to come.Particularly, straight quarters of revenue declines and contract losses in Italy and Russia have made matters worse for Ericsson. This trend is unlikely to reverse itself in the to-be-reported quarter, thus thwarting profitability and sales.Ericsson Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ericsson Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ericsson QuoteSoft mobile broadband demand and slowdown in emerging markets will continue to put a significant dent in Ericsson’s performance. These factors will likely manifest in the company’s sales in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, Ericsson expects the industry trends and business mix in mobile broadband to prevail this year as well.We believe the only potential upside to earnings in the near future depends mostly on expense management. Ericsson had earlier announced a restructuring plan to cut costs and streamline the company’s focus areas, as well as explore options for the media business.Just last week, Ericsson announced that it is undertaking another colossal write-down by booking charges roughly amounting to a whopping $1.8 billion.The company will write off assets worth SEK 14.2 billion ($1.77 billion) and another SEK 1 billion ($125 million) non-cash charge will be booked due to the recent U.S. tax reform. Ericsson noted that the charges will not impact cash flow but would affect operating profit in the upcoming quarterly results.Despite these challenges, Ericsson remains the world’s largest supplier of LTE technology, with a significant market share and has established a large number of LTE networks worldwide. Also, the Ericsson-Cisco partnership, which has been shaping up well ever since its inception in November 2015, is winning Ericsson lucrative awards, which should positively impact the upcoming quarterly results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ericsson will likely beat on earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

The company has a consistent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 2.6% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What’s Driving Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Danaher has successfully positioned itself as a healthcare company, broadening its presence in the healthcare and dental markets. Potential prospects in the pharma and clinical end-markets bode well for the company in the upcoming quarters. Further, Danaher’s robust biopharma business should prove conducive to operating profit and bottom line in the fourth quarter.The company has had an impressive 2017, delivering core growth acceleration, operating margin expansion as well as double-digit growth in earnings. Moreover, the company’s recent acquisitions continue to perform impressively, which have helped it improve productivity and drive growth.

161,HES,"Pipeline operator Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) recently announced that it is planning to restart operations at its Garden Banks gas pipeline in early February. The 1 billion cubic foot per day (Bcf/d) pipeline will begin operations for some producers.The pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico was shut down following a fire outbreak on Nov 8, 2017.  The incident resulted in stalling of operations on most of the platforms in the region, including Enchilada and Salsa platforms, operated by Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) and the Baldpate and Conger filed platforms, operated by Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report). Enbridge is separating its pipeline from the damaged platform Enchilada and expects to finish the task by the coming month. Production at the site was disrupted due to the unavailability of pipeline. Both Shell and Hess are yet to provide dates for restarting operations at the site.The Garden Banks pipeline connects Garden Banks block 128 to South Marsh Island block 76 and then interconnects with four existing interstate pipelines, from where it transports gas onshore.Per the forecasts of the Energy Information Administration, oil production level in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to be flat in 2018 year over year. From 2019 onward, production in the region is expected to rise as seven new projects will come online.About Enbridge Headquartered in Calgary, Alberta in Canada, Enbridge is a leading energy infrastructure company. One of its businesses is the transportation of energy through the most extensive and advanced crude and liquids pipeline system that spreads across 17,511 miles globally. Through the Mainline and Express pipelines, the company transports 2.8 million barrels of crude every day, which accounts for almost 68% of the Canadian crude oil production that is transported to the United States.We appreciate Enbridge raising its quarterly dividend every year. The new dividend of 67.1 Canadian cents represents a sequential increase of 10%, will likely be paid on Mar 1, 2018, to stockholders of record as of Feb 15, 2018.However, in the recent times, the company’s debt load has increased significantly. Importantly, during the first nine months of 2017, long-term debt rose more than 77% while cash balance declined 59%, reflecting weak financials.In addition, Enbridge has lost 8.2% in the last year against 1.5% gain of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderEnbridge Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the oil and energy sector is Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

162,HES,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Hessis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for HES in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of $1.27 per share for HES, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.29 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for HES, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.52% heading into earnings season.Hess Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Hess Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Hess Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that HES has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

163,HES,"Upstream energy player, Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 25.Last quarter, the company delivered a negativeearnings surprise of 10.61%. However, Hess delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2.60% for the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement. Hess Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Hess Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Hess Corporation QuoteWhich Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.29 for the third quarter has seen five upward revisions and two downward revisions by firms in the last thirty days. It reflects a year-over-year decline of about 15.2% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,284 million for the impending quarter, up7.4% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderHess is among the leading producers of crude in the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota. The company has interests in the best areas of the play. With crude prices improving after OPEC decided to curb output, we believe that Bakken play should contribute to the company’s production growth in the long run. Moreover, new output from Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia could add considerably to the company’s output. These are likely to be reflected in this quarter’s results.Analysts polled by Zacks expect average realized oil price to rise 1% from the preceding quarter to $48.86 per barrel. The positivity in the oil prices will benefit upstream players like Hess.However, since the beginning of 2014, long-term debt load has been on the rise. Our proprietary model shows that from 2014 to 2016, the company’s long-term debt increased from nearly $5,500 million to almost $6,700 million.Also, net cash flow from operations has been declining steadily over the last three years, reflecting weak operations owing to persisting low commodity prices.  Price Performance in Q3During the quarter, Hess has underperformed the industry. The stock has gained 6.9% compared with the industry's growth of 9.1%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Hess is likely to beat on earnings this time because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.52%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of a loss of $1.27 comes below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.29. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Hess carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating on earnings. The combination of Hess’ favorable Zacks Rank and Earnings ESP makes us confident about an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Stocks to ConsiderHere are other firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Noble Midstream Partners LP (NBLX  -  Free Report), headquartered in Houston, TX, has diversified energy infrastructure properties.The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.91% and flaunts a Zacks Rank #1.

The first week of 2018 saw U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest closing since December 2014. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another higher-than-expected weekly draw.On a further bullish note, political turmoil in Iran has raised the specter of production disruption in OPEC’s third-biggest producer. Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs falling for a second straight week helped cement those gains.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 31 of the last 39 weeks and are down almost 109 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 424.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 11.4% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2014.Meanwhile, natural gas – one of 2017’s worst-performing commodities – registered another drop following a below-average decrease in supplies. Forecasts of an end to the harsh cold snap and the resultant dip in heating demand added to the bearish sentiment, bringing prices down sharply.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Hess announced that the sixth oil discovery — Ranger-1 exploration well — since 2015 in the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, was a success.The five world class discoveries in the block — Liza, Payara, Snoek, Liza Deep and Turbot —are projected to have total recoverable resources of over 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Further, resources related with the Ranger-1 discovery will raise this estimate.The drilling of the Ranger-1 well was started by partner ExxonMobil Corporation’s associate Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Ltd. on Nov 5, 2017. It hit about 230 feet (70 meters) of high-quality, oil-bearing carbonate reservoir. The well was drilled to a total depth of 21,161 feet (6,450 meters) in water depth of 8,973 feet (2,735 meters). ExxonMobil, the operator of Stabroek Block, holds 45%, while Hess and CNOOC Nexen Petroleum Guyana Limited hold 30% and 25%, respectively.The discovery further validates the significant potential of Guyana. This is likely to attract other oil giants to boost financial returns and create significant value for shareholders.

The payout marks the biggest such payment in the United States by a foreign entity and one of the largest securities class action settlements in the U.S. history. The settlement seeks to put to rest one of Brazil's most notorious cases of fraud.The Brazilian oil giant was at the heart of the massive corruption scandal -- dubbed ""Operation Carwash"" -- which incriminated other industries like banks, construction firms and shipyards along with high-level politicians. Various lawsuits were filed against Petrobras by shareholders to recoup losses triggered by money laundering and bribery schemes.Many senior executives of the company were accused of taking bribes for inflated contract schemes. Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was also charged with corruption and sentenced to an imprisonment term of nearly 10 years. Charges were also pressed against the current President Michael Temer in May 2017, shaking the nation, following which the Brazilian Real fell hard against the dollar -- its worst since the global financial crisis in 2008.Petrobras' involvement in the multibillion dollar corruption case was a major overhang for the company which scarred its credit metrics and turned it into the world's most indebted oil company. The settlement deal comes days after Brazil's securities regulator indicted eight more executives of Petrobras including the former CEOs, Maria das Gracas Foster and Jose Sergio Gabrielli.
