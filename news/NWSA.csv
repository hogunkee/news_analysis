14,NWSA,"Zillow Group (Z), operator of the online house-hunting network that dwarfs all competitors, has the inside track for winning a dominant share of real estate agents' digital ad spending.""Their competitive position is quite strong,"" said Macquarie Capital analyst Tom White.While the homes-for-sale data that underpins sites like Zillow and Realtor aren't proprietary, White notes that Zillow ""is out-innovating its competitors in augmenting that basic listings data"" with other data, including listings of homes not for sale, and by investing heavily in mobile.Citing comScore data, Zillow says its five brands account for nearly two-thirds of the total online real estate category and nearly three-quarters of the mobile segment.Yet White notes that there's ""a big disconnect"" between Zillow's majority share of traffic and its slice of the real estate advertising pie.Turning clicks into commission for agents and more ad dollars for Zillow turns out to be easier said than done.A partial explanation is that a big slice of real estate advertising dollars is going to companies that aren't direct competitors, like Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.But the good news for Zillow is that it has been getting better and better monetizing that traffic, growing sales by upwards of 30% over the past year even as real estate agents have lowered their overall spending on digital advertising.The bulk of Zillow's revenue — 70% in the last quarter — comes from its Premier Agent program, where sales rose 32.5% from a year ago. Real estate agents pay to have their picture, credentials and ratings linked to Zillow's listings of homes for sale, with up to four agents attached to each listing.Home shoppers who don't have an agent are likely to click on those with high ratings and a history of similar transactions, and that's exactly what Zillow wants to see.Zillow has a strategy to help accelerate the real estate industry's evolution to the survival of the fittest. Zillow is looking to help the best real estate agents — the ones who can best capitalize on the leads that Zillow generates and will therefore pay the highest ad prices — to extend their domination.""We are accelerating the broader trend across the real estate agent population of higher-producing agents gaining market share from those who are less productive,"" Chief Executive Spencer Rascoff said on a November conference call with analysts.Rascoff also noted that Zillow overhauled the ways it sells ads to its Premier Agents last quarter. Under its old model, Zillow came up with a price for a fixed number of ad impressions based on a ZIP code's characteristics.But Rascoff noted that the fixed-price model sometimes sold out impressions in desirable ZIP codes, requiring the company to call up agents to increase ad prices. So now prices will be set dynamically, based on the total dollars agents budget to advertise on Zillow in a given ZIP code.The goal is ""to have the marketplace"" determine ad costs, Rascoff told analysts.Zillow, which reports fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, advised analysts on its November call that its guidance carried an extra margin of error because of the nationwide rollout of the new pricing strategy.Analysts expect the company to earn 11 cents a share vs. a one-cent loss a year ago, as revenue rises 31% to $222 million. In 2017 revenue is expected to grow 23% to $1.038 billion.The number of agents advertising on Zillow declined modestly in the third quarter to 89,147, but that was part of a planned shakeout. At the same time, the number of advertisers spending at least $5,000 per month rose 79% from a year ago, while average spending per agent rose 46%.IBD'S TAKE: Zillow shares showed promise in early December, after forming a cup-with-handle and starting to break out. But shares retreated into a flat base and remain there. Check out IBD Stock Checkup to see the top companies in the Internet-Content group. Tuesday's results also will provide a checkup on two other new initiatives: a partnership with Facebook and Zillow's first effort to monetize the sell-side of the housing market.Zillow is partnering with Facebook to offer a precision-ad targeting program that enables real estate agents to connect on Facebook with home shoppers who are using its site or Trulia, its sister property acquired in early 2015.Zillow also announced its Seller Boost program in October, involving the placement of Premier Agent ads on listings of its huge inventory of homes not for sale to provide potential leads for agents if the homeowner decides to sell.At the same time, Zillow is trying to leverage its large network of users — 164.5 million in the seasonally slower third quarter — to get a broader slice of advertising dollars.Zillow's marketplace for mortgages, which connects homebuyers to area mortgage lenders much like LendingTree (TREE), generated $19.8 million in revenue in the third quarter, up 57% from a year ago.The traffic at Zillow properties is roughly triple that of its closest direct competitor, Realtor.com, which was acquired by News Corp. (NWSA) in November 2014.Thanks to the merger with Trulia, Zillow removed a major competitor. Meanwhile fears that News Corp. might jump-start the growth and promotion of Realtor.com have been mostly unfounded, Macquarie analyst White said.By some measures, though, Zillow has a growing slice of a pie that has been shrinking in recent years. Borrell Associates estimates that real estate agents spent $7.7 billion on digital ads in 2016, down from $9 billion in 2014. Some 78% of real estate ad spending was done online in 2016, Kip Cassino, Borrell's executive vice president of research, told IBD.The decline in spending partly reflects a relatively modest pace of home sales, especially among millennials, Cassino says. The other reason is that agents ""have become more discerning about how they spend,"" using Google keywords, social media or unpaid search engine optimization strategies.Still, digital spending, including spending on related technologies, has been growing as a percentage of agents' marketing budgets, Zillow says.Rascoff's focus is making sure Zillow is ""well-positioned for the billions of dollars of real estate agent ad spend which will surely migrate on to the internet over the next couple of years, and making sure that we've the right ad model to capture the lion's share of that.""After several days of losses, shares of Zillow reversed course late last week. The stock ended trading Friday up 1.6% to 35.93 and climbed another 1.9% Monday to finish the day at 36.62, right on its 50-day moving averageRELATED:Analyst Sees 'Modest' Earnings Upside For ZillowZillow Group Challenged By Rising Interest Rates, Says StifelZillow Group Stock Turbocharged By High-Spending 'Super Agents'

71,NWSA,"Elizabeth Cady Stanton was nothing if not persistent.In the 1840s, when she started working on legal issues, most Americans opposed letting women get involved in politics. So when she helped organize the first national women's rights conference in Seneca Falls, N.Y., in 1848, even many of the female delegates opposed the resolution to advocate suffrage — the voting franchise — for women. It passed only because of the support of the nation's most famous ex-slave, Frederick Douglass, who attended.Stanton kept pushing hard for the vote until her death in 1902, two decades before the 19th Amendment was ratified to allow all citizens to vote. Without her effort, it might have taken much longer.""Brilliant, self-righteous, charismatic, self-indulgent, mischievous, intimidating and charming, she was the founding philosopher of the American movement for rights for women,"" Lori Ginzberg, author of ""Elizabeth Cady Stanton: An American Life,"" told IBD.Elizabeth Cady (1815-1902) was the eighth of 11 children, five of whom died in early childhood.Her father, Daniel, was a prominent attorney in Johnstown, N.Y., near Albany. As a child, Elizabeth was fascinated by his law library and loved to discuss legal issues with his clerks. She saw that the law didn't regard women as equal to men.Women's Standing""Legally, in the 19th century women had almost no rights — not to sue, to serve on a jury, to own property, to divorce nor even to custody of their children,"" said Edward O'Donnell, author of the Great Courses' audiovisual program ""Turning Points in American History."" ""Their only duties were to manage their homes, rear their children and civilize their husbands.""Cady attended elite private schools, excelling at mathematics and languages. Her formal education ended at 17.There were no higher expectations of her, so she socialized and often visited her cousin Gerrit Smith, a wealthy landowner passionate about ending slavery.At one of these gatherings she met Henry Stanton, an abolitionist speaker and journalist. They married in 1840 (after she had ""promise to obey"" removed from the vows). Their marriage would last 47 years, and their seven children regarded her as a good mother who encouraged their independence.For their honeymoon, the Stantons sailed to London to observe the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. There she met Lucretia Mott, a Quaker minister who, along with the other female delegates, couldn't participate with the convention's leaders.Stanton and Mott became allies upon returning to America.Henry studied law with Elizabeth's father until 1843, when they moved to Boston, where he joined a law firm. There, she enjoyed friendships with Douglass, anti-slavery newspaperman William Garrison, author Louisa May Alcott and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson.In 1847, the Stantons moved to Seneca Falls, N.Y., between Rochester and Syracuse, because the milder climate was better for Henry's health. The next year, Elizabeth helped organize the first women's rights conference there.She and her friend Lizzie McClintock wrote the gathering's ""Declaration of Sentiments."" It opened with, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal."" It was signed by 68 women and 32 men out of the 300 people there.""Most of the resolutions seemed unobjectionable, since vast numbers of Americans already approved of educating girls, many believed women should control their own property, and even the most conservative women's organizations had long argued for a single standard of sexual respectability to judge other people's lapses,"" said Ginzberg.But it wouldn't be until 1869 that Wyoming became the first state to let women vote, followed by Utah the next year.It wasn't easy. A backlash from the press, churches and political establishment caused pro-suffrage backers to withdraw endorsements.Stanton barely noticed the speed bump. She was to be the featured speaker at the second national women's rights conference in Rochester in 1850, but she was pregnant and sent a message to be read. Although she was a compelling orator, more often than not she found it more convenient to write words for someone else to read. She found the perfect partner in Susan B. Anthony.They were introduced by a mutual friend on the street in Seneca Falls, where Anthony was attending an abolitionist convention.They first worked together in the temperance movement, with Stanton as president of a new society in 1852-53. She immediately created waves by asserting that drunkenness could be a cause for divorce.Excessive drinking was seen as a predominantly male problem, and prohibition increasingly became allied with suffrage.TeamworkAs Stanton and Anthony focused on women's rights, the duo split duties. Elizabeth became the thinker and writer at home, where she could care for her children. The childless Susan went on the road and read Stanton's words.""She forged the thunderbolts that I fired,"" said Anthony.""Cady Stanton was more important as a leader of ideas than as an organizer, a task brilliantly undertaken by Anthony,"" said Ginzberg. ""Anthony was constantly frustrated by her refusal to focus on one idea or demand. Cady Stanton hated conventions, felt stifled by organizations and couldn't stick to an agenda, but she was unsurpassed in her generation in communicating the idea that women were restrained from expressing their full humanity without the rights to education, property, intellectual and religious expression, and full citizenship. She considered equality a very American idea in the tradition of the Revolution.""The women's crusade was soon overshadowed by the increasingly militant debate over whether to abolish slavery, limit it to the South or let the slave states secede.Then came the Civil War of 1861-65, with women finding new opportunities on the home front and as spies and battlefield nurses.After the Union victory, the wording of the proposed 14th Amendment extended the vote only to black men and declared voting a male right. Stanton and Anthony saw this expansion of the male franchise as a threat and spoke out to reword it to grant universal suffrage. But the amendment passed unchanged in 1868, and enforcement was strengthened by the 15th Amendment two years later.The GapThe fight over whether to enfranchise women at the same time as black males split the women's movement. In 1869, Stanton and Anthony formed the National Woman Suffrage Association, with Elizabeth serving as its president for the next 21 years.It had an ambitious agenda, including gender-neutral divorce laws, the right to serve on juries and increased economic opportunities for women. Those who wanted to focus on gaining voting rights for women formed the American Woman Suffrage Association.In 1890, the NWSA and AWSA merged, with Stanton as the new group's president. Two years later, she and Anthony testified at the House Committee on the Judiciary. Elizabeth said, ""The strongest reason for giving woman all the opportunities for higher education, for the full development of her faculties, her forces of mind and body; for giving her the most enlarged freedom of thought and action, a complete emancipation from all forms of bondage, of custom, dependence, superstition; from all the crippling influences of fear — is the solitude and personal responsibility of her own individual life.""A decade later, Stanton died at her home in New York City at 86, survived by six of her children and seven grandchildren. Unlike their mother, her daughters had been allowed to attend Vassar College and Columbia University.Her role in helping women achieve equality became overshadowed by the more public and less radical Anthony. Stanton's return to equal honor was symbolized when statues of both were placed in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda in 1997.Two years later, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns premiered ""Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton & Susan B. Anthony.""

159,NWSA,"Rivals Time Warner (TWX) and News Corp. (NWSA) are expected to report quarterly earnings on Feb. 8.Viacom (VIAB), the first major entertainment company to report earnings this season, posted slightly higher-than-expected first-quarter profit, but disappointing sales.The owner of the Nickelodeon, Paramount and Dreamworks brands, said first-quarter EPS rose 4% to $1.06, beating Wall Street estimates by a penny as Viacom increased fees cable providers paid for its networks, which include BET, MTV and Comedy Central. Revenue increased 3% to $3.95 billion, missing forecasts for $3.99 billion.Viacom's class B shares were down 0.5% to 46.74 in intraday trading.Revenue from its Paramount division rose slightly as the latest Tom Cruise action-adventure movie ""Mission Impossible — Ghost Protocol"" raked in $575 million in global sales and horror film ""Paranormal Activity 3"" garnered more than $200 million worldwide.Viacom's children's network Nickelodeon saw a dramatic dip in viewers in September, according to the Nielsen rating system. CEO Philippe Dauman called the drop ""inexplicable"" and blamed Nielsen for faulty ratings.But some analysts believe the instant availability of Nick shows on the video streaming site Netflix (NFLX) caused the viewership drop. Viacom executives disagreed, saying they didn't see a huge increase in Netflix viewership in September.The drop in ratings hurt advertising revenue and the soft advertising sales were specific to Viacom, not an industrywide trend, according to an analyst at Evercore Partners in a Reuters article.Revenue was boosted, however, by digital licensing fees paid by Netflix and others to Viacom for its popular TV shows like ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" and movies.The media-diversified group is ranked No. 88 out of Investor's Business Daily's 197 industry groups.Rivals Time Warner (TWX) and News Corp.

The general market came under pressure May 3 and shifted to correction the day after.The S&P 100 index is comprised of established companies, often large caps. This isn't a bad place to look for dividend stocks.Only seven stocks in the S&P 100 have gained ground during the market decline. Five pay dividends. The five and their price gains during the market decline are: Insurance provider Allstate (ALL), up 5%. This stock has gone through some rough times. Allstate hasn't delivered consecutive years of EPS gains on a year-ago basis since 2002-04. The Street, though, sees EPS soaring 196% this year. Revenue growth is estimated at 3%.The dividend yield is 2.6%.Allstate has been losing younger customers to online rivals. But Allstate decided that if you can't beat them, buy them. In 2011, Allstate bought Esurance and Answer Financial. Theme park and media stock Walt Disney (DIS), up 4%. The dividend yield is 1.3%. Disney was profiled in this space on May 4. Processed food maker H.J. Heinz (HNZ), up 2.5%. The dividend yield is 3.6% but EPS growth has been sluggish. EPS grew 11% to 13% in 2007-09, then slowed to a 1% drop and 7% rise the past two years.The Street sees 9% EPS growth in the fiscal year ended in April. Diversified media giant News Corp. (NWSA), up 2%. Earnings growth accelerated in recent quarters — from 6% to 15%, 34% and 42%. But revenue growth decelerated in the same period — 11%, 7%, 2% and 2%. The dividend yield is only 0.9%. Discount retailer Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), up less than 1%. EPS growth was 11% and 14% the past two fiscal years. (The fiscal year ends in January.) The Street sees a 5% pop this year. The yield is 2.7%.All five stocks share the same drawback, weak to so-so fundamentals.

351,NWSA,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for News Corporation (NWSA  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 5.6% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is NWSA due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.News Corp Q3 Earnings Top, Soft Ad Revenues a ConcernRupert Murdoch-controlled News Corporation delivered sixth straight quarter of positive earnings surprise, when it reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Also, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third successive quarter. Results gained from sturdy performance at the Digital Real Estate Services, Book Publishing and Cable Network Programming segments.However, sluggish print advertising demand still remains a concern. Nevertheless, the company is concentrating on cost cutting, expanding digital offerings with greater emphasis on real estate services to mitigate the impact of the same. Management also highlighted that from the final quarter of fiscal 2018, the combination of digital real estate services and pay-TV operations will represent more than half of profits and propel recurring subscription-based revenues considerably.News Corporation also hinted that with the consolidation of Foxtel and FOX SPORTS Australia, circulation and subscription revenues is likely to emerge as one of the prominent revenue streams for the company. This will help shield it from volatility in the advertising market. The new segment — Subscription Video Services — formed due to consolidation will also incorporate Australian news channel operator, Sky News.Q3 HighlightsNews Corporation delivered adjusted earnings of 6 cents a share that came a penny ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but declined 14% from the year-ago quarter.Including one-time items, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal reported quarterly loss of $1.94 per share that widened from a loss of one cent in the prior-year period on account of non-cash write-downs related to Foxtel and FOX SPORTS Australia and non-cash impairment charge at News America Marketing.Moreover, News Corporation stated that total revenues in the reported quarter came in at $2,093 million, up 6% from the year-ago quarter. The top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,975 million as well. Adjusted revenues (excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency fluctuations and divestitures) of $2,008 million, improved 2% year over year.While advertising revenues declined 3% to $687 million, circulation and subscription revenues increased 7% to $659 million. Consumer revenues also rose 6% to $381 million, while revenues from real estate were up 24% to $208 million. Meanwhile, Other revenues improved 23% to $158 million.Total segment EBITDA was $182 million for the quarter under review, reflecting a decline of 15% from the prior-year period.Segment DetailsRevenues from the News and Information Services segment jumped 2% over year to $1,286 million in the reported quarter. At News UK and Dow Jones, revenues increased 10% and 4%, respectively. However, at News America Marketing and News Corp Australia, the metric decreased 5% and 3%, respectively. Further, the segment’s adjusted revenues declined 2% from the year-ago quarter.Advertising revenues fell 3% year over year due to softness in the print advertising market, primarily in Australia and the United States, and lower revenues at News America Marketing. The decision to stop The Wall Street Journal’s international print editions also impacted the results. These were somewhat mitigated by modest improvement in digital advertising revenues at News Corp Australia and Dow Jones as well as marginal growth in advertising revenues at News UK. Foreign currency fluctuations also acted as a tailwind.Circulation and subscription revenues grew 7% on account of strong contribution from Dow Jones — which witnessed nearly 10% growth in the circulation revenues — persistent increase in digital subscriber at The Wall Street Journal along with sturdy growth at its professional information business. Rise in cover and subscription price, and favorable currency impact also aided revenue growth. These were partly offset by fall in newsstand volume at News UK.In the quarter under review, digital revenues accounted for 29% of segment revenues compared with 24% in the year-ago period. Segment EBITDA plunged 31% to $85 million.The Book Publishing segment reported revenues of $398 million, up 6% from the prior-year period. Digital sales, which constituted 22% of Consumer revenues, rose 5% from the prior-year quarter owing to increase in downloadable audio book sales. The segment’s adjusted revenues rose 4% in the quarter. Segment EBITDA surged 16% to $43 million.Revenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment advanced 27% year over year to $279 million on the back of sustained growth witnessed across REA Group (up 35% to $158 million) and Move (up 15% to $115 million). Further, the segment’s adjusted revenues were up 18%. Segment EBITDA surged 17% to $88 million.The Cable Network Programming segment’s revenues came in at $129 million, up 6% on account of rise in affiliate revenues at FOX SPORTS Australia and Australian News Channel and favorable currency fluctuations. The segment’s adjusted revenues also grew 2% in the quarter. However, segment EBITDA plummeted 53% to $16 million.Other Financial AspectsNews Corporation ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2,112 million, borrowings of $184 million and shareholders’ equity of $9,695 million, excluding non-controlling interest of $296 million.Capital expenditures of $200 million were incurred in the nine months of fiscal 2018, while free cash flow available to the company was $184 million.OutlookManagement stated that advertising trends so far in the fourth quarter are mostly in line with the third quarter. Moreover, the company anticipates marketing costs at Dow Jones to increase marginally on account of driving digital paid subscribers.The company has entered into a licensing deal with Amazon to create an original television series based on The Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien, which is likely to be accretive in the fourth quarter. The company expects to generate more than $20 million additional revenues.News Corporation expects sturdy revenue growth at REA.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to three lower. Last month, the consensus estimate has shifted downward by 35.6% due to these changes.News Corporation Price and Consensus  News Corporation Price and Consensus | News Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, NWSA has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F.

352,NWSA,"The U.S. newspaper publishing industry is no longer restricted to print. This is largely because rampant technological advancements have opened up multiple ways in which the industry can reach its target audience. That said, it is increasingly becoming obvious that newspaper companies cannot solely rely on print or digital advertising but need to diversify their revenue streams focusing on video content, events and paid-for-products.The outcome of this approach is hinged on how effectively newspaper companies make the most of the growing use of Internet as a medium to reach business-to-business and business-to-consumer markets.Newspaper companies are altering their business models to gain an edge in the current multi-platform media environment, as people now stay updated about current affairs via smartphones, social media and other interactive platforms. For this reason, companies are focusing on creating content for mobile devices, online advertising based on user experience and personalized content to lower their dependence on traditional advertising business.It goes without saying that digital advancements and economic shifts have compelled newspaper companies to streamline cost structure, focus on strengthening the balance sheet and restructure portfolio to offset declining revenues and shrinking market share. These companies have also been offloading assets that bear no direct relation to core operations.Let’s take a look at how newspaper companies are adapting to the changing face of media and tapping opportunities for growth.Industry’s Game PlanVenturing Beyond Traditional AdvertisingNewspaper publishing companies are diversifying their revenue base. They are striving to expand their presence in digital products with the aim of lowering dependency on soft print media businesses and traditional advertising. In line with this, Gannett Co., Inc. (GCI  -  Free Report), The McClatchy Company (MNI  -  Free Report), tronc, Inc. (TRNC  -  Free Report) and Hearst newspaper group joined forces to form a national advertising network — Nucleus Marketing Solutions — with the goal to assist advertisers in reaching out to a wider audience.Notably, with the launch of ‘excelerate,’ McClatchy created a niche in the digital agency services space, and now provides marketing solutions such as creation of websites, search-engine optimization, social media management, research, video and branded content productionto local and regional advertising clients.Data-Driven Digital Marketing ServicesIndustry experts believe that Data-Driven Revenue Diversification is one of the primary paths newspaper companies may choose to tread. Per industry experts, newspaper companies are using data analytics and modeling to not only engage with the audience but also provide targeted marketing services on behalf of local businesses. Gannett’s buyout of WordStream, a provider of cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions, is another step toward the same. This acquisition follows the company’s buyout of ReachLocal, a digital marketing solutions company, and SweetIQ Analytics Corp., a provider of location and reputation management SaaS solutions.Portfolio Strengthening Via Alliances & BuyoutsNot every company is ‘shrinking to grow.’ Many companies are taking the consolidation route to create economies of scale, widen their reach and become an all-in-one destination point for advertisers. Gannett formed a fine example of this trend with its acquisition of Journal Media Group, Inc., the owner of Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and other newspapers. The company’s other prominent acquisitions include ReachLocal, Golfweek, SweetIQ, Grateful Ventures and North Jersey Media Group.Meanwhile, New Media Investment Group (NEWM  -  Free Report) has been constantly on the lookout for strategic buyouts. The latest in the list are Akron Beacon Journal, Palm Beach Post and Daily News and Austin American-Statesman. The New York Times Company (NYT  -  Free Report) is also keeping abreast, with its list comprising HelloSociety, a digital marketing agency and portfolio company, The Wirecutter and its sister site, The Sweethome that provides recommendations on technology gear, home products and other consumer services.Pay-and-Read Model en Vogue“To read further please subscribe” has steadily emerged as a viable option for many industry players. Many smaller players want to jump the bandwagon but struggle to pull it off. Only operators with a reputation for quality and unique content have tasted success here. The online subscription model provides steady revenues and helps offset some of the weakness in the advertising revenue side.The New York Times Company’spaid digital subscribers reached 2,783,000 at the end of the first quarter of 2018, up 25.5%year over year.Digital-only subscribers at McClatchy were 112,200 at the end of the quarter, up 32.8%, while Gannett digital-only subscriber volumes surged 51% to approximately 382,000.Portfolio RestructuringCompanies are segregating broadcasting and digital properties from the sluggish print business as a means to ‘unlock value.’ TEGNA Inc. (TGNA  -  Free Report) was formed after the parent company, Gannett spun off its Broadcasting and Digital and Publishing units into two separate entities. The publishing division retained the name of the parent company, Gannett Co., Inc.

353,NWSA,"Rupert Murdoch-controlled News Corporation (NWSA  -  Free Report) delivered sixth straight quarter of positive earnings surprise, when it reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Also, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third successive quarter. Results gained from sturdy performance at the Digital Real Estate Services, Book Publishing and Cable Network Programming segments.However, sluggish print advertising demand still remains a concern. Nevertheless, the company is concentrating on cost cutting, expanding digital offerings with greater emphasis on real estate services to mitigate the impact of the same. Management also highlighted that from the final quarter of fiscal 2018, the combination of digital real estate services and pay-TV operations will represent more than half of profits and propel recurring subscription-based revenues considerably.News Corporation also hinted about the consolidation of Foxtel and FOX SPORTS Australia which is likely to result in circulation and subscription revenues to emerge as one of the prominent revenue streams for the company. This will shield it from volatility in the advertising market. The new segment — Subscription Video Services — formed due to consolidation will also incorporate Australian news channel operator, Sky News.Notably, shares of the company have gained 9% in the past six months but have underperformed the industry’s rally of 21%.News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | News Corporation QuoteQ3 HighlightsNews Corporation delivered adjusted earnings of 6 cents a share that came a penny ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but declined 14% from the year-ago quarter.Including one-time items, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal reported quarterly loss of $1.94 per share that widened from a loss of one cent in the prior-year period on account of non-cash write-downs related to Foxtel and FOX SPORTS Australia and non-cash impairment charge at News America Marketing.Moreover, News Corporation, which split from Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), stated that total revenues in the reported quarter came in at $2,093 million, up 6% from the year-ago quarter. The top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,975 million as well. Adjusted revenues (excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency fluctuations and divestitures) of $2,008 million, improved 2% year over year.While advertising revenues declined 3% to $687 million, circulation and subscription revenues increased 7% to $659 million. Consumer revenues also rose 6% to $381 million, while revenues from real estate were up 24% to $208 million. Meanwhile, Other revenues improved 23% to $158 million.Total segment EBITDA was $182 million for the quarter under review, reflecting a decline of 15% from the prior-year period.Segment DetailsRevenues from the News and Information Services segment jumped 2% over year to $1,286 million in the reported quarter. At News UK and Dow Jones, revenues increased 10% and 4%, respectively. However, at News America Marketing and News Corp Australia, the metric decreased 5% and 3%, respectively. Further, the segment’s adjusted revenues declined 2% from the year-ago quarter.Advertising revenues fell 3% year over year due to softness in the print advertising market, primarily in Australia and the United States, and lower revenues at News America Marketing. The decision to stop The Wall Street Journal’s international print editions also impacted the results. These were somewhat mitigated by modest improvement in digital advertising revenues at News Corp Australia and Dow Jones as well as marginal growth in advertising revenues at News UK. Foreign currency fluctuations also acted as a tailwind. Definitely, the rate of decline in advertising revenues have decelerated from 6% reported in the second quarter.Circulation and subscription revenues grew 7% on account of strong contribution from Dow Jones — which witnessed nearly 10% growth in the circulation revenues — persistent increase in digital subscriber at The Wall Street Journal along with sturdy growth at its professional information business. Rise in cover and subscription price, and favorable currency impact also aided revenue growth. These were partly offset by fall in newsstand volume at News UK.In the quarter under review, digital revenues accounted for 29% of segment revenues compared with 24% in the year-ago period. Segment EBITDA plunged 31% to $85 million.The Book Publishing segment reported revenues of $398 million, up 6% from the prior-year period. Digital sales, which constituted 22% of Consumer revenues, rose 5% from the prior-year quarter owing to increase in downloadable audio book sales. The segment’s adjusted revenues rose 4% in the quarter. Segment EBITDA surged 16% to $43 million.Revenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment advanced 27% year over year to $279 million on the back of sustained growth witnessed across REA Group (up 35% to $158 million) and Move (up 15% to $115 million). Further, the segment’s adjusted revenues were up 18%. Segment EBITDA surged 17% to $88 million.The Cable Network Programming segment’s revenues came in at $129 million, up 6% on account of rise in affiliate revenues at FOX SPORTS Australia and Australian News Channel and favorable currency fluctuations. The segment’s adjusted revenues also grew 2% in the quarter. However, segment EBITDA plummeted 53% to $16 million.Other Financial AspectsNews Corporation, which carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2,112 million, borrowings of $184 million and shareholders’ equity of $9,695 million, excluding non-controlling interest of $296 million.Capital expenditures of $200 million were incurred in the nine months of fiscal 2018, while free cash flow available to the company was $184 million.OutlookManagement stated that advertising trends so far in the fourth quarter are mostly in line with the third quarter. Moreover, the company anticipates marketing costs at Dow Jones to increase marginally on account of driving digital paid subscribers.The company has entered into a licensing deal with Amazon to create an original television series based on The Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien, which is likely to be accretive in the fourth quarter. The company expects to generate more than $20 million additional revenues.News Corporation expects sturdy revenue growth at REA.2 Stocks Seeking Your AttentionThe New York Times Company (NYT  -  Free Report) delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 31.6% in the trailing four quarters.

356,NWSA,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for News Corporation (NWSA  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 1.5% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is NWSA due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.News Corp Q2 Earnings & Revenues Surpass EstimatesNews Corporation reported the fifth straight quarter of positive earnings surprise, when it posted second-quarter fiscal 2018 results.

Further, the segment’s adjusted revenues declined 5% from the year-ago quarter.Advertising revenues fell 6% due to soft home delivered revenues at News America Marketing, mainly attributable to two fewer free-standing inserts as well as lower custom publishing revenues. Also, softness in the print advertising market along with the decision to stop The Wall Street Journal’s international print editions in the quarter impacted the results. These were somewhat mitigated by contributions from the buyout of ARM, a modest growth of advertising revenues at News UK, and foreign currency tailwinds.Circulation and subscription revenues grew 6% on account of strong contribution from Dow Jones, reflecting nearly 10% growth in the circulation revenues, persistent increase in digital subscriber at The Wall Street Journal along with sturdy growth at its professional information business.

357,NWSA,"Newspaper companies are transforming their business models to better position themselves in the current multi-platform media environment. These companies are focusing on mobile devices, online advertising based on user experience and personalized content to lower their dependence on traditional advertising revenues.The companies are also streamlining their cost structures, strengthening their balance sheets and restructuring their portfolios to offset declining revenues and shrinking market shares. This has compelled many newspaper companies to undertake cost-cutting measures such as headcount trimming, pay cuts, furloughs, voluntary retirement programs and closure of printing facilities. Publishing companies have been offloading assets that bear no direct relation to core operations.Let’s take a look at what’s happening in the publishing industry and how newspaper companies are adapting to the changing face of media in the race for survival.Industry Game PlanNewspaper publishing companies are diversifying their revenue base. They are striving to expand their presence in broadcasting and digital products with the aim of lowering dependency on soft print media business and traditional advertising, thereby reducing susceptibility to economic conditions. In line with this, Gannett Co., Inc. (GCI  -  Free Report), The McClatchy Company (MNI  -  Free Report), Tribune Publishing Company, now known as tronc, Inc. (TRNC  -  Free Report) and Hearst newspaper group joined forces to form a new national advertising network – Nucleus Marketing Solutions – with the goal to assist advertisers in reaching out to a mass audience.On the restructuring front, companies are even separating their broadcasting and digital properties from the sluggish print business as a means to ‘unlock value.’ TEGNA Inc. (TGNA  -  Free Report) was formed after the parent company, Gannett spun off its Broadcasting and Digital and Publishing units into two separate entities. The publishing division retained the name of the parent company, Gannett Co., Inc.This is not the first time that any media company has spun off its publishing unit. Earlier, News Corporation (NWSA  -  Free Report) and Time Warner also separated their broadcasting and digital properties from their sluggish print business.Not every company is ‘shrinking to grow,’ with many companies taking the consolidation route to create scale economies. Gannett is an example of this trend when it acquired Journal Media Group, Inc., the owner of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and other newspapers. The acquisition of Journal Media Group added 15 dailies and 18 weeklies in 14 local markets under Gannett’s portfolio, increasing the daily and Sunday circulation. Gannett has made other acquisitions since then as well.Pay As You Access“To read further please subscribe” has steadily emerged as a viable option for many industry players. Many smaller players would like to go this route, but find it hard to pull it off. Only operators with a reputation for quality and unique content have been successful in this way. The online subscription model provides consistent revenues and helps offset some of the weakness on the advertising revenue side.Wrapping UpWith a strategic and steady newspaper budget, we could see fewer layoffs, increased focus on web and local content, improved subscription and concentration on profitable circulation. We observe that newspapers are turning more subscriber-oriented, offering reports in line with readers’ choice. We expect paywall strategies, new pricing techniques and product innovation to generate more revenues for the newspaper companies.We further believe that separating the publishing division will help to better exploit the potential of broadcasting and digital businesses. Once the companies are spun off, they have separate management teams and a much more defined capital structure that provide ample room for strategic decisions related to any investment, acquisition or a new endeavor that can benefit that particular business, and in no way affect the other.Consolidation too has its benefits of a stronger base and wider reach. No wonder, publishing companies are boosting their strength to optimize business profits.   As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the newspaper publishing industry over the long term. But what about investing in the space right now?

These were somewhat mitigated by contributions from the buyout of ARM, a modest growth of advertising revenues at News UK, and foreign currency tailwinds.Circulation and subscription revenues grew 6% on account of strong contribution from Dow Jones, reflecting nearly 10% growth in the circulation revenues, persistent increase in digital subscriber at The Wall Street Journal along with sturdy growth at its professional information business. Furthermore, the contributions from ARM buyout, rise in cover and subscription price, and favorable currency impact aided revenue growth. The improvement was partly compensated with diminished newsstand volume at News UK.In the quarter under review, digital revenues accounted for 29% of segment revenues compared with 26% in the year-ago period. Adjusted segment EBITDA fell 7% to $134 million.The Book Publishing segment reported revenues of $469 million, up 1% from the prior-year period. Digital sales, which constituted 16% of Consumer revenue, rose 2% from the prior-year quarter owing to increase in downloadable audio book sales. However, the segment’s adjusted revenue dipped 1% in the fiscal second quarter while adjusted EBITDA was up 5% to $79 million.Revenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment advanced 21% year over year to $292 million on the back of sustained growth witnessed across REA Group (up 24%) and Move (up 18%). However, growth was partly compensated with the divestiture of REA Group’s European business and the sale of Move’s TigerLead product. Further, the segment’s adjusted revenues were up 18%. Also, adjusted EBITDA grew 22% to $115 million.The Cable Network Programming segment’s revenues came in at $120 million, up 15% on account of the buyout of ANC and rise in affiliate revenue at FOX SPORTS Australia. The segment’s adjusted revenues also grew 6% in the quarter. However, adjusted EBITDA fell 22% to $40 million.Other Financial AspectsNews Corp, which carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,856 million, borrowings of $187 million and shareholders’ equity of 10,860 million, excluding non-controlling interest of $298 million.Capital expenditures of $128 million were incurred in the six months of fiscal 2018 while free cash flow available to the company was $16 million.Two Stocks Seeking Your AttentionMSG Networks Inc.

360,NWSA,"The fourth-quarter 2017 earnings season is shaping up as one of the best quarters in recent times. In fact, the season has so far been spectacular, displaying all-round strength and momentum. Apart from an above-average proportion of positive surprises, we are witnessing solid upward revisions in estimate  for the current quarter.Per the Earnings Preview dated Feb 2, about 251 S&P 500 index members have reported results. Of these, about 80.5% delivered a positive earnings surprise and about 78.1% beat revenue estimates. The blended beat ratio (companies beating both earnings and revenues) so far has been 64.9%. Further, total earnings for these companies were up 16%, on 10.5% revenue growth.Undoubtedly, the fourth-quarter earnings season is on track to be among the best in recent quarters. The results are better not only in terms of enhanced growth from the same group of 251 index members but also a greater proportion beating top- and bottom-line estimates.Coming to expectations, total fourth-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to increase 13% year over year, with a 7.7% rise in revenues. This follows 6.7% earnings growth and 5.9% revenue increase recorded in the third quarter.A Look at Consumer Discretionary SectorThe performance of the index is determined by all 16 Zacks sectors, out of which 14 are estimated to witness year-over-year earnings growth. The Consumer Discretionary sector, which houses major media stocks, seems to be one among the sectors to lag this quarter. Per the report, the Consumer Discretionary sector is likely to witness earnings decline of 3.7% while revenues are expected to increase 3.7% this earnings season.Currently, the Consumer Discretionary sector is ranked among the bottom 31% (11 of 16) of all the Zacks sectors. Nonetheless, the sector has rallied 8.4% in the last three months, outperforming the S&P 500 market’s gain 2.2%. So, let’s see what awaits the following Media stocks that are queued up for earnings releases on Feb 8.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP have higher chances of delivering positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Let’s See How VIAB, NWSA, WWE & LGF.A Are PlacedLeading entertainment content company operating primarily in the United States and Europe, Viacom Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report), is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31, 2017). Although the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), our earnings beat criteria was let down by its Earnings ESP of -1.64%.Viacom Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Viacom Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Viacom Inc. QuoteViacom’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 results are likely to be hurt by weak affiliate revenues in the United States due to loss of subscribers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for affiliate revenues is pegged at $1,076 million, below $1,150 million in the previous quarter. Additionally, advertising revenues are expected to remain weak in the fiscal first quarter. Soft advertising and affiliate revenues are expected to hurt the company’s primary division — Media Networks too. Below-par performance of the company’s principal revenue generating division will naturally hurt its overall results. Moreover, higher programming expenses have the potential to hurt results in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the company’s performance on the international front is anticipated to be much better. Additionally, strong growth in international consumer products is likely to boost ancillary revenues. Similarly, internal growth should boost total advertising revenues, mitigating the weakness on the domestic front.

Moreover, the company’s current Earnings ESP is -8.11% makes surprise prediction impossible. Nevertheless, its efforts to diversify revenue streams through strategic acquisitions and operational enhancement alongside stringent cost cutting are impressive. The company is also expanding its digital offerings, emphasizing on real estate businesses and augmenting digital subscriber base.News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | News Corporation QuoteHowever, advertising, which forms a major part of total revenues, continues to be highly vulnerable to economic conditions. In fact, advertising revenues in the News and Information Services segment remained flat in the preceding quarter. This is because contributions from the buyouts of Australian Regional Media and Wireless Group, favorable foreign currency fluctuations and modest rise in digital advertising revenues were offset by sluggishness in the print advertising market and lower free standing insert revenues at News America Marketing. Previously, management had highlighted that FOX SPORTS Australia is likely to struggle against higher costs during the second quarter due to the amortization of NRL rights throughout the year. (Read more: Factors Likely to Decide News Corp's Fate in Q2 Earnings)Taking a sneak-peek at World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. (WWE  -  Free Report), we note that this integrated media and entertainment company is likely to beat expectations in the to-be reported quarter.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. QuoteWWE has garnered a stellar revenues record with sturdy growth delivered in the last three quarters. We believe this record is likely to continue as it has not only extended its earlier deal but also signed agreements with the new service provider for airing its flagship program — Raw and SmackDown — in different countries. Further, subscriber growth and worldwide increase in TV rights fees are anticipated to provide an impetus to the top line. Furthermore, revenues from international sponsorship will receive an additional stimulus from WWE’s agreement with sports marketing agency — Lagardère Sports. We believe with increasing subscription-based video streaming services, WWE Network through its vast presence in more than 180 countries will be able to capitalize on the trend. (Read more: Subscriber Growth, TV Right Fees to Drive WWE Q4 Earnings)Finally, let’s assess the earnings beat criteria for Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation (LGF.A  -  Free Report), a producer and distributor of motion pictures for theatrical and straight-to-video release. The surprise prediction for this stock is also difficult given its Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -4.19%.Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation QuoteLions Gate’s strategic acquisitions and alliances to enhance its competitive position and maximize returns along with building a diversified portfolio bode well for the company. Notably, the addition of Starz is aiding Lions Gate to emerge as a major player in the TV space and helping it regain lost ground in the streaming network. Moreover, the company has invested in The Immortals to capitalize on the increasing popularity of eSports. It expects the eSports market to grow more than$1 billion in fiscal 2018.However, fewer movie releases in fiscal 2018 compared with the previous year might hurt Motion Pictures revenue performance. Dismal television production performance in the past few quarters has also been a concern for investors. Further, the escalating cost of motion picture production and marketing in recent years may jeopardize Lions Gate’s margins.

361,NWSA,"News Corporation (NWSA  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 8. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether the company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. In the trailing four quarters, this diversified media conglomerate outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 88.2%.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions to get a clear view of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been stable in the last 30 days and is currently pegged at 19 cents, flat year over year. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenue of $2,133 million, up from $2,116 million in the prior-year quarter.Factors Influencing Q2News Corporation is diversifying its revenue streams through strategic acquisitions and operational enhancement. The company is expanding its digital offerings, emphasizing on real estate businesses and augmenting digital subscriber base. Further, it has been concentrating on cost cutting.However, advertising, which forms a major part of total revenues, continues to be highly vulnerable to the economic conditions. Advertising revenues in the News and Information Services segment remained flat during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This is because contributions from the buyouts of Australian Regional Media and Wireless Group, favorable foreign currency fluctuations and modest rise in digital advertising revenues were offset by sluggishness in the print advertising market and lower free standing insert revenues at News America Marketing.Previously, management had highlighted that FOX SPORTS Australia is likely to struggle against higher costs during the second quarter due to the amortization of NRL rights throughout the year.Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues from News and Information Services division to decline marginally by 1%. However, revenues in Cable Network Programming and Digital Real Estate Services segments are expected to increase 10.6% and 13.6%, respectively. Book Publishing division is expected to register revenue growth of 1.5%.News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | News Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that News Corporation is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

362,NWSA,"World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE  -  Free Report) focus on increasing original content production, localization, subscriber growth, rise in TV rights fees and strategic initiatives bode well for the stock. Further, these factors have helped the stock to register a solid gain of 54.1% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 38.3%. Stocks such as News Corporation (NWSA  -  Free Report), Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF.A  -  Free Report), which belong to the same industry, have also witnessed upsides of 26.4%, 39.7% and 20.1%, respectively. Let’s delve deeper.Driving FactorsWe believe WWE will continue to report record revenue growth as it has not only extended previous deal with different companies but also signed agreement with new service provider for airing its flagship program Raw and SmackDown in different countries. The strong relationship between WWE and Groupe AB is set to continue into the 18th year with both companies extending the partnership.In the long haul, the company will continue banking on WWE’s content distribution agreement. Recently, the company stated that distribution agreement, which generated a large chunk of television rights revenues, will expire in 2019 in some regions. Licensing of Raw and SmackDown in the United States will terminate in Sep 30, 2019, while in UK and India it will expire on Dec 31, 2019. The company is looking to renew the distribution agreement in these regions somewhere between May 2018 and first-half 2019.Further, in an effort to augment revenues this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has reached an agreement with sports marketing agency Lagardère Sports, which will facilitate it to acquire international sponsorship. Per the agreement, Lagardère Sports will help in building partnership portfolio through its sponsorship proficiency and global sales channel in all international regions, excluding China. We believe with increasing subscription based video streaming services WWE Network through its vast presence in over 180 countries will aid top-line growth. For 2018, management is optimistic about achieving another great year of revenues and adjusted OIBDA growth. The company anticipates adjusted OIBDA of at least $115 million.HurdlesWWE which distributes home entertainment content in both physical (DVD and Blu-Ray) as well as digital formats has been witnessing decline in revenues. In 2016, home entertainment net revenues came in at $13.1 million in comparison with $13.4 million and $27.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Further, the trend continued in the first, second and third quarters of 2017, with home entertainment revenues declining 27%, 3.2% and 8%, respectively. The decline in home entertainment revenues can primarily be attributed to steady shift by consumers to digital formats, downloaded or streamed over the Internet.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

363,NWSA,"The strong relationship between World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE  -  Free Report) and Astro Malaysia Holdings Berhad (Astro) is set to continue in to the 17th year with both companies extending the partnership. Per the new deal, Astro will continue to air WWE programming like Raw and SmackDown.Astro Vice President of Sports Business, Lee Choong Khay, said “The response from the passionate fanbase has been tremendous, with nearly five million viewers in 2017 alone and we hope to serve more fans in years to come.”We believe extension of the agreement between both the companies will enable WWE to increase subscriber base.

364,NWSA,"It’s a win-win deal for all you Marvel fans out there. After years of speculation and what-if moments, the X-Men, Fantastic Four and Deadpool will finally join the rest of the Marvel juggernaut following the media deal of the year, if not the decade. But it is difficult to be similarly enthusiastic about The Walt Disney Company’s (DIS  -  Free Report) $52.4 billion takeover of key Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets.While Disney does gain many mouthwatering options, it remains to be seen how these assets will help it launch its own streaming offensive in 2019. And was the asset sale, Murdoch’s way of acknowledging that he’s largely quitting the entertainment side of things? The media mogul refused to acknowledge such feelings at a recent news conference saying:  “Are we retreating? Absolutely not.”Has Disney Really Benefited?Probably the biggest media player of them all at present, Disney’s performance on the bourses has lagged far behind its soaring ambition. Since late 2015, the stock assumed a sluggish trajectory and has gained only 4.4% over the last two years, underperforming the broader industry over this period. Disney has a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.At the time of this acquisition, Disney is beset by several problems, particularly at ESPN where its subscriber base is shrinking even as it has to bear high programming costs.  Recently, it decided to terminate the distribution agreement with Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) for subscription streaming and is on the verge of launching its own streaming services —one for Disney and Pixar brands and another for ESPN followers.Disney does gain several key media assets as it prepares to launch its own streaming service. But is difficult to decipher how the large number of regional sporting networks it owns, reputedly worth nearly a third of the entire deal value,  will help in shoring up its losing TV business. Surely, all these businesses are also facing the prospect of a wave of ensuing cord cutting.Further, the media behemoth now has access to Fox’s massive collection of movies and television programming. But what Disney needs to do at this point is to build a streaming service with a loyal customer base. Recent trends in this segment clearly point to a fragmented scenario where the popularity of niche offerings is rising.Disney may be better off launching a more focused service and only time will tell how it  utilizes its new found assets. The acquisition of a large stake in Hulu, on the other hand, is more of a clear victory.Intensifying Competition Forced Murdoch’s Hand?The view on the Fox end of things is even less clear and the jury is still out on what forced Murdoch’s hand. Essentially, he has offered up to Disney the lion’s share of Fox’s media and entertainment assets. This is an unlikely move for a media baron who was well known for aggressive deal making. For instance, in 2014, Murdoch famously, and presciently, bid for Time Warner Inc. .But his confident posturing notwithstanding, the deal is probably a quiet acknowledgement of not only how much the media business has changed but also of how technology centric it has become. Further, the space has been marked by hectic acquisitions which have created even bigger media behemoths.For instance, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) has acquired Huffington Post, AOL and Yahoo. Disney is an even stronger case in point, since it now owns not only Marvel but also Lucasfilm which makes the Star Wars motion pictures.The sale of these Fox assets will allow Murdoch to focus on his beloved newspaper assets which includes the likes of the Wall Street Journal and The Times. This is Murdoch’s first love since he built his business from the lone paper in Adelaide that he inherited from his father.Murdoch has indicated that he may merge New Fox, the entity to be created from surviving Twenty-First Century Fox assets with News Corporation (NWSA  -  Free Report) or News Corp. Murdhoch’s heir apparent and his older son Lachlan has said: “The New Fox is about returning to our roots as a lean, aggressive, challenger brand.”Personal Equations Also at PlayIndustry watchers have also characterized the deal as a turning point in Murdoch’s relationship with his younger son James, the chief executive of 21st Century Fox. Apparently, differences between father and son have accumulated over the years, and are now difficult to resolve. Essentially, Murdoch believes his younger son failed to develop his empire’s entertainment assets to their full potential.James Murdoch probably has a future at Disney and the media behemoth’s chairman Bob Iger has hinted at such a prospect. But at this point, their seems to be no clear and immediate winners from a deal which has captured the imagination of investors and industry watchers alike.  Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

366,NWSA,"Yesterday, in a landmark 3-2 vote, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved a sweeping rollback of rules that were stumbling blocks to consolidation in the media and entertainment industry. FCC’s new proposals will bring an end to several longstanding rules designed to limit the monopoly of local broadcasters.U.S. media accounts for a staggering one third of the global media market. Nevertheless, this industry is lately going through severe fluctuations. One of the key reasons for volatile growth is stringent regulatory norms across all segments of the industry and high barriers to entry.A New Look Less-Restrictive FCC In January 2017, President Donald Trump elected the existing Republican commissioner Ajit Pai as the new Chairman of the FCC. The appointment of Pai, who appears to have exercised lesser restrictions, at the helm of the regulatory body, is likely to bode well for media companies. Relaxation of ownership rules may increase consolidation within media and lead to increased competition to the online digital platform.The FCC’s decision will bring to an end of longstanding rules like restriction on cross-ownership of radio, newspaper and TV assets in a market and counting each station involved in joint sales agreements in owners’ ownership tallies. It will also end the rule of eight-voice which called for at least eight other independently owned outlets in the coverage area, after any ownership consolidation.Earlier this year, the FCC took two major decisions to ease media ownership rules. On Apr 20, the regulatory body voted 2-1 to restore the “UHF-discount” that has allowed station groups to fall within media ownership limits. The rule allows media companies to count only half the coverage areas reach of their UHF (ultra-high frequency) stations.On Oct 24, the FCC voted 3-2 to eliminate the so-called “Main Studio Rule,” which requires local TV and radio broadcasters to maintain studios in the communities where they are licensed.Advantages to Media Companies The new set of proposals of the FCC will enable common ownership of a newspaper and a broadcast station in the same market. Moreover, common ownership of two of the top four TV stations in the same market will be allowed subject to regulatory clearance. The old restrictive rule, which so far explicitly prohibited any incumbent from owning more than two TV stations and one radio station in the same market, has now been eliminated by FCC.Additionally, local broadcasting stations, which have agreements to sell more than 15% of the advertising time of another outlet in the same market, will no longer count these deals in calculating whether they are within national TV ownership limits.Moody’s Praises FCC Move Credit rating agency Moody’s Investors Services has stated that the FCC’s relaxation of media ownership rules is credit-positive for TV broadcasters. “Under the revised FCC rules, U.S. television broadcasters will benefit from the ability to consolidate local market ownership through acquisitions and station swaps,” said Jason Cuomo, author of the Moody’s report. As broadcasters will attain economies of scale, this will result in lower costs, greater negotiation power and increased advertising. Our ChoiceAs the market becomes more business friendly for the media companies, we believe investors should choose stocks that promise strong near-term growth and carry a favourable Zacks Rank.

368,NWSA,"Benchmarks finished in the red on Thursday following concerns over a likely delay in the Trump administration’s tax cut plans. The Senate Finance Committee released a tax plan which aims to reduce corporate tax rate to 20% but not before 2019, in contrast to the 2018 deadline proposed by the House Republicans. Although, investors turned jittery following concerns that tax cut may be delayed, markets curtailed some of the day’s declines after the House Ways and Committee passed a bill to reframe the tax reforms.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) decreased 0.4%, to close at 23,461.94. The S&P 500 Index (INX) fell 0.4% to close at 2,584.62. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,750.05, losing 0.6%. A total of 7.4 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.6 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.67-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.62-to-1 ratio favored declining issues. The CBOE VIX decreased 1.1% to close at 9.78.What Dragged Benchmarks Downward?On Thursday, a version of the tax plan was released by the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate version differed from that of the House panel's in several ways. Unlike the House Republicans’ tax proposals which focus on reducing corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, the Senate version supports a similar tax cut only by2019. Also, per House Republicans, the top individual tax rate would be 39.6%, whereas the Senate version puts the ceiling rate at 38.5%.Worries over a possible delay in tax cut plans weighed on investor sentiment. Although, some of the day’s losses were curtailed after the House Ways and Committee approved a Bill to recast the tax reforms, all the three key U.S. indexes registered their worst trading day in two weeks. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 posted their largest one-day percentage falls since Oct 25, while the Nasdaq registered its worst one-day performance since Oct 23.The day’s performance could have been much worse if the the tax plan Bill approved by the House Ways and Committee did not offer some positives for the investors. Among the Bill’s key highlights were proposals to reduce corporate taxes by 2018, reducing the number of tax brackets from seven to four and a gradual repeal of the estate tax.Key Earnings For the DayOn the earnings front, shares of TransDigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report) fell 6.8% after the reporting fiscal fourth quarter net sales of $923.9 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $967 million.

369,NWSA,"Media behemoth – The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) – reported negative earnings surprise in the fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 after beating the estimate in the trailing three quarters. Moreover, the company’s top-line also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fifth straight quarter.The company’s adjusted earnings in the reported quarter came in at $1.07 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 and decreased 3% year over year. Moreover, revenues came in at $12,779 million, down 3% year over year and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,149 million. The company’s disappointing results in the quarter was primarily due to dismal performance of Media Networks, Studio Entertainment. and Consumer Products & Interactive Media, which overshadowed growth at Parks and Resorts.The company’s total operating income came in at $2,812 million during the quarter, down 11% year over year. The downside was due to decline in operating income from Media Network, Studio Entertainment, and Consumer Products & Interactive Media.Despite Disappointing Results Stock Gains: Why?Even though Disney reported dismal results, shares inched up nearly 1% during after-hour trading session yesterday. Analysts believe that the deal with Rian Johnson, the director of The Last Jedi, to produce a brand new Star Wars trilogy may have raised hopes of investors. We note that, the stock has increased 4.2% in a month, outperforming the industry, which has witnessed a decline of 2.8%.Further, Disney plans to launch its own streaming services – one for Disney and Pixar brands, and another for ESPN followers. The company had earlier stated that it will terminate distribution agreement with Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) for subscription streaming of the new movies starting in 2019.Disney will start online streaming services for ESPN sports in early 2018 and its branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 will carry Disney movies as well as TV shows. The ESPN-branded multi-sport streaming service will give an option to enjoy 10,000 live international, national and regional games every year. Tournaments like Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, Grand Slam tennis, and college sports will be live streamed.Meanwhile, through the fresh Disney-branded service, subscribers can view both Disney’s and Pixar’s latest live action and animated movies, starting with the 2019 theatrical slate.Disney Now Controls BAMTechIn an effort to attract online viewers, the company has completed the acquisition of video streaming, data analytics as well as commerce management company BAMTech in September.In the past few quarters Disney’s ESPN has been a hot topic in the media industry and investors are closely monitoring the performance of ESPN. In the reported quarter, advertising revenues declined in the low-single digit. Falling subscriber base and higher programming costs at ESPN continues to hamper the company’s results. Most of the media companies are failing to cope with ""cord cutting"" as consumers are unwilling to pay for large bundles of channels.ESPN has sealed a number of deals with new platform owners, mostly over-the-top. These deals have started to yield positive results and are also increasing the number of subscribers. Moreover, the company has inked a deal with Hulu and another entity, and is also in discussion with others. The company had earlier stated that mobile apps are going to play an important role in the future of media, and ESPN is rightly on the way of taking the advantage of the trend with wide range of apps.Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Walt Disney Company (The) QuoteSegment DetailsThe Media Networks segment’s revenues were down 3% to $5,465 million, primarily due to 11% decrease in Broadcasting revenues to $1,514 million. However, Cable Networks came in at $3,951 million, almost flat year over year.The segment’s operating income came in at $1,475 million, down 12% year over year. Cable Networks saw 1% drop in operating income to $1,236 million, while the Broadcasting segment reported a 15% slump in operating income to $229 million. Drop in operating income at Cable Networks were primarily due to decline at Freeform, which overshadowed the gain at the Disney Channels. At ESPN increase in affiliate revenues were ooffset by higher programming cost and dismal advertising revenues. Decrease in advertising revenues were chiefly due to decline in average viewership. Meanwhile, growth in affiliate revenues was driven by rise in contractual rate, which mitigated the fall in subscribers.Parks and Resorts revenues came in at $4,667 million, up 6% from the year-ago period. The segment’s operating income climbed 7% to $746 million backed by growth at the company’s international operations, which was due to robust performance of Disneyland Paris and Shanghai Disney Resort. Rise in guest spending and attendance were the main reasons behind growth in operating income at Disneyland Paris. Meanwhile, growth at Shanghai Disney Resort was driven by lower marketing cost, increase in attendance, which negated lower average ticket pricing. Meanwhile, operating income declined at the company’s domestic operations due to the impact of Hurricane Irma.The Studio segment generated revenues of $1,432 million, down 21% year over year. Moreover, operating income dropped 43% to $218 million. Sharp decline in operating income was due to decrease in TV/SVOD distribution results and increase in film cost impairments. Home entertainment as well as theatrical distribution results was flat year-over-year. However, decrease in theatrical distribution results were due to better performance of the company’s releases in the prior-year quarter compared with this quarter. However, analysts believe that the coming two years will be the most fruitful for Disney. The studio is all set to continue with its success story beyond Star Wars, Zootopia and Beauty and the Beast as it boasts of an impressive lineup of big budget movies up to 2018. In 2018, the company is expected to release Black Panther, A Wrinkle in Time, Avengers: Infinity War, The Incredibles 2 and Ant-Man and the Wasp. Further, movie lovers must be really pumped up as Star Wars saga, The Last Jedi will hit the in December.Consumer Products & Interactive Media division saw a 6% decrease in revenues to $1,215 million. Moreover, the unit’s operating income dropped 12% to $373 million owing to decline at merchandise licensing business.Other Financial DetailsDisney, which shares space with Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report), generated free cash flow of $2,691 million during the reported quarter, down 3% year over year. The company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $4,017 million, borrowings of $19,119 million and shareholder’s equity of $41,315 million, excluding non-controlling interest of $3,689 million.During the quarter, the company bought back nearly 33.6 million shares for $3.4 billion.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Disney carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) which is subject to change following the earnings announcement.

370,NWSA,"Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF.A  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 quarterly numbers, wherein both top and bottom lines improved year over year and the latter also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While the stock has not shown much movement since the announcement, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has gained 14.2% in the past six months, surpassing the industry’s rise of 0.6%.Q2 HighlightsLions Gate’s earnings came in at 7 cents per share, which fares much better than a loss of 12 cents recorded in the year-ago period, as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 18 cents.Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Quote On the revenue front, Lions Gate witnessed a surge of 47.1% year over year to approximately $941 million, though it fell short of the Zacks Consensus estimate of $955 million. This can primarily be attributed to a surge in Media Networks revenues. However, on a pro-forma basis, revenues tumbled 10.3%.The company’s adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) came in at $109 million, in comparison with negative $24 million reported in the prior-year quarter. On a pro-forma basis, adjusted OIBDA increased 66.1% year over year. The company’s filmed entertainment backlog was nearly $1.3 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter.Segmental Performance (On Pro-forma basis)Media Networks’ segment formed after the acquisition of Starz reported revenues of $393.4 million, up about 7% year over year on account of continued solid performance by hit series, Power as well as gains from Outlander’s premiere. Moreover, segment profit came in at $116.5 million, up 42.2% year over year on the back of increased over-the-top revenues; reduced programming expenses and benefits from Power’s licensing. Segment profit margins expanded to 29.6% in the quarter from 22.2%.Motion Pictures reported revenue of $385.7 million, which slumped nearly 24% due to lower theatrical and international revenues, partly compensated by improved home entertainment and television revenues.  Theatrical revenues were marred by lesser featured film releases this quarter, partly negated by robust performance of The Hitman's Bodyguard. International sales fell year over year owing to absence of solid contributions from Now You See Me 2 which aided the year-ago period. On the contrary, Home entertainment revenues gained from Starz third party distribution business, partly offset by lower feature films. However, television revenues were fueled by greater contributions from feature films.The segment logged profit of $8.9 million as against a loss of $5.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The improvement stemmed from lower P&A expenses.Television Production revenues dropped 4.7% to $168.7 million, mainly due to lower domestic television sales. This was accountable to soft revenues from reality shows and unfavorable timing of episodic deliveries of Orange is the New Black. Moreover, segment profit plunged 30.1% to $8.6 million, while the segment profit margin contracted 150 basis points to 5.1%. Financial DetailsLions Gate ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $225.9 million, film obligations and production loans of $294.9 million and shareholders’ equity of $2,826.8 million. The company generated $339.4 million as cash flow from operating activities in the first six months of the fiscal.Lions Gate, which shares space with major studios like Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.

However, what came as a surprise is that she now also wants reviewers to examine the company’s commitment to broadcasting standards. The U.K.’s Office of Communications commonly known as Ofcom had no problem regarding Twenty-First Century Fox’s capability to match U.K. broadcasting criteria. Earlier, Bradley also had no concerns about the company’s commitment toward broadcasting standards. As the matter is referred for further review the company expects deal to be sealed by Jun 30, 2018.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderTwenty-First Century Fox carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Per our Earnings Outlook report as of Nov 3, out of the 406 S&P 500 companies that have come up with their quarterly numbers, approximately 73.9% posted positive earnings surprises, while 66.7% beat top-line expectations.According to the report, earnings for the 406 S&P 500 companies that have reported are up 7.5% from the same period last year, while revenues have increased 6.3%. Further, the report projects that earnings for the total S&P 500 companies will improve 6.5% from the year-ago period with total revenues rising 5.6%.Let’s Take a Glance at Consumer Discretionary SectorHowever, the widely diversified Consumer Discretionary sector is likely to witness mixed results. Total earnings of the sector are likely to decline 1.2%, while revenues are estimated to increase 2.8% year over year. Media stocks form part of the Consumer Discretionary sector.Turning our focus to the Media industry, we note that few players have reported their results so far. Among media stocks which have reported their quarterly numbers, CBS Corporation (CBS  -  Free Report) and AMC Networks Inc. (AMCX  -  Free Report) posted mixed results, wherein earnings of both the companies surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same. Meanwhile, Time Warner Inc.  has surpassed both the top and bottom line in the third-quarter 2017.  Among media stocks lined up to report on Nov 9, let’s take a sneak peek at three companies.News Corporation (NWSA  -  Free Report), the diversified media conglomerate, is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell. The stock has a favorable combination of Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of +3.70%. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.News Corporation is in a transitionary phase looking to diversify revenue streams through strategic acquisitions and operational enhancement. The company is expanding its digital offerings, along with greater emphasis on real estate businesses and augmenting digital subscriber base. Further, it has been concentrating on cost cutting.However advertising, which forms a major part of total revenues, remains highly vulnerable to the economic conditions. Advertising revenue at the News and Information Services segment tumbled 12% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 due to sluggishness in the print advertising market, reduced in-store product revenue at News America Marketing and adverse foreign currency fluctuations. As a result, revenue from the News and Information Services segment declined 10% year over year.Analysts surveyed by Zacks now anticipate revenue from News and Information Services division to decline 1.6% during the first quarter but envisions growth of 7.8% and 9.7% across Cable Network Programming and Digital Real Estate Services segments, respectively. Book Publishing division is expected to witness revenue growth of 1%.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has increased by a penny in the last 30 days and is currently pegged at 2 cents. This reflects an improvement over a loss of one cent reported in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $1,978 million compared with $1,965 million reported in the prior-year period.

(DISH  -  Free Report), which is slated to report third-quarter 2017 financial results before the opening bell, has created an extensive portfolio of wireless spectrum. The company’s favorable combination of Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +1.68% raise optimism about the positive earnings surprise. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We are impressed with the company’s efforts to diversify business model from a pure-play satellite-TV operator to an Internet-TV operator. This should aid the company to counter competitive threats from low-cost video streaming operators. The launch of Air TV Player bodes well for DISH Network’s prospects.Moreover, DISH Network has been trying to lure customers for its Internet-TV service, Sling TV, by offering services at a reasonable rate along with the addition of other premium networks such as Showtime. Despite such efforts, the company has failed to gain subscribers in the broadband and pay-TV segment.In second-quarter 2017, DISH Network lost 196,000 pay-TV subscribers compared with a loss of 281,000 in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the company lost 46,000 broadband subscribers in the reported quarter compared with a loss of 15,000 in the prior-year quarter. This trajectory of subscriber losses in pay TV continues to signify an unprecedented annual decline. DISH Network continues to struggle with the persistent loss of subscribers due to cord cutting. Per the analyst surveyed by Zacks, DISH Network likely to lose 127,000 pay-TV subscribers in third-quarter 2017, compared with a loss of 196,000 subscribers in the preceding quarter.

In the previous quarter, the company had registered a positive earnings surprise of 3.3%. Moreover, it has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters with an average earnings beat of 1.8%. Let’s analyze some of the metrics impacting the company’s performance.Media Networks Likely to GainAfter witnessing a decline of 1% in the preceding quarter, the segment is likely to register a year-over-year increase of 0.8% owing to gain in revenues at Cable Networks. The analyst surveyed by Zacks expects revenues of $5,706 million, up from the prior-year figure of $5,658 million. Meanwhile, Cable Networks and Broadcasting are anticipated to report revenues of $4,009 million and $1,704 million up 1.3% and 0.1%, respectively. However, operating income from the segment is anticipated to decline 4.5% year over year to $1,597 million due to higher programming costs.Falling subscriber base and higher programming costs at ESPN remain major concerns. Fresh NBA agreement and increase in contractual rate for NFL programming has been driving the overall programming cost higher for ESPN. Disney is striving to bring back ESPN’s golden days. In an effort to attract online viewers, the company has inked a deal with video streaming, data analytics as well as commerce management company BAMTech. Disney which had earlier acquired 33% stake in BAMTech announced its intention to acquire another 42% stake in the firm.Parks & Resorts Attracting VisitorsDisney’s Parks & Resorts division are also doing well. Disney is focused on deploying its capital toward expansion of the Parks and Resorts business. Consequently, increasing market share and creating long-term growth opportunities. Disney’s Parks and Resorts segment is once again anticipated to deliver growth in final quarter of fiscal 2017. The consensus mark for revenues from the segment is pegged at $4,559 million, up 3.9% year over year. Further, operating income is also anticipated to increase by 4.4% to $730 million.Another Tough Quarter for Studios SegmentThe segment, which impressed investors with blockbuster hits in 2016 has somewhat disappointed in 2017 as the year has been a weaker one for movie industry. The segment revenues declined 16% in the third quarter as the movies released failed to match the prior-year hits of Captain America: Civil War, The Jungle Book, and Finding Dory. The trendy is likely to continue in the fourth as the analyst polled by Zacks expects revenues of $1,637 million, down 9.6% year over year. However, operating income is projected to register a gain of nearly 5% year over year to $400 million.

In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 39.8%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a loss of 13 cents, which has improved by a penny in the last seven days. It also fared far better than the loss of 50 cents reported in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Zacks, expect revenues of roughly $947.4 million, up 48% from the prior-year quarter.Factors Influencing the QuarterFrom abovementioned figures it is quite evident that Lions Gate is likely to report sharp improvement in both the top and bottom lines on a year-over-year basis. The company’s strategic acquisitions and alliances to enhance competitive position and maximize returns, along with building a diversified portfolio bode well for the stock.In first-quarter fiscal 2018, Media Networks’ segment formed after the acquisition of Starz reported revenues growth of 9.2% year over year on account of Starz new series American Gods and The White Princess. Earlier, Lions Gate acquired Summit Entertainment which further expanded its filmed entertainment library, while boosting feature film and home entertainment offerings.  Notably, the addition of Starz is aiding Lions Gate to emerge as a major player in the TV space and helping it regain lost ground in streaming network. Moreover, the company has invested in The Immortals to capitalize on the increasing popularity of eSports. It expects eSports market to grow over $1 billion by the next year.However, fewer movie releases in fiscal 2018 compared with the previous year may hurt Motion Pictures revenue performance. Dismal television production performance in the past few quarters has been also a concern for investors. In first-quarter fiscal 2018 Television Production revenues tumbled 18.6% following a decline of 3.5% in the preceding quarter. Further, the escalating cost of motion picture production and marketing in recent years may jeopardize Lions Gate’s margins.Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Lions Gate is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

379,NWSA,"Newspaper companies are transforming their business models to better position themselves in a multi-platform media universe. According to industry experts, these companies are focusing on mobile devices, online advertising based on user experience and personalized content to lower their dependence on traditional advertising revenues.The companies are also streamlining their cost structure, strengthening their balance sheet and restructuring their portfolioto offset declining revenues and shrinking market share. This has compelled many newspaper companies to undertake cost-cutting measures such as headcount trimming, pay cuts, furloughs, voluntary retirement programs and closure of printing facilities.Publishing companies have been offloading assets that bear no direct relation to the core operations.Let’s take a look at what’s happening in the publishing industry and how newspaper companies are adapting to the changing face of the media in the race for survival.Industry Game PlanNewspaper publishing companies are diversifying their revenue base. They are striving to expand their presence in broadcasting and digital products with the aim of lowering dependency on soft print media business and traditional advertising, thereby reducing susceptibility to economic conditions. In line with this, Gannett Co., Inc. (GCI  -  Free Report), The McClatchy Company (MNI  -  Free Report), Tribune Publishing Company, now known as tronc, Inc. (TRNC  -  Free Report) and Hearst newspaper group joined forces to form a new national advertising network – Nucleus Marketing Solutions – with the goal to assist advertisers in reaching out to a mass audience.In July 2016, Nucleus Marketing Solutions collaborated with the Rubicon Project, Inc. (RUBI  -  Free Report), which operates one of the largest advertising marketplaces in the world. Publishers via Nucleus make mobile, display and video inventory accessible to advertisers on Rubicon Project's technology platform.Newspaper publishing companies are even separating their broadcasting and digital properties from the sluggish print business. TEGNA Inc. (TGNA  -  Free Report) was formed after the parent company, Gannett spun off its Broadcasting and Digital and Publishing units into two separate entities. The publishing division retained the name of the parent company, Gannett Co., Inc.This is not the first time that any media company has spun off its publishing unit. Earlier, News Corporation (NWSA  -  Free Report) and Time Warner also separated their broadcasting and digital properties from their sluggish print business.The recent trend seen in the industry is that of consolidation. With an aim to strengthen its position in the newspaper industry, Gannett, in October 2015 entered into a deal to acquire Journal Media Group, Inc., the owner of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and other newspapers. In April 2016, the company completed the acquisition of the remaining shares. Journal Media Group was formed after Journal Communications and E.W. Scripps merged their broadcasting operations and split the newspaper business. The merged broadcast and digital media company, headquartered in Cincinnati, retained the name, The E.W. Scripps Company (SSP  -  Free Report).The acquisition of Journal Media Group added 15 dailies and 18 weeklies in 14 local markets under Gannett’s portfolio, increasing the daily and Sunday circulation by approximately 675,000 and 950,000, respectively. In September 2016, Gannett invested an undisclosed amount in Digg, a digital media company.This investment paves the way for USA TODAY NETWORK, Gannett’s media network, to obtain access to Digg’s industry-leading data. This is enhancing the network’s content distribution capacities. In July 2016, Gannett acquired North Jersey Media Group Inc. The buyout includes The Record (Bergen County), the Herald News, as well as their digital assets.In June 2016, Gannett entered into a deal to acquire digital marketing solutions company, ReachLocal, Inc. The deal, which was concluded in third-quarter 2016, is helping the acquirer to boost its digital offerings. The company also acquired leading golf publication, Golfweek.  In April 2017, Gannett acquired SweetIQ Analytics Corp., a provider of location and reputation management Software-as-a-Service solutions, which will help expand ReachLocal's portfolio of products. Gannett entered into a partnership deal with RealMatch that will help the former to enhance its recruitment advertising business.Gannett has also acquired majority ownership in Grateful Ventures — a digital media company — that specialized in lifestyle content including food and cooking websites as well as blogs. This investment is expected to strengthen and diversify USA TODAY NETWORK’s portfolio — a subsidiary unit of Gannett — alongside increasing its audience base. Also, it is likely to boost the parent company’s owned and operated digital websites.Another newspaper publishing company, The New York Times Company (NYT  -  Free Report) acquired a digital marketing agency and portfolio company, HelloSociety, from Science Inc., which complements the company’s T Brand Studio that helps in creating digital ad innovation and branded content.The New York Times Company is not only gearing up to become an optimum destination for news and information but is also focusing on service journalism, with verticals like Cooking, Watching and Well. In this regard, the company recently acquired The Wirecutter and its sister site, The Sweethome that provides recommendations about technology gear, home products and other consumer services. This May, the company officially commenced expanded coverage of Australia.Of late, publishing companies have been disciplined buyers of local media assets. New Media Investment Group Inc. (NEWM  -  Free Report) has been continuously looking for strategic buyouts. The company concluded the acquisition of Harris Enterprises, Inc. in November 2016 and also completed the buyout of the Ohio publishing division of Wooster Republican Printing Company in January 2017. The company also announced the sale of the Medford, Oregon Mail Tribune.New Media Investment Group recently entered into an agreement to buy many of the newspapers and related assets from Morris Publishing Group for $120 million and also teamed up withonline employment marketplace, ZipRecruiter, which is now the exclusive provider of recruitment advertising to all its print and online newspaper pages. Another media company, tronc, Inc. acquired all the outstanding interests of Daily News, LP., owner of the New York Daily News and NYDailyNews.com.Pay As You Access“To read further please subscribe” is the new mantra that newspaper companies are fast adopting. To curb shrinking advertising revenues and improve market share battered by the recent economic downturn, some of the publishing companies are now considering charging readers for online content. We believe that this will end the free usage of online content. Despite hiccups in the economy, the online subscription-based model still promises guaranteed revenue generation.The New York Times Company (NYT  -  Free Report), on Mar 28, 2011, launched a pricing system for NYTimes.com,whereby after browsing a certain number of free articles, readers will be asked to subscribe for complete access to its articles on phones, tablet computers and the Internet.The New York Times Company notified that the number of paid digital subscribers reached 2,333,000 at the end of the second quarter of 2017 — rising 114,000 sequentially (93,000 came from digital news products and 21,000 from Crossword product) and 63.4% year over year. The company is steadily taking strides to bring in more readers under the ambit of the subscription-based model.Bottom LineWith a strategic and steady newspaper budget, we could see fewer layoffs, increased focus on web and local content, improved subscription and concentration on profitable circulation. We observe that newspapers are turning more subscriber-oriented, offering reports in line with readers’ choice. We expect paywall strategies, new pricing techniques and product innovation to generate more revenues for the newspaper companies.We further believe that separating the publishing division will help to better exploit the potential of the broadcasting and digital businesses. Moreover, once the companies are spun off, they have separate management teams and a much more defined capital structure that provide ample room for strategic decisions related to any investment, acquisition or a new endeavor that can benefit that particular business, and in no way affect the other.Consolidation has also its benefits of a stronger base and wider reach. No wonder, publishing companies are boosting their strength to optimize business profits. As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the newspaper publishing industry over the long term. But what about investing in the space right now?Check out our latest Publishing Industry Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

(GOOGL  -  Free Report).It is still the United States’ largest broadband provider, with over 22 million high-speed Internet customers. Comcast has an impressive market value of almost $180 billion. Founded in 1963 and headquartered in Philadelphia, Comcast has created a media empire over the years due to smart acquisitions and media asset-building. Let’s take a look at what the media and entertainment conglomerate owns and operates.EntertainmentComcast has a big foothold in the entertainment industry, with many of its assets falling in film and television.FilmComcast owns popular film studio Universal Studios.

TIME subsidiary), Tele-Communications, Daniels & Associates, and the Century Southwest Communications Corporation, bought Group W Cable, a division of Westinghouse Electric Corporation.In 2001, it bought the largest cable television operator at the time, AT&T Broadband, a division of AT&T (T  -  Free Report), for over $44 billion.Then, in 2005, Comcast announced that it had bought Susquehanna Communications, a South Central Pennsylvania-based cable television and broadband services provider and unit of the former Susquehanna Pfaltzgraff company, for $775 million in cash. This gave the company about 230,000 basic cable customers, 71,000 digital cable customers, and 86,000 high-speed Internet customers.In partnership with Time Warner in 2006, Comcast purchased the majority of the floundering Adelphia Communications Corporation, which was the fifth largest cable company in the U.S. before filing for bankruptcy.Comcast began promoting its Xfinity service in 2010. This includes what they call their “triple play” services: digital cable, cable Internet access, and cable telephone.
