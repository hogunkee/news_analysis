1,PSA,"Real estate funds have been making a comeback since tumbling to recent lows. In fact, several are near potential buy points.Why? Most of these ETFs hold real estate investment trusts (REITs), high-yielding securities which tend to do better when interest rates are low. So investors bailed out as the 10-year Treasury yield climbed past 3% earlier this year. But they're getting back in as rates have slipped below 3% again.The $32 billion Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ) is in buy range from an 80.87 entry of a cup with handle. While shares are near a 52-week high, they are still about 11% below their August 2016 peak.Specialized REITs accounted for the biggest sector weight in the fund as of May 31, at about 27% of assets.

2,PSA,"American Airlines (AAL) on Wednesday cut its second-quarter unit revenue outlook on weaker domestic pricing power on airfares. The announcement appeared to surprise Wall Street, denting airline stocks and leaving analysts searching for reasons after rising fuel costs and strong demand have given airlines more leeway to charge passengers more to fly.One analyst, in wondering about reasons for the cut, said ""most fingers are being pointed at"" competition from Southwest (LUV). Others said American's less upbeat view on unit revenue was unusual because many airlines had suggested the worst fare discounting was behind them.American Airlines said it expected second-quarter unit revenue to increase around 1%-3%, lower than an earlier outlook for a 1.5%-3.5% gain. The carrier said the cut was due to ""lower than anticipated domestic yields."" Yields measure how much money an airline can get out of passengers when they book flights.Shares of American tumbled 8% to close at 35.96 on the stock market today. The carrier's stock has been at lows not seen before the 2016 election. Airline stocks this year have suffered due to higher jet-fuel costs and President Trump's trade-related provocations.Other airline stocks retreated as well. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports second-quarter earnings on Thursday, slipped 1.5%. United Airlines (UAL) lost 3.4%. Southwest fell 0.9%, touching its 50-day line.When fuel costs rise, investors prefer that airlines push fare costs higher. In a solid demand environment, higher fares usually translate into higher unit revenue. Unit revenue gauges how efficiently an airline operates by measuring sales in relation to an airline's overall flight coverage.""In an environment with higher fuel prices and what by all accounts seems to be very strong demand, it's curious that domestic yields would be weaker than expected,"" Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in a research note.""We have some theories but no concrete explanation. It seems like most fingers are being pointed at American's neighbor,"" he added, referring to Southwest.American on Wednesday also said it would lose $35 million in pretax income as a result of computer-system problems at PSA Airlines, a regional airline the carrier owns, that forced the cancellation of some 3,000 flights last month. But it said costs at non-fuel units would only be up 2.5%. That's less than the 3.5% bump expected earlier, due partly to lower-than-expected maintenance costs.The Trump administration on Tuesday said it would impose tariffs on an extra $200 billion in Chinese products. U.S. tariffs targeting $34 billion worth of Chinese products took hold on Friday. Some analysts worry that a full-blown trade war could force companies to cut spending. That spending pullback, in turn, could crimp corporate travel.As airlines prepare to report second-quarter earnings this month, Wall Street will be focused on how carriers can counterbalance rising fuel prices. American CEO Doug Parker said last month that customers could face rising airfare costs, as higher fuel expenses prompt carriers to pull back on the flights they offer. However, he said such a scenario was unlikely in the near term.Southwest, which reported June traffic results on Tuesday, has already pared back its full-year flight capacity. Delta could announce its own decision on how many flights it will ultimately offer for the rest of the year when it reports on Thursday.""In a rising jet fuel environment, airlines should be raising prices, and investors expect yields to show improvement to offset higher labor and fuel costs,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. ""The increase in yields will take time, but investors did not anticipate a reduction, mostly because most airlines have indicated that a lot of the deepest discounted fares have left the system.""She said that even though American has benefited from strong demand, that demand appeared to be the product of low fares. As jet-fuel costs rise and unit revenue flags, American would likely trim its fall and winter flight schedules as well, she said.""Demand remains solid but they need to show they can overcome rising fuel costs with higher fares,"" she said.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:S&P 500 Earnings Hot, But Will Trump's Trade Wars Chill Guidance?Delta Air Lines To Make This Key Decision Over Next Month As Fuel Hits ProfitTop Airlines Issue These Warnings As Higher Fuel Prices BiteAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

3,PSA,"Beware. Many breast and prostate cancer patients are getting diagnosed late in the game because of Obamacare's skimpy cancer screening regulations. Remember when President Obama repeatedly told Americans that greedy doctors were overtesting and overtreating them, and federal rules were needed to stop it? Now the evidence is in that some of those rules are killing us.Inadequate cancer screening is forcing women to undergo mastectomies and men to endure aggressive treatments with side effects. Many could have avoided these outcomes if they'd been diagnosed earlier.Last Friday, Dr. Elisa Port, chief of breast surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, presented compelling evidence about the harm done to women because of the Affordable Care Act's stingy approach to breast cancer screening.Starting in the 1980s, American women age 40 and over were advised to get annual mammograms. The healthy result of that standard of care is that women diagnosed with breast cancer had smaller, more treatable tumors. But in 2009, under President Obama, the United States Preventative Services Task Force declared women were getting too many mammograms. The USPSTF changed the recommendation from yearly starting at age 40 to once every two years starting at age 50.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWorse, the Affordable Care Act gave the USPSTF new clout, mandating that insurance companies pay for USPSTF-recommended tests with no out-of-pocket costs. Not so for other tests. Millions of women were suddenly misled into thinking the USPSTF's meagre new screening schedule was enough. Now the dire consequences are emerging.Port's blockbuster study, presented at the American Society of Breast Surgeons annual meeting, showed that women who hadn't had yearly mammograms were diagnosed with later-stage cancer, more apt to have the disease in their lymph nodes, and likelier to need mastectomies and chemotherapy than women who got yearly screenings. Port emphasized that her findings apply to women in their 40s, too. She urged them to get screened yearly.Men got bad news from another blockbuster study published in the Journal of Urology showing the harm done to prostate cancer patients by Obamacare and the USPSTF. Almost 30 years ago, widespread use of a simple blood test — the prostate specific antigen test — reduced the death rate from prostate cancer and the likelihood the cancer had metastasized to other parts of the body. PSA testing allowed cancer to be caught early. But in 2012, despite an outcry from urologists, the USPSTF announced that men should no longer routinely get the test.The latest prostate cancer research shows alarming results. In the years since the USPSTF's edict, men are being diagnosed when the disease is at a later stage and harder to treat. Medical progress is being reversed.Even before these headline-grabbing studies, evidence was mounting that the USPSTF's screening edicts were harming patients. Last year, research in Annals of Internal Medicine showed that PSA tests reduce prostate cancer deaths by almost one-third. ""This is a screening test that saves lives,"" said lead author Ruth Etzioni, of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Better late than never, the USPSTF backed off its misguided opposition to PSA testing and urged men to consult their own doctors.Defenders of the skimpy cancer screening rules insist aggressive testing produces too many false positives, exposing patients to needless anxiety as they wait for second tests or undergo biopsies. For every life saved with the PSA test, about five other men will be told they have abnormal cells and be put through the wringer before getting cleared.But let's get real. Enduring a false positive result, even if it means having to undergo a second test or a biopsy, pales in comparison to being told you have an untreatable cancer that was diagnosed too late and that you should say goodbye to your family.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

4,PSA,"RIP, Barbara Bush: The passing of former first lady and presidential mother Barbara Bush should have been a time for reflection on a life truly well-lived, both as a private person and as a public servant. Instead, the progressive left turned it into a political hate-fest. We need a safe space for civility.It used to be a tradition that, with the passing of a politician or a member of the family, old political foes would verbally tip their hats with a few kind words in tribute. Today, such once-routine courtesy doesn't merely seem archaic, but positively antediluvian.Twitter was awash with ugliness of the left kind following Barbara Bush's death, as captured on Twitchy.""RIP Barbara Bush, the only woman who was 92 for 30 years,"" tweeted Jen Spyra, a writer for ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWe suppose she was riffing on Bush's famously white hair, which, along with her ever-present string of pearls, gave her a classic matronly look. What Spyra's jibe didn't comprehend was that Barbara Bush's hair began to go white shortly after she turned 28, following the untimely death of her daughter from leukemia. It was care, worry and grief that turned her hair gray. It wasn't a fashion statement.Knowing that kind of ruins Spyra's cruel punchline, doesn't it?Far worse was this from ""Palestinian-American"" professor Randa Jarrar at California's Fresno State University, who tweeted out: ""Barbara Bush was a generous and smart and amazing racist who, along with her husband, raised a war criminal. F*#k outta here with your nice words.""Did she regret her vile comments? Not at all, since she doubled down with this: ""PSA: either you are against these pieces of sh#t and their genocidal ways or you're part of the problem. that's actually how simple this is. I'm happy the witch is dead. can't wait for the rest of her family to fall to their demise the way 1.5 million Iraqis have. byyyeeeeeeee.""Later, she gloated about being a tenured professor who makes ""100K a year doing that. i will never be fired."" We'll give her this: She made maybe the best argument ever for ending tenure.The Twitter spewage of hate by people who call themselves ""progressive"" didn't end there. A sampling, courtesy of DailyWire.com:Rosa A. Clemente: ""This is so disappointing. The things she and her family have down (sic) to global Black people is criminal, to say the least. She is part of the system of white supremacy, anti Black, anti feminist, as Malcolm said 'who taught you to hate yourself?'

Me: Ok, let me know when Henry Kissinger dies so we can have a party. Mom: Henry Kissinger is still alive?'""Peter Coffin: ""Geez, I get it. Barbara Bush is dead. Can we stop acting like it matters to anyone but a family of war criminals?""Calleigh Little: ""May Barbara Bush rot in pieces.""These are just some of the many other routine expressions of hate found on Twitter following Barbara Bush's death. There were many, many others. One can only hope that their authors' ObamaCare coverage includes mental health.Nor are these aberrations or out of the ordinary. In fact, the far left has steadily ratcheted up the hate quotient of its speech for years. The goal is to continue to shrink the space in which basic decency, conservative or even moderate political thoughts can flourish, by constant public attack, threats, noisy demonstrations, name-calling, derision and ridicule.But the tweets we reproduced above should be a reminder to all of who the real intolerant hatemongers are. And while conservatives are routinely silenced and even banished on progressive social media such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, we'll be surprised — no, stunned — if any of the above haters find themselves censured in any way at all.Worse still, those who engage in this type of routine demonizing and character assassination claim absolute moral superiority for their own beliefs as the reason why they're fully justified. No need to have a conscience.""In America today, being moral is out and moralizing is in,"" wrote John Daniel Davidson at The Federalist website. ""Just witness the nonstop spectacle of moralizing everywhere you turn — from The New Yorker's panicked denunciation of Chick-fil-A's 'infiltration' of New York, to gun control activist David Hogg's boycotts, to the protester with a megaphone shouting in a Starbucks clerk's face.""It seems that nonstop hate and demonizing of the ""other"" — along with endless, narcissistic moralizing about race, gender, immigration, sports, economics, #metoo, #takeaknee, politics and all other aspects of American life — are the defining characteristics of the far left these days.We feel terrible about filling an entire column with far-left bile, rather than the many public accounts of the goodness, decency and kindness of Barbara Bush. It's an injustice of sorts for which we apologize.And yet, we feel obligated to point out that, at a time when the beliefs of conservatives, libertarians and moderates of both parties are routinely labeled as ""intolerant,"" ""hate speech"" and ""fascistic,"" and when even supposedly respectable Democrats in Congress and former ""nonpartisan"" heads of our national security agencies routinely call the duly elected president ""morally unfit"" to serve, and when even moderate voices speaking on college campuses are shouted down and physically threatened, it's clear that civil discourse has suffered a serious, perhaps irreparable, breach.We hope most Americans agree: It's time to reclaim the civility that once was part of American public life. The response to Barbara Bush's death should be a wake-up call. If we can't return to decency and respect in public discourse, we'll bequeath our children and grandchildren a meaner, angrier and far less free America.In the meantime, rest in peace, Barbara Bush.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Do The Media Hate Trump (Part II)?

5,PSA,"As investors and Warren Buffett followers ponder what Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) will do with its swelling, record-high pile of cash, analysts say options include a major acquisition, buying more stocks like Apple (AAPL), doing nothing, or even a first-ever dividend.X The holding company held $109.3 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the third quarter and will grow by some $3 billion more in December thanks to a bet on the burger business years ago. The record cash hoard is more than five times the $20 billion that CEO Buffett likes to keep on hand, and many shareholders want to see Berkshire put the money to greater work.Hopes are high that Berkshire could shake things up with a deal to rival its $37 billion Precision Castparts purchase in 2016 or its $26 billion Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad purchase in 2010, especially since an attempt this year to buy electric utility Oncor fizzled, while investments in a real estate investment trust and a Canadian mortgage lender hardly made a dent in Berkshire's cash.Buffett even acknowledged to Berkshire shareholders in May that it had been a while since he had pressed his ""foot to the floor"" on an acquisition, and rued keeping so much cash just lying around. But he said the question is: ""Are we going to be able to deploy it?""One challenge facing a Berkshire megadeal is stiff competition among U.S. companies looking to grow through acquisitions. Just in the last month, CVS Health (CVS) agreed to buy Aetna (AET) for $69 billion and Disney (DIS) reached a deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) assets for $66 billion. The number of U.S. deals totaled 9,999 through Dec. 26, up 4.5% vs. all of 2016, according to Dealogic. And while deal values have slipped 14% to $1.492 trillion so far this year, they top the yearly average of approximately $1.137 trillion since 1995.Cathy Seifert, an equity analyst at investment research firm CFRA, thinks a key deal — or two — is likely. What she described as Berkshire's ""embarrassing"" Oncor loss may have left Buffett with the itch to prove his deal making chops, though she doesn't expect him to buy some hot tech company.""My sense is, valuation aside, there is still definitely an appetite to do deals,"" Seifert told Investor's Business Daily.A famously value-driven, opportunistic investor, Buffett's likely to scout for acquisition candidates in underperforming sectors as well as those that tend to do well late in the economic cycle. So think consumer staples, industrials, energy and telecom, Seifert said, adding that Buffett could also look abroad for acquisitions, especially Europe given the healthy recovery in many economies there.As for individual names that Berkshire could target, FactSet Research suggested Nike (NKE), Cognizant (CTSH), BlackRock (BLK), SAP (SAP) and Public Storage (PSA) among other companies. These companies check off Buffett's main acquisition criteria: sizable businesses, solid returns on equity, stable profits, low debt, able management, well-loved brands and simple business models.But any megadeal may be done with 3G Capital, which has teamed up with Buffett lately, including on the Kraft-Heinz (KHC) merger and the Burger King deal that eventually created Restaurant Brands (QSR).Actually, a splashy new deal is unlikely in the year ahead, said Robert Miles, the author of several books on Buffett. After a long bull market and stocks at record highs, a good deal is hard to find, and Buffett is ""a Walmart (WMT) shopper when it comes to stocks and companies"" — meaning, he looks long and hard at valuations.Miles said the 87-year-old Berkshire chief could bide his time ""until the next calamity in financial markets"" to jump on a megadeal.Meanwhile, the insurance segment remains Berkshire's cash cow and is its most important segment, notwithstanding this year's series of disasters that will force hefty payouts.The insurance operations require keeping a safe cushion for catastrophe claims, but it also produces a float — cash holdings from premiums collected ahead of claims that the company invests.Last year, Berkshire posted a combined $6.6 billion in underwriting profits and investment income tied to its prized and expanding float. So basically, Buffett ""got paid about 6%"" for holding his billions, Miles said. This puts the CEO in an enviable situation.""Buffett doesn't have to be in a hurry to go out and make silly investments,"" he added. ""He is getting paid to wait.""It's Berkshire's portfolio of stock holdings that draws especially intense interest, as Buffett fans try to mimic these investments. In Miles' view, Buffett could hand the cash pile over to Berkshire money managers like Todd Combs and Ted Weschler to buy more shares of Apple or smaller-cap equities.When it comes to stocks, Seifert thinks Buffett is more likely to continue to make equity investments in technology and financials.One thing he won't do? Speculate on some investment driving others to a fever pitch. ""He's not going to buy Bitcoin, I can pretty much guarantee you that,"" Miles said.Morningstar sector strategist Gregory Warren suggests Berkshire should try something new with its growing cash hoard: share repurchases and dividends.But that would mark a change of heart for Buffett. He is famously skeptical of such uses for excess cash, preferring to see it reinvested to grow businesses. But Warren argues that with more than $100 billion on its balance sheet, Berkshire should at least consider ""a large one-time special dividend"" soon.The windfall that will be seen on corporate ledgers after the GOP's tax cuts is expected to result in more repurchases and fatter dividends. And Berkshire stands to gain handsomely from lower taxes too.In September, when Congress was still discussing a 20% rate vs. the 21% that eventually passed, Barclays analyst Jay Gelb wrote that a cut to 20% could add $27 billion to Berkshire's book value by lowering its deferred tax liability and raise its earnings power by about 15%.MORE YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN:Where Are The Early Investing Hot Spots In Artificial Intelligence?The New Stock Gems: Which Top IPOs Are The Next Googles Or Ciscos?Before You Buy Bitcoin, Read This

6,PSA,"Contrary to Attorney General Sessions and others who suggest it shows the need for a 1980s-style crackdown on crime, the FBI's just-released report for 2016 — showing that violent crime has increased for the second consecutive year — does not actually demonstrate that we are experiencing a violent crime wave.Moreover, the administration's policy preferences threaten to undo reforms that are succeeding at the state and local levels. Even staunch Republican strongholds have pioneered new approaches to issues like jail overcrowding — crafting policies designed to shrink incarcerated populations. Policymakers should ignore Sessions' calls to ramp up prison populations and to return to failed policies from a bygone era.The uptick in violent crime in 2016 was small, rising just 4.1% from 2015. But multiple studies on crime rates in recent years conclude that variations of this size are normal and do not indicate a national epidemic. In fact, violent crime is still 12.3% lower than it was 10 years ago. Meanwhile, property crimes, which make up the lion's share of overall crimes, dropped for the 15th year in a row.Violent crime rates are substantially worse in large cities. Still, the increase in violent crimes is being driven by a handful of urban areas, and largely only by a select few communities within those cities. We shouldn't ignore trends in neighborhoods in Baltimore and Chicago — the pattern of violence in these cities is tragic and requires our fullest attention. But we're far from a catastrophic outbreak of crime across the nation. Americans are safer today than they have been at almost any time in the past 25 years.The attorney general's steadfast belief in a crime wave and his skepticism that ""small fry"" offenders even exist both undergird his support for hawkish crime policies: increasing incarceration populations, slapping harsh sentences on offenders and failing to distinguish between dangerous and nonviolent offenders.Meanwhile, bail-reform movements, which seek to reduce the number of low-level jail detainees, are gaining momentum across the country. The guiding principle behind bail reform is that we throw too many people in jail who shouldn't be there.While local jails do convicted individuals, usually serving short sentences, about 70% of jail populations are pretrial defendants who have not been convicted of a crime. Many are held simply because they can't afford bail, even though recent data show that pretrial jailees often are detained for nonviolent offenses.This situation makes us less safe. Detaining low- and moderate-risk defendants, even for a few days, correlates strongly with higher rates of new criminal activity. The likelihood that a defendant will reoffend increases with the length of their detention. Meanwhile, wealthy offenders who can afford bail often walk free. In one study, nearly half the defendants considered ""high-risk"" or dangerous were released, simply because they could afford bail.In one notable example, New Jersey recently replaced much of its cash-bail system with algorithmic risk assessments. New Jersey judges now use the Arnold Foundation's Public Safety Assessment (PSA) software, which uses individualized data to assess a defendant's pretrial risk and recommend whether they should be released, detained or released with surveillance. Since the system's implementation earlier this year, the state's jail population already has fallen by 15.8%, while violent crime fell by 12.4%.Kentucky similarly uses a pretrial risk-assessment system, which the Pretrial Justice Institute analyzed in 2010, finding its failure to appear and rearrest rates — 8% and 7%, respectively — were among the best in the nation. After further reforms in 2013 that included adopting the PSA, one Kentucky legislator estimated taxpayer savings of $30 million from downsized jail populations, while keeping FTA and rearrest rates among the lowest in the country.Local legislators also are focusing on how the criminal justice system treats individuals with drug and mental health issues. Law-and-order types often lack sympathy for behavioral-health defendants. Sessions has expressed that he believes just about all nominally nonviolent drug offenders are actually violent, and that the only reason they lack violent records is that they accepted plea deals. His views on drug offenders probably explain why he once sought to make second-time drug offenses punishable by death.Yet evidence suggests that many inmates are incarcerated without a public-safety justification, and mental-health problems are rampant among jail detainees. We also know that pretrial detention can substantially increase mental-health detainees' odds of reoffending, and that even brief stays in jail correlate harrowingly with suicide.To remedy the influx of detainees with rehabilitative needs, Texas expanded drug courts, which allow users to forgo incarceration if they agree to comprehensive supervision, drug testing and treatment. Texas' reforms saved taxpayers more than $3 billion, while crime rates have plummeted to a 49-year low and recidivism dropped steadily.Participating defendants in Washington, D.C.'s newly implemented mental-health court were 36% less likely than the comparison group to be arrested again in the year after completing the program. As part of the MacArthur Foundation's Safety and Justice Challenge, more than 30 counties — from Palm Beach, Fla., to Spokane, Wash. — along with the states of Connecticut and Delaware, are making changes to their jail systems by diverting mental-health and drug offenders, reducing reliance on cash bail and minimizing the number of nonviolent offenders in pretrial detention.The massive hike in incarceration rates in the 1980s helped bring down crime, though many other factors likely contributed. However, the collateral consequences of mass incarceration are obvious. It tears apart families, drives up government expenditures and, most importantly, it damages public safety.Many in the administration will use these new statistics to justify an old school war on crime. But they would be demonstrably wrong to claim that there is a crime wave, and their tactics to solve crime will only exacerbate it. Legislators and criminal justice policymakers would do well to ignore them.

7,PSA,"China's Great Wall Motor is eyeing a bid for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), in a fresh sign that China's scrappy and fast-growing automakers have global ambitions.XAn unidentified Great Wall executive told Reuters ""we currently have an intention to acquire"" some or all of the Italian-American automaker; another told the Associated Press that the company's interest is in the Jeep truck brand; and Great Wall President Wang Fengying told Automotive News that his company intends to buy Jeep and is ""connecting with FCA"" to negotiate a deal.However, Fiat Chrysler said in a statement that ""it has not been approached by Great Wall Motors in connection with the Jeep brand or any other matter relating to its business.""Great Wall is the biggest maker of SUVs and pickup trucks in China, which is itself the world's largest automotive market. The Jeep brand, one of Fiat Chrysler's most prized assets, would complement Great Wall's existing portfolio while boosting its ambitions to become the first Chinese automaker to go global.Fiat Chrysler has been busy ramping up its presence in China and is pumping out three Jeep SUV models in that critical emerging market: the Cherokee, Renegade and all-new Compass. CEO Sergio Marchionne is said to be looking for a partner or buyer to help the company cope with rising costs, emissions regulations and the development of electric and self-driving cars.Shares of Fiat Chrysler gapped up to add nearly 5% to 13.16 on the stock market today.

General Motors, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, Toyota Motor (TM) and Nissan (NSANY) all retook their 50-day moving averages, with GM also moving above its 200-day line.Smaller and crossover SUV sales seem to be offsetting continued weakness in cars.Kelley Blue Book (KBB) analysts reported Thursday that the estimated average transaction price (ATP) for light vehicles was $33,261 in May.""Transaction prices continue to climb at a steady rate, driven by the weakening sales mix of cars which is estimated at 38% in May, down from 41% one year ago,"" said Tim Fleming, analyst for Kelley Blue Book.While SUV segments are seeing double-digit sales growth this year, Fleming cautioned that there are signs that discounts for subcompact and luxury SUVs are growing quickly and are likely fueling that scorching demand.Automakers overall were expected to report almost-flat sales of new vehicles in May, according to KBB ahead of the release. That would be an improvement after sales fell in the first four months of 2017.Japanese automakers Honda Motor (HMC) and Toyota Motor (TM) posted mixed results for May sales. South Korea's Hyundai-Kia, which is heavily weighted toward cars, saw a sharp sales decline.Tesla (TSLA) does not provide monthly sales figures. Tesla will soon start rolling out its mass-market Model 3 sedan, although its Model X is missing out on America's ever-growing love affair with SUVs. Tesla shares fell 0.2% after hitting a record high intraday.A total of 1.53 million new light vehicles may have been sold in May, for a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.7 million, KBB estimated before Thursday's results.Though strong historically, the latest numbers add to evidence that Americans' appetite for new cars is on the wane. Hefty vehicle incentives and subsidies on leases helped to prop up sales in May.""Consumers are continuing to defect from the midsize car segment at a rapid pace,"" said Tim Fleming, analyst for KBB. ""Most commonly, they are turning to the compact SUV/crossover segment.""General Motors reported total May U.S. sales of 237,364 vehicles, down about 1% from last year. It was expected to post a 3.1% gain to 248,000 vehicles.Strong crossover demand across the Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac brands drove a modest gain in retail sales to 191,388 vehicles. GM has been cutting its reliance on sales to rental car agencies and other fleets.In May, GM crossover retail sales rose 19% compared to last year. Sales of the Cadillac XT5 grew 110% and the new GMC Acadia by 33%. Crossover sales may have offset declines in car and pickup-truck models, though GM's press release did not offer actual numbers for the latter.""The decline in total sales is primarily due to the industry's pullback from daily rental sales,"" said Mustafa Mohatarem, GM chief economist. ""Although total sales are running below our expectations, we anticipate retail vehicle sales will remain strong.""Daily rental sales were down 36%, commercial sales were up 14% and government sales were up 21%, GM reported.GM shares rose 1.5% to 34.43 in Thursday stock market trading. GM hit a six-month low last week.Ford Motor reported May U.S. sales rose 2.2% to 241,126 vehicles, citing strong F-series pickup truck sales and a 4.2% gain in SUV sales. Analysts had expected a 1.2% sales slide to 232,000.However, Ford's retail sales fell 0.8%. Fleet sales, which tend to be lower margin, climbed 8.4%.Ford rose 2.6% to 11.41.Fiat Chrysler saw May sales of of 193,040 units, a 1% decline vs. a year ago. It was expected to show a 4% drop to 187,000 vehicles.While retail sales rose 1% to 152,227 units, fleet sales fell 7% to 40,813 units. Fiat Chrysler, like some other U.S. automakers, is reducing sales to the daily rental segment amid rising inventories of used fleet cars.The Ram truck brand was a notable area of strength, with May sales up 18% vs. a year ago. The Jeep and Fiat brands slipped 15% and 16%, respectively, last month.Shares of Fiat Chrysler jumped 5.4%.Honda Motor total U.S. sales rose 0.9% year over year to 148,414  vehicles, modestly higher than estimates of a 0.6% gain to 148,000. Honda HR-V, the subcompact SUV, saw May sales jump 29% for a new all-time monthly record. The CR-V sport utility vehicle grew sales nearly 10% for the month.Honda's car segment continued to show strength, with the Civic and Accord brands posting sales of more than 31,000 for the month. That cemented their position as No. 1 and No. 2 in car sales for the year, Honda said.Toyota Motor sales in America fell 0.5%. Analysts had expected a 0.3% gain to 220,000. The SUV segment led the way in sales, , including a 19% jump for the RAV4, the company said.Nissan (NSANY) reported a 3% U.S. sales gain for May, far better than expectations of a 1.1% rise vs. a year earlier to 135,000 units. Like Ford, fleet sales boosted Nissan.Nissan shares rose 0.7%, Toyota 0.8% and Honda 1.3%.Hyundai-Kia saw May sales of 118,518 units, a 12% drop vs. a year earlier. That was far worse than the 4.4% decline expected. Cars comprise 69% of their sales mix vs. the 37% industry average.Sales at the Hyundai Motor division fell 16% in May to 60,011 units. Every model except the Accent subcompact and Tuscson compact crossover saw a drop in sales. Sales at the Kia division fell 7% in May to 58,507 units. Every model except the Forte compact saw a drop in sales.IBD'S TAKE: Ferrari has raced to the top spot in the auto manufacturers industry group. Visit Stock Checkup to learn why it ranks higher than peers such as Tesla, Fiat Chrysler and General Motors.Record U.S. industry vehicle sales in 2016 capped a hot seven-year growth streak. But the 2017 forecast is for a 1% to 4% decline. The automobile industry is braced for a slowdown as inventories pile up on dealer lots, especially for out-of-favor sedans and small cars.Aside from slumping sales, the automotive industry faces a headache in the form of auto loans. Terms lengths have crept up for both new and used car loans, which may spur Americans to delay future car buys. Subprime auto loan delinquencies also are up.

GM pulled out of Russia in 2015 and stopped manufacturing autos in Australia last year.General Motors' India unit will still produce vehicles, but only for export. Its South African plant will be sold to Isuzu Motors.""Globally, we are now in the right markets to drive profitability, strengthen our business performance and capitalize on growth opportunities for the long term,"" CEO Mary Barra said in a statement. ""We will continue to optimize our operations market by market to further improve our competitiveness and cost base.""Sales at GM International (which excludes Europe, South America and China) fell sharply in Q1, down 5.8% year over year. By comparison, GM South America saw a 10.8% jump in sales and GM North America grew sales 2.1%.GM International sales accounted for 6.3% of total global sales of 2.3 million.According to Barra, this international revamp will allow General Motors to commit more resources to ""future of personal mobility"" initiatives, which include autonomous driving.GM will save roughly $100 million as a result of the changes to its international strategy. Implementing those changes will involve a charge of roughly $500 million.Shares of General Motors rose 0.2% to 32.48 on the stock market today after tumbling Tuesday to a six-month low. The major market averages rose modestly Thursday after they suffered their worst one-day drop of 2017.The auto manufacturers industry group ranks No. 4 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD vs. No. 12 four weeks ago. But that's not due to General Motors or to Ford Motor (F), which is near six-year lows. Credit electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA) and sports car maker Ferrari (RACE). Tesla now has the highest market cap for any U.S. automaker, at $50.6 billion, just above GM's $49 billion and Ford's $43 billion.Back at home, U.S. auto sales have fallen for the past four months vs. a year earlier, with GM and others seeing weaker demand after years of big sales.

10,PSA,"General Motors (GM) beat first-quarter estimates Friday and credited its strong earnings performance to cost cuts and price increases as demand for full-size trucks and crossovers in the U.S. remained robust.Estimates: Earnings per share are seen rising 17.5% to $1.48, with revenue rising 9.4% to $40.75 billion.Results: EPS of $1.70 on revenue of $41.2 billion. North American income jumped 50% to $3.42 billion. Europe losses deepened to $206 million from $6 million a year ago on Brexit-related currency fluctuations. South American losses nearly doubled to $115 million from $67 million.""Our strong first quarter resulted from continued top-line growth and an intense focus on

""As we refresh our crossover portfolio in the next several months, we expect to stay on track to meet our financial commitments for the year.""Stevens later said GM made $500 million in cuts and boosted North America earnings by $400 million via price hikes. He added that the company is watching inventory level closely amid signs of slowing demand.On Friday, the Commerce Department reported Q1 GDP ticked up just 0.7% on an annualized basis, as weak auto sales drove the weakest consumer spending performance since 2009.Stock: Shares rose 0.3% to 34.64 on the stock market today, after rising as much as 2.2% earlier. Ford, which reported first-quarter earnings on Thursday, was flat. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), which reported results Wednesday, added 0.9%.In March, General Motors said it had agreed to sell two European car lines, Opel and Vauxhall, and the European operation of its financial unit to France-based PSA, the maker of Peugeot. Opel and Vauxhall had lost money for years.Ford, during its earnings call on Thursday, said GM's turn away from Europe represented an opportunity, even as Brexit's impact on the pound throws off the foreign exchange rate on sales.Ford on Thursday said it expected higher commodity costs, particularly in steel, to weigh on the company this year.The company also said Thursday that used-vehicle prices would likely fall further, but that the oversupply of used cars and other issues overshadowing the industry had been incorporated into its business outlook.Used vehicle prices have fallen as more vehicles leased two or so years ago come off lease and are returned to dealers, creating extra supply. Cheaper used cars can be more attractive to customers, meaning they might be less likely to buy new ones.Wall Street has also been worried about slowing U.S. sales even as incentives rise and credit remains relaxed. Loan delinquencies have also drifted higher.RELATED:General Motors Dives On Margins, Trump 'Uncertainty'; Tesla Tests Buy PointFord Hiring 400 BlackBerry Engineers In Connected Car Push: Report

12,PSA,"Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) stock rocketed to an all-time high Wednesday after the No. 1 medical tech player reported 18% procedure growth in the first quarter and unveiled an upgrade for its robotic surgeon platform.Intuitive Surgical stock closed 6.4% at 807.94 on the stock market today, after announcing its first-quarter results late Tuesday. Shares led IBD's 58-company Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group, which broadly rose 2.8%.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar called the results especially strong for such a big name.""Generally for high growth/high (price/earnings value) names like Intuitive Surgical, the numbers have to be pretty solid all around to sustain multiples,"" Kumar said. ""We think Intuitive Surgical managed to put up enough to satisfy elevated expectations.""Procedure growth launched to 18% in the first quarter following a change in guidelines for testing prostate-specific antigen by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The group now encourages men ages 55-69 without signs or symptoms to talk with their doctors regarding the potential benefits and harms of screening. Men above the age of 70 should not be screened as the potential benefits don't outweigh the harms.Intuitive's robotic tools are used in a number of urologic and gynecologic settings. During the recent Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons conference, experts said hernia treatments are likely to grow 40% in 2017.""Along with a change in PSA testing guidelines by (the task force), we think procedures should trend in the midteens range for Intuitive Surgical,"" Kumar said. On Tuesday, Intuitive guided to 12%-14% procedure growth in 2017, up from earlier views for 9%-12%.IBD'S TAKE: In 2008, Intuitive Surgical was a leader in the medtech world. Can it get there again?

13,PSA,"PSA Group is betting that size is the answer in Europe's saturated car market as it buys the ailing regional division of General Motors (GM) despite years of losses.The maker of Peugeot and Citroen cars will pay 1.8 billion euros ($1.9 billion) for GM's Opel unit and its U.K. sister brand Vauxhall, as the French manufacturer bolsters its defenses in a peaking market that's being transformed by technology, new competitors and Brexit. GM, which is taking a charge of $4 billion to $4.5 billion, will retain a toehold in the area by continuing to sell Chevrolets in small volumes.""It gives us the opportunity to become a real European champion,"" PSA Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares said Monday after announcing the deal, which reinstates the French company as the region's second-biggest auto manufacturer. ""Our plan is to build a common future for Opel and Vauxhall and fix the existing issues.""Picking up GM's 1.2 million annual deliveries allows PSA to solidify a turnaround following its 2014 bailout, by spreading the costs for developing new vehicles across a larger network while achieving the savings necessary to compete amid Europe's high wages and wafer-thin profit margins. Gaining scale is vital for mass carmakers as they try to stay ahead of self-driving and electric-car innovations and compete with new entrants including Uber Technologies.GM, which has owned Opel for almost 90 years, is cutting ties after the division missed a target to break even in 2016, contributing to losses that have totaled about $9 billion since 2009. In addition to the charge, GM is on the hook for much of Opel's pension obligations and will pay PSA 3 billion euros to settle some retirement plans. Still, the deal will free up about $2 billion in cash, which GM plans to use for share buybacks.PSA shares rose as much as 5.25% in European trading to 20.06 euros, the highest level since July 2011. General Motors rose as high as 38.55 soon after the opening bell on the stock market today, its highest since March 2015 and just above a 38.47 buy point. But shares have reversed to trade down 0.4% to 38.07.IBD'S TAKE: General Motors had rallied on reports of an Opel deal. GM is trying to clear a flat base with a buy point of 38.47. Despite Opel's woes, GM had previously given bullish guidance for 2017.While job and production cuts are likely as the two companies offer a similar slate of mass-market cars from high-cost locations in Germany, France and the U.K., Tavares vowed to honor existing labor agreements and said that closing factories is a ""simplistic"" solution.""We don't need to shut down plants,"" he said, echoing promises made repeatedly in recent weeks as PSA executives toured Europe to win support for the deal from workers and politicians.Bringing the two automakers together will yield annual savings of 1.7 billion euros by 2026 by combining development costs, factory investments and purchasing. That will help Opel generate an operating profit margin of 2% of revenue by 2020 and 6% by 2026.Implementing the savings measures will cost about 1.6 billion euros. Initially the deal will be a drag, with PSA's profit margin from automaking likely to drop to 3.8% from 6%, according to an estimate from UBS AG.""This move, on paper, is a good deal for PSA,"" in part because it gives the French carmaker access to GM's expertise on electrification and fuel cell technologies, Bryan Garnier & Co. analyst Xavier Caroen wrote in a note to clients. However, ""implementing synergies will take time, diluting group's PSA margin on the short term, while risk of further cannibalization between brands could occur.""Tavares's focus on growth comes after a bailout three years ago by the French state and Dongfeng Motor and a painful restructuring that included freezing pay, weeding out unprofitable models and shutting a plant. PSA went from net losses starting in 2012 to profit in 2015, and generated 2.7 billion euros in cash in 2016. This year, for the first time since 2011, the company will pay a dividend.The deal propels PSA to second place in Europe with a 16 percent market share, behind only Volkswagen (VLKAY) with 24% and pushing it past Renault following a steady decline in recent years.The transaction, with a total value of 2.2 billion euros, includes GM's European auto brands and a stake in its local financing business. PSA will pay 1.13 billion euros in cash and 650 million euros of warrants that will be issued to the U.S. carmaker. PSA is acquiring the financing division in a joint venture with BNP Paribas, which accounts for the remaining 460 million euros.

20,PSA,"Real estate investment trusts were big winners for much of the year, as investors sought out juicy payouts in a world of low or even negative interest rates. But with bond yields rising amid growing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike, property REITs such as Store Capital (STOR) and Simon Property Group (SPG) are selling off.REITs get special tax treatment as long as they pass on nearly all earnings to investors. Many pay attractive yields and in the low-interest world they've also delivered significant share price appreciation. But the stocks peaked a few months ago, with many REIT stocks breaking their 50-day moving averages or their 200-day lines in recent days.IBD'S TAKE: Fed rate hike talk is sinking REITs and utilities, but it's giving a boost to financials. See which big bank stocks have joined JPMorgan Chase in a buy zone this week.Store Capital is the only property REIT in the IBD 50. Store — an acronym for Single Tenant Operational Real Estate — focuses on single-occupant commercial real estate. Earnings growth has been strong, with a 4.1% dividend yield.But shares fell below the 50-day moving average last week. Store Capital sank 3.75% to close at 27.49 on the stock market today, hitting the lowest levels since late June.Simon Property Group owns many malls. That's a tough business with many retailers slashing stores in the face of competition from Amazon (AMZN).Simon Property fell below its 50-day moving average in early August, and found resistance at that line over the next several weeks. Recently shares have crumbled, tumbling through the 200-day line on Monday. Shares closed down 1.6% at 195.72, and are off 5.5%% so far this week.Crown Castle (CCI) and American Tower (AMT) are both REITs that own cellphone towers used by telecoms.Crown Castle has been trading below its 50-day line since early August, with a couple of exceptions. Shares fell 2% Wednesday, through its 200-day line. Crown Castle hasn't closed below that key level since early February.American Tower plunged below its 50-day on Sept. 9. It tried to retake that line on Friday but reversed lower. Shares have plunged 5% so far this week to a 3-month low, including 2.9% on Wednesday, heading for the 200-day line.Public Storage (PSA) owns self-storage facilities across the country. Shares peaked in April, then decisively undercut the 50-day and 200-day lines in late July. Public Storage has continued to fall. Shares slid 1.8% Wednesday afternoon, hitting a 52-week low.RELATED:Real Estate Is Newest S&P Sector

21,PSA,"Given all the other fireworks that went off before and after the last presidential debate, it's not surprising that Donald Trump's attack on Canada got little notice in the national press.  But it did set off a deluge of protests from people who follow health care.In answer to an audience question about problems with ObamaCare, Trump dropped a bomb on Canada. Hillary Clinton, he said, ""wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It's catastrophic in certain ways.""While ""fact checkers"" were quick to claim that Clinton doesn't favor a single-payer health plan (despite praising it in the past) and that Canadians like their health care system, few pointed out that Trump's comment was a 180 degree turn from what he said about Canada's health care system a year ago in the first GOP debate.""As far as single payer, it works in Canada,"" Trump said. ""It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked (here) in a different age, which is the age you're talking about.""So which Trump is correct? Does Canada's single-payer system work, as Trump once believed, or is it the disaster he now claims.If you look at the barrage of responses to Trump's latest statement, you'd come away convinced that Canada's health care system is a thing of beauty.Canada, we are told, spends a smaller share of its GDP on health care than the U.S. (11% vs. 17%) and does better on quality measures like infant mortality and life expectancy. And polls show strong public support for Canada's system.But it turns out that Trump is absolutely right about Canada's system being slow.A January 2016 Commonwealth Fund report found that 29% of Canadians waited two months or longer to see a specialist, compared with 6% in the U.S., and 18% of adults waited four months or longer for elective surgery, compared with 7% in the U.S.Clinton herself has admitted as much. In a recently released transcript of a 2013 speech she gave, Clinton said Canada ""can get costs down because … they do impose things like waiting times, you know. It takes longer to get like a hip replacement than it might take here.""What about Trump's claim that lots of Canadians go out of the country for treatments?Vox.com blasted Trump with a piece headlined ""No, Trump, Canadians do not flee en masse for US health care."" But that's not what Trump said at all. Instead, he claimed that they do so ""in many cases"" and qualified this further by saying it's ""when they need a big operation.""That, too, is absolutely correct. A Fraser Institute study found that 52,000 Canadians sought non-emergency medical treatments outside of the country in 2014 — up from 42,000 the year before. It also found that leave rates were higher for specialty care and that wait times were often to blame.""In 2014, patients could expect to wait 9.8 weeks for medically necessary treatment after seeing a specialist — 3 weeks longer than the time physicians consider to be clinically 'reasonable' (6.5 weeks),"" the report stated.The New York State Department of Health reports that hospitals in Buffalo, N.Y., provided 1,000 Canadian patients with ER, inpatient and outpatient services in 2014. A Canadian consulting firm hired by hospitals in Syracuse, N.Y., said that hospitals there could lure a significant number of eastern Ontario's medical consumers frustrated by long waits.How about quality of care?A study published by the highly respected National Bureau of Economic Research found that the two measures frequently cited to show that Canada does better on quality than the U.S. -- infant mortality and longevity — are notoriously unreliable because of wide differences in demographics and behaviors.Americans don't seem to realize that Canada is a vastly different country. It has a tiny population (smaller than California) that is far less diverse (just 3.5% are black or Hispanic compared with 27% in the U.S.). The murder rate in Canada is a third of what it is here. Obesity rates are far lower. And Canadians have far fewer low-birthweight babies.When you control for those and other differences, the authors found, Canada's supposed quality advantage basically disappears.The authors then looked at things like screening tests and cancer survival rates, and found that people were far more likely to get screening tests like mammograms, Pap smears, PSA tests, and colonoscopies in the U.S. than in Canada. As a result, the ""U.S. health care system is generally more successful in the detection and treatment of cancer.""Then there's the problem of fiscal solvency. Since health spending consumes a vast proportion of its spending, when Canada needs to cut costs, it invariably targets health care.In 2011, for example, Canada's conservative leadership cut health care dollars sent to the provinces by $36 billion. Critics said it was a ""frontal attack on public health care."" But after liberals took over, they kept the cuts in place.In Ontario, spending on hospitals has been flat for four years, and earlier this year doctors protested cuts in Ontario's health care budget, which they said were causing family practices and hospitals to close their doors.Whether all this qualifies as a disaster depends on your perspective, but it hardly makes Canada a shining example for health care reform, which was Trump's point. At least for the time being.RELATED:Canadian Health Care: Patients Waiting Longer Than Ever For TreatmentNo, The Public Doesn't Suddenly Support Socialized MedicineThe Slow Slide Into Single-Payer Health Care

22,PSA,"While exchange traded funds are ideal for producing short- and long-term investment gains, many ETFs can be deployed to generate steady income from stock dividends and bond interest.ETF investment strategies for generating income fall into five main categories:The highest yielding U.S. bond ETF tracked by Morningstar Inc. right now is SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond (JNK). Its 12- month yield sits near 6%. It's followed by First Trust Tactical High Yield (HYLS) yielding 5.6% and SPDR Short-Term High Yield Bond ETF (SJNK) yielding 5.5%.But seeing a fat yield on an ETF can be misleading. A big payout doesn't mean as much if the fund's total return is slipping. JNK has returned 11.31% year to date and an average annual 2.53% the past three years. That compares with 7.16% and 4.13% for HYLS and 10.8% and 1.64% for SJNK.Ranked by three-year returns, the top performer is Pimco 25+ Year Zero Coupon U.S. Treasury (ZROZ), up an average annual 18.39% the past three years and 20.44% year to date, and yielding just over 2%. It is followed by Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury (EDV), up 17.1% and 18.6% over the respective periods, and yielding 2.4%. Next is iShares 20 Year Treasury Bond, at 11.8% and 13.1%, and yielding 2.2%.Junk bonds and long-duration Treasury bonds are subject to bouts of heightened volatility, which investors looking for income often seek to avoid. So they're better off using ETFs that track these kinds of bonds as part of a diversified portfolio that contains steadier bonds.The benchmark for diversified bond portfolios is the Barclays Aggregate Bond index, which is made up of a broad array of investment-grade bonds. The index is tracked by iShares Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG), which has $190 billion in assets. It's up 5% year to date and an average annual 3.96% the past three years. It yields 2.3%.Those who prefer bonds need to be aware that anticipated interest-rate hikes could affect potential returns.In general, bond ETFs with higher durations will be more negatively impacted than those with shorter durations as expectations increase for higher rates. Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of bond price to changes in interest rates. Duration is tied to a bond's maturity, or the date at which the bond's principal is repaid to lenders. Investors can check an ETF's website for the average duration.For example, if rates rise, a long-term ETF such as iShares 20 Year Treasury (TLT) incurs more interest rate risk than iShares 3-7 Year Treasury (IEI), notes Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF Research at S&P Global Market Intelligence.""In short, if rates trend higher over time, returns for bond ETFs will be negatively impacted, but not equally,"" he said. ""However, one rate hike by the Fed should not be that impactful.""The highest yielding ETFs can bring big payouts, but if the quality of their holdings declines, the total return could be sapped by declining prices in unfavorable markets. The top yielding dividend stock ETF is Global X SuperDividend Alternatives (ALTY), paying out 8.2% of its stock price annually. It's a small, young ETF with just $3 million in assets and without a three-year record. It's up almost 19% this year.Its older and bigger sibling, $807.4 million Global X SuperDividend (SDIV), yields 6.7% and has gained 12% this year and an average annual 11.27% the past three years.High-yield stock investors tend to prefer stocks whose declines are about over. In that way investors can reap big payouts for each dollar invested with the hopes of capital appreciation as the business turns around. Not all ETFs screens for stocks in this way. One that does is Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF (DIV). Its index methodology screens for stocks that have exhibited low betas relative to the S&P 500 in an effort to produce low-volatility of returns. It's up 9% this year and has risen an average annual 6.8% the past three years. Top holdings include Cone Midstream Partners (CNNX) and Invesco Mortgage Capital (IVR).At the other end of the spectrum, lower yielding ETFs invest in companies that have a long history of increasing dividends. Only top quality companies can increase payouts year after year, and they tend to be in big demand by investors looking for steady capital appreciation. Their stock prices rarely get whacked to the point where they have big yields.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers Select Index. It holds 185 stocks, each of which has grown dividends annually for 10 years or more. It yields 2.1% vs. SPDR S&P 500's (SPY) 2%. Top holdings include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Microsoft (MSFT) and Pepsi (PEP)ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) holds 50 stocks, a smaller list that reflects a higher barrier to entry -- each holding has raised dividends every year for 25 years or more. It yields 1.8%. Top holdings include Cintas (CTAS), W.W. Grainger (GWW) and S&P Global (SPGI).SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), which invests in dividend aristocrats from the S&P Composite 1500, has jumped 15% year to date. It yields 2.4%. Top holdings include property REIT HCP (HCP), People's United Financial (PBCT) and Caterpillar (CAT).Safe to say, MLPs are best left to the pros who know when to get in or out, or how to use them as portfolio diversifiers.Morningstar tracks 20 REIT ETFs. The top-performing one year to date is Global X SuperDividend REIT (SRET). It's up 27.4% this year and yields about 8%, the third-highest. The index it tracks, the Solactive Global SuperDividend REIT index, invests in 30 of the highest dividend-yielding REITs in the world with the least amount of volatility.Nearly all of the $33 million ETF's assets are invested in North America. Top holdings include mortgage REITs Annaly Capital Management (NLY), which yields 10.1%, and Chimera Investment (CIM), yielding nearly 12%, as well as property REIT Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH) yielding 6.6%. The REIT was launched in March 2015.The biggest REIT ETF is $35.59 billion Vanguard REIT (VNQ). It's up 14% year to date and yields 3.3%. Its top holdings along with their year-to-date price performance include Simon Property (SPG), up 12%, Public Storage[ticker symb=PSA] down 7%, and Prologis (PLD) up 30%. They all yield about 3%.Convertible bonds are bonds that can be exchanged for a set number of the issuing company's common stock. They tend to carry lower interest than normal corporate bonds but have the potential for greater price appreciation.The top performing ETF in this area year to date is $471 million VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials (PFXF). It's up 12% and yields 5.6%. The largest is $17.86 billion iShares U.S. Preferred Stock (PFF). It's up 3.8% this year and yields 5.74%.RELATED:The Latest ETF News

23,PSA,"Investing in real estate may help to build a strong foundation in your investment portfolio. These securities diversify portfolios, generate income and hold potential for capital growth -- a trifecta of benefits for ETF investors.And several REIT exchange traded funds may be poised for a sizable rally, having found support around their 200-day moving averages after a recent pullback. They include Vanguard REIT (VNQ), iShares U.S. Real Estate (IYR) and Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE), which are among the five largest funds in the sector.Real estate debuted as the 11th S&P 500 sector Monday, commanding a roughly 3% weighting in the large-cap index. It's a timely move, given the performance and popularity of REIT exchange traded funds with investors in 2016.As a stand-alone sector, REITs will gain added visibility that may serve to further increase asset flows into this asset class, says Adam Patti, CEO of IndexIQ, the firm behind IQ US Real Estate Small Cap ETF (ROOF). Active managers, many of whom underweighted real estate when it was part of the financial sector, may be forced to adjust.Demand for U.S. real estate securities held strong ahead of the industry's elevation as a new S&P 500 sector. Investors poured $1.33 billion into real estate ETFs in August, following $1.60 billion in July, according to Morningstar data.""The popularity of REIT ETFs persisted last month"" even as other yield-focused ETFs, such as rate-sensitive telecom services and utilities, saw significant outflow, Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote Sept. 13.On the stock market today, VNQ showed bullish momentum, extending Wednesday's gains from the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged in September. The Fed left the door open to hikes later this year. Several other REIT ETFs showed similar action.Investors in REITs should monitor interest rates closely. Lower rates typically make it easier to buy, sell and refinance property, which boosts demand for real estate. Conversely, the sector tends to sell off when rates trend up.IBD'S TAKE: Recent changes to a widely used classification system for equities could significantly impact how fund investors allocate resources.Among real estate ETFs, Vanguard's VNQ dominates in terms of net inflow so far this year, raking in $5.75 billion through August. The $34.83 billion ETF holds traditional real estate such as self-storage company Public Storage (PSA) and health care REIT Welltower (HCN).By comparison, its iShares rival IYR also holds newer ""specialty REITs"" focused on timber, communications or other areas. They include American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI), former telecoms that have restructured as REITs, Rosenbluth noted.And the young XLRE invests exclusively in S&P 500 components. This ETF launched in late 2015 in anticipation of the landmark change to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) -- a taxonomy for equities -- that carved out real estate from financials as a stand-alone sector.XLRE swelled from a few hundred million in assets to $2.82 billion as the GICS changes took effect this month. The five largest real estate ETFs skew toward big REITs like Simon Property Group (SPG) and Vornado Realty (VNO).IndexIQ describes ROOF as the only way for investors to gain access to the small-cap segment of REITs and real estate holding companies. It invests across the commercial, residential and specialized REIT sectors.The ETF is relatively small in assets and thinly traded, but has vaulted over the five largest funds so far in 2016.ROOF jumped 16.2% on the stock market year to date through Sept. 21. By comparison, VNQ gained 11.8% over the same period, XLRE 6.8%, and ETFs tracking the S&P 500 7.5%.Index IQ's Patti thinks ""REITs still have room to run"" because they got hit fairly hard in 2015. Funds holding smaller REITs may offer an especially attractive opportunity for investors.Small caps as a group provide higher dividend yield than large caps, according to Patti. ROOF currently has a 12-month yield of 3.80% and VNQ 3.27%.The former invests in the bottom 10% of the domestic REIT market in terms of market capitalization, while filtering out the smallest and most illiquid names. Patti described ROOF's 67 stock holdings as ""hidden gems"" that are underowned and offer attractive relative value. They include First Industrial (FR).Added flow of money to real estate as a new sector could further extend valuations for large caps, while reducing their dividend yield, according to Patti. That dividend income is a big reason why investors seek out REITs in the first place. Real estate investment trusts generate yield by distributing 90% of their earnings as dividends.""The reality is if you're investing in REITs for yield and diversification, you should look at small caps,"" Patti said. He suggests that investors carve out 15% of their overall REIT exposure for the small caps in ROOF.RELATED:The First New S&P 500 Sector Since 1999 Is A Big Deal For InvestorsWith Yields As High As 10%, Real Estate Funds Drum Up Assets And AppealKey Debut For Real Estate Is A Big Opportunity For ETF InvestorsMeet The First New Sector SPDR ETFs In 17 Years

"
25,PSA,"Real estate soon makes its debut as the newest S&P 500 sector, in a sign that this once-niche asset class is all grown up and ready for a far more prominent role in investors' portfolios.In November 2014, S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI announced that real estate was being moved out from under the financial sector and elevated to its own sector. The change was driven by investor demand, the indexing giants said. Now, the index changes are being formally implemented.MSCI-based indexes will be rebalanced after the market close on Aug. 31 and S&P-based products will be rebalanced on Sept. 16. Exchange traded funds tracking them will follow suit.The changes are consequential — real estate is the first new sector since 1999, when the S&P 500 index was carved into 10 broad sector slices. It will have a bigger weight than materials and telecom in the large-cap index starting in September, and be almost even with utilities. The financial sector's weighting will nudge lower to roughly 13%.The promotion recognizes, first and foremost, real estate's growing importance to major world economies. It now has a $596.28 billion market cap in the S&P 500 alone. It accounted for a minuscule 0.2% of that large-cap bogey's market cap in 2001 vs. a current 3.1%.More companies, like former telecoms American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI), are converting to a real estate investment trust (REIT) structure, in part for a favorable tax status. So this asset class, which used to fit inside that narrow sleeve of investment portfolios dubbed alternatives, is being used more and more for strategic asset allocations.Its elevation also should bring more attention to a dividend-rich sector that has outperformed this year.""REITs are an important portfolio diversifier and income producer, and now perhaps the added visibility that a stand-alone sector provides will serve to increase asset flows into this sector,"" said Adam Patti, CEO of IndexIQ, the firm behind IQ US Real Estate Small Cap ETF (ROOF).Real estate yielded 3.09% and gained 10.1% in 2016 through Aug. 10, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. By comparison, the S&P 500 as a whole yielded 2.11% and gained 6.4% over the same period.For fund investors, the launch of the new sector can have a profound impact on portfolio choices, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence, which operates independently from S&P Dow Jones Indices.""In a passive investment world, this is an active change that's taking place,"" Rosenbluth told IBD. ""The more investors understand about it, the better prepared they can be.""IBD'S TAKE: Compare and contrast how the best REITs are faring on various fundamental and technical metrics at IBD Stock Checkup.Investors aiming for a simple, diversified portfolio with one or two funds such as SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), Vanguard 500 (VOO) or iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH) won't really be affected by the index changes. Those funds offer exposure to both financials and REITs, and will continue to do so.""Nothing changes for you"" as a result of the index rebalance if you own SPY or its peers, said Dave Mazza, head of research for SDPR ETFs. While stocks like Public Storage (PSA) may be categorized under the new real estate sector, ""at the end of the day, you own the same stocks,"" he added.For those who take a sector-based approach to investing in ETFs, the changes will be more significant.Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), the $15.73 billion category heavyweight, will drop its exposure to equity REITs after the reclassification. Mortgage REITs remain in the financial sector. The real estate equity holdings are slated to be transferred on an in-kind basis from XLF to Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE), a young ETF that will subsequently balloon from $115 million in assets to about $3 billion.Investors in XLF will receive a special dividend on Sept. 22, in the form of shares of XLRE. At the end of the entire transaction, a current investor in XLF will own shares of the revamped XLF as well as XLRE, providing the same exposure combined as the investor had before with XLF alone.The special dividends will reflect the ratio of real estate in the financial sector, which is roughly 20% now. According to Mazza, the in-kind process made possible by the ETF structure will minimize costs tied to rebalancing XLF, one of his firm's largest ETFs and the most heavily traded after SPY. The implementation was designed to be as tax-efficient as possible, ""opposed to selling $3 billion worth of real estate,"" he told IBD in a phone call.Once investors receive the XLRE shares, it will be up to them to maintain real estate exposure, add to it, sell it or trim it depending on their view of the sector's outlook, said S&P Global's Rosenbluth.Similar changes are afoot for other financial ETFs including Vanguard Financials (VFH), Fidelity MSCI Financials (FNCL), Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials (RYF) and PowerShares S&P SmallCap Financials (PSCF).But not every ETF sponsor is making adjustments the same way. The Vanguard Financials ETF will drop the real estate securities that no longer belong in the underlying index. Investors in VFH will have to buy Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ) or a similar ETF to retain real estate exposure.Other financial ETFs that don't track S&P and MSCI benchmarks are not affected, such as iShares U.S. Financials (IYF).Longer term, investors will have to examine the performance, income and tax consequences of the changes. Year to date, Vanguard's real estate ETF has far outpaced its financial sibling in both performance and asset gathering. VNQ has gained 13.5% vs. 3.7% for VFH. The former raked in $5.19 billion in fresh money through July — more than any other sector equity ETF and a far cry from the heavy outflow for some of the largest financial funds.And without REITs, financial ETFs will yield less and likely be more volatile. However, the income from financials is taxed at a lower, more favorable rate.Investors should expect the financial services sector to outperform real estate in a rising rate environment. REITs sold off in 2015 in anticipation of rate increases, though some investing pros argue that REITS can fare well in that environment.Rosenbluth also thinks many actively managed mutual funds are likely to increase their exposure to REITs to better align with the large-cap bogey. That could translate to billions in demand for this brand-new S&P sector.RELATED:With Yields As High As 10%, Real Estate Funds Drum Up Assets And AppealKey Debut For Real Estate Is A Big Opportunity For ETF InvestorsMeet The First New Sector SPDR ETFs In 17 Years

26,PSA,"Real estate securities continue to shore up their popularity with ETF investors, with demand for these income-producing assets accelerating in recent months.Vanguard REIT (VNQ) saw $860.4 million net inflow in the month ended July 25 to take its asset haul this year to $4.12 billion, according to analytics firm XTF.com. Investors have poured fresh money into VNQ every month since the February stock market pullback, including $1.33 billion in June alone.In search of yield, investors are favoring real estate investment trusts (REITs), according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence. These companies own and operate income-producing properties such as shopping malls and warehouses. They typically pay out 90% of their taxable income as dividends to shareholders. It doesn't hurt either that REITs as a group are inwardly focused at a time when Japan and Europe are wracked with a negative or uncertain market outlook.""Investors sought out securities offering stable income with limited exposure to non-U.S. markets,"" Rosenbluth wrote in a July 19 note. He noted that many actively managed mutual funds have also been buying this asset class ahead of the elevation of real estate as a new S&P 500 GICS sector in September.With $35.96 billion in assets, VNQ is not only the largest REIT exchange traded fund, but also the largest ETF investing in U.S. sector equities.It offers low-cost and diversified exposure to the real estate markets. Its 0.12% expense ratio makes it one of the cheapest options around.VNQ focuses on equity REITs -- firms that manage various commercial properties -- and shuts out mortgage REITs and specialty REITs.The property REIT group ranks No. 39 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD; the mortgage REIT group ranks No. 95.The Vanguard real estate ETF's top three holdings out of 150 are Simon Property Group (SPG), Public Storage (PSA) and Welltower (HCN). VNQ yields 3.3%.REIT ETFs average a 4.5% yield. That equity income is a big draw for investors at a time when bond rates are mired at historic lows. But Kevin Mahn, president of Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, likes them just as much for their growth potential and relatively low correlation with stocks and bonds.""REITs continue to fly under the radar"" of many investors, Mahn told IBD in a phone interview. VNQ has jumped 17% on the stock market so far in 2016 vs. a 7% gain for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY).Mahn maintains a small allocation to REITs in client portfolios and is bullish on the sector. ""REITs have historically shown they can fare well, even in the face of rising interest rates,"" he said.The fear of rising rates was a headwind for the sector in 2015. But Mahn noted that higher rates driven by economic growth and job growth can be a plus. When people have more money to spend, retail REITs like Simon benefit. When more Americans are working, and earning more, health care REITs like Welltower gain.Mahn invests in REITs for both attractive income and ""good, strong total return characteristics."" CoreSite Realty (COR), a highly rated IBD stock, has jumped 74% over the past year on the back of consistent profit and sales growth. The REIT operates nationwide data centers -- a booming business as companies migrate key operations to the cloud. CoreSite releases its Q2 results Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Mortgage REITs hold no real estate and are vulnerable to interest-rate hikes. However, the outlook for rates is murky, and the Federal Reserve may have boxed itself in on monetary policy.When choosing an ETF, Mahn looks first for ""an index that is recognized and established."" Vanguard REIT, iShares U.S. Real Estate (IYR) and SPDR Dow Jones REIT (RWR) are among the funds that make that cut.A younger rival, Schwab U.S. REIT (SCHH), offers a rock-bottom 0.07% expense ratio. Among 20-odd options, iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped (REM) offers the highest yield at 10.6%.

30,PSA,"Stock indexes on Tuesday carved off all or most of the prior session's gains and did it in rising volume.The Nasdaq lost 1.3%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average severed 0.9% and 1% respectively. The small cap S&P 600 chopped off 1.7%, and the Dow Jones utility average dropped 1.8%. Volume was higher across the board.The weekly charts of the indexes, however, raised the question of whether the market is putting in a floor or a trapdoor. The Nasdaq and S&P 500's recent weekly closes look like a floor — tight closes without much additional price movement south. Yet, the closes are coming low in the week's range, and the 10-week line is serving as fierce resistance, at least for the Nasdaq.Bulls and bears both need to consider three other factors:—The put-call ratio closed at 1.07 Tuesday, in line with closes of 1.15 Friday and 1.07 Thursday.

31,PSA,"Shares of pharma major AbbVie (ABBV) were sliding Wednesday after Morgan Stanley downgraded it on concerns of increasing competition.Analyst David Risinger downgraded AbbVie stock to equal weight and lowered his price target to 65 from 73, noting that the nature of AbbVie's pipeline has become clearer since its R&D day on June 1 and its presentations on its cancer drugs over the weekend, including its negatively received report on Rova-T. In the meantime, AbbVie still depends on its immunology drug Humira, the analyst said.""With 2015 sales of $14 billion, Humira is the world's best-selling drug and generated 61% of AbbVie's 2015 total sales (and we estimate the vast majority of profits),"" Risinger wrote. ""Humira not only faces challenges from several biosimilar players (including Amgen (AMGN), Novartis' (NVS) Sandoz, and Pfizer (PFE)), but also from novel branded injectables and orals.""If AbbVie can score a string of patent litigation victories, that may allay investors' concerns, but we are unable to make that call,"" Risinger wrote.Humira's market exclusivity already suffered one setback last month, when the patent board agreed to review a challenge to a Humira patent brought by biosimilar developer Coherus Biosciences (CHRS), though that likely will take years to resolve.Risinger wrote that newer classes of drugs treating the same conditions that Humira does, including Novartis' Cosentyx and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Taltz and baricitinib, should slow down Humira's growth in the near term.This threat gained some support Wednesday, when Novartis said that among its presentations at the European League Against Rheumatism conference, running Wednesday through Saturday, are ""new long-term analyses suggesting Cosentyx may lead to higher responses than Humira in improving the signs and symptoms of people living with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) at 52 weeks."" Novartis said it will initiate head-to-head trials to confirm this.""That said, AbbVie's own novel autoimmune disease products should help offset moderation, including JAK ABT-494 and IL-23 risankizumab,"" Risinger wrote. ""We expect both to launch in 2019.""AbbVie stock fell 2.1% at the close on the stock market today, to 61.73.

34,PSA,"Real estate investment trusts are proving worthy of some serious Tubmans, as President Obama recently put it.Several REIT ETFs bolted to new highs on the stock market today, making last week's run-up seem like a prelude to bigger moves.The asset class is proving to be a foundational piece for investors' portfolios in an unsettled stock market. It offers both attractive yields and solid fundamentals.An allocation to real estate can substantially improve risk-adjusted returns, experts say. REITs tend to have lower beta -- a measure of volatility -- than the broad stock market. Plus, their tasty dividends boost total returns when capital growth in stocks is hard to come by.Income-yielding utilities and real estate ETFs have drawn roughly $7 billion in fresh assets in 2016 through May 6, according to Mizuho Securities. Technology and health care exchange traded funds, respectively, saw $10 billion and $5.9 billion in net outflow over the same period.Here is a look at three REIT ETFs showing leadership in terms of both price performance and inflow of new money:VNQ holds $31.91 billion in assets, has a 0.12% expense ratio and yields 4.32%. It's one of the oldest and cheapest options in its segment.The fund holds 150 mostly equity REITs, including Simon Property Group (SPG) and Public Storage (PSA).California-based Public Storage, an IBD 50 stock, has a 97 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. It has grown revenue 9% a year over the past three years. Its dividend has grown at a 15% annual pace over the past three to five years.VNQ tracks the MSCI U.S. REIT Index, which requires holdings meet certain liquidity and size requirements. Companies are weighted by their free-float-adjusted market cap. It shuts out mortgage REITs and specialty REITs, such as timber and prisons, according to investment research firm Morningstar. The index rebalances quarterly.Investors are liking REITs more and more as the odds of a near-term rate hike grow less and less. Higher bond yields can dent the appeal of utilities and REITs' dividends by comparison.VNQ has absorbed $2.26 billion in investor money while surging 8.6% so far in 2016.It has less exposure to small-cap and midcap stocks than does VNQ. However, the two funds have significant holdings overlap.RWR also excludes specialty and mortgage REITs.The returns on REITs come from a combination of rental income and property appreciation, says Morningstar analyst Robert Goldsborough.""Many of these firms use leverage, which can magnify the gains and losses from fluctuations in the value of their properties,"" he said. REITs are a capital-intensive business. The use of debt to finance operations and acquisitions also makes them sensitive to interest rates.RWR has $3.66 billion in assets, a 0.25% expense ratio and a 3.73% yield.The ETF absorbed $214.5 million in net inflow over the first four months of 2016. It has gained 6.7% year to date.""As most REIT ETFs use similar methodology and perform almost identically, price is an important factor when choosing an ETF,"" writes Goldsborough.SCHH holds $2.23 billion in assets and yields 2.45%. Its 0.07% expense ratio is the lowest in this segment.Its low-cost edge has helped SCHH outperform peers that track the same index by roughly the difference in their expense ratios, Goldsborough said.RWR soaked $122.7 million in net inflow in 2016 through April's end. It has risen 6.8% so far in 2016.

37,PSA,"Volkswagen (VLKAY) more than doubled provisions to pay for the emissions-cheating scandal, leading to the biggest loss in the German automaker’s history while giving it a path toward assessing the full financial impact of the crisis.VW set aside 16.2 billion euros ($18.2 billion) to cover the costs of the cheating, up from the previous amount of 6.7 billion euros, Europe’s largest carmaker said in a statement on Friday. The manufacturer cut its annual dividend 97% to 0.17 euros per preferred share, the lowest since at least 2000.“The current crisis -- as the figures presented today reveal -- is having a huge impact on Volkswagen’s financial position,” Chief Executive Officer Matthias Mueller said in the statement, adding that the “repercussions of the emissions issue are now quantifiable.”While the latest tally on the financial impact show the automaker is making progress, Volkswagen is far from resolving the crisis. A report on how the manipulations were carried out and covered up for so many years won’t be concluded until the fourth quarter, more than a year after the scandal became public. Volkswagen has two months to finalize a U.S. agreement on fixing or buying back tainted cars there. Meanwhile, a recall of some 8.5 million affected autos in Europe has gotten off to a slow start.For 2016, Volkswagen forecast flat deliveries and a drop in revenue of as much as 5% amid what the automaker called a “challenging environment.” Its operating profit is projected to be between 5% and 6% of sales, compared with 6.3% in 2014.The crisis erupted in September when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced that the carmaker had used illicit engine-control software to dupe emissions tests. Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn was forced to resign within days as the automaker’s stock lost billions in value. Volkswagen has been battling since then to appease regulators and regain customer trust after ultimately admitting to rigging the exhaust systems of 11 million diesel-powered cars worldwide to pass emissions tests.Determining the roots of the manipulation and the people behind it have proved complex due to the use of code words to disguise their wrongdoings as well as insufficient and outdated computer systems. The company said it was advised by U.S. legal advisors to delay the report from an internal investigation.VW’s credit profile has suffered as all major ratings agencies downgraded the manufacturer in the wake of the scandal. That contrasts with improved ratings for some direct rivals despite the slowdown in emerging markets like Brazil and Russia. Since the beginning of this year Standard & Poor’s lifted ratings on Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), Ford Motor (F), and PSA Group and assigned a positive outlook to Nissan Motor Co. as the manufacturers reap the rewards of cost-cutting measures.Despite the costs of the scandal, Volkswagen insists that the underlying business is robust, CEO Mueller said today at a briefing at its Wolfsburg headquarters.A dispute between influential works council chief Bernd Osterloh and Herbert Diess, the new head of the namesake passenger-car brand, over restructuring measures is complicating Volkswagen’s recovery. Restoring profit at the manufacturer’s largest division by sales volume and revenue is vital to weathering the fallout and moving beyond the scandal.“Management should now be in a position to more actively address the turnaround plan for the VW brand,” said Arndt Ellinghorst, a London-based analyst with Evercore ISI. “It has been too quiet for too long.”

The S&P 500 rose 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.3% after reversing similar losses. Volume in the stock market today rose 16% on the Nasdaq and 12% on the NYSE compared to Tuesday, according to preliminary data.Solar stocks were among the day's biggest gainers.

The S&P 500 eased 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average edged higher. Small caps lagged badly with the Russell 2000 down 1.3%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly higher than Monday's levels in the stock market today.In economic news, February retail sales fell 0.1%, in line with economists’ expectations, but the real story was a sharp downward revision to January data -- to -0.4% from an initially reported 0.2% gain.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell 2% to $36.34 a barrel.Apple (AAPL) was a big gainer in the Dow, rising 2%, after Morgan Stanley (MS) issued a positive note, citing ""surprising upside"" to iPhone demand.

48,PSA,"Top European automakers like PSA Peugeot Citroen and Mercedes Benz' parent Daimler (DDAIF) are making a push in the electric vehicle market as diesel falls out of favor, threatening to siphon off customers in a key market for Tesla Motors (TSLA).Volkswagen (VLKAY), which last year admitted to cheating on emissions tests for its diesel cars, is also focusing more on electric vehicles.Peugeot presented the Citroen E-Mehari electric off-road concept car at the Geneva International Motor Show this week. Volkswagen said it's working on various EV-related technologies, including fast battery charging, while General Motors' (GM) Opel plans to roll out the Ampera-e next year.And last fall's Frankfurt Auto Show saw VW's Audi show off its the E-tron Quattro sport-utility concept vehicle and Porsche showcase its first-ever battery-powered sports car -- the Mission E concept.The increased activity in Europe in EVs could erode Tesla's sales there. Last year, Tesla sold an estimated 16,000 cars in that market, a significant chunk of the more than 50,000 cars Tesla delivered worldwide in 2015.Tesla plans to build on its success of its Model S in the luxury category with the impending debut of the $35,000 mass market Tesla Model 3. It's due to be unveiled this month, although Tesla won't be taking orders until 2017. It will face competition from the BMW i3, which sells for less than $40,000 after government incentives.Meanwhile, Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) isn't joining the stampede for now.“I can’t make money building a car like Tesla,” CEO Sergio Marchionne said, according to Bloomberg. “So for the time being I am abstaining.”Tesla shares closed up 3.9% on the stock market today, but fell 49% from a July 20 high to a 143.67 low on Feb. 10 amid plunging gas prices.General Motors, which last month unveiled its Bolt EV at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, rose 3%. Fiat Chrysler gained 2.8%. U.S.-listed shares of VW added 1.9%, and Daimler rose 1.6%. 
"
49,PSA,"Right on, REIT ETFs: High-yielding real estate investment trusts have won investors' favor in the current stock market.These businesses typically pay out taxable income as dividends to shareholders. And they make it a breeze for the average investor to own a chunk of commercial real estate -- from office complexes and apartment buildings to warehouses and shopping centers or nursing homes.Rising interest rates can hurt some yield-bearing REITs, but not always. Higher rates driven by economic growth and job growth boost the demand for commercial real estate. After all, companies are looking to expand and consumers are looking to spend.For equity REITs, that translates to higher occupancy rates and rent growth at their facilities, and, ultimately, to rising profits.A handful of property REITs have emerged on the IBD 50 list as the market uptrend resumes. They include Public Storage (PSA), Equity Lifestyle Properties (ELS), Sovran Self Storage (SSS), CoreSite Realty (COR) and Store Capital (STOR).Each has a Composite Rating of 98 or 99, meaning they're rock-solid on a range of fundamental and technical measures, including earnings-per-share growth.Vanguard REIT (VNQ), the largest sector-equity exchange traded fund, holds all five of these REITs in its 151-stock portfolio. VNQ yields 4.07%.The ETF rose 2.8% to close above its 200-day moving average for the first time in nearly two months Tuesday and edged up further Wednesday. That's a bullish technical sign, but the downward-sloping 200-day line hints at its holdings' recent struggles.So does the ETF's 76 Relative Strength Rating and D- Accumulation/Distribution Rating. The former translates to ho-hum price performance; the latter to tepid institutional demand.Public Storage is VNQ's second-largest holding, at 5% of assets. It's a rarity among stocks, with uninterrupted quarterly earnings and revenue growth since June 2011.Public Storage stock is trading near a 52-week high of 257.98. It rallied above its 50-day moving average after beating analyst estimates in its Feb. 16 earnings report.As millennials move to dense urban cities for work and find themselves in small apartments, they need a place to store stuff. That's helping companies that rent out storage units grow sales and profits, industry experts say.VNQ is not only the largest REIT ETF, but it's also one of the cheapest to own. It has $26.99 billion in assets and a 0.12% expense ratio.The ETF slightly outpaced the broad market last year and has narrowly held up better so far in 2016, with a 3.8% loss. It absorbed $572.7 million in new investor money in the first two months of 2016.The property REIT group ranks 12 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, up from No. 14 one week ago and No. 20 eight weeks ago.Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), the third-largest sector-equity ETF, also finished above its 200-day line Tuesday for the first time in 2016. It was trading flat intraday on the stock market today.The remaining 3 of the 5 largest sector-equity ETFs are testing their 50-day but are sitting well off their 200-day lines.They include Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) and Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE).Image at top of page provided by Shutterstock.

54,PSA,"What happens when the market goes down and stays down? Your Weekly Review list gets shorter, and defensive stocks tend to shine. And that's certainly the case right now. This week's list of leading stocks still falls well short of the usual 120-plus that make the cut in a healthy market. Many top growth stocks have dropped off the list, while defensive plays like utilities, real estate investment trusts and food companies raise their profile.Such stocks may not typically be highfliers, but they can offer steady growth and usually pay a dividend. While defensive sectors are viewed as a relative safe haven, keep in mind no stocks are truly safe stocks in a market correction.Atmos Energy (ATO) is finding support at its 10-week moving average as it trades just below a 63.87 flat-base buy point initially cleared Dec. 28 in light trade. The stock's Relative Strength line is near highs, a bullish sign. The Dallas-based natural gas utility serves customers in eight states. Atmos has an annualized dividend yield of 2.7%, above the S&P 500's average 2.3% payout.One Gas (OGS), featured in Thursday's New Highs column, is a natural gas distributor based in Tulsa, Okla. Shares remain in buy range from a 49.97 flat-base entry. All buys, though, are extremely risky with the market in correction. Its annualized yield is also 2.7%.Public Storage (PSA) is an operator of self-storage facilities in the U.S. and Europe. Public Storage shares fell below a 254.05 four-weeks-tight buy point Wednesday, but they found support at the 10-week line Thursday. The REIT's annualized payout is 2.8%. It is featured on today's New America page.Constellation Brands (STZ) continues to trend higher. The stock is well extended from a 122.23 buy point and multiple pullbacks to the 10-week line.

56,PSA,"The public storage sector has been a boon to investors of late, with a number of players prospering or, at worst, sustaining minimal damage in an otherwise rough market.So it stands to reason that Public Storage (PSA), the world's largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities, will reap gains from the sector's current bonanza.Public Storage ""is in a fantastic space right now,"" said analyst Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.""It's a very well-run company with a conservative balance sheet. It has minimal debt and low leverage,"" Golladay said.The major players in the self-storage industry operate as real estate investment trusts, or REITs, and they've been strong performers the last two years. With a total return (share-price appreciation and dividends) in 2015 of 40.65%, self-storage led all other REIT sectors, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.It even slaughtered the hot apartment sector's 16.45% total return over that same time. Public Storage's dividend yield is a relatively high 6.8%; its stock soared more than 30% last year.Public Storage, which opened its first storage facility in 1972, is viewed as the industry's large-cap bellwether. Rivals include Extra Space Storage (EXR), CubeSmart (CUBE), Sovran Self Storage (SSS) and National Storage Affiliates (NSA).Big Is BetterIn storage, ""big is better,"" says Rod Petrik, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, adding that Public Storage saves money by efficiently spreading costs over a large base.""They are the largest in this space, and it allows them to run at the lowest cost,"" Petrik said.Indeed, Public Storage is one of the largest landlords in the world, and its near-full occupancy rate is the envy of just about any real estate company that relies on tenants for income. More than 1 million customers occupy rooms in over 2,200 of its company-owned locations — most in the U.S. — comprising more than 142 million net rentable square feet of real estate.Analysts expect another good year for the self-storage industry in 2016, and for Public Storage specifically. In a poll by Thomson Reuters, analysts see the company's funds from operations rising 10% over 2015, to $8.78 a share. That would put it at the same growth pace expected in 2015.Public Storage hasn't yet announced when it will report fourth-quarter and full-year results, and the company did not respond to a request for an interview.High Occupancy, Big MarginsFunds from operations measure net income before depreciation, gains and losses and impairment charges related to real estate assets. In the third quarter, Public Storage's funds from operations rose to $2.27 a share from $2.09 a year earlier.""They generally run with the highest occupancy in the industry and the best margins,"" Petrik said.In the third quarter, the company's occupancy rate was 95.3% vs. 94.7% a year prior. Gross margin was 74.2%, up from 73%.Spending on advertising, which has been gravitating to the Internet, has been falling due to high demand for space.""If you're running at 95% occupancy, it means all your 10(foot) by 10(foot) rooms are gone,"" Petrik said. ""You end up with the odd sizes.""Few ExpensesAnd like other self-storage companies — but unlike other forms of real estate — there's relatively little capital expenses involved to spruce up assets.""Someone moves out of an office building or retail space, and the landlord has to reconfigure the space and make tenant improvements,"" Petrik said. ""When someone moves out of a storage space, you sweep it and make sure the light bulb is working. You're ready to re-lease that space within minutes, not months or weeks.""""Investors look at this as a cash-flow business,"" he said.Public Storage has raised rents around 5% a year the last couple of years, around the same pace as apartment rentals. Its three top markets are in fast-growing states where people move around a lot: California, Florida and Texas.Demand for self-storage is typically driven by any kind of change, says RBC Capital's Golladay, pointing to life changes such as divorce, death, a job or military move, retirement or a home renovation. Restless young people are particularly heavy users.""Population alone is growing 1%, and more and more people are using storage, so 1.5% growth would be a good indicator of demand (growth) for their products,"" he said.Same-Store GainsMuch of the company's revenue growth comes from annual rent increases, however. In the third quarter, for instance, revenue at facilities open since Jan. 1, 2013 — referred to as same-store facilities — rose 6.7%, due largely to higher realized annual rent per occupied square feet, the company said. Total revenue grew 6.7% to $511.8 million.During the quarter, Public Storage acquired two self-storage facilities in Colorado. It subsequently acquired or contracted to buy 11 others, eight of them in Florida and the rest in Texas and California.But it also completed three facilities it developed on its own, as well as various expansion projects. More are underway.While limited new supply in the self-storage industry has helped to keep occupancy rates high and rental rates rising, analysts expect new supply to increase this year, though at manageable levels.""It's been undersupplied the last few years, so the new supply could easily be absorbed without any issues,"" Golladay said.Even when Public Storage opened a new 2,000-unit facility in Glendale, Calif. last year, space quickly filled, he adds.""It opened in April and was already 72% leased in the third quarter,"" Golladay said. ""It takes three to four years to lease up a facility. That tells you how much pent-up demand there is.""

Very little, except that they are all worthy of your watch list.Keep in mind that IBD's ETF market strategy calls for extreme caution in the stock market today. With the market in correction, it's time to focus more on capital preservation than capital appreciation.As you wait for a new uptrend to announce itself, get to know these exchange traded funds. They're each trading 7% or less below buy points.IShares Residential Real Estate Capped (REZ) is somewhat deceptively named. The ETF tracks a cap-weighted index of U.S. residential, health care, hotel and self-storage REITs.REZ holds 45 securities, giving 12% portfolio weighting to No. 1 holding Public Storage (PSA) alone. No. 2 holding Equity Residential (EQR) accounts for an additional 10%.Public Storage has an IBD Composite Rating of 98, based on various technical and fundamental measures, out of a best-possible 99. The REIT acquires, owns and operates self-storage facilities — 2,250 in 38 U.S. states and 192 in Europe.REZ is holding up fairly well amid the stock market's abysmal start to 2016. It is trading above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, which mark key levels of support, and is within 6% of a 65.90 buy point.Not all breakouts succeed. But REZ broke out of a cup base in October 2014 and ran up 30% by January 2015.REITs offer potential for long-term capital appreciation as well as income generation. REZ yields 3.18% vs. 2.06% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY).The ETF is relatively thinly traded, at less than 50,000 shares a day on average.However, its upward-sloping relative strength line means that the ETF is outperforming the S&P 500 index.The RS line is also moving to new high ground ahead of its potential breakout, a bullish sign for successful investing.REZ jumped 11.4% in 2015 vs. a 1.3% gain for SPY, a proxy for the broad market.An RS Rating of 81 means that REZ's price performance has surpassed 81% of all other publicly traded stocks in the past 12 months.First Trust Morningstar Dividend Leaders (FDL) is 6.7% below a buy point of 24.63.The ETF holds roughly 100 companies with consistent and sustained dividend payments. Its top three holdings are Exxon Mobil (XOM), AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ). It yields 3.65%.However, FDL has largely moved sideways in the past year. It is languishing below its 50- and 200-day lines.In 2015, the ETF advanced 2.6%. It has an RS Rating of 73.IShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility (USMV) is within 6.9% of a 42.73 buy point from a flat base.The ETF's last breakout, on Aug. 5, ended with a whimper.

The small list of stocks making Inside Your Weekly Review reflects this clearly.Nevertheless, the market's rally can heat up. Spring always follows winter. In 2016, watch to see if a comeback in crude oil prices, better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, or other positive external events help provide a spark.Keep a close eye on how this Weekly Review list changes.

The Jan. 15 list showed 37 stocks.A quick scan of today's YWR shows that quite a few different industry sectors get represented, but only by a handful of stocks or less. These companies are true leaders in their specific industry niches.You won't find many stocks hailing from the medical sector in today's list, but Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) (90 EPS, 89 RS) made the grade. It's fallen in recent days, but still trades not so far from a 580 high that it hit in a recent breakout. No one has yet come up with a better system of robotic surgery.Ross Stores (ROST) truly excels in buying excess inventory from department store chains and selling the merchandise at deep discount in a clean, well-lit atmosphere.

Its portfolio includes 24,400 megawatts of generation, 12,200 miles of natural gas transmission and 6,490 miles of electric transmission lines.Market turmoil has stirred up the Big Cap 20. Back on Dec. 1, the top four names wereFacebook (FB), LinkedIn (LNKD), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Alphabet (GOOGL) — growth stocks all.They're gone from the list, replaced by defensive names, including food makers, REITs and utilities.Defensive stocks can shine because messy markets are making money managers mortified. They are being bought on the theory they will go down less than high-flying growth stocks. And, if corporate earnings and the economy are beginning to sag, the public will continue to buy their products and services, while they might reduce their buying of expensive durable goods, such as cars or TV sets.Defensive stocks also pay dividends that can cushion a downturn.But investors should keep in mind that a bear market will take everything down with it. There's no such thing as a safe stock.Among the top names in today's list is Constellation Brands (STZ), a purveyor of beer and booze. Its products could classify it as a defensive stock, but it has definite growth characteristics. It has a five-year annualized growth rate of 25%. Analysts expect 20% growth in fiscal 2016 and 14% growth in 2017.After riding along the north side of its 50-day moving average for months, it gapped to a new high Thursday after reporting better-than-expected earnings that were 15% higher than a year earlier.A REIT making this week's cut is Public Storage (PSA).Public Storage owns 2,200 self-storage facilities with more than 142 million square feet of net rentable space in the U.S. and Europe plus a minority stake in PS Business Parks (PSB), which has another 28 million rentable square feet of commercial and industrial space.It pays a dividend that is equal to an annualized yield of 2.8%.Among utilities, WEC Energy Group (WEC), NextEra (NEE) and Dominion (D) made the list. WEC provides electricity and natural gas to 4.4 million customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota. It operates 70,000 miles of electric lines, 44,000 miles of natural gas pipelines and 8,800 megawatts of power plant capacity.NextEra transmits electric energy generated by gas, oil, solar, coal, petroleum coke, nuclear and wind, serving 4.7 million customers in the east and lower coasts of Florida. It also leases fiber-optic networks and dark fiber to phone companies, wireless, Internet and other telecoms.Dominion is one of the nation's largest producers and transporters of energy.

"
88,PSA,"It's a safe bet that when most people think of self-storage units, the term ""high tech"" doesn't immediately leap to mind. After all, they're just storage units, right? You open the door, put a few things inside and then close the door.About the most high-tech thing involved is turning a key in a lock.Behind the scenes, however, technology plays a big part in the success of large, publicly traded self-storage facility operators like Sovran Self Storage (SSS).Sovran is a real estate investment trust that owns or operates 500 self-storage facilities in 25 states. It operates under the name Uncle Bob's Self Storage and serves more than 250,000 customers.Like the three other publicly traded players in the self-storage space — Public Storage (PSA), Extra Space Storage (EXR) and CubeSmart (CUBE) — Sovran uses its size to take business away from small mom and pop operations. A big part of its edge against the little guys involves technology — specifically, its revenue management system and Internet marketing strategy.Fitting The MarketsSovran's revenue management system was developed a few years ago to help the company gauge how much it should charge in specific markets during specific times of the year. The system crunches massive amounts of data to determine why some customer inquiries turn into rental contracts, while others don't.""The system uses computer algorithms that help them price units better and increase occupancy,"" Jefferies analyst George Hoglund told IBD.""The result is that you're seeing overall occupancies rise at the big public REITs.""The publicly traded REITs typically have storage unit occupancy rates in the low-to-mid 90% range, he says. That's about 5 to 10 percentage points higher than the average for small private players.""Sovran and the other public REITs have the kinds of systems in place that generate more data than the mom and pops, which gives them a big edge in terms of finding and winning customers,"" Hoglund said.The same holds true for Sovran's Internet marketing strategy, which basically involves paying top dollar to secure important search terms. These include the obvious — ""storage unit,"" ""self-storage,"" etc. — as well as street names, city names, ZIP codes and terms like ""cardboard boxes"" and ""moving vans.""What's It Worth?""Self-storage operators have to ask themselves how much it's worth to pay for a particular search term,"" Hoglund said. ""You can only do that efficiently and effectively if you have scale, which gives Sovran and the other public REITs another advantage over the small players.""Analyst R.J. Milligan of Robert W. Baird echoed that point in a research note, saying the larger players ""continue to out-market"" the smaller players online.""Technology and economies of scale are allowing the REITs to capture greater market share at better rates, while the data analysis is contributing to a more efficient use of marketing dollars,"" Milligan noted.Those advantages help explain why Sovran regularly trots out double-digit revenue and earnings growth — and why its stock price has been trading at record highs this month, along with those of its publicly traded peers.Macro Trends HelpingThe sector also is getting help from several favorable macro trends, analysts say. One is the rising population of millennials entering the workforce. Many choose to live in densely populated areas where apartments are small and storage units are needed to house items that don't fit in the available living spaces.It also helps that the U.S. job market is improving, which means more millennials are finally able to leave home and move out on their own. Meanwhile, there's a shortage of storage units nationwide, which helps drive up rental rates.""The lack of development financing, an increasingly difficult land entitlement process, and increasing development land values have kept new supply relatively muted,"" Milligan said.It all adds up to a pretty stout operating environment for Sovran. The company has a years-long streak of double-digit revenue growth, helped by a stream of acquisitions. Funds from operations, or FFO — the figure that REITs use to define cash flow from their operations — have risen by double digits for five quarters in a row.During its third quarter, Sovran logged FFO of $1.29 a share, up 15% from the prior year and above analysts' consensus estimates. Revenue grew 12% to $95.4 million. Same-store revenue climbed 6.5%.High OccupancyThe company's same-store occupancy rate as of Sept. 30 was 91.4%, up 100 basis points from the prior year. In July, it set an occupancy record rate of 93.1%. Sovran spent $66 million to acquire 11 self-storage facilities during the quarter.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Sovran's full-year funds from operations to rise 20% in 2015. Growth is seen as slowing to 11% in 2016 and 8% in 2017.One area of concern is Sovran's large exposure to the Houston market, which has been hurt by the slumping oil and gas industry. Sovran's same-store revenue in Houston rose 6.9% during the third quarter, though the occupancy rate there fell by 180 basis points year-over-year.Sovran Chief Executive David Rogers downplayed the problem during a Q3 conference call with analysts, pointing out that rental rates in Houston actually rose faster than the company average during the quarter.""Things are real strong and continue to look strong in Houston,"" Rogers said.Wall Street doesn't seem too worried. Sovran's stock price shot to a new intraday high of 106.59 on Friday and is up more than 20% since Sept. 4. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a possible 99.

157,PSA,"SNL Financial expects self-storage and multifamily REITs to each log around a 15% gain in operating earnings next year, putting the two just behind health care and specialty REITs.Last year may have been the year of the REIT, as total returns for the dividend stocks fetched an alluring 27.5% total return in aggregate, double that of the S&P 500 Index.But this year, the group of real estate investment trusts, or REITs, got battered.They logged a paltry total return of just 1% through Dec. 4 vs. the S&P 500's 3.6% gain, according to SNL Financial. But self-storage and apartments were standouts.Prospects of a looming rate hike by the Fed scared investors. REITs return at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, leaving them sensitive to interest-rate increases as they seek financing to grow, since they don't have much cash on hand. Or so investors like to think.""Rumors of rising interest rates have certainly weighed on REITs,"" said Jason Lail, manager of real estate research at SNL Financial.With a rate hike expected imminently, will REITs falter again in 2016?REIT experts say that it might be better to look at fundamentals such as operating earnings, which in REIT parlance are known as funds from operations, or FFOs.""A rising interest rate environment is indicative of the overall health of the economy,"" Lail said. ""REITs are much more tied to economic health than to interest rates in regard to their performance.""And as Ron Kuykendall, a spokesman for the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, put it: ""If operating earnings are improving, that income is going to be translated into growing dividends. And that has a positive impact on share performance.""Battered Sectors May ShineBy that measure, some of this year's most battered sectors may shine next year, with health care seen emerging at the top.Through the first week in December, health care's total return sunk by 12.4%, according to SNL Financial.But operating earnings jumped by 25.6%, the best showing of any sector. ""And that can definitely have a positive impact on health care REIT equity pricing in 2016,"" Lail said.Health-care dividend yields were also higher this year than any other sector, at 6.63% on average vs. 4.82% for all equity REITs.Gerry Casimir, portfolio manager of the $21 billion of assets in the variable annuity TIAA Real Estate Account, says that his team has started to invest in life sciences and biomedical properties in Boston and San Francisco, and is eying others in San Diego and elsewhere.""It's a subset we're excited about,"" he said. ""The returns are extremely strong, and there are real long-term prospects for growth.""SNL forecasts that FFOs for health care REITs will jump 25.6% in 2016, followed by specialty REITs' 23.9% gain, thanks in part to strong performance from data centers.Demand For Data Centers""Data center REITs are enjoying continued increases in demand for space,"" especially from cloud service providers and digital media, Lail said.Four data-center REITs are among Lail's top-25 picks for 2016 in terms of FFO growth, led by CoreSite Realty (COR), which is projected to grow FFO by 16.9%.Others are CyrusOne (CONE) (16.3%), QTS Realty Trust (QTS) (15.9%) and Equinix (EQIX) (13.2%), which has the largest market cap, at $18 billion, and counts Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) (Web services and cloud computing) as customers.In health care, Lail singles out Physicians Realty Trust (DOC) and Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) for impressive FFO growth in 2016. He limited his top 25 picks, compiled exclusively for IBD, to U.S. REITs with market caps above $1 billion and at least three analyst estimates.Besides their sensitivity to interest rates due to long-term leases, too much construction all at once might have brought down health care REITs this year.""Health care is a very good long-term investment that right now has suffered because of new construction,"" said Calvin Schnure, senior vice president of research and economic analysis at NAREIT. ""There's a near-term bunching of supply that has had some impact on rents and (same-property) operating income. It's unclear how long it will take to digest. But medium- and long-term fundamentals are quite strong for that sector.""Millennials And RentalsREITs tied to the rise of the rental market — and the millennials who have been flocking to rental apartments — are also expected to stay at the forefront in 2016.Self-storage REITs have shown the best total equity returns this year, with the sector up a whopping 35.6% through Dec. 4. Total returns for multifamily apartment REITs were up 14.4%.Self-storage REITs operate storage facilities that apartment dwellers and others rent to store their extra stuff.

We like the idea that with 1 million people or so, we can buy enough stores to reach the scale we want.""

223,PSA,"""We had no units in Chicago in 2012. Now we have 13 there and a couple more underway,"" Rogers said.
"
224,PSA,"Another growth market is the greater New York area that extends from southern Connecticut to northern New Jersey.
"
225,PSA,"Sovran intends to keep expanding, Rogers says, though he would not disclose details on specific plans — other than to say that the pace of acquisitions will probably be slower in 2015 than in 2014.
"
226,PSA,"Room To Grow
"
227,PSA,"In December, Sovran announced details of financing arrangements totaling $625 million of senior unsecured debt. Sovran's revolving credit limit increased from $175 million to $300 million, and it got a lowered interest rate on that credit and its $325 million in term notes.
"
228,PSA,"In a statement at the time, Sovran Chief Financial Officer Andrew Gregoire said the financing arrangements ""will allow us to continue to execute on our growth plan.""
"
229,PSA,"KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Todd Thomas noted in a research report that Sovran management ""indicated it suspects the company could acquire between $100 million and $200 million"" worth of assets in 2015, excluding investments in joint ventures and the like.
"
230,PSA,"""Portfolio deals continue to surface, however, so it is possible that Sovran exceeds that target,"" Thomas said.
"
231,PSA,"Much of Sovran's acquisition strategy focuses on high-end, ""third-generation"" properties. They tend to be multistory self-storage facilities with modern amenities such as security systems and 24-hour access.
"
232,PSA,"""Everything being built new is going to be third-generation,"" Rogers said, adding, ""The industry is in transition.""
"
233,PSA,"The industry is also dominated by small local or regional players, at least in nonurban areas.
"
234,PSA,"Rogers estimates that the Big Four self-storage companies control a little less than 10% of the U.S. market, so there's ""plenty of room to grow.""
"
235,PSA,"Business is good. Of the four publicly traded self-storage REITs, all but Public Storage consistently deliver double-digit revenue and earnings growth.
"
236,PSA,"Public Storage's growth rate is a little slower, probably because it's far and away the biggest player in the sector, with more than $2 billion in 12-month trailing revenue. It therefore has a much higher hill to climb to establish year-over-year growth.
"
237,PSA,"By contrast, Extra Space has $622 million in trailing 12-month revenue. CubeSmart has $360 million, and Sovran has $313 million.
"
238,PSA,"During its third quarter, Sovran posted total operating revenue of $85.3 million, up 21% from the previous year. The company logged funds from operations (FFO) of $1.17 vs. $1.01 a year earlier, on an adjusted basis. Same-store net operating income rose 9.2%.
"
239,PSA,"""The trends are evidence of continued strength in fundamentals,"" Citigroup analyst Michael Bilerman noted.
"
240,PSA,"Sovran has credited its Revenue Management System with helping to drive top-line growth. The system was developed a few years ago to help Sovran gauge how much it should charge in specific markets during specific times of the year.
"
241,PSA,"Need A Storage Unit?
"
242,PSA,"It is the product of extensive research that involved crunching call-center data to learn when, and why, some customer inquiries turn into rental contracts and some don't.
"
243,PSA,"""We wanted to build a history — what were the patterns, what caused people to buy or just shop,"" Rogers said. ""We stored data like how long the call was, did it turn into a rental, what was the pricing. The result is that we were able to build algorithms into the system that are proactive and preventive.""
"
244,PSA,"Analyst Thomas notes that Sovran's technology ""has come a long way"" in recent years. He points out that ""a minimum of 70%"" of Sovran's rental customers use the Internet at some point during the rental process.
"
245,PSA,"Because the Internet has become the main source of business for self-storage companies, investing in web advertising is key to finding and winning customers. To that end, Sovran plans to spend about $6 million on Internet advertising in 2015, Thomas says, ""which equates to about $11,000 per store.""
"
246,PSA,"Sovran has a top IBD Composite Rating of 99. It is among several now sporting that high a rating in IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group, which ranks No. 27 out of 197 in performance.Like many businesses, self storage is a numbers game.In a locale with a certain number of people, a certain percentage will need storage units. That baseline holds regardless of the local economy, job market or housing trends.Dave Rogers knows all about those numbers. He's CEO of Sovran Self Storage (SSS), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that operates more than 500 self-storage facilities in 25 states under the Uncle Bob's Self Storage brand.Sovran is one of four publicly traded self-storage companies that comprise the ""Big Four"" of an industry otherwise dominated by small mom-and-pop operations.Like Sovran, the other Big Four players — Extra Space Storage (EXR), Public Storage (PSA) and CubeSmart (CUBE) — have enjoyed strong financial and share-price growth as they've seen steady demand for storage units.Sovran set a record high of 94.07 in the stock market on Friday, putting it up 8% for the month.One of the most important numbers for Sovran and the other big guys is 1 million. That's how many people a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) needs to make it worth Sovran's while to set up shop.It's Not The EconomyIt doesn't seem to matter how the stock market and the broad economy are doing, Rogers says. Once you reach around 1 million people, the numbers always come out the right way.""Everybody's looking for that holy grail tying something to storage demand, but there just don't seem to be any economic or macro patterns that apply,"" Rogers told IBD. ""We found that if you can get into an MSA of 1 million people or so, you can do well in storage. We like the idea that with 1 million people or so, we can buy enough stores to reach the scale we want.""In this case, ""stores"" means self-storage facilities, and Rogers' company has been buying a lot of them.Sovran has acquired about 125 stores over the last three and a half years, he says. In 2014, it added nearly $500 million worth of storage assets when you factor in its own buyouts as well as joint venture acquisitions it invested in.""It's been a very busy year acquisitionwise,"" Rogers said.The acquisitions have helped Sovran expand in core markets such as Florida, the mid-Atlantic states and Texas.

263,PSA,"Stocks opened firmly higher Wednesday, boosted by a raft of solid Q4 reports and a surprise uptick in producer prices and factory output in January.The Nasdaq stepped out to an early lead, up 1.6%. The S&P 500, the Russell 2000 and the Dow were close behind, up 1.2% apiece.Volume opened on a mixed note, up 3% on the Nasdaq and 7% lower on the NYSE, relative to trade at the same time Tuesday.The stock market today opened to mixed economic news, with producer prices rising more than expected in January, while housing starts and building permits slipped more than expected. It was the second weak data point for housing markets this week, after a surprise pullback in builder confidence from the National Association of Homebuilders' Housing Market Index on Tuesday.Industrial production was positive, rising 0.9% in January according to Federal Reserve numbers. The Fed also revised its December estimate downward, to an 0.7% decline. Economists had projected a gain of 0.4% for January. Utilization of factory capacity also improved, edging up to 77.1% vs. 76.5% utilization in December. Economists had projected a very mild uptick to 76.4% in January.Oil prices upshifted from their early gains, with West Texas Intermediate climbing nearly 3% to nearly $30 a barrel. Brent crude also gained 3% to $33.15 a barrel. The Energy Information Administration delayed its weekly inventories report, normally released on Wednesday, until Thursday.Dow stocks rose almost unanimously. McDonald's (MCD) was the weak spot, down more than 1%.

"
264,PSA,"It's hard to think of anything more low-tech than a self-storage facility. Once you figure out how to open a door and work a lock, you've pretty much mastered it.Long before you've done that, however, chances are someone who works behind the scenes has spent years using high-tech tools to ensure the facility has the best chance of capturing your business.A tech-savvy self-storage company will make sure its facilities are among the first three or four names that pop up in an Internet search — a process that involves things like analyzing search algorithms to determine the most productive keywords to use on the website.In the case of Extra Space Storage (EXR), a real estate investment trust, it also means hiring a team of marketing and search engine optimization — or SEO — specialists.Gang of FourExtra Space owns and/or operates more than 1,000 self-storage properties in 35 states as well as in Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Its properties comprise around 715,000 units and 79 million square feet of rentable storage space.It is one of four major players in the self-storage industry, along with fellow publicly traded REITs Public Storage (PSA), CubeSmart (CUBE) and Sovran Self Storage (SSS).Outside of U-Haul parent Amerco (UHAL), which provides self-storage rentals as well as truck and van rentals, the rest of the market is dominated by the many smaller mom-and-pop operations.One reason the bigger players have put so much distance between themselves and the rest of the field is that they've done a better job at developing Internet marketing strategies, says Jeff Norman, Extra Space's senior director of investor relations.Just about everyone who needs a self-storage facility looks online to find one. Since a lot of companies are competing for business, search results often mean the difference between success and failure.""It's a very fragmented industry, and if you are not one of the top three or four terms that pop up after a search, no one is ever going to find you,"" Norman told IBD during a phone interview. ""If someone goes to Google (GOOGL) and types in 'self-storage Long Island' or 'self-storage Chicago,' you will consistently see the larger REITs come at the top of those searches.""That's mainly because the larger REITs have the resources and expertise to develop effective Internet search and marketing strategies, while many smaller ones don't.This has ""created a moat"" between the larger operators and the smaller ones, Norman says, and goes a long way in explaining why Extra Space trots out double-digit-percentage revenue and profit growth with astonishing regularity.""We have a lot of data points to track and analyze,"" Norman said. ""If we see that something works well in one market, we will roll it out in other markets. We are constantly trying to keep up with the evolving algorithms that search engines use to make sure we are getting a good return.""That has been a key internal driver of Extra Space's financial growth, he says.A key external driver is the self-storage industry itself, which has seen a shortage of supply nationwide since the early days of the financial crisis and recession in 2009.According to industry estimates, there are about 50,000 storage facilities in the U.S., Norman says. With the nation's population growing at around 1% a year, he reckons you could add 1% a year to the storage facility supply and ""still not upset the equilibrium.""Over the past five years, however, the amount of new supply has been ""virtually zero,"" Norman says. That's mainly due to a lack of financing for local developers, who handle the vast majority of self-storage construction projects.This lack of supply ratchets up demand for Extra Space and other self-storage operators.Go Where The People AreVery little alters that demand outside of the number of people living in a given area, Norman says. The ups and downs of the housing market don't seem to have a big impact, he says, and neither do the ups and downs of the economy.Since demand is primarily driven by population growth, Extra Space looks to buy properties in cities with dense and growing populations.""We try to focus on the top 50 MSAs (metropolitan statistical areas),"" Norman said. ""Our main motivation is places with high population density — not just because there is more demand, but also because there are stronger barriers to entry because there is less space to build new storage properties.""The strength of the self-storage market is reflected in Extra Space's financial results. The company has delivered 11 straight quarters of 21%-or-better revenue and funds from operations (FFO) growth.Solid ResultsDuring its second quarter, overall revenue rose 27% from the prior year to $160.2 million. Same-store revenue growth was 7.9%, flat with the prior quarter and up from 7.4% the previous year, according to a report from Citigroup analyst Michael Bilerman. FFO gained 26% to 63 cents a share.Extra Space paid a Q2 common stock dividend of 47 cents a share, up 17.5% from the prior quarter.""Occupancy continued to move higher year-over-year, up 160 basis points, and realized rent growth inched up to 5.2%,"" Bilerman noted. ""Acquisitions continue to ramp but at a slower pace.""Extra Space uses acquisitions to expand its business in existing markets and move into new ones.One of its biggest deals came in January, when it spent around $200 million to buy a self-storage portfolio of 17 assets located in Virginia.""We believe there are plenty of growth opportunities because there are a lot of properties out there to acquire,"" Norman said. ""The stereotypical storage owner is an entrepreneur reaching a point where he wants to capitalize on his investment and move on to another phase of his life, so you see opportunities pop up regularly.""Extra Space is due to report Q3 results after the stock market close on Oct. 29. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect FFO of 65 cents a share, up 41% from a year earlier. Full-year FFO is seen rising 27% to $2.49.The company's stock price touched a record high of 56.05 on Oct. 17 and still trades near there.

265,PSA,"Size isn't the be-all and end-all of the business world, although it has its perks. The bigger you get, the more likely you are to score the kinds of deals that can help you get even bigger.Executives at NetSuite (N) can attest to that. The company provides cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and e-commerce services, mainly in the U.S. and Europe.Its products include NetSuite, a platform for financials/ERP, CRM, professional services automation (PSA) and e-commerce capabilities that automates processes across departments; and NetSuite OneWorld, used to manage organizations with different currencies, tax rules and reporting requirements.Clients come from a variety of industries, ranging from distribution and wholesale to computer software, manufacturing, telecom services, retail, financial services and health care.Roughly three-quarters of its business comes from the U.S. Its competitors include tech heavyweights Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP) and Microsoft (MSFT).Technology Growth StoryWhile NetSuite doesn't have nearly the size of those companies, it has grown a lot bigger in recent years. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to post $553.8 million in revenue this year. That's up from about $415 million last year and $236 million as recently as 2011.NetSuite has strung together nine straight quarters of 30% or better year-over-year revenue growth — a tribute to its ability to land bigger deals with bigger clients, says NetSuite spokeswoman Jennifer Gianola.While the company used to focus exclusively on small and midsize businesses, it now is signing large enterprise customers.""During our most recent quarter, we had a record number of deals greater than $1 million, and our OneWorld product had a record ASP (average sales price),"" Gianola told IBD. ""These are indications that larger organizations are moving to the cloud on NetSuite.""Big-Company DealsD.A. Davidson analyst Jack Andrews said much the same thing in a recent report, noting that NetSuite ""continues to gain traction in larger companies domestically.""Andrews cites San Francisco-based home furnishings retailer Williams-Sonoma (WSM), which last year selected NetSuite's SuiteCommerce product as the multichannel retail and business management platform for its global expansion into Australia.Prior to signing on with NetSuite, Williams-Sonoma ""had three different legacy systems for point-of-sale, e-commerce and call-center transactions,"" he noted. ""By utilizing NetSuite as a next-generation platform, it was able to consolidate the activities of four separate brands into a single back-end solution.""Overseas markets hold particular promise for NetSuite, he said: ""Internationally, we believe companies of all sizes can benefit from OneWorld's multicompany, multicurrency functionality immediately, given the more heterogeneous business, tax and regulatory environment.""Condensing In The CloudNetSuite's main selling point is its ability to help clients condense their operations over the cloud, Gianola says. ""The value proposition is looking at companies that really want to run products and services in one system. A lot of product companies are becoming service companies, and we are a great solution for them.""More of those companies are choosing to go with NetSuite over other firms.""(NetSuite) will continue to gain ERP market share in the midmarket from Oracle, SAP, Microsoft and Sage,"" said Jeff Houston, analyst at Barrington Research. ""We also anticipate it will keep moving upstream (to enterprise customers) due to its OneWorld product.""One of NetSuite's advantages is that it already has a cloud-based ERP system, while other players in the field are still developing theirs.""The fact that it takes so long to write/build this type of system speaks to the complex issues legacy software vendors face when competing with effective cloud products,"" Andrews noted.He points out that it took NetSuite about 10 years to build its OneWorld product, and Oracle around eight years to completely rewrite its software for the cloud.Because of this long lead time, Andrews said, investors should be able to find out about potential competitors ""long before they might impact the growth trajectory of NetSuite.""That growth trajectory was on display during the third quarter, when NetSuite logged a 34% year-over-year sales increase to $143.7 million, edging past consensus analyst views. Earnings climbed 22% to 11 cents a share, topping views. It was the fifth straight quarter of double-digit EPS growth.NetSuite reported its Q3 results after the close on Oct. 23. The next day, its shares popped 11% to 103.61. The stock has since pushed higher and now trades near 107.The company signed 360 new customers during the third quarter, and its ASP rose more than 40% year over year. It also had two key product announcements.One of the products, Services Resource Planning, joins ERP and PSA in enabling project-based businesses to run their entire business life cycle — including project management, resource management and time-and-expense management — in a unified solution, according to a note from FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi.The other new product, SuiteGL, ""adds a general ledger component to NetSuite,"" Seyrafi said. ""And later this year, NetSuite will roll out its next-generation user interface.""Meanwhile, NetSuite's $50.5 million buyout in July of Venda, a London-based e-commerce company, gives it a chance to expand its footprint in Europe, Gianola says.""We acquired a a great team of people, a great product and great customers,"" she said.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect NetSuite to post full-year EPS growth of 27% in 2014 and 42% in 2015.

Rates for storage units have been rising, CEO Chris Marr said Friday, as he discussed the latest results. The entire industry is doing well, Marr said.Self-storage company CubeSmart (CUBE) has been increasing its dividend since early 2011.The quarterly dividend payout rose from 2.5 cents a share in 2010 to 13 cents a share in January and April.This gives CubeSmart the best dividend growth rate among the self-storage stocks, but it carries an asterisk. CubeSmart slashed its dividend twice during the recession.The current dividend works out to an annualized yield of 2.9%, which is the lowest vs. three other storage stocks in the Finance-Property REIT industry group.The three other stocks are ExtraSpace Storage (EXR), Public Storage (PSA) and Sovran Self Storage (SSS).Apart from the best dividend growth rate of the four, CubeSmart has the best up-down volume ratio — 1.7 which is well above the neutral 1.0.CubeSmart is working on a first-stage base.As a stock advances, it pauses to consolidate. A breakout from a first- or second-stage base is more likely to work than those from later-stage bases.The stock cleared an 18.18 buy point in a handle April 15, but there were three drawbacks. The market was in correction; volume didn't meet the desired 40% minimum increase; and the handle was low in the base.

281,PSA,"After shunning real estate investment trusts last year, investors are rebuilding their positions in companies that buy and rent real estate.REIT ETFs have been among the few sectors beating the stock market so far this year. Vanguard REIT Index (VNQ), the largest in its category with $22 billion in assets, has jumped 11% year-to-date, far surpassing the SPDR S&P 500's (SPY) 1% gain. It's a remarkable turnaround after adding only 2% when SPY popped 32% in 2013.IShares Residential Real Estate (REZ) has also vaulted 13% year-to-date, while IShares Cohen & Steers REIT (ICF) is up 12%.Investors have been flocking to income-generating assets as interest rates fell this year despite the Federal Reserve's plan to scale back its unprecedented economic stimulus, which was expected to lift interest rates. Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes are down 28 basis points so far this year to 2.72% as of Wednesday from 3.00% at the start of the year.""The average public REIT has a yield of 3.5% — much better than other alternatives and more sustainable if the economy does recover from its current anemia,"" Christian Wagner, CEO of Longview Capital Management in Wilmington, Del., said in an email. ""Builders continue to bring more product online due to low costs of funds. And in the event that we do have a significant upturn, their inventory will be sufficient to fulfill demand.""VNQ currently shows a 12-month yield of 2.9%, REZ 3.6% and ICF 3.2%, according to Morningstar. Among the biggest holdings in VNQ, Simon Property Group (SPG) is up 10% this year, Public Storage (PSA) 13% and Prologis (PLD) 12%. Top gainers among VNQ's 131 names are Ashford Hospitality Trust (AHT), up 28%, and Camden Property Trust (CPT), up 20%. They each account for less than 0.5% of VNQ's assets.REITs such as Simon, which invest in shopping centers and retail locations, should benefit from rising consumer spending and retail sales anticipated over the next year, says Robert McMillan, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ.""Most of the retail REITs have long-term leases with their customers, with embedded rent adjustments that should help insulate them from economic fluctuations,"" he wrote in an equity report April 5.""We expect tight credit conditions, though not as restrictive as they were at the height of the financial crisis in late 2008 and 2009, to continue to squeeze smaller, undercapitalized players from the market as larger retailers seek to do business with shopping -center operators that can execute in a still tight and volatile credit environment.""Although REITs are heavily indebted, their mortgages are secured by the underlying properties — which makes lenders amiable to refinancing the debts, McMillan added. But traditional brick-and-mortar stores could suffer if online shopping continues to win over customers. Retail landlords would have to focus on expanding overseas, which entails more risks, wrote Todd Lukasik, an analyst with Morningstar, in a report dated April 8.Rate-Rise RiskReal estate ETFs have absorbed $2.25 billion year -to-date after taking in $3.21 billion last year, according to ETF.com.

347,PSA,"Extra Space Storage (EXR) is still repairing the dividend damage suffered during the last recession.The Utah-based real estate investment trust skipped the second- and third-quarter payouts in 2009 and reduced the subsequent payouts.The quarterly dividend was 25 cents a share in Q1 of 2009. After skipping the next two quarters, the Q4 payout was 13 cents a share and 10 cents a share in Q1 of 2010.Since then, the quarterly dividend has doubled to 20 cents a share. The annualized yield is 2.3%.The stock appeared Friday in IBD's Your Weekly Review, which basically involves the top 15 percentile of the market.Extra Space is a REIT that derives its income from rent payments on storage units, a revenue fee of 6% on properties it manages for others, and tenant insurance.The fee-based revenue for managing other facilities brings a benefit beyond revenue. Extra Space Storage sees the management business as an acquisition pipeline. Acquisitions are a key part of Extra Space Storage's growth strategy. The company made 55 acquisitions in 2011.As of June 30, Extra Space was managing 179 facilities for franchisees or third parties. The company owns 363 facilities and has a stake in 340 joint ventures. Together, that makes for 882 in 34 states.Most facilities are in major cities. About 24% are in California.Annual earnings last year grew 28% on revenue growth of 17%. The Street expects EPS to advance 24% this year on a 16% pop in revenue.In the past three quarters, EPS leapt 30%, 31% and 34% on revenue gains of 27%, 22% and again 22%.Rivals such as Public Storage (PSA),  Sovran Self Storage (SSS) and  CubeSmart (CUBE) are showing slower growth on the top and bottom lines.Drawbacks for Extra Space include a sluggish economy and tight credit. Extra Space has $1.3 billion in total debt, with 18% subject to variable interest rates.Some market watchers say the self-storage business is ""recession-proof"" or ""recession-resistant."" If so, someone forgot to tell the stock market.In the past recession, the stock of Extra Space fell 76%, Public Storage 61%, Sovran 74% and Cube-Smart 94%.

356,PSA,"From 2004 to the end of this October, the market capitalization of health care REITS grew more than 300% to about $67 billion, according to data from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. Meanwhile the market cap of self-storage REITs has tripled to $30 billion. And while there were no publicly traded student housing REITs at the end of 2004, NAREIT data show now there are three with a total market cap of $5.8 billion.
"
357,PSA,"IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group ranks just No. 141 of 197 groups tracked. And all equity REITs generated an annualized average total return of just 2% over the five years ended Oct. 31, according to NAREIT. But its data show niches outperforming: Student housing REITs saw an average of 8%, as trusts in the health care and self-storage areas had average returns of 11.7% and 12.8%, respectively.
"
358,PSA,"Why are yields higher? Merrill notes that some 70% of college students need off-campus housing and aging Baby Boomers need health care. Self-storage has benefited from the steady thrum of marriage, divorce and other life events — not to mention moves from houses into apartments after the housing bust.
"
359,PSA,"Storage was one of the most resilient asset classes in the downturn, given its low cost and need-based nature, Merrill says. Demand ""comes from downsizing"" as the population ages, he adds, and areas with a ""high percentage of renters.""

407,PSA,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Public Storage (PSA  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 6.3% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PSA due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Public Storage Q4 FFO Beats Estimates, Revenues Up Y/YPublic Storage’s fourth-quarter 2017 core FFO per share of $2.75 marked 3.8% growth from the prior-year quarter figure of $2.65 and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.72.Results mirror an improvement in NOI from both same-store and non-same store facilities. Higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot supported the company’s same-store performance. Also, Public Storage benefited from its expansion efforts.Quarterly revenues of $672.3 million also climbed 3.2% from the prior-year quarter. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $680.5 million.For full-year 2017, core FFO per share came in at $10.23, well ahead of the prior-year tally of $9.79. This was backed by 4.2% year-over-year growth in total revenues to $2.7 billion.Behind the HeadlinesSame-store revenues advanced 2.1% year over year to $551.7 million during the fourth quarter, while the company’s NOI climbed 2.0% to $434.7 million.

This limits its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.In addition, over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter remained unchanged at $2.72. It reflects a year-over-year improvement of 2.6%.Furthermore, in the past one month, shares of Public Storage have lost 2.6%, outperforming its industry’s descend of 4.1%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Public Storage will likely beat estimates this season.

The company had reported the same figure in the year-ago quarter.The company posted revenues from rental properties of $310.6 million in the reported quarter, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $299.0 million. The figure compared favorably with the year-ago number of $292.9 million.For full-year 2017, FFO per share came in at $1.55, well ahead of the prior-year tally of $1.32. This was backed by 2.7% year-over-year growth in revenues from rental properties to $1.2 billion.Notably, the company leased more than 10.0 million square feet in 2017. This denoted the highest leasing volume in the past 10 years. Also, the company’s board authorized a $300-million share repurchase program.Quarter in DetailAt the end of the fourth quarter, pro-rata occupancy came in at 96.0%, indicating a sequential expansion of 20 basis points (bps) and 60 bps year over year.Same-property net operating income (NOI) inched up 1.2% year over year. Pro-rata rental-rate leasing spreads grew 9.2%, with rental rates for new leases and renewals/options, climbing 13.2% and 7.9%, respectively.Balance Sheet PositionKimco exited fourth-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of around $238.5 million, up from $142.5 million recorded at year-end 2016.Portfolio ActivityDuring the reported quarter, Kimco sold 16 shopping centers for a gross sales price of $234.2 million, with its share of the sales price being $174.0 million.

The company projects FFO per share in the range of $1.42-$1.46. This is based on same-property NOI growth (excluding redevelopments) projections of 1.25-2.00%, net dispositions estimations of $700-$900 million, and total redevelopment & development investment of $425-$525 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2018 FFO per share is currently pegged at $1.52.Share Repurchase ProgramIn February 2018, Kimco’s board authorized a $300-million share-repurchase program that runs through Feb 28, 2020.Our ViewpointKimco remains on track with its strategic 2020 Vision, which envisages the disposal of non-strategic assets and ownership of premium assets in major metro markets in the United States. This is reflected in its portfolio-restructuring activities in the reported quarter.Nevertheless, shrinking footfall at malls amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers are expected to hurt the performance of this retail REIT.

413,PSA,"Benchmarks ended in negative territory on Wednesday as investors remained indifferent even as Congress passed the much-awaited Republican tax Bill. During the day, all the three key U.S. indexes reached record high levels initially, but finished lower following a pullback. Markets have already traded higher in the last few sessions on optimism over the passage of the tax cut Bill and witnessed a sell-off after both the Houses actually passed the Bill on Wednesday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) decreased 0.1%, to close at 24,726.65. The S&P 500 Index (INX) fell 0.1% to close at 2,679.25. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,960.96, losing 2.39 points.

The CBOE VIX decreased 4.4% to close at 9.59.Congress Finally Pass Republican Tax BillOn Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed the Republican tax overhaul Bill. Although, the House passed the tax Bill, it violated Senate rules during this process. The three provisions which were included in the Bill did not fulfill the Byrd Rule. These include criteria used to determine whether private university grants are subject to excise taxes, allowing families to utilize 529 plans to bear home-schooling costs and the name of the Bill itself.The Senate Republicans passed the tax overhaul Bill early Wednesday, excluding the provisions. The Senate voted 51-48 in favor of the Bill, with majority of the Republicans present in the Senate supporting the new tax code. The Bill permanently slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%. Further, companies will be allowed to pay a 5% tax on reinvested earnings and 10% tax on deferred cash earnings. After the Senate passed the tax Bill, the House of Representatives re-voted 224-201 in favor of the Bill, complying with the Senate rules.Optimism regarding lower corporate tax rates has already boosted sentiment for the last few sessions. However, markets witnessed a slight pullback on Wednesday as investors had already priced in the impact of the legislation, which in turn weighed on all the three key U.S. indexes.In the of S&P 500, out of its 10 key sectors, seven of them declined yesterday with both real estate and utilities sectors being key decliners.

414,PSA,"Self-storage REIT Public Storage (PSA  -  Free Report) has been capitalizing on growth opportunities, of late. Recently, the company unveiled a new facility in Richmond, TX, that will offer more than 1,200 climate-controlled storage units and serve the growing Houston suburb. These units, with a range of prices, will satisfy personal and business requirements. The facility marks the company’s seventh in the Houston area this year.In fact, since the beginning of 2015 through Sep 30, 2017, Public Storage has acquired a total of 86 facilities with 6.2 million net rentable square feet from third parties for around $679.6 million. In addition, since Jan 1, 2013, the company has opened newly developed and redeveloped self-storage space for a total cost of $831.2 million, which added around 7.5 million net rentable square feet.Moreover, following the third-quarter 2017 closure, the company acquired or was under contract to acquire eight self-storage facilities, spanning 0.5 million net rentable square feet of space, for $67.8 million. Such acquisitions and expansions bode well for this self-storage REIT’s long-term growth.As a matter of fact, Public Storage is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. The ‘Public Storage’ brand is the most recognized and established name in the self-storage industry, with presence in all major metropolitan markets of the nation.Further, the company has managed to create a significant presence in the European markets as well, through the Shurgard Storage Centers’ acquisition in 2006. Also, the self-storage industry’s fundamentals will likely be driven by favorable demographic changes, and events like marriages, shifting, death and even divorce. The company also has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, with adequate liquidity to actively pursue acquisitions and developments.However, supply has been rising in a number of markets which has an adverse impact on the company’s pricing power. In fact, Public Storage operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. This limits its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.In addition to the above, hike in interest rate can also pose a challenge for the company. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company. Additionally, the dividend payout might become less attractive than yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Public Storage currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the past six months, shares of the company have outperformed the industry. While the stock has edged down 0.7%, the industry has incurred loss of 2.2% during this period.

These units, with a range of prices, will satisfy personal and business requirements.The facility marks the company’s seventh in the Houston area this year and is expected to serve the fast growing community, along with those in Sugar Land and neighboring master communities like Aliana Houston, Harvest Green and Long Meadow Farms, the company said.Notably, expansion in Richmond is a strategic fit for Public Storage. This is because the population of Richmond has recorded 4% growth over the last five years, per the U.S. Census. The community is growing and there is an added demand for self-storage facilities from this expanding population.Further, expansion efforts are being carried out on Grand Parkway, also known as Highway 99, to have capacity for additional commuters in the greater Houston area. As such, this facility being suitably located on the State Highway 99, can serve both Houston commuters and Richmond residents alike.Moreover, the company has been making concerted efforts to enhance its presence in the growing Houston region and has added more than a million square feet of storage space in less than a year.Public Storage is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. The ‘Public Storage’ brand is the most recognized and established name in the self-storage industry, with presence in all major metropolitan markets of the nation.The company is also capitalizing on growth opportunities. In fact, since the beginning of 2015 through Sep 30, 2017, it has acquired a total of 86 facilities with 6.2 million net rentable square feet from third parties for around $679.6 million.In addition, since Jan 1, 2013, Public Storage has opened newly developed and redeveloped self-storage space for a total cost of $831.2 million, which added around 7.5 million net rentable square feet. Such acquisitions and expansions bode well for its long-term growth.However, supply has been rising in a number of markets. This is a concern as it limits the company’s power to raise rents and turn on more discounting. Also, rate hike adds to its woes.Shares of Public Storage have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past month. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have inched up 0.2%, while the industry edged down 0.1% during the same time period.

416,PSA,"Public Storage (PSA  -  Free Report) is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. The ‘Public Storage’ brand is the most recognized and established name in the self-storage industry, with presence in all major metropolitan markets of the nation. Further, the company has managed to create a significant presence in the European markets as well, through the Shurgard Storage Centers’ acquisition in 2006.Moreover, the self-storage industry’s fundamentals are likely to be driven by favorable demographic changes, and events like marriages, shifting, death and even divorce. Also, due to shorter leasing periods, this REIT has the power to adjust its rents quickly to any rate hike.In recent times, Public Storage announced opening of new units in Plano, TX. Specifically, the company unveiled nearly 900 storage units at a new self-storage facility in the rapidly growing region of North Dallas.In fact, the company has been efficiently capitalizing on growth opportunities. Since the beginning of 2015 through Sep 30, 2017, the company has acquired a total of 86 facilities, with 6.2 million net rentable square feet from third parties for around $679.6 million. Further, since Jan 1, 2013, Public Storage has opened newly developed and redeveloped self-storage space for a total cost of $831.2 million, which added around 7.5 million of net rentable square feet.Following the third-quarter 2017 closure, the company acquired or was under contract to acquire eight self-storage facilities, spanning 0.5 million net rentable square feet of space, for $67.8 million. Such acquisitions and expansions bode well for the company’s long-term growth. The company also has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, with adequate liquidity to actively pursue acquisitions and developments.Public Storage also delivered a decent performance in the recently-reported quarter. The company’s core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $2.61 marked 3.2% growth from the prior-year quarter figure of $2.53. Results mirror an improvement in net operating income (NOI) from both same-store and non-same store facilities. Higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot supported the company’s same-store performance.Shares of Public Storage have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. The company’s shares logged in a gain of 4.2% compared with growth of 3% recorded by the industry. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year FFO per share has been revised 0.1% upward in a month’s time, reflecting analysts’ bullish sentiments. Given its progress on fundamentals, the stock is likely to keep performing well in the quarters ahead.Nonetheless, supply has been rising in a number of markets and this adversely affects the company’s pricing power. In fact, the company operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. This limits its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.Also, hike in interest rate is a concern for the company. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Public Storage currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the REIT space are Cedar Realty Trust (CDR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage (EXR  -  Free Report) and Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report). All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Cedar Realty’s FFO per share estimates for 2017 remained unchanged at 54 cents in a month. Its share price has increased 20.9% in the past six months.Extra Space Storage’s current-year FFO per share estimates inched up 0.5% to $4.33 over the past month. Its shares have rallied 12.0% over the last six months.Regency Centers’ FFO per share estimates for full-year 2017 remained unchanged at $3.67 during the same time frame. Over the past six months, the company’s shares have gained 9.4%.Note: All EPS numbers presented in this report represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.

417,PSA,"The use of leverage for real estate investment trust (REIT) businesses makes the returns from this industry susceptible to interest rate movements. This is because a rise in the interest rate affects the present value of future cash flows. Therefore, asset valuation, including bond coupons and stock dividends, experiences a decline.In addition to this, weakness in the fundamentals of certain asset categories has added to the woes because it further restricts the scope of enhancing the future cash flows from the properties of the corresponding REITs. Specifically, changes in consumer preferences and supply issues in a number of asset classes have affected the market fundamentals and are likely to continue thwarting growth of REITs in the coming months.Therefore, prior to making any investment in this special hybrid class, one needs to pay close attention to all the weakness.Fundamental WeaknessRetail REITParticularly, mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preference through the online channel, resulting in an increasing number of retailers jumping on the dot com bandwagon. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent times. In fact, the decision to close stores by a number of reputable retailers like Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report), J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) and Sears Holdings Corporation , have raised concerns over cash flows of mall landlords.Further, retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. This is a pressing concern for retail REITs, as the trend has been considerably curtailing demand for the retail real estate space.This choppy retail real estate market situation is also said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which mall landlords are finding unjustified. Moreover, significant store closures in the middle of the lease term not only hurt mall landlords, but also the tenants occupying space in that mall because their shop visits also depend on the mix of specific types of retailers.Amid these, retail REITs are fighting back and giving their malls a facelift in an attempt to lure customers. They are also adopting the latest technologies to offer attractive services to their tenants and mall visitors as well as transforming their traditional retail hubs into entertainment destinations. However, the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and, hence, is likely to limit growth in the profit margins of retail REITs in the near term.Residential REITGrowth in supply in a number of property types is hurting fundamentals. Specifically, after achieving excellent growth over the past few years, residential REITs now have an excess of new apartment deliveries in several markets.In fact, for the overall U.S. apartment market, fourth-quarter 2017 is projected to be the peak period for deliveries. However, delays resulting from labor shortage and escalating costs could push the peak season to first-quarter 2018, as the expected completion dates of a number of projects are changing to early 2018 from late 2017.Per the apartment pipeline data from Axiometrics, a RealPage Inc. (RP) company, in 2018, the Washington, DC and Los Angeles markets are likely to witness an upswing in construction, while new units in New York and Seattle markets are expected to hover near the 2017 levels.Elevated supply has already affected the performance of residential REITs over the last few quarters. The anticipation of a stressed environment in the near term is also likely to curb their ability to command more rents and affect concession levels. Further, with some of the residential REITs’ development deliveries running behind schedule amid delays in construction activities, lease-up net operating income is expected to be affected.Self-Storage REITIn the self-storage industry, there is softness in demand, with customers remaining under stress due to the current economic environment. Additionally, supply has been rising in a number of markets and this is hurting the storage REITs’ pricing power and revenue growth.Healthcare REITSoftness in seniors housing fundamentals is also likely to continue in the upcoming quarters amid a rise in new supply in the market. This is anticipated to restrict healthcare REITs’ pricing power and occupancy level.Moreover, with healthcare providers opting for cost containment, less-expensive delivery settings and new technologies, demand for medical office buildings as well as urgent-care facilities is growing.But amid the implementation healthcare reforms, the corresponding REITs have been distancing themselves from the skilled nursing facility (SNF) business. This is because though seniors housing, medical-office buildings and hospitals have been able to realize solid revenue growth in recent years, SNFs are becoming more susceptible to top-line pressure due to the gradual shift in the medical billing procedure.In fact, tenants of SNFs derive the majority of their revenues in the form of payments from Medicare and other government insurance programs. However, these tenants have been facing shorter stays and lower rates amid the shift in the billing practices, which stresses more on the value of care provided rather than the volume of services offered.On the other hand, though the U.S. industrial real estate market is enjoying a considerable boost in demand because of the exponential growth of the e-commerce business, supply has started to gain substantial momentum to put an end to the lengthiest stretch of demand-supply imbalance in the market that started way back in 2010. In fact, a lot of new buildings are slated to be completed and made available this year and next, leading to higher supply and lesser scope for rent and occupancy growth.Rising Rates Pose a ThreatFinally, rising rates will have an impact on the debt-dependent REITs. Particularly, the pace and magnitude of rate hikes, and the capacity of REITs to absorb those increases are expected to substantially shape the industry’s outlook. Therefore, things like lease durations and pricing power in the market would command much attention.Specifically, with rates moving north, healthcare REITs are generally at risk because these usually have significant exposure to long-term leased assets, which carry fixed rental rates that are subject to annual bumps. As a result, when the rate goes up, the cost of borrowing will increase, while their revenue flows will not get adjusted quickly for their fixed-rate nature, leading to an adverse impact on profitability.Moreover, performance of mortgage REITs, or mREITs, which offer real estate financing through the purchase or origination of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, are affected by the volatility in rates. These REITs fund their investments with equity and debt capital and earn profits from the spread between interest income on mortgage assets and their funding costs.Apart from these, the dividend payout itself might turn out less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts in the event of a rate hike.Bottom LineBefore calling the shots, investors should satisfy themselves by dispassionately absorbing both sides of the argument.Check out our latest REIT Industry Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective.REITs to AvoidSpecific REITs that we don't like are NexPoint Residential Trust, Inc.

Net effective rent change improved in the quarter, while period-end occupancy remained high.Over the preceding four quarters, Prologis surpassed the FFO per share estimates in three occasions and met in the other. This resulted in an average positive surprise of 4.33%. This is depicted in the graph below:Prologis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Prologis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Prologis, Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter FFO per share is currently pegged at 71 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayThe industrial real estate market is firing on all cylinders, backed by an improving economy and job-market gains, strengthening e-commerce market and high consumption levels. Demand for warehouses, distribution centers and other industrial property remains strong, and continues to surpass supply levels.In fact, per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 32 straight quarters to 7.2% for the U.S. industrial real estate market in the April-June quarter. Notably, this denotes the lowest level since 2000.Given Prologis’s capacity to offer modern distribution facilities at strategic in-fill locations, the company remains well positioned to capitalize on these growth opportunities. It also has solid balance-sheet strength. In the to-be-reported quarter, the company is expected to have enjoyed high occupancy of its properties and healthy rent levels.Moreover, Prologis’ build-to-suit activity has been stellar in the year so far, with the company completing 16 such development projects in the first half. These projects included more than 6.2 million square feet of area and involved total expected investment (TEI) of around $475 million on a Prologis-share basis. Further, this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) commenced 14 build-to-suit development starts during the same period, comprising more than 4.7 million square feet of space and involving a TEI of approximately $450 million on a Prologis-share basis.This high number of build-to-suit development projects highlights the advantageous location of the company’s land bank, as well as demand from its multi-site customers, many of whom are focused on e-commerce. These sites are positioned in urban markets that are suited for serving as the last warehouse before goods are delivered to consumers.Nevertheless, recovery in the industrial market has continued for long. Also, there is intense competition in the market. Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter rental revenues is currently pegged at $560 million, indicating 0.7% increase sequentially.Further, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to-be-reported quarter being revised 1.4% upward to 71 cents over the past three months. However, the figure denotes a projected year-over-year decrease of around 15.5%.Year to date, Prologis has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The company’s shares have appreciated 1.8% in this period compared with its industry’s growth of 0.5%.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Prologis has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Prologis is +2.26%.Zacks Rank: Prologis carries a Zacks Rank #3.A positive Earnings ESP is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely beat in terms of FFO per share.

However, the weighted-average square foot occupancy of 92.3% contracted 80 basis points year over year.In addition, the company’s NOI from non-same store facilities grew on the back of the 127 self-storage facilities acquired and developed since January 2016.Portfolio ActivityIn the reported quarter, Public Storage bought two self-storage facilities, comprising 0.2 million net rentable square feet of area, for $18 million.

425,PSA,"Public Storage (PSA  -  Free Report) is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. The ‘Public Storage’ brand is the most recognized and established name in the self-storage industry, with presence in all major metropolitan markets of the nation. Further, the company has managed to create a significant presence in the European markets as well through the Shurgard Storage Centers’ acquisition.Moreover, the self-storage industry’s fundamentals are likely to be driven by favorable demographic changes, and events like marriages, shifting, death and even divorce. Also, this REIT has the power to adjust its rents quickly to any rate hike due to shorter leasing periods.In addition, the company has been capitalizing on growth opportunities. Recently, Public Storage announced the opening of a new self-storage facility in one of Seattle’s popular suburbs. Specifically, The Public Storage located at 16311 Meridian Ave E Puyallup, WA, will accommodate more than 1,200 storage spaces. Notably, Puyallup is witnessing an influx of new residents from Seattle who are looking for more affordable housing in Puyallup. Hence, a new storage facility amid high demand will likely enable the company to enjoy elevated occupancy.Since January 2016, 127 self-storage facilities have been acquired and developed by the company. Particularly, during 2017, the company acquired 22 self-storage facilities, comprising 1.4 million net rentable square feet, for $149.8 million. Additionally, in first-quarter 2018, Public Storage acquired two self-storage facilities, comprising 0.2 million net rentable square feet of area, for $18 million. Further, as of Mar 31, 2018, the company was under contract to acquire three self-storage facilities, spanning 0.2 million net rentable square feet of space, for $19 million. Such acquisitions and expansions bode well for long-term growth.Public Storage also delivered a decent performance in the first quarter. The company’s core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $2.48 marked 4.6% growth from the prior-year quarter figure of $2.37. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.46. Results highlight improvement in net operating income from same-store and non-same-store facilities. Higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot supported the company’s same-store performance. Additionally, Public Storage benefited from its expansion efforts.Furthermore, shares of Public Storage have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. The company’s shares increased 7.6%, while the industry reported growth of 5%. Moreover, the trend in estimate revisions indicates a favorable earnings outlook for the current year.However, supply has been high in a number of markets and this affects the company’s pricing power. In fact, the company operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. This limits its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.The company has a significant development and refurbishment pipeline. In fact, as of Mar 31, 2018, it had several facilities in development (2.7 million net rentable square feet), with an estimated cost of $381 million, as well as expansion projects (2.3 million net rentable square feet), worth roughly $281 million.Public Storage estimates to incur the remaining $382 million of development costs related to these projects mainly over the next 18 months. Though this is encouraging, the substantial pipeline increases operational risks and exposes the company to rising construction costs, entitlement delays and failure to fulfill government requirements. Further, self-storage spaces are not usually pre-leased and new assets generally take time to generate yields.Also, hike in interest rate is a concern for the company. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Public Storage currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks from the real estate space include Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report), Lamar Advertising Company (LAMR  -  Free Report) and Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report). All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).Host Hotels’ Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 funds from operations (FFO) per share has risen 3% to $1.71 in two months’ time. Its shares have returned 20.2% over the past year.Lamar’s FFO per share estimates for the current year increased 1.1% in a week’s time to $5.40.

430,PSA,"We are in the heart of the Q1 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is buzzing with activity. In fact, there is a deluge of Q1 earnings releases lined up for this week, of which AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report), Public Storage (PSA  -  Free Report) and UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) will release quarterly numbers on Apr 25.Rate hike and cautious approach of investors have affected returns from this industry, so far, this year. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining REITs’ performance, not all players in the space are equally poised to excel or fall behind this season.Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. The figure not only marked a contraction of 6 basis points (bps) sequentially, but also shrunk 20 bps, year over year, on average, across 50 markets that are followed by CBRE. Moreover, net asking rents inched up 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square foot, denoting the highest mark since CBRE started following the metric in 1989. High consumption levels, strengthening e-commerce market, and a healthy manufacturing environment amid recovering economy and job market are fueling demand.However, the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — states that the national apartment market moderated in the Jan-Mar quarter. Nevertheless, the first quarter marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand.Going by statistics, annual rent growth shrunk to 2.3% in Q1. This marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% this March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%, with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy.Furthermore, the self-storage industry is anticipated to experience solid demand backed by favorable demographic changes, improving job market and rising incomes, as well as events like marriages, shifting, death, and even divorce. Also, due to shorter leasing periods, this REIT has the power to adjust its rents quickly to any rate hike.Therefore, let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ first-quarter results.AvalonBay Communities Inc.Residential REIT AvalonBay is well poised to grow on the back of rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics. Additionally, increasing consumer confidence driven by job growth, higher wages and a healthier balance sheet promises brighter prospects for this Arlington, VA-based REIT. Amid these, the company is likely to continue experiencing high occupancy.However, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of markets of the company. This high supply is expected to have put pressure on rental rates in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, there is high-concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.  (Read more: AvalonBay to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)In a March-issued operating update for the first quarter, AvalonBay stated that it expects total rental revenues for established communities to be up 2.3-2.4% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is $558.5 million, denoting an expected increase of 6.9% year over year. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations (FFO) per share is pegged at $2.18, indicating projected increase of 4.3% year over year.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively show that AvalonBay is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.In fact, though AvalonBay has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, its Earnings ESP of -0.28% makes surprise prediction difficult.Moreover, AvalonBay has a mixed surprise history, as evident from the chart below:AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AvalonBay Communities, Inc. QuoteDuke Realty CorporationIn recent years, Duke Realty has made concerted efforts to enhance its industrial portfolio. Admittedly, this asset class has been witnessing improving fundamentals amid economic recovery and growth of e-commerce business. This is spurring demand for warehouse space as companies are compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms, helping the industrial real estate market to record growth.Nonetheless, Duke Realty is enhancing its portfolio mix through continued divestitures, which includes the significant disposition of sub-urban office assets and medical office buildings. While such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect on earnings cannot be bypassed. Furthermore, the company faces significant competition from developers, owners and operators of the commercial real estate. This influences its ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors. (Read more: Duke Realty to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in the Offing?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $183.8 million, indicating a decline of 15.7% year over year. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is 30 cents, pointing to an estimated year-over-year decline of 6.3%.Although Duke Realty has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, its Earnings ESP of -1.70% lowers chances of any positive surprise this season.The story about Duke Realty’s decent surprise history is better told by the chart below:Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Duke Realty Corporation QuotePublic StoragePublic Storage is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. High brand value, strategic acquisitions, robust presence in key cities and healthy balance sheet serve as major growth drivers for the company. The company is likely to be able to achieve reasonable rate hike for its existing customers. In addition, acquisition and expansion initiatives are anticipated to stoke growth.Amid these, the company remains well poised to record growth in revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $668.9 million, depicting projected rise of 3.6%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is currently pegged at $2.46, indicating an expected rise of 5.1% year over year.Nevertheless, supply has been rising in a number of markets and this adversely affects the company’s pricing power. In fact, it operates in a highly fragmented market in the nation, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. This, in turn, limits the company’s power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.

Additionally, it has a superior portfolio in targeted U.S. markets and adheres to disciplined capital allocation. These are likely to drive results in the to-be-reported quarter. Specifically, the company is predicted to benefit from favorable demographic trends. There is a steady demand for rental apartments from both new millennial households and empty nesters. Along with this, the healthy job market is estimated to drive demand for apartments.However, the company has been dealing with escalating deliveries in a number of its markets. This remains a concern as elevated levels of supply curtail landlords’ ability to demand higher rents and result in lesser absorption. Consequently, concession levels are estimated to have remained at the higher end, while UDR’s pricing power might have been limited in the quarter.

Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $253 million, indicating year-over-year improvement of 3.8%.Although UDR has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, its Earnings ESP of -0.30% lowers chances of any positive surprise this season.The story about UDR’s surprise history is better told by the chart below:United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.
