0,MDT,"Stocks hit record highs during the holiday-shortened week. Black Friday kicked off holiday shopping, while several retailers reported earnings, including Lowe's (LOW) and Dollar Tree (DLTR), along with tech giants Salesforce.com (CRM), HP Inc. (HPQ) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE). The Justice Department moved to block the AT&T (T)-Time Warner (TWX) merger, while the FCC signaled it'll pare back net neutrality rules. Marvell Technology (MRVL) agreed to buy Cavium (CAVM) for $6 billion.X The Nasdaq rose 1.6% while the S&P 500 and Dow climbed 0.9%, all setting all-time highs. Higher oil prices lifted energy stocks while Apple (AAPL) had solid gains and the Marvell-Cavium deal kept chips rallying. Earnings were mixed, with Salesforce, HP, HPE falling on results or guidance.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereThe Justice Department said the megamerger would harm consumers because the combined media-and-telecom giant might extract higher prices for Time Warner (TWX) content from other video distributors, or try to withhold content from emerging rivals. The DOJ has asked AT&T (T) to sell off Turner Broadcasting or its DirecTV satellite business to gain approval. AT&T rejected the DOJ's claims and proposed conditions, suggesting President Trump's animus toward Time Warner-owned CNN was a key factor. The DOJ's move could chill other big mergers, analysts say. AT&T and Time Warner rose about 1%.Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) fell 7% Wednesday on weak guidance and CEO Meg Whitman's decision to step down on Feb. 1 amid ongoing restructuring. Antonio Neri, who was named president in June, will replace Whitman. October quarter earnings and revenue topped lowered expectations. But for the January quarter, HPE forecast adjusted EPS of 22 cents at its midpoint of guidance vs. estimates of 28 cents. HPE has sold off its software and enterprise services businesses to focus on servers, networking and data storage hardware but faces stiff competition from Cisco (CSCO) and Dell Technologies (DVMT).The PC and printer maker's fiscal Q4 revenue rose 11% to $13.9 billion. But earnings only met views for a 22% gain and  HP Inc. (HPQ) gave in line guidance, raising concerns about the company's growth outlook. HP shares fell 5% Wednesday.Marvell Technology (MRVL) announced a deal to buy fellow chipmaker Cavium (CAVM) for more than $6 billion to create an ""infrastructure solutions powerhouse"" in communications and data centers. Marvell agreed to pay $40 and 2.1757 Marvell common shares for each Cavium share, or $91.78 as of Friday's close. Both stocks rose sharply after gaining earlier in the month on reports that a deal was close.Salesforce.com (CRM) reported Q3 earnings surged 62% to 39 cents a share, with revenue rising 25% to $2.68 billion, both topping. But for the January quarter, Salesforce.com forecast adjusted earnings of 32-33 cents a share vs. estimates of 34 cents a share. Salesforce.com named Bret Taylor, a former chief technology officer at Facebook (FB), as president and chief product officer. Salesforce.com acquired startup Quip, where Taylor was CEO, last year. Salesforce.com named Alex Dayon chief strategy officer. Salesforce shares fell 1.8% Wednesday but just edged lower for the week, right at record highs.The Republican-led Federal Communications Commission moved closer to dismantling the Obama administration's net neutrality rules. The FCC aims to increase broadband investment by cable TV companies and other internet service providers. The FCC will vote Dec. 14 on Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to scrap public-utility-type Title 2 regulations that were foisted on ISPs. ISPs may be able to charge content providers or business partners fees for ""prioritized"" services. Some regulatory authority on consumer protection could shift to the Federal Trade Commission. Pai says new ""transparency"" rules will protect consumers.RELATED:Why FCC Net-Neutrality Reversal Could Later Be Reversed AgainPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Q1 earnings rose 34% while revenue swelled 27% to $505.5 million, both topping the consensus. The cybersecurity firm guided December-quarter estimates slightly higher. Shares jumped 5.55%. Palo Alto's solid quarter followed soft sales and disappointing guidance from other computer software security providers.On Monday, Roche (RHHBY) unveiled upbeat data from trials in immuno-oncology and hemophilia A — sending its shares up 8.6%. But Dow stock Merck (MRK) fell to an 18-month low after Roche's combination of Tecentriq, cancer drug Avastin and chemotherapy helped reduce the risk of disease worsening or death in patients with advanced lung cancer. Merck's Keytruda-and-chemo combo was approved in May. Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) lost nearly 10% as Roche said its Hemlibra significantly reduced bleeds in a Phase 3 study of hemophilia A.Malls were crowded on the traditional holiday kickoff even as online and mobile shopping continues to grow rapidly and retailers of all kinds touted deals well before Black Friday. Amazon (AMZN) and Wal-Mart (WMT) are expected to do well, but it will be a critical holiday season for Macy's (M) and other department stores.Dollar Tree (DLTR) Q3 EPS jumped 25% to $1.01 with sales up 6.4% to $5.32 billion, both beating Street estimates. The deep discounter sees Q4 EPS of $1.80-$1.89 vs. consensus views for $1.80, on sales of $6.32 billion-$6.43 billion vs. consensus views for $6.36 billion. Shares leapt 4%, hitting new highs. Off-price apparel chain Burlington Stores (BURL) Q3 EPS soared 40% to 70 cents, beating views but sales only rose 6.6% to $1.438 billion, just short. Same-store sales climbed 3.1%. Shares fell 3% for the week after hitting record highs Monday.Urban Outfitters (URBN) earnings unexpectedly rose in the latest quarter. The young-adult clothier's reported earnings of 41 cents, up 3% vs. a year ago, on sales of $893 million, up 4%. Analysts were expecting EPS to slide 18% to 33 cents. Guess (GES) topped earnings views but revenue fell short. DSW (DSW) reported a 12% EPS drop that missed views, with the shoe retailer also giving weak guidance. Urban Outfitters hit an 11-month high while Guess and DSW tumbled below recent buy points.Shares of recent IPO Qudian (QD), Yirendai (YRD) and other China-based providers of online credit plunged on reports that China authorities had ordered a suspension of online small-loan approvals. The rapid expansion of consumer loans, especially on online microloan platforms, has raised concerns among financial regulators.Home-improvement retailer Lowe's (LOW) third-quarter earnings, revenue and same-store sales beat estimates, helped by higher home-repair demand in the wake of the summer's string of hurricanes. But shares fell, with some analysts saying Wall Street may have wanted more acceleration following a weak second quarter, and expressing concerns about thinner margins and its outlook for the year. Earlier this month, larger rival Home Depot (HD) beat views and raised its full-year forecast.The QuickBooks and TurboTax maker's earnings leapt 83% as revenue grew 14% to $886 million in the October fiscal first quarter, easily beating views. For the current quarter, Intuit (INTU) guided to adjusted earnings per share of 33 cents on sales of $1.17 billion, modestly above analyst models. Shares fell 3.8% on Tuesday following earnings after hitting a record Monday. Intuit lost 1.7% for the week.Durable goods orders, which tend to be volatile, fell in October after a big gain in September. Core capital goods orders dipped, but the business investment proxy jumped vs. a year earlier. October existing-home sales rose 2% to an annual rate of 5.48 million, slightly above views, as hurricane impacts fade.

Deere hit record highs.BitAuto (BITA) fell 14% following weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings, though revenue and revenue guidance topped.  Shares of the Chinese auto information site have plunged 25% so far in November.Analog Devices (ADI)beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal fourth quarter and guided higher for the current quarter. But the chipmaker's stock fell from Monday's record highs, likely because the magnitude of the beat wasn't as large as in prior quarters.Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google cut prices on cloud-computing services — including those that use superfast number-crunching processors from Nvidia (NVDA) ahead of an Amazon.com (AMZN) annual user conference.China e-commerce services provider Baozun (BZUN) beat quarterly earnings and revenue estimates, but gave in-line guidance. Shares fell nearly 14%.

1,MDT,"Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) surpassed Wall Street's third-quarter expectations early Tuesday on strength in its pharmaceutical unit and boosted its 2017 guidance — prompting shares to pop in premarket trades.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, J&J stock jumped 3.4% to finish at 140.79. Shares broke out of a flat base with a buy point at 137.18 on Oct. 12.For its third quarter, J&J reported $19.7 billion in sales and adjusted income of $1.90 per share, up a respective 10.3% and 13.1% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both metrics topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $19.28 billion in sales and $1.80 a share in earnings.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro attributed J&J's sales beat to upside in its pharma unit. Global sales were $300 million above his forecast and $360 million above the consensus.Pharma revenue topped Novarro's estimate by $270 million, but medical device sales lagged.Worldwide pharma sales of $9.7 billion increased 15.4% on a year-over-year basis. Key products included cancer drugs Darzalex, Imbruvica and Zytiga, with the latter beating Novarro's views by $125 million. Sales from the new Actelion brands were $30 million below Novarro's model.IBD'S TAKE: J&J isn't alone in reporting quarterly results this week as earnings season kicks off in earnest. Keep tabs on IBD's Investing Action Plan for what's on deck each day.Medical devices sales grew 7.1% to $6.6 billion, but that included some shortfalls and was slightly below Novarro's view for $6.61 billion. Orthopedic and vision care revenue both were light by $25 million and $40 million, respectively, he wrote in a note to clients.J&J's consumer unit grew 2.9% to $3.4 billion and were just ahead of the RBC estimate for $3.31 billion. On an operational basis, over-the-counter and beauty sales each grew 4.4%, but all other categories fell ""highlighting the continued pressure in the segment.""The firm also raised its 2017 guidance to sales of $76.1 billion to $76.5 billion, up from $75.8 billion to $76.1 billion. It sees adjusted income of $7.25-$7.30 per share vs. earlier expectations for $7.12-$7.22, Novarro wrote. Analysts had modeled $75.9 billion in sales and $7.19 in per-share earnings.J&J disclosed that its medical devices segment sustained a negative impact of 30 basis points following hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. J&J is among a number of firms with manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico. Investors have been wary of the effects of the storms.The negative impact was attributed to lost surgery days in areas affected by stormwater, wrote Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges in a note to clients. There was no supply disruption and all six of the firm's sites in Puerto Rico are open with generator power and running at different capacities.Porges notes that J&J's results could extend to others in the biotech space.""Given J&J's reliance on Puerto Rico for pharmaceutical manufacturing, and their lack of disclosure regarding demand and supply impacts, we are increasingly confident that companies in our biopharma coverage will not experience material storm-related Q3 headwinds,"" he said.But RBC's Novarro is a bit less bullish. J&J's results point to ""continued soft U.S. market trends"" in medical devices and diagnostics, he said. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, J&J's medical devices and diagnostics unit grew just 1.2% year over year.Overall, U.S. hospital admissions were down 50 to 100 basis points with U.S. surgical procedures down about 250 basis points, on a year-over-year basis, Novarro wrote. J&J's orthopedic sales were short on weak performance in its knee and spine segments.""Weak knee performance was blamed on the negative impact of India implant pricing legislation,"" he wrote, estimating a $10 million sales impact in the quarter. Worldwide, knee revenue declined 4.4% year over year. Revenue from hip products, though, grew 1.5% on pricing declines.J&J likely lost share to Stryker (SYK) in its knee-products unit, Novarro said. Global spine-product sales declined 7%. It's losing share in its U.S. spine-product segment, which benefits NuVasive (NUVA) and K2M Group (KTWO). This also suggests continued weak growth in the quarter for the U.S. spine-product market.Separately, it looks like J&J lost some share of the U.S. trauma-product market to Stryker, though worldwide sales grew 2.1%.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and Medtronic (MDT) are taking pieces of J&J's surgery unit, Novarro said.RELATED:Why It Might Be Time To Buy Dow's J&J, A 'Dividend Machine'Dow's J&J Flirts With Buy Point On Bullish Pre-Earnings ReportThese Medtech Players Are Flailing On Hurricane-Related Headwinds

3,MDT,"Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria didn't just devastate Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico: Medtech players Medtronic (MDT), K2M Group (KTWO) and Wright Medical Group (WMGI) were flailing in the headwinds on Monday.XIn afternoon trading on the stock market today, IBD's 116-company Medical-Products industry group, which Medtronic leads by market cap, fell a collective 1.1% after K2M and Medtronic acknowledged the impact the hurricanes had on their quarterly metrics.But they won't be alone, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro wrote in a note to clients. News reports indicate 70% of Puerto Rico's hospitals were not operational at the end of the third quarter. Those that were operational may not have been running at full capacity, he said.""We assume two lost weeks of procedures at the end of the third quarter (in Puerto Rico) for device manufacturers,"" he said. ""Also, we conservatively estimate that no elective procedures will be performed in Puerto Rico in the fourth quarter.""On Friday, Medtronic said it expected a $250 million impact to both revenue and earnings in its fiscal second quarter. The firm said it's too early to determine whether there will be an impact in the latter half of the year. At least three analysts cut their price targets on the stock.K2M followed Medtronic on Monday, pre-announcing negative Q3 results and sustaining at least two price-target haircuts. For the quarter, K2M expects to report $62.7 million in sales, up 6% vs. the year-earlier period, but below analysts' views for $67 million.The firm also trimmed its 2017 sales outlook to $255 million to $257 million, which would grow 8% to 9%.Shares of K2M were among those hardest hit in the Medical-Products group, plunging 18.4% to close at 17.77 Monday. Wright, NuVasive (NUVA) and Globus Medical (GMED), which make medical implants, dove a respective 5.2%, 4.9% and 3.9%.But Novarro says there could be opportunities for investors in NuVasive and Wright. NuVasive is capable of accelerating organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter and 2018, and Wright has a strong product portfolio plus operating-margin expansion opportunities, he said.""We expect management teams to cut guidance due to hurricane-related revenue shortfalls, which the sell-off over the past several weeks is already discounting,"" he said. ""While NuVasive and Wright are each dealing with specific short-term issues, the setup for 2018 looks attractive.""In a separate report after K2M's pre-announcement, Novarro noted that investor sentiment on spine stocks remains negative. He cut his price target on K2M to 22 from 26, but kept his outperform rating and said he would be a buyer on any pullback in the stock. The worst is already priced in, he argued.Needham analyst Mike Matson is more bearish still on spine players. Outside of the hurricanes, K2M was impacted by weaker degenerative and deformity procedure growth in August and September, Matson wrote in a note to clients. It's likely Globus and NuVasive will miss estimates in the third quarter.Matson lowered his 2017 view on K2M to $256 million from $267 million. For 2018, he now sees $279 million, down from earlier expectations for $300 million. He also trimmed his price target on K2M to 27 from 29, though kept his strong-buy rating.Medtronic toppled to an eight-month low Monday on a series of price-target cuts after it announced Hurricane Maria's damage in Puerto Rico could hit earnings and revenue by up to $250 million. Also last week, Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) said the hurricanes will be a headwind against its third-quarter earnings.Novarro expects Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Boston Scientific (BSX) to chip away at sales of Medtronic's implantable heart devices. Several newly launched products are on back-order status or had lower inventory levels before the hurricane, the firm said in a press release.IBD'S TAKE: Medtronic has an IBD Composite Rating of 48 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it underperforms more than half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at stronger performers.""Competitors may be able to take advantage of such a supply shortage, which is hard to quantify at this stage,"" Novarro said. ""Therefore, we see downside risk to both revenue and (earnings) guidance for the second half of 2018.""For the second fiscal quarter, Novarro trimmed his model to $6.8 billion in sales and 92 cents earnings per share, down from $7.05 billion and $1.07.Novarro also slashed his views for fiscal 2018-19. For 2018, he models $28.9 billion in sales and $4.55 earnings per share. He forecasts $5.13 in EPS on $29.8 billion in sales in fiscal 2019. This resulted in his price target cut to 85 from 90, though Novarro kept his outperform rating.At least two other analysts cut their price targets on Medtronic stock. Wells Fargo downgraded Medtronic to a market perform from outperform. Medtronic toppled 3.6% to finish at 76.93.Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) appeared to sustain ""minimal damage"" to its Janssen unit Gurabo facility, which makes Remicade, Xarelto, Prezista and a number of other drugs, according to UBS analyst Carter Gould, who viewed satellite images of the facilities.""Based on utilization of most of the lots on site it appears that activity is returning to the facility,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Fellow drugmaker Amgen (AMGN) had visible damage to the roofs of two buildings and flooding on an access road to a manufacturing site in Puerto Rico. But by Oct. 4, both roofs appeared to have been fixed and the parking lots were at 80% capacity, Gould said.Amgen confirmed to Gould it's using diesel generators on site and contracted fuel providers have been making shipments. In the meantime, the first shipment from its inventory on Puerto Rico has already flown off the island, Gould said.It's unlikely the Food and Drug Administration will require an inspection before allowing Amgen to restart production.""While we would ultimately expect some accounting charge related to this, we are incrementally less concerned on potential disruptions to product supply,"" he said.RELATED:Medtronic Sinks After Sales Lag, Though Earnings Beat ViewsThis Robotics Player Neared 1,000, Then Toppled — Here's WhyThis Drug Bellwether's Sales Miss Actually Bodes Well For The Sector

4,MDT,"General Electric's (GE) Jeffrey Immelt cut his ties with the company about three months ahead of schedule, retiring as chairman and leaving the board.XJohn Flannery, who took over as chief executive officer from Immelt in August, was elected chairman, GE said in a statement Monday. Immelt left after determining ""that the CEO transition has proceeded smoothly,"" said the maker of jet engines, gas turbines and ultrasound machines.The shift accelerates GE's leadership transition as Flannery, under pressure from activist shareholder Trian Fund Management, seeks to reverse this year's biggest stock drop on the Dow Jones industrial average. Under the new boss, GE has said it will sell its fleet of corporate jets and unload its industrial-products operation to ABB (ABB). Flannery is expected to outline his plans for GE's portfolio of businesses next month.Immelt, 61, had been expected to step down as chairman of Boston-based GE at the end of the year. He pulled himself out of consideration for the top job at Uber Technologies in late August.With his knowledge of a wide variety of industrial businesses and countries where GE did business, Immelt is a potentially attractive candidate to work at a private-equity firm, said Scott Simmons, managing director at Crist Kolder Associates, an executive-search company.""There's gray matter up there that's valuable,"" said Simmons, whose firm has worked with companies such as Medtronic (MDT) and Polaris Industries (PII). ""Making tough decisions, under duress, in a difficult marketplace is what he did and many out there will clamor to have that on their team.""Immelt also departed as chairman of Baker Hughes, a GE Company (BHGE). The provider of oilfield equipment and services named CEO Lorenzo Simonelli as chairman. Baker Hughes elected Geoffrey Beattie as lead independent director.GE has tumbled 22% this year. The shares climbed less than 1% to $24.66 after the close of regular trading in New York, when Immelt's departure as chairman was announced.

5,MDT,"In his first run with the Food and Drug Administration, gene and cell therapy were early-stage, theoretical concepts, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said Tuesday.XBut last month, the FDA approved its first cellular therapy, a drug called Kymriah from Novartis (NVS) to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients age 25 and younger. Kite Pharma (KITE), soon to be acquired by Gilead Sciences (GILD), is expected to grab a similar approval in November.In 2005, gene/cell therapy and drugs that biologically copy an existing product — known as biosimilars — didn't exist, Gottlieb told the MedTech Conference in San Jose, Calif.""Now we have products we're reviewing and approving,"" he said.Gottlieb is nearly five months into his stint as FDA commissioner. He was among the first appointments by President Donald Trump and took office in May. He first served as an FDA deputy commissioner in 2005-07.Gottlieb's background has him uniquely prepared to head up what is now a much bigger FDA, said Scott Whitaker, Chief Executive of AdvaMed, the world's largest medical technology association. Gottlieb was diagnosed with a type of lymphoma when he was younger.""It was the kind of tumor only a hypochondriac doctor would have found on himself,"" Gottlieb told the audience at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center. As a doctor, Gottlieb researched the type of treatment he wanted, knowing he had a very good chance of survival.IBD'S TAKE: Medtech stocks have been riding out drug-pricing fears that have hurt the pharma and biotech sectors, analysts say. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at winners and losers in the political discourse.He acknowledged not every patient fits into that bucket.""I was a very different patient from the patient who is told, 'You have a 20% chance of survival,'"" he said. ""They're looking for something experimental; something that might not be approved yet. There's a lot of different cancer patients.""Part of his challenge, Gottlieb says, is ensuring the FDA has policies that help all patients.""It's difficult to simultaneously serve both types of patients because by serving one patient you could potentially impact another patient,"" he said.Today, the FDA has its hands in a number of areas. Gottlieb says most people would be surprised to find he spends most of his time working on the tobacco side. What won't surprise the public, though, is that the FDA is working closely on ameliorating the opioid crisis.Last month, Trump declared the opioid crisis a national emergency. To cope, companies like Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Medtronic (MDT) are working on therapies called neuromodulation, which use electricity to conceal pain from the brain.Gottlieb notes medical products could step in as alternatives to addictive opioids. A medical device ""could deliver localized therapy or a patch to treat localized pain vs. drugs that have a systemic approach and are very addictive,"" he said.The FDA is also working on a framework for quicker review and certification of software programs. Rather than go through the longer products review, these software programs can be reviewed with less information.Apple (APPL), FitBit (FIT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Pear Therapeutics, Phosphorus, Roche (RHHBY), Samsung, Tidepool and Verily will be involved in the pilot program which seeks to identify the information companies will need to provide for the quicker review process, Gottlieb said.""We need to modernize our regulatory framework so that it matches the kind of innovation we're being asked to evaluate, and foster beneficial technology while ensuring that consumers have access to high-quality, safe and effective digital health devices,"" he said.RELATED:This Biotech Craters 70% On Late-Stage Alzheimer's Drug Failure

6,MDT,"Medtronic (MDT) shares sank early Tuesday after the maker of medical devices reported fiscal first-quarter sales that lagged Wall Street estimates, though adjusted profit beat by 4 cents a share.In early trading on the stock market today, Medtronic dropped 2.1% to close at 81.76. Shares fell well below a flat base that began forming in late June with an 89.82 buy point. Meanwhile, IBD's ninth-ranked Medical-Products industry group advanced 0.6%.Medtronic reported $7.39 billion in sales, up 3%, but that fell short of the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $7.45 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.12 per share beat the $1.08 view and grew 9%.Medtronic's restorative therapies and minimally invasive therapies businesses contributed to the revenue miss, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro wrote in a note to clients. But Novarro kept his outperform rating on the company.Restorative therapies include work on the spine and brain, as well as pain management. Sales in that unit rose 2% to $1.81 billion, but missed views for $1.84 billion. Minimally invasive therapies include surgical and monitoring/recovery; this business grew 3% to $2.49 billion but missed by $28 million.IBD'S TAKE: Medtronic has an IBD Composite Rating of 66 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms two-thirds of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Still, it lags top performers like Abiomed (ABMD) and Align Technology (ALGN), which have CRs of 99. Visit IBD Stock Checkup for a closer look at strong performers.Cardiac and vascular sales advanced 5% to $2.65 billion, but were a tad light. Medtronic noted that adoption of its CoreValve Evolut Pro platform in the U.S. helped drive high-30% growth, excluding foreign exchange rates, in sales of its transcatheter heart-valve replacements.Diabetes tech sales, though, fell 1% to $449 million, missing by $25 million. The group was temporarily affected by a limited supply of some glucose sensors, Medtronic said in a news release.Medtronic reaffirmed its full-year guidance for 4%-5% sales growth and 9%-10% adjusted EPS growth, excluding foreign exchange rates. But it cut views for diabetes sales to 1%-4% growth from its prior 10%-12% outlook. Its cardiac forecast was boosted to 5.5%-7% growth.RELATED:This Robotics Player Neared 1,000, Then Toppled — Here's WhyRobot-Surgeon Maker Bests Q2 Sales, Profits ViewsThis Drug Bellwether's Sales Miss Actually Bodes Well For The Sector

9,MDT,"Thanks to a Gilead-Kite merger, biotechs had a big week. They've also rallied this year and over the longer haul.XThree of the top four health sector ETFs ranked by year-to-date returns through Aug. 29 were biotech-focused, according to Morningstar Direct. The top performer, SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI), posted a 36.4% gain, well ahead of the S&P 500's 10.8% advance.The ETF, featured in Monday's ETF Leaders column, broke out past an 82.48 flat-base entry Thursday and remains in buy range. Shares ran up 13% from a June breakout from a flat base to the start of the just-cleared pattern. The fund, launched in January 2006, has $4.15 billion in assets and bears a 0.35% expense ratio.Coming in second is First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech (FBT), with a 31.4% YTD gain. The ETF is in a buy zone from a breakout past a 121.02 flat-base entry. The 11-year-old fund, which tracks the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index, has attracted $1.14 billion in assets. It carries a 0.56% expense ratio.It counted among its top holdings as of Aug. 30 Kite Pharma (KITE), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Illumina (ILMN). Kite gapped up and soared 28% on Aug. 28 after Gilead Sciences (GILD) announced that it's buying Kite for $11.9 billion. XBI, mentioned above, also got a boost from Kite.IShares U.S. Medical Devices (IHI) took third place with a 22.6% YTD return. The ETF recently regained its 50-day moving average line as it shapes a flat base with a potential 169.90 buy point. The $1.40 billion fund, which marked its 11th anniversary in May, tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Medical Equipment Index.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead Sciences has been in the news lately due to its Kite Pharma acquisitions. How does it rank among biotechs? Find out now at IBD Stock Checkup.Its top holdings as of Aug. 30 included Medtronic (MDT), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO). IHI's expense ratio is 0.44%.IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) rounded out the top four with a 20% YTD gain. Its price action is similar to the other two biotech ETFs — in buy range following a Thursday breakout from a flat base. The buy point in this case is 330.

16,MDT,"Bellwether Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) second-quarter report bodes well for the biotech sector, an analyst said Tuesday, after the Dow component topped profit expectations and narrowly lagged sales views.On the stock market today, J&J stock climbed 1.8% to 134.46, as biotech stocks dropped nearly 1% as a group. Generic drugmakers inched down 0.3%.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges remains bullish on the biotech sector and Needham analyst Mike Matson says J&J's second-quarter results point to a stable period for medtech players like Boston Scientific (BSX), Medtronic (MDT), Stryker (SYK) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH).During the quarter, J&J's drug sales grew 4.7% sequentially, though they fell 2.6% vs. the year-earlier period. Porges partially blamed a one-time positive rebate adjustment in 2016 which eliminated 4% of year-over-year volume/price growth in the second quarter.Sales of J&J's immunosuppressant Remicade declined 14% year over year. But rivalry from biosimilars contributed to just 5% of that decline, which is lower than guidance for a 10%-15% decline in 2017, Porges wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Cancer and rare-disease specialists are expected to do well in the second half of 2017 as positive sentiment returns to the biotech space. Visit IBD's Industry Snapshot for a look at who may outperform in the second quarter.J&J also expects currency headwinds to subside in the second half of 2017 and called for acceleration in its pharmaceutical unit as well as positive trends in sales outside the U.S. Based on the presumed currency impacts, the firm raised its outlook for adjusted profits to $7.12-$7.22 a share.Outside the U.S., drug sales grew 7% sequentially in the second quarter, beating views for 3% growth, Porges said.""(This) supports our expectations for sequential outside-U.S. revenue growth for our companies due to a weakening dollar in the second quarter,"" he said.Porges expects guidance increases for biotechs during the second quarter. Earlier in the week, he called for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) to easily beat June quarter sales views and for Gilead Sciences (GILD) to handily top profit expectations.""Our covered companies will not be negatively impacted by the same prior period adjustments as J&J, and those with current or imminent biosimilar competition may surprise consensus if the Remicade market dynamics can be viewed as a proxy,"" he said.AbbVie (ABBV) could see some pain, though. Sales of cancer drug Imbruvica grew 40% in the U.S. and 64% outside the U.S., J&J said. J&J is partnered with AbbVie on Imbruvica in the U.S. J&J typically books 40% of U.S. Imbruvica sales, Porges said. This translates to about $501 million for AbbVie's Imbruvica sales.This would be a ""miss vs. consensus of $514 million and our estimate of $537 million,"" he said. ""For AbbVie, Imbruvica is considered the largest growth driver beyond the Humira patent cliff, but continued missed consensus expectations repeated in the second quarter would be a negative for the stock.""RELATED:'Stars Align' For These Biotechs To Crush Earnings ConsensusThese 2 Drug Giants In Buy Range Just Beat Earnings ViewsHow Novartis' FDA Win In Cancer Also Could Be A Boon For Its Rivals

17,MDT,"A number of high-profile medical technology firms, including the likes of Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Medtronic (MDT), are unlikely to stand in the way of Dutch firm Philips' bid for heart device-maker Spectranetics (SPNC), an analyst said Wednesday.XOn the stock market today, Spectranetics stock rocketed to a record closing high, up 26.2%,  to 38.35, after Philips announced its plan to acquire Spectranetics for $38.50 in cash per share. The deal values Spectranetics at 1.9 billion euros, about $2.16 billion.Needham analyst Mike Matson says the bidding will likely stop there as Boston Scientific, Abbott and Medtronic aren't expected to bid for the company. Spectranetics makes a drug-coated balloon called Stellarex as a treatment for a disease in which the arteries to the legs, stomach, arms and head narrow.Rivals C.R. Bard (BCR), Boston Scientific and Medtronic already make drug-coated balloons, Matson wrote in a note to clients. Further, Becton Dickinson (BDX) is acquiring C.R. Bard for $24 billion.That leaves three major firms in the sector that lack drug-coated balloons: Abbott, Cardinal Health (CAH) and Terumo.""We suspect Abbott is too preoccupied with its St. Jude Medical and Alere (ALR) acquisitions to pursue another large deal,"" he said. ""Similarly, Cardinal is in the process of acquiring Medtronic's medical supplies business for $6 billion.""IBD'S TAKE: The heart-valve sector heated up last year as Boston Scientific made an acquisition that could bring it closer to competing with Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences  in the U.S. Head to Sector Leaders a look at for how the battle is shaping up.Matson is unsure of Terumo's acquisition strategy.Similarly, he doesn't expect Philips' acquisition to get caught up with regulatory issues. Philips and Spectranetics only overlap in atherectomy, a process in which hardened or narrowed arteries are removed from the body. Philips got into the area with an earlier acquisition.""But we believe its market share is very low and think regulatory issues are unlikely,"" he said.Philips said Wednesday that it expects the deal to close in the third quarter.

""However, investors' exuberance about the company's strong performance over the past few years has driven the stock to unprecedented valuation levels.""Mills downgraded Intuitive Surgical stock to a hold rating from buy after two years, though he kept his 870 price target. At the close on the stock market today, Intuitive Surgical was up 0.5%, to 914.43.""While we expect Intuitive Surgical to deliver solid results in 2017 and 2018, we believe the risk/reward setup tilts too much to the former at the present,"" he said. The stock hasn't traded at this valuation since 2012 and is now at a 34% premium to its own five-year average.IBD'S TAKE: Intuitive Surgical stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of a best-possible 99. It's ranked fourth in IBD's 58-company Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group. Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) stock leads the group, with a CR of 98. For a look at the group setup, head to IBD Stock Checkup.Guidance has played a big role in Intuitive Surgical's stock, Mills said. The company typically offers conservative guidance that it easily outperforms, thus investors expect ""positive guidance revisions through the balance of 2017.""But that might not be the case. The Easter weekend tailwind in the first quarter will become a headwind in the second quarter, and outside-U.S. business is slowing, Mills wrote. Procedure growth is expected to be subdued in Japan and to moderate in China.""While we think there could be upside to current guidance, we think you're already paying for that,"" he wrote.In the meantime, competition is looming, he said. Intuitive Surgical makes robotics that assist in performing surgery. Medtronic reiterated on its earnings call last week its plan to launch its surgical robotics outside the U.S. before April 2018 and in the U.S. during fiscal 2019.""Medtronic's competitive approach seems to be centered on its ability to target the customer across myriad surgical spectrums, but we also deduce from our conversations with management they will target the cost side of the equation as well,"" Mills said.Though Medtronic might not become much of a competitor until late 2018 or early 2019, as its domestic launch creeps closer Intuitive Surgical investors ""may begin to account for the upcoming competition vis-a-vis the multiple afforded these shares,"" he said.RELATED:Robot Surgeon Maker Launches To Record High On Strong Q1

Analysts had modeled $1.31 and $7.86 billion, respectively.""Our fourth quarter results were a strong finish to the fiscal year, with balanced, diversified growth across our groups and regions,"" Medtronic CEO Omar Ishrak said in a statement. ""Fiscal year 2017 was a solid year overall for Medtronic.""Robust sales in the minimally invasive therapies group — which includes electrosurgical tools and advanced vessel sealing devices — helped Medtronic's total sales to beat views. Globally, the unit pulled in $2.61 billion, up 6%, and $35 million above RBC analyst Glenn Novarro's call.Novarro kept his outperform rating on Medtronic stock. He noted $1.95 billion in the restorative therapies group topped his view with strong 9% and 7% growth in brain and specialty therapies, respectively. Spine revenue grew 3% but missed Novarro's forecast.Meanwhile, the cardiac and vascular group just met expectations with $2.85 billion in revenue, up 5%. Sales from pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators declined in the low-single-digit range.But that group also saw 30% growth in sales of transcatheter aortic valve replacements, or TAVR, topping broader market growth. TAVR is a method of inserting a heart-valve replacement via catheter, which is less invasive and safer than open-heart surgery.In that sector, Medtronic's CoreValve products rival Sapien devices from Edwards Lifesciences (EW). Boston Scientific (BSX) also has a competing device called Lotus, but it isn't approved in the U.S.Medtronic also guided to 4%-5% growth in fiscal 2018 sales and 9%-10% growth in earnings per share minus certain items.

22,MDT,"Boston Scientific's (BSX) Lotus heart valve proved superior to rival Medtronic's (MDT) CoreValve in a yearlong trial by Boston Scientific, the medtech player said Tuesday — prompting shares to jump early.Lotus and CoreValve are transcatheter aortic valve replacements, or TAVR, in patients with hardened arteries who are not eligible for surgery. The process is less invasive than open-heart surgery, allowing the new valve to be inserted via catheter.At year one in Boston Scientific's study, its pair of Lotus valves showed superiority over two of Medtronic's CoreValves for primary effectiveness. The Lotus valves, which are not FDA-approved, also proved non-inferior on safety.The risk of death, disabling stroke and paravalvular leak — the result of insufficient sealing at the site of a replaced valve — was lower for Boston's Lotus, 16.7% to 29% for Medtronic's CoreValve, Boston said.Boston's Lotus also proved safer in that it had lower rates of moderate-to-severe paravalvular leaks, 2% to 11.1% for Medtronic's CoreValve. Most leaks following heart-valve replacement are minor, but large leaks have been linked to heart failure.IBD'S TAKE: Edwards Lifesciences is among the leaders in medtech with an IBD Composite Rating of 98, landing it in the third spot among the top companies in the Medical-Products industry group. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the other leaders.Separately, the rate of disabling stroke for Lotus patients was just 3.6% compared to 7.1% for CoreValve patients. The overall stroke rate was closer though, 7% in Lotus patients vs. 9.4% in CoreValve patients.A larger percentage of CoreValve patients died as a result of cardiac death, 9.8% of CoreValve patients to 7.7% of Lotus patients.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar said the fact that Lotus achieved overall superiority in the study is linked to lower rates of paravalvular leak. He noted, ""It shouldn't be a surprise that Lotus had lower (paravalvular leak) rates — this is a key distinguishing feature of the valve.""In a separate study, Edwards Lifesciences (EW) Sapien 3 valve had a comparably low rate of leaks.At the close on the stock market today, Boston stock was up 0.2% to 26.48, after lifting as much as 1.3% earlier in the day. Shares topped a 25.75 buy point out of a flat base on April 25 and have lingered in a buy zone since.Medtronic stock was down a fraction to 83.94, while shares of Edwards were up 0.2%, near 113.65.RELATED:Edwards Rockets To 6-Month High On Strong U.S. Heart-Valve SalesDid Baxter 'Hoodwink' FDA Inspectors Or Is Probe Just 'Extraordinary'?Which Medtech Stocks Should you Buy Ahead Of Q1?

23,MDT,"Medical-related exchange traded funds have racked up healthy gains this year amid the ongoing quest for longer and healthier lives.One of the outperformers is iShares US Medical Devices (IHI), which gained 20.9% year to date through May 30, well ahead of the S&P 500's 8.7% gain for the period. The $1.4 billion fund boasted a five-year average annual return of 21.6% vs. the benchmark index's 15.4%, according to Morningstar Inc.IHI, launched in May 2006, tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Medical Equipment Index. Top holdings in the ETF included Medtronic (MDT), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO). Abbott, a developer of generic drugs, disease screening systems and other products, is in buy range after clearing a 45.94 flat-base entry on Thursday.XIHI was one of three ETF picks featured in IBD last month by Oscar Pursche, chief executive of Bruderman Brothers and Bruderman Asset Management. ""As opposed to taking a broad view of the health care sector, which we do like overall, we see some great opportunities in the medical device space, to which investors can get exposure through the iShares Medical Device ETF,"" he said.He also noted that the fund's top five holdings account for nearly 40% of the portfolio, which may increase the risk profile. IHI is extended past a 152.83 buy point cleared in April.IBD'S TAKE: Find out which biotechs stand to benefit the most under President Trump's proposed tax reform in this recent tech column.SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment (XHE) returned 16.2% YTD through May 30 and 19.4% for the five-year average. The 6-year-old fund, which tracks the S&P Health Care Equipment Select Industry Index, has gathered $120.6 million in assets.Its top 10 holdings included Align Technology (ALGN), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW), and accounted for about 21% of the portfolio. XHE is trading at record highs and is extended after two recent bounces off the 50-day line.SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI), up 14.4% this year, has an average annual gain of 21% for the past five years. The $3.2 billion fund, launched in January 2006, is forming a flat base with a 72.68 buy point. It's 2% below the entry, but still about 20% off of its July 2015 peak.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and AbbVie (ABBV) are among top names held by XBI.

24,MDT,"Edwards Lifesciences (EW) stock rocketed to a six-month high Wednesday after the medical tech player reported ""particular strength"" in U.S. heart-valve-replacement sales, following several quarters of ""ups and downs.""On the stock market today, Edwards soared 10.5% to 109.30 after earlier rising as much as 14.3% to a high last achieved in October.U.S. sales of transcatheter aortic heart valves, or TAVR, grew 38% to $299 million, Edwards said Tuesday during its first-quarter earnings conference call. That beat the consensus by $28 million, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro said in a note to clients.""An unexpectedly strong quarter for U.S. TAVR sales, coupled with an upward revision to revenue and (earnings) guidance, sent Edwards shares up about 10% in after-market trading,"" Novarro said after Edwards' late-Tuesday report.TAVR is a method of replacing a diseased heart valve via catheter. This process has become more popular in recent years as it's less risky and requires a shorter recovery period than surgery. Medtronic (MDT) and Boston Sciences (BSX) are also working in this realm.For the quarter ended March 31, Edwards reported $883.5 million in sales, growing 26.7% and topping the consensus for $777 million, Canaccord analyst Jason Mills wrote in a research report. Edwards reported 94 cents adjusted earnings per share, up 32.4%, and beating by 12 cents.Mills is pounding ""the drum again on the three primary reasons to own Edwards,"" including the $5.3 billion total addressable market in TAVR by 2021. Edwards outgrew the market this quarter, increasing TAVR sales by 38%, vs. 26% for other companies.Edwards has about a 67% share of the TAVR market, Mills estimates.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific made an acquisition in December that could rattle Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic. Will it pay off? Head to Sector Leaders for the deep dive.""(The first quarter) validated our bullish view of the U.S. TAVR market in which we estimate a 575,000 target population in the U.S., penetration into which we model 21% by 2021 when we estimate a $3.3 billion U.S. market of which Edwards will hold a 64% share,"" he wrote.He also notes Edwards' strong earnings leverage and growing opportunities in transcatheter mitral-valve repair. The portfolio ""could positively surprise investors earlier than (2019)"" when its acquisition of CardiAQ is expected to drive material profit and loss contributions.Also Tuesday, Edwards boosted the low end of its yearly sales guidance and now sees $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion in 2017 revenue. The company also raised its adjusted EPS guidance for 2017 to $3.43-$3.55 from $3.30-$3.45.For the second quarter, Edwards models $810 million to $850 million in sales, excluding Germany stocking sales, and adjusted earnings of 82 cents to 92 cents per share.Mills kept his 140 price target and buy rating on Edwards stock. Novarro boosted his price target to 120 from 116 and maintained his outperform rating on Edwards.RELATED:Which Medtech Stocks Should You Buy Ahead Of Q1?Boston Scientific Makes Acquisition To Battle Medtronic, EdwardsMedtronic Does Heart-Valve Study, And Rivals Reap The Benefits

25,MDT,"XDrug and medical supplies distributor Cardinal Health (CAH) said it would buy the medical supply units of Medtronic (MDT) for $6.1 billion, mostly with debt. Along with weaker earnings guidance, Cardinal shares plunged early Tuesday.Cardinal Health is acquiring Medtronic's patient care, deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency units, including brands used. Combined, the units generated about $2.4 billion in revenue in the last four reported quarters, Medtronic said. They include 23 product categories across multiple market settings, including brands, such as Curity, Kendall, Dover, Argyle and Kangaroo, which are used in nearly every U.S. hospital.""This well-established product line is complementary to our medical consumables business and fits naturally into our customer offering. For this reason, this product portfolio has been on our radar for many years,"" said Cardinal Health Chairman and CEO George Barrett.IBD'S TAKE: Cardinal Health shares had been rebounding since the presidential election as investors believed Donald Trump would be less aggressive on drug prices than Hillary Clinton, despite some of his statements. But the stock tumbled through its 50-day moving average after finding support there in 2017.But Cardinal now sees fiscal 2017 earnings per share at the low end of earlier guidance of $5.35 to $5.50. It expects the deal to be boost non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations by more than 21 cents in 2018, but still sees EPS that year to be flat to down in the mid-single digits.Cardinal Health will finance the acquisition with cash and $4.5 billion in new debt. Standard & Poor's and Fitch both put Cardinal's credit rating at risk of a downgrade, citing increased ""leverage.""Cardinal Health shares tumbled 11.5% to 72.39 on the stock market today, gapping below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Medtronic dipped 3 cents to 80.33. Among Cardinal's fellow drug distributors, McKesson (MCK) sank 4.6% and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) 4.7%.In 2015, Cardinal Health paid about $2 billion for Cordis from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), adding a portfolio of devices, including catheters, filters and stents.Medtronic said the transaction will reduce 2018 EPS modestly. Medtronic will spend $1 billion of the $5.5 billion in net proceeds from the deal on share buybacks, with the rest going to cut debt.RELATED:Johnson & Johnson Earnings Top, But Drug Sales Are A Drag

26,MDT,"As we move through May, the old Wall Street adage ""Sell in May and go away"" comes to mind, a reminder that stocks historically tend to underperform during the May-to-October period.But does that mean ETF investors should liquidate their holdings, take the summer (and a few extra months) off, and resume buying stocks in November?That's one investment strategy. But, as with most old sayings, it doesn't have to be taken literally. Even if the market's return tends to be bigger in the November-April period, investors sitting out the other six months miss out on intermediate rallies and on the power of reinvesting dividends and compounding returns.That's why Oliver Pursche, chief executive of Bruderman Brothers and Bruderman Asset Management, doesn't think the adage proves advantageous for most investors.""It is at best unreliable and inconsistent and amounts to market timing,"" he told IBD. ""When taking into account possible tax consequences, missed dividends and trading commission, the math doesn't bear out.""But Pursche, who oversees the New York-based firm's investment banking and wealth management divisions, thinks May is a good time for investors to reassess their portfolios.Click Here To See A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017Bruderman Asset Management is a registered investment advisor (RIA) with more than $1 billion in assets under management.Here are Pursche's three best ETF investment ideas, in his own words:""Sell in May and walk away"" is not a strategy we feel is particularly smart or beneficial to investors. However, as we enter the summer months and the second half of the year, there is a need for investors to revisit their investment thesis and potentially reallocate their portfolios. After a solid double-digit run by the S&P 500 since Mr. Trump was elected president, a portfolio risk assessment is certainly due. Investors should expect a continuation of the current positive sentiment, even though the Trump administration is unlikely to pass any major legislation, in particular tax reform. Nonetheless, there are several key factors that are benefiting our economy and consequently, corporate earnings.The United States economy, as well as the world as a whole, is benefiting from a cyclical rebound in growth and consumer demand that is helping drive corporate earnings higher, and could help boost U.S. GDP growth by 4% or more in the second quarter. One phenomenon that has been interesting to observe in the current earnings cycle is the strength of earnings coming from outside the United States. Of the companies within the S&P 500 that have reported earnings so far, those companies that earn more than 50% of their revenues offshore have seen EPS growth of nearly 20%, while companies that derive all of their earnings domestically are experiencing low- to middle-single-digit EPS growth.One last note: Expect a correction at some point, but don't let that change your long-term investment strategy. The ETFs named above should perform well if the current environment persists through the end of the year and into 2018, as we expect it to.RELATED:This ETF Is Knocking The 'Socks' Off The Tech Sector

27,MDT,"Baxter (BAX) stock fell Monday on worries related to a Department of Justice investigation into potential price fixing of intravenous fluids — allegations an analyst deemed ""extraordinary.""On the stock market today, Baxter stock fell 0.8% to 52.82 after the Justice Department sent a grand jury subpoena to one of Baxter's employees.The subpoena was received Friday and relates to a criminal investigation by the Justice Department's antitrust arm. It asks for documents and testimony related to manufacturing, pricing, selling and shortages of intravenous solutions, and Baxter's communications with rivals.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar noted that the price-fixing allegation isn't new. It stems from a 2-year-old investigation that began in New York and an ongoing class-action suit in the Northern District of Illinois related to supply shortages.The shortage was triggered by the flu season in 2013-14 and benefited manufacturers like Hospira, which in the third quarter of 2014 saw 43% growth in its unit that produces intravenous fluids, Kumar said. Hospira was acquired by Pfizer (PFE) in 2015.But the class action lawsuit alleges that manufacturers of intravenous fluids falsely created the shortage to justify spiking prices in 2014. Baxter, which has filed for a motion to dismiss the suit, called the allegations extraordinary.""The idea of a public company voluntarily creating supply shortage in the hopes competitors would similarly restrict output in order to raise prices seems a stretch,"" Kumar told clients in a note.IBD'S TAKE: Baxter stock trades in IBD's 120-company Medical-Products industry group which is led by Medtronic (MDT), Stryker (SYK) and Boston Scientific (BSX) in terms of market cap. Medtronic, Boston and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) compete in the heart-valve replacement market. Check out this edition of Sector Leaders to see how they stack up.FDA regulators regularly inspect manufacturing facilities, he noted. The class action lawsuit seems to imply that Baxter and other intravenous-fluid manufacturers were able to ""hoodwink"" inspectors to post shortage notices, he said.Baxter said in 2015 that it incurred about $150 million in costs to comply with increased FDA regulatory requirements and meet supply constraints. Meanwhile, price increases only contributed $70 million to $90 million in 2016 growth, Kumar said.In 2016, intravenous-fluid solutions contributed two-thirds of that segment's growth, implying that pricing was up 6% on average, Kumar said. Assuming a bag of intravenous fluid costs $1.50 to $2, this equates to increases of 15 to 20 cents per bag.Apart from price collusion, prosecutors will have to argue whether Baxter's earnings on increased intravenous fluid prices were reasonable. Kumar estimates that after hiking prices on intravenous fluids Baxter had 15%-16% margins on its earnings before interest and taxes.RELATED:Boston Scientific Makes Acquisition To Battle Medtronic, EdwardsMedtronic, Edwards Among Five Best 'Stocks To Own': Analyst

28,MDT,"There's been a lot of hand-wringing lately that the iconic S&P 500 has gone more than a year without marking a new all-time high.Don't despair. You're a smart ETF investor who spots opportunities even when others agonize that stocks are stuck in a rut.The geniuses at indexing shops don't just offer products that track a broad basket of assets, such as the S&P 500 for U.S. large caps and the Russell 2000 for U.S. small caps.They also slice and dice those indexes into finer segments with the aim of boosting returns or reducing risk. Sometimes they aim to do both.To achieve these aims, they may screen stocks for ""factors"" or characteristics such as low volatility or high quality.Several exchange traded funds tracking indexes based on the S&P 500 have scored all-time highs recently. They're not only outperforming the bellwether SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), but also attracting gobs of new investor money.PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility (SPHD), ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) and PowerShares S&P 500 Quality (SPHQ) made all-time highs April 27.PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) did the same on May 10, with PowerShares S&P 500 ex-Rate Sensitive Low Volatility (XRLV) following suit on May 11.SPHD ""cherry-picks the market rather than delivering the whole basket,"" according to industry research firm ETF.com. It invests in the 50 least risky, highest yielding stocks in the S&P 500. That indexing method skews it toward defensive sectors such as utilities.CenterPoint Energy (CNP) is a top-five stock holding. The stock is trading near a 52-week high as investors have favored the defensive cast and income potential of the utility sector this choppy year.This ETF has outperformed SPY both year-to-date and over the past three years. It's up 9.6% in 2016 through May 23 vs. a 1.2% gain for its better-known S&P 500 peer.SPHD also saw $805 million in net inflow over the first four months of the year. By comparison, SPY leaked $1 billion.ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats holds 50 stocks from the parent index that have hiked dividend payments for at least 25 consecutive years. It then equal-weights those holdings, which accounts for a big midcap stake.Irish medical device maker Medtronic (MDT) is one of the ""dividend aristocrats"" in the portfolio. The company makes heart valve products just as an IBD Leaderboard aristocrat, Edwards Lifesciences (EW), does.NOBL has advanced 6.4% year to date, while absorbing a net $633.7 million from January through April.Despite the ""dividend"" in its name, NOBL yields a relatively modest 1.9%. That's less than 2.10% for SPY and 3.33% for SPHD.

30,MDT,"Investors scoffed at the ""sell in May and go away"" adage and sent stock ETFs higher in the past month. A sharp oil rally offset both a dismal employment report and more evidence that corporate America's profits are getting crushed.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) set a string of 2016 highs in June, as the U.S. stock market built on its rebound from the February market bottom.Still, caution is the word at the world's largest investment manager.Click Here To See A List Of Top Performing ETFs In 2016In the U.S., the latest job growth figures -- the weakest in almost six years -- cast doubt on the recovering economy's ability to absorb an interest-rate hike this summer. In the U.K., a key June 23 referendum will decide whether Britain stays in the European Union.Those uncertainties add up to big risks for global markets, according to BlackRock.""We believe now is a good time to dial down equity and credit risk,"" Richard Turnill, BlackRock's  global chief investment strategist, wrote in a June 6 research note. He favors dividend growers in an unstable environment, to be found in an exchange traded fund such as ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL). NOBL invests exclusively in S&P 500 companies with the longest track records of year-over-year dividend growth. These ""aristocrats"" include medical device maker Medtronic (MDT) and drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV).In the month ended last Tuesday, United States Oil (USO), a best-performing ETF of 2016, added 11.5%. The commodity ETF invests in crude futures, which on June 8 surged to their highest level in nearly a year.Among equities, technology stocks emerged from their recent sloth to help lead the S&P higher.IShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) jumped 11.7% in the past month, as No. 1 holding Broadcom (AVGO) climbed to a 52-week high after its fiscal Q2 report. Ambarella (AMBA), parts supplier to GoPro (GPRO), also soared after its earnings report.SPY posted a 2.9% gain in the past month as the market resumed its uptrend.IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), holding foreign developed-market stocks, rose 3.6% in the same time. Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO) tacked on 5.2%.For ETF investors, the key question is whether the S&P 500 can hold above the 2,100 resistance level in the second half of 2016. We asked two money managers for their best investing ideas so that portfolios aren't range-bound, even if the broad market moves sideways:Kimberly D. Woody, senior portfolio manager, Globalt Investments in Atlanta, Ga.; assets under advisement: roughly $1.8 billion.The S&P 500 remains sandwiched in a multiyear trading range, which calls for more nimble tactical trading, not large strategic tilts. The choice before American voters is as stark as ever, with far-reaching implications for the economy as well as for multiple industries. We believe it unlikely that markets race higher before global risks abate and until more clarity is seen on the U.S. political front. Positive developments in the global economy, currency and commodity markets have led to calmer global equity and bond markets. We remain hopeful for increased economic momentum, but more evidence of recovery is needed to justify increasing risk in portfolios.Robert Davis, partner and chief investment officer, Round Table Wealth Management in New York City; assets under management: $1 billion.Our near-term view is cautious as it relates to stocks. Earnings have been significantly reduced since the start of the year, and valuations remain at a premium in certain defensive sectors. Growth is not absent, however, as the small-cap growth sector is demonstrating increased earnings, and we believe this is an area of opportunity after a meaningful sell-off in the first half of the year. We also view high-yield bonds as an attractive area, as those securities are higher in the capital structure and provide a meaningful yield to get investors through what could be a flat market leading up to the presidential election.

31,MDT,"Medical device maker Boston Scientific (BSX) popped to a 10-year high Wednesday after it reported a strong Q1 and raised its guidance.Boston Scientific's adjusted earnings totaled 28 cents in the quarter, up 33% from the year-earlier quarter and beating analysts' consensus by four cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 11% to $1.96 billion, beating consensus by about $50 million.Boston Scientific added more than $100 million to its full-year revenue guidance range, now $8.08 billion to $8.23 billion, up 9% at the midpoint vs. $7.48 billion last year. It also added two cents to its full-year EPS guidance, now 64 to 69 cents.The company said that its sales in the current quarter should be $2.01 billion to $2.06 billion, up 10.6% at the midpoint from $1.84 billion a year ago and on the high side of consensus. Its earnings guidance of 25 to 27 cents a share was in line with Wall Street's estimate and up from 21 cents last year.Boston Scientific stock was up 9.5% in morning trading on the stock market today, near 21.50 and hitting its highest point since May 2006.In a research note Wednesday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro broke down the results.""Cardiovascular revenues of $790 million (+13% year-over-year constant currency) easily topped our estimates and consensus,"" he wrote. ""We believe cardiovascular results were led by share gains for Synergy (drug-eluting stent) in the U.S., robust adoption of Watchman (left atrial appendage closure device) and strong peripherals sales.""Meanwhile, MedSurg sales of $682 million (+28% year-over-year constant currency, +11% year-over-year organic) also topped expectations, driven by strong Endoscopy results, owing to Spyglass DS (direct visualization system) and the launch of the Axios stent system, and Urology/Women’s Health.""On the downside, Novarro said that cardiac rhythm management sales were light, which he says is due to Medtronic (MDT) taking share in the implantable cardioverter defibrillator market. However, Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar wrote that Monday's approval of a new MRI-safe suite of pacing products should help boost the division.Boston Scientific's growth has been picking up the last three quarters, helping drive the stock to a strong IBD Composite Rating of 94.

32,MDT,"Boston Scientific (BSX) said Thursday it plans to acquire Swiss firm Symetis in a $435 million deal in that will deepen its heart-valve rivalry with Medtronic (MDT) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW).Symetis offers several transcatheter aortic valve replacement products in Europe and internationally. This would add to Boston's Lotus heart-valve device which, in late February, was recalled due to mechanical issues.The deal is expected to close in the second quarter, be earnings accretive in 2018 and hit 10% return on interest by the third year, Boston said in a presentation. Boston also reiterated its plan to launch its Lotus heart-valve device in the U.S. in 2018. The device is expected to return to European markets later this year.""We believe that this is an offensive rather than a defensive move,"" Needham analyst Mike Matson said. ""We do not believe this is a 'stopgap' to address the Lotus recall, shortcomings with Lotus or IP (intellectual property) issues.""Matson kept his buy rating and 29 price target on Boston Scientific stock. Boston shares finished regular trading down 1.1% to 24.45 on the stock market today following the announcement. Boston has been under pressure recently amid a patent battle with Edwards.Shares fell 2.7% on Feb. 23 after Boston voluntarily recalled its Lotus heart-valve device. The company discovered a mechanical issue that led to the premature release of a pin before doctors could implant the device. One patient died during an attempt to replace a Lotus heart valve.IBD'S TAKE: It's not the first time Boston Scientific has made an acquisition to help it in its battle against Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences, both of which already have transcatheter aortic heart valve devices in the U.S. Head to Sector Leaders to see how this rivalry is shaping up.Boston sees Symetis as complementary to Lotus and ""would have done the deal even if Lotus were not to have been recalled,"" Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar wrote in a note to clients.""For investors concerned on whether Symetis' acquisition implies Lotus could be further delayed, this should provide reassurance,"" he said.Symetis is also unlikely to trigger more patent issues with Edwards, Kumar said. Per the patent, it doesn't appear Symetis works with supporting beams or locking mechanisms in its heart-valve replacements. Both are being contested by Edwards.RELATED:Medtronic, Edwards Among Five Best 'Stocks To Own': AnalystBoston Topples On Heart Valve Bug; 'Woes' Boost Edwards, MedtronicMedtronic Does Heart-Valve Study And Rivals Reap The Benefits

The devices are used to manage tachycardia. He expects transcatheter aortic valve replacements and drug-coated balloons to perform well in 2017.Novarro calls for in-line to slightly better first- and second-quarter metrics for Edwards. He expects Medtronic's launch of its CoreValve Evolut-R to drive growth also for Edwards' Sapien XT.Both devices are transcatheter aortic valve implants for patients with hardened heart valves unable to undergo open-heart surgery. Novarro recommends owning Edwards stock going into the second half of 2017 on expectation for market growth.Evercore's Kumar notes that Edwards stock is a growth stock and therefore volatile by nature.""With lowered investor expectations, we believe Edwards shares are poised for a 'catch-up' trade and offer asymmetric risk-reward at current levels,"" he wrote in a research report. He sees 15% upside at current stock levels.Kumar was previously sidelined on Edwards stock with competition from Boston Scientific in international markets. But Boston pulled its Lotus valve off the market in late February, giving Edwards ""its first break in six months.""Still, the companies are likely at a patent standoff until the first half of 2018.RELATED:Medtronic Does Heart-Valve Study, And Rivals Reap The BenefitsBoston Scientific Wins In Patent Battle Vs.

36,MDT,"Medtronic (MDT) stock popped Tuesday after the No. 1 medical-products maker topped fiscal Q3 expectations across the board in what Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar called ""the quickest comeback in large-cap land.""For its fiscal Q3 ended Jan. 27, Medtronic reported $1.12 earnings per share ex items on $7.28 billion in sales, up 3% and 5%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. The consensus saw $1.11 and $7.22 billion, Kumar wrote in a research report.The Q3 beat helped Medtronic stock lift 2.1% on the stock market today to 80.55, touching its highest point since a disappointing Q2 sales and 2017 guidance three months ago sent shares falling 8.7%.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific made a key acquisition late last year that could help it in the battle against Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic.

Others have perked right up.IShares U.S. Medical Devices (IHI) bounded to a 52-week high of 129.93 Thursday as it eyes a fourth straight weekly gain.Its relative strength line -- a gauge of its performance vs. the S&P 500 -- is bolting higher in defiance of the overall stock market mood. The market uptrend has come under pressure this week.IHI is a targeted bet on a health care niche. It invests in 47 U.S. companies that manufacture and distribute medical devices. Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is a top-rated IBD stock within this industry group, based on measures of technical and fundamental health such as earnings and sales growth.IHI counts Edwards among its top 10 holdings and gives it a 4.4% portfolio weighting.Edwards' stock has jumped 39% in the past three months. The California-based company is battling for the top spot in the heart-valve market. Its Sapien 3 received FDA approval for treatment of high-risk patients suffering from severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis. Its chief rival is Medtronic (MDT), the No. 1 holding in the IHI portfolio.Edwards will report quarterly results April 26 after the close. Wall Street stock analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters expect an 18% gain in earnings for the quarter and 17% for the year.

41,MDT,"Two major stocks held by IHI reported this week.Late Tuesday, surgical-robot maker Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) beat Q1 earnings estimates and the stock hit a new high Wednesday after receiving a series of price target hikes. On Wednesday, orthopedics giant Stryker (SYK) also beat expectations and raised guidance.Both Stryker and Intuitive stocks have fallen since then in volatile trade.IHI also has smaller weightings in Cantel Medical (CMN), Steris (STE) and Cynosure (CYNO) -- device specialists with top-notch IBD Composite Ratings of 99, 98 and 97, respectively.Steris provides products to prevent infections and control contamination. It reported a 31% jump in sales in its latest reported quarter, helped by the buyout of U.K.-based Synergy Health.Small-cap Cantel Medical is also in the infection control and prevention business. Cynosure develops treatment systems for hair removal and skin rejuvenation.IHI has a Relative Strength Rating of 75, which means it's outperformed 75% of other stocks and ETFs in the IBD database over the last 12 months.

42,MDT,"Surgical-robot maker Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) received multiple price target hikes from Wall Street, as its stock hit a new high Wednesday, following its Q1 earnings report late Tuesday.As IBD reported, Intuitive Surgical's Q1 earnings beat estimates, but what really interested analysts was the quarter's 17% procedure growth. Intuitive Surgical normally sells only about 100 of its pricey da Vinci robotic systems per quarter, so surgical procedures using the company's consumable accessories and services are key to steady revenue. Management raised procedure-growth guidance for the year to 12% to 14%, from the previous 9% to 12%.Operating expenses increased, and Intuitive Surgical's management also raised its opex guidance for the year to 12% to 15% of revenue, up from 9% to 13% previously. However, it likewise raised its gross-margin guidance to 69% to 70%, from 68% to 69.5%.Intuitive Surgical is on IBD's Big Cap 20. Who else makes the grade?""Intuitive Surgical's impressive Q1 procedure growth is consistent with our recent positive general surgeon checks,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Brandon Henry as he raised his price target to 640 from 610 while maintaining a sector perform rating. ""While Intuitive Surgical is accelerating operating expense spend, we believe these investments should drive increased future robotics adoption and help the company maintain its superior position in the robotics market, despite upcoming competition.""The company has no competitors at present, but Medtronic (MDT), TransEnterix (TRXC) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) partnering with Alphabet's (GOOGL) Verily division are all developing their own robotic surgery systems.Leerink analyst Richard Newitter lifted his Intuitive Surgical price target to 710 from 700 while maintaining an outperform rating.""A now stronger outlook for Urology/GYN and general surgery gave management confidence to raise '16 procedure guidance,"" Newitter wrote in his research note. ""Also, management seems to be talking more aggressively about da Vinci use in thoracic, a procedure area we think may be around the corner as an emerging growth driver.""Piper Jaffray analyst Matt O'Brien raised his price target to 610 from 550. He rates the stock neutral.Intuitive Surgical stock hit a record high of 654.88 early on the stock market today, pushing it up 20% for the year. In morning trading, shares were up 4.5% near 652.
"
43,MDT,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) are medtech stocks to own going into earnings season, but several others could be put on buy lists on pullbacks, an analyst says.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro said Wednesday that among large-cap medtech stocks, Johnson and Zimmer offer the best risk/reward into the first-quarter earnings season. Zimmer is the cheapest in its arena and Johnson has lagged the group.""While investor sentiment has turned more favorable for Johnson in recent weeks, we anticipate further multiple expansion on the back of strong first-quarter results, and consensus estimates moving higher throughout the year,"" he wrote in a research report.The consensus of analysts polled by Yahoo (YHOO) broadly expects Johnson to report $18.01 billion in sales, up 3% year over year, and $1.76 a share in adjusted earnings, dipping 1.7%.Johnson is also on the cusp of closing its acquisition of Actelion Pharmaceuticals in the second quarter. It and Sanofi (SNY) were locked in a battle late last year to take over the Swiss biotech. Johnson's $30 billion bid won it the company.For Zimmer, the company ""just has to hit consensus estimates for the stock to move higher,"" Novarro said. The consensus models 3% year-over-year sales growth to $1.96 billion and $2.11 adjusted earnings per share, up 4.5%.Novarro, however, says Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Boston Scientific (BSX), Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and Stryker (SYK) may be attractive on pullbacks. He sees all delivering solid results and reaffirming 2017 guidance. Investors will likely track ongoing litigation for Abbott with Alere (ALR), and heart-valve replacement sales for Edwards.Boston likely will comment on its voluntary recall of its Lotus heart-valve replacement. The company recalled the Lotus device after discovering a malfunction that resulted in the premature release of a pin during implantation.""Medtronic's (MDT) Onyx stent launch represents near-term challenges"" for Boston, but ""we still want to own Boston for 2018,"" Novarro said.In the small- and midsize-cap world, Novarro recommends NuVasive (NUVA), Wright Medical Group (WMGI) and K2M Group (KTWO). The potential for a takeout is likely baked into the stock prices for NuVasive and Wright, he said.IBD'S TAKE: This isn't the first time Edwards has been listed as a best ""stock to own."" Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive on why Edwards is holding strong.K2M remains his top pick in the small-and-midsize medtech group.""We expect K2M to play catch-up to the group as investor focus shifts to the company's impressive new product lineup and improving international sales growth after the company experienced some distributor issues in 2016,"" he wrote.Like Novarro, Needham analyst Mike Matson also prefers K2M and Zimmer, but also has strong buy ratings on shares of Inogen (INGN) and MiMedx (MDXG). He sees the cardiovascular and orthopedic markets as slowing while the diagnostic market improved in the quarter.Matson models cardiovascular market growth as decelerating to 6.3% from 7.3% in the fourth quarter, and the orthopedic market advancing by 3.5%, vs. 4% growth in the prior quarter. In diagnostics, sales likely grew 3.6% from 2.1%, he said.But there were some standouts, Matson said. He models the transcatheter aortic valve-replacement market — where Boston, Edwards and Medtronic operate — as having grown 23%. In orthopedics, Matson models 9% growth for the extremities market.RELATED:Medtronic Does Heart-Valve Study And Rivals Reap The BenefitsBoston Scientific Makes Acquisition To Battle Medtronic, Edwards
"
44,MDT,"Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and Boston Scientific (BSX) stocks got a boost Friday after Medtronic (MDT) published a study showing that a new method of inserting a heart valve could be a better alternative than open-heart surgery.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Edwards stock popped 1.6% to 94.40 as Boston stock followed, up 0.6%, near 24.43. Though Medtronic conducted the study, its exposure to the transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR, market is smaller. Shares lifted a fraction, to 82.23.All three companies play in the market, but Boston is still testing its products in this realm. In patients with hardened valves -- a condition called aortic stenosis -- the procedure allows a new heart valve to be inserted via catheter, and the new device pushes the diseased aortic valve aside.The trial monitored 1,660 patients who received a heart valve replacement over two years. At the two-year mark, 12.6% of the patients who underwent a transcatheter aortic valve replacement had died or suffered a disabling stroke vs. 14% of patients who underwent surgery.Analysts had generally expected a 15%-17% rate of death or disabling stroke in patients who underwent the new method of heart valve replacement, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific is looking to take on Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences with an acquisition in December. Will it be successful? Head to Sector Leaders for a look at the upcoming battle in medical technology.Surgery is much riskier and involves a longer recovery period. Medtronic met its goal of proving TAVR is not inferior to the surgical method of replacing a diseased heart valve. This could help push more doctors into using the newer method, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro said.""We believe the positive Edwards (stock) reaction is due to the fact that a larger body of clinical evidence showing TAVR as safe and effective would convince more surgeons to consider TAVR as a viable option for aortic stenosis patients at lower surgical risk,"" he wrote in a note.Novarro forecasts the TAVR market to exceed $5 billion by 2020, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 20% over the next four years. He sees Medtronic getting FDA approval for its CoreValve TAVR platform in intermediate-risk patients in the next three to six months.RELATED:Boston Scientific Wins In Patent Battle Vs.

"
45,MDT,"Boston Scientific (BSX) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) could reach a cross-licensing agreement for designs on their heart valves, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar suggested Thursday after Boston triumphed in a German court on patent issues.The court ruled Edwards infringed on two of Boston's patents for a ""skirt"" and a ""sac"" to reduce leaks for transcatheter aortic valve replacements. But the court also ruled Boston infringed on one of Edwards patents for a structure within the heart valve known as the ""support beam."" It tossed out a second Edwards patent.The German decision puts Boston in ""a commanding position in its IP litigation with Edwards,"" Kumar wrote in a research report. He expects Boston to file for a court action that would prevent Edwards from selling its heart valve in Germany. An injunction is unlikely while Edwards' appeal is ongoing, he wrote.Thursday's ruling follows a U.K. decision last week in which a court ruled one Edwards' patents for a ""sac outside the anchor to provide a seal"" as valid and infringed. But a second patent for a fabric seal on its Sapien 3 valve was ruled invalid.Edwards said Thursday it's planning to appeal the German decision. The company expects court proceedings to continue in various locations over an extended period of time. The two med-tech giants also are battling it out in the U.S., France and Canada.Boston Scientific stock closed up 0.7% at 24.69 on the stock market today, and Edwards jumped 3.9% 93.06.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific, Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic are battling it out in the heart-valve market. Who leads? Head to Sector Leaders for a deep dive.Edwards is also appealing portions of the UK court decision, but precedence doesn't look good for the company, Kumar wrote. In an earlier patent battle with Medtronic (MDT) regarding heart-valve tech, higher courts upheld decisions in Germany and the UK. Medtronic and Edwards ultimately settled. Medtronic pays Edwards a royalty of no less than $40 million annually.Edwards has 65% of the transcatheter aortic valve replacement — a type of heart-valve replacement — market, Kumar wrote. Medtronic trails with 30%. Using the earlier settlement model, Edwards could end up paying Boston no less than $80 million per year, he said. Or, the duo could agree to license one another's tech.""In our scenario analysis, we had noted that in the event Boston Scientific wins and Edwards Lifesciences comes out with the poorer hand, it could potentially force the players to arrive at a cross licensing agreement,"" he wrote.RELATED:Edwards Stock Dips On Patent Loss In Lawsuit With Rival BostonMedtronic Downgraded On Increased Boston, J&J, St. Jude RivalriesBoston Topples On Heart Valve Bug; 'Woes' Boost Medtronic, Edwards

46,MDT,"Medtronic (MDT) could use $5 billion in potential proceeds of a major divestiture to add 11 to 24 cents to its 2018 earnings, Needham analyst Mike Matson suggested Monday as Medtronic stock dipped.In the stock market today, Medtronic stock slipped 0.47% to 75.98. But its shares are trading well above their 50-day moving average and are up 6.7% this year. Meanwhile, IBD's 121-company Medical-Products industry group is up only 1%.Bloomberg first reported Jan. 31 that Medtronic is considering selling its Covidien-acquired medical-supplies unit. The business comprises commoditized products including products used in nursing care, incontinence, medical surgical and OEM products.According to insiders cited by Bloomberg, the deal could fetch up to $5 billion. The unit has a $500 million EBITA (earnings before interest, taxes and amortization) and Matson estimates $320 million in operating income. The sale could dilute Medtronic's earnings per share by 20 cents.""We think that dilution from the sale should be mostly offset by use of the proceeds for share repurchases, debt retirement, or M&A,"" Needham's Matson wrote in a research report Monday. ""Additionally, a sale would improve Medtronic's revenue growth and operating margin.""IBD'S TAKE: Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Edwards Lifesciences are often seen in a battle for market share. Late last year, Boston Scientific said it would acquire Neovasc's tissue business, taking aim at its rivals. Get the bigger scoop on IBD's Sector Leaders.But Medtronic could add 24 cents to its earnings in 2018 by repurchasing stock at $80 per share. Or, Medtronic could use the $5 billion to retire debt at a 4% interest rate, adding 11 cents to EPS, Matson wrote.""Medtronic could also use the cash for M&A but it's hard to predict the impact of an unknown deal,"" he wrote.Matson kept his buy rating and 84 price target on Medtronic stock.Medtronic is ranked first by market cap in its industry group, leading Stryker (SYK) and Boston Scientific (BSX).

47,MDT,"Boston Scientific (BSX) stock toppled to a six-week low Thursday after the medtech-maker said it will delay its Lotus heart valve amid mechanical issues, giving rivals Medtronic (MDT) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) a boost.In the stock market today, Boston Scientific stock fell 2.7% to 24.47, after plunging as much as 7.4%. But Edwards Lifesciences stock jumped 3.8% to 95.71, and Medtronic climbed 1.4% to 80.76.Needham analyst Mike Matson argued that investors overreacted. According to an 8-K filed by Boston Scientific early Thursday, the removal was voluntary and would enable the company to deal with the premature release of a pin connecting Lotus to the delivery system.The company noted ""excess tension in the pin mechanism introduced in the manufacturing process."" Boston is expected to relaunch Lotus in Q4.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific is taking on Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic with a key acquisition. Read on in Sector Leaders for details of its recent buy and how the new business could help Boston take on its rivals.Matson estimates that Boston will be taking a 3-cent hit to earnings in 2017. Boston earlier guided to $300 million in structural heart sales in 2017. Matson sees $120 million of that at risk. He had modeled $327 million in structural heart sales, with $142 million from Lotus and $185 million from Watchman.""We still expect Lotus to be a differentiated share-taker and think today's sell-off (reducing Boston's market cap by about $2 billion) is overdone,"" he wrote. ""We are buyers on the weakness.""Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar expects ""Boston Scientific's woes to be an unexpected boon to Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences.""For Medtronic, this increases confidence that 4% organic top-line growth seen in fiscal Q3 is sustainable, he said, while Edwards could boost sales by one or two percentage points in 2017.Still, Kumar sees Boston as the third player in the transcatheter aortal valve replacement (TAVR) market. He has a buy rating and 27.50 price target on Boston stock. Matson kept his buy rating and 29 price target on shares.""While the delay in Lotus is no doubt disappointing, we continue to believe that Lotus could be a meaningful opportunity for Boston Scientific over the medium term,"" Kumar wrote in a report.

48,MDT,"Leading medical-device maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) jumped Monday, a day after its artificial heart valve passed a hurdle that could greatly expand its market.Edwards conducted a large clinical trial comparing its transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), Sapien 3, to traditional open-heart surgical valve replacement in patients with aortic stenosis, or shrinking of the aortic valve of the heart, who were characterized as ""intermediate risk"" for open-heart surgery. The study followed up on patients 30 days after surgery and again a year later, and it found that deaths and strokes were both significantly lower in the Sapien group.Sapien 3, which is delivered via catheter through a small incision in the patient's thigh, was approved in June 2015 for patients who were at high risk if they had open-heart surgery. Adding the intermediate-risk population to the patient pool led several analysts to hike their sales estimates for the product.""We estimate the patient population could increase 50% to 150,000 to 200,000, including intermediate-risk patients,"" wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst Jason Mills in a research note, as he raised his price target on Edwards Lifesciences stock to 113 from 95. ""We increase our Edwards 2016 sales estimate to $2.796 billion from $2.779 billion and pro forma EPS forecast to $2.72 from $2.68. For 2017, our top-line projection increases to $3.1 billion from $3.06 billion and pro forma EPS to $3.21 from $3.09.""Edwards stock rose 17% on the stock market today, closing at 105.08 and hitting a new lifetime high of 106.10. The stock was already doing well, ranking at No. 23 on the IBD 50 and also rating a spot on IBD's Leaderboard. It's 27% over an 83.53 buy point, and thus in the profit-taking zone.The news also led analysts to lift their estimates for the entire TAVR market, which is currently split between Edwards' Sapien and Medtronic's (MDT) CoreValve.

49,MDT,"Biotech United Therapeutics (UTHR) said Thursday that the Food and Drug Administration had rejected its partner Medtronic's (MDT) application for approval of a device to deliver the former's lung-disease drug Remodulin, sending United Therapeutics' stock down sharply.Remodulin, a treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension, became a top seller for United Therapeutics in injectable form, but the company has been developing different delivery methods that broaden the patient base and also help extend the drug's patent life. United Therapeutics had hoped that Medtronic's implantable device could treat patients with the most severe forms of the disease, who can currently only use the intravenous form.United Therapeutics' brief SEC filing didn't say why the FDA had rejected the device, and Medtronic has said nothing about it, although the FDA's response letter arrived over a week earlier. The filing did say that the letter had ""noted various measures that Medtronic should take"" to make the filing approvable, which the two companies were currently discussing.United Therapeutics also noted that it's filed for a label extension on Remodulin to approve it for use through the device, which is due for a decision by October.United Therapeutics' stock hit a 17-month low of 109.44 in early trading on the stock market today. By mid-morning it was down 8.5% near 111, while Medtronic stock was down more than 1%, near 73.50.A top-rated stock a year ago, United Therapeutics retains a stellar IBD EPS Rank of 98, but quarterly results that missed analyst estimates and increasing competition started pressuring the stock, even before the biotech sell-off started in August. This made the pump financially important, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee.""Investors view the 'implantable pump' as an important near-term program that could stop or slow erosion of Remodulin generic with a settlement with (Novartis (NVS) unit) Sandoz set to allow a version starting June 2018,"" Yee wrote in a research note. ""If this pump is continuously delayed, then there's less time to convert patients over to it and bring the approvability into question, and (it) increases risk of generic erosion of the core franchise.""

50,MDT,"Shares of medical-device giant Medtronic (MDT) dipped sharply Tuesday after its fiscal Q3 sales missed estimates, though earnings and guidance were in line with expectations.Medtronic's earnings for the quarter ended Jan. 29 totaled $1.06 a share excluding one-time items, down 1% from the year-earlier quarter and matching the consensus number calculated by Thomson Reuters' survey of analysts. Sales jumped 61% to $6.93 billion, though adjusted for last year's buyout of Covidien, as well as foreign-exchange rates, sales increased just 6%. This was about $55 million below consensus.Medtronic affirmed its full-year guidance of $4.36 to $4.40 in EPS, which includes 45 to 50 cents of foreign-currency impact. It did not guide Q4 earnings but said sales should grow 5% to 5.5% excluding the foreign-currency impact, which it sees amounting to $180 million to $220 million.Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy wrote that the sales miss was largely due to higher-than-expected foreign-exchange headwinds, but there were a few signs of trouble.""U.S. sales growth did slow a bit, coming in at 4% growth vs. our 6% projection and representing a deceleration from the 6% growth seen in (fiscal) Q2 2016 and the 14% growth seen in (fiscal) Q1 2016,"" Antalffy wrote. ""This slowing growth is likely in large part attributable to increasingly difficult comparables and, to us, doesn't yet suggest an alarming signal of a broad-based slowdown.""Medtronic did deliver positive operating leverage quarter-over-quarter, with EBIT margins of 27.8% vs. 27.4% last quarter, but this improvement fell below guidance of 28.0%-28.5% and our 28.5% estimate. This now leaves the increasingly positive operating leverage story very much back-end-loaded, with Medtronic having to deliver Q4 operating margins of at least 33.5% to hit its prior guidance for 29%-31% as reported for full-year 2016.""Antalffy also noted that Medtronic's competitors similarly missed sales estimates in the most recent quarter -- among them St. Jude Medical (STJ), Boston Scientific (BSX) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) -- making Medtronic's quarter look good in comparison.Medtronic stock was down almost 5% in late-morning trading on the stock market today, near 74. The stock had been relatively buoyant during the market sell-off, closing Monday just a few percentage points below the 52-week high hit last March.

51,MDT,"Medical-device maker and IBD 50 stock Edwards Lifesciences (EW) beat analysts' Q1 estimates and raised guidance late Tuesday, sending the stock up a fraction in after-hours trading, after shares touched a new high in the regular session.Edwards made 71 cents a share in the quarter, excluding one-time items, up 25% from the year-earlier quarter and topping analysts' consensus of 66 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales rose 18% to $697 million, vs. consensus of $665 million.Edwards lifted its full-year earnings guidance to $2.67 to $2.77, a dime above the guidance it issued in its Q4 report. It added around $100 million to its sales range, now $2.7 billion to $3 billion.The company also added $100 million to its guidance specifically for transcatheter heart valve therapy (THVT), whose Sapien line of valve replacements has driven much of Edwards' recent growth. It now guides $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion in sales, representing 25% underlying growth.Edwards said the market expansion of the Sapien was the main driver of the guidance increase. This month, the company's Sapien 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was shown to reduce deaths and strokes in treating aortic stenosis in patients with ""intermediate"" risk from open-heart surgery, boosting its stock 17% on April 4.The Sapien is only approved for patients at high risk, so adding moderate-risk patients would significantly broaden its market. On the company's earnings conference call with analysts Tuesday, CEO Michael Mussallem said Edwards will submit the data to the FDA in a few weeks and is modeling approval of the new indication early in Q4, though it could come earlier.""We are enthusiastic about the continued expansion of transcatheter-based therapies for the many structural heart patients still in need,"" Mussallem said in a statement. ""We are confident in our outlook for strong sales growth, and we remain passionate about developing impactful therapies to help more patients around the world.""Edwards also guided Q2 above expectations, with EPS of 67 to 73 cents and sales of $700 million to $740 million. For Q2, analysts expected earnings of 67 cents a share and sales of $698 million.Apart from the THVT business, the Critical Care division grew 7% to $133.6 million, while the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy group declined 0.5% to $195.9 million. Edwards has been exiting some ""non-strategic"" product lines in the latter group, but said the number of surgical procedures is growing.Edwards stock has been on a roll this year, hitting a record high of 109.71 Tuesday before closing up a fraction, at 108.84. With an IBD Composite Rating of 97, it's No. 8 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks over the past 12 months.The strong recent performance might explain the small move the stock made after hours Tuesday.""Expectations heading into 1Q were elevated ... and Edwards did not disappoint investors,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar in a research note. ""If there was one thing we had to pick on, it is the underlying TAVR growth in International markets. While underlying U.S. TAVR sales were up 64%, the total TAVR growth of 38% implies International growth of 4%, a further deceleration from 4Q.""On the conference call, Mussallem said international THVT sales had actually grown 13%, but admitted that it has been losing market share abroad. The Sapien line has faced competition in Europe for longer than it has in the U.S., as Medtronic's (MDT) CoreValve was approved there two years earlier than its U.S. approval in January.He said that market share has increased slightly in the U.S., however.Overall, Kumar said the quarter was very solid. Although expenses were up, he said R&D spending came in well below his expectations, while the gross-margin decline to 74% from 77% was already in his model.

52,MDT,"Allergan (AGN) stock dived Tuesday after the U.S. Treasury and IRS announced plans for new rules aimed at curbing tax inversions, a practice that allows U.S. companies to avoid taxes by buying a foreign company and moving their headquarters overseas.That could impact the pending deal between Pfizer (PFE) and Ireland-based Allergan -- set to close this year -- since the latter is the result of several recent inversions.The companies said in a statement late Monday: ""We are conducting a review of the U.S. Department of Treasury’s actions announced today. Prior to completing the review, we won’t speculate on any potential impact.""Allergan fell nearly 20% to 233 in premarket trading, which would be the lowest level since October 2014. Pfizer rose nearly 2%.The latest Treasury  actions would limit the ability of inverted companies to lend money to their American subsidiaries, which creates deductible interest and reduces their taxable income in the U.S., by treating certain debt issuance as stock.""Serial inverters,"" are also targeted. Under the new rules, there's a three-year limit on foreign companies ""bulking up"" on U.S. assets to avoid ownership requirements for a later inversion deal.This is the third set of inversion-curbing rules issued by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew in the last few years. Lew said his office is continuing to explore additional ways to limit inversions.America's corporate tax system gives companies a strong incentive to shift headquarters overseas. The combined federal-state corporate rate is 39%, the highest in the industrialized world, while America -- unlike most nations -- taxes overseas earnings. Inverted companies still have to pay U.S. tax rates on American profits, but are get relief on earnings elsewhere.Other notable recent inversions involved Mylan (MYL), Medtronic (MDT) and Burger King, now called Restaurant Brands (QSR). But those deals have already closed.

53,MDT,"Edwards Lifesciences' (EW) CardiAQ heart valve will resume clinical testing, the company said late Friday, putting it on track for a European launch in 2018 and a U.S. launch in 2020, RBC estimates.In the stock market today, Edwards stock jumped 3.3% to 92.67, after earlier rising as much as 5.1% to a nearly three-week high and retaking its 50-day line. Edwards stock plunged 8.5% on Feb. 2, after valve-related issues caused the company to halt enrollment in the U.S. feasibility study.Though it had received the requisite regulatory approvals to begin a key trial in Europe, Edwards opted to delay enrollment while working through those issues. Edwards expected to resume clinical activity on the transcatheter mitral valve in Q2.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific is making a play to beat out Edwards and Medtronic in the heart-valve market. How? Read on in Sector Leaders.But ""the restart is occurring sooner than expected,"" RBC analyst Glenn Novarro wrote in a research report. He sees the valve as launching next year in Europe and in 2020 in the U.S.Novarro kept his outperform rating and 116 price target on Edwards stock.""While concern over U.S. TAVR (transcatheter aortic valve-replacement) will linger until ACC (the American College of Cardiology annual meeting), we believe that the CardiAQ overhand has now been removed,"" he wrote.Edwards competes against Boston Scientific (BSX) and Medtronic (MDT) in the heart-valve market. Though its competitors are larger by market cap, Novarro sees Edwards as the ""best growth story in large-cap medtech.""RELATED:Medtronic Posts 'Quickest Comeback' On Heart-Valve, Brain TherapiesEdwards Heart-Valve Guidance Lags On Medtronic, Boston RivalryMedtronic Downgraded On Increased Boston, J&J, St. Jude Rivalries

54,MDT,"President Trump harped on drug prices in a tweet early Tuesday, prompting generic drugmakers Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL) to dip, even though the House's proposal to replace ObamaCare doesn't touch drug prices.""I am working on a new system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry,"" Trump wrote in a tweet before the open Tuesday. ""Pricing for the American people will come way down!""Drug and biotech stocks broadly dipped in response. At the close on the stock market today, IBD's 17-company generic drugs industry group was down 1.2% after falling as much as 3.8% earlier, touching a five-week low.Shares of biotech and specialty drug companies fell nearly 1.5%. One of the biggest stock losers was specialty drug firm Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN), which was down 11.3%. Supernus, however, also settled a patent dispute with Zydus Pharmaceutical over marketing of the generic version of Supernus' seizure treatment, Trokendi. Zydus will be the only company allowed to market the drug under certain circumstances starting in 2023.Also falling were shares of Endo International (ENDP) down 4.4% to 10.90, and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), plunging 5.6% to 11.71.Trump's specific method of targeting drug prices via competition wasn't immediately clear Tuesday after the House released an early version of a bill to replace Obama's linchpin legislation, the Affordable Care Act.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech leader Celgene could breakout on a major breakthrough. Head to IBD's Stock Analysis for a deeper dive.Dubbed the American Healthcare Act, the Republican proposal would end the individual mandate, bringing the penalty for not having health insurance down to $0. The proposal would also repeal the medical device tax.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar noted the latter point would be a positive, in general ""as a majority of device companies have been reinvesting the benefit from the current temporary repeal of (the) device tax.""This could be a potential boon for med-tech makers like Medtronic (MDT), Boston Scientific (BSX) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW), which make heart valves.But the bill still has a long way to go before making its way to Trump's desk, Evercore analyst Terry Haines wrote in a research report. It will need near-unanimous support from House and Senate Republicans where Democrats will likely be in opposition.""We are only at the beginning of the legislative process on part of ACA reform,"" he wrote. ""We continue to think that the end of June is a realistic target.""The document released late Monday is merely the tax and revenue portions of the ACA repeal. Congress will use the budget reconciliation process — requiring only a majority in both houses — for this portion, Haines wrote.Broader ACA reform will probably not be finalized this year.""It will need some bipartisanship to succeed,"" he wrote. ""Today, none is apparent but we are in early days.""RELATED:How To Quickly Find Top-Rated Stocks Near A Buy Point

56,MDT,"Want to put Fidelity Investments' world-class research resources to work for your retirement accounts and your taxable portfolios? Of course you do.Knowing how the Boston-based asset management giant has deployed the assets of shareholders in its stock mutual funds and balanced funds can help you make decisions about your own buys and sells.For example, in the fourth quarter Fidelity trimmed its exposure to several big technology bellwether stocks. Not all Fidelity funds may act in lockstep, but overall the fund complex lightened its net share count in Facebook (FB) by 5.1%, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research for CFRA, an independent research firm.Facebook is ranked No. 4 on IBD's Internet-Content industry group, thanks in part to a strong 91 Composite Rating from IBD and 87% average earnings per share growth over the past three quarters. 99 is the highest possible rating, which is on a scale from 1-99.Fidelity's Facebook holding is now at its lightest quarter-end level since the end of 2013, Rosenbluth says in a new report for MarketScope Advisor.Facebook has rallied 16% since the beginning in a year to an all-time high. Subsequent disclosures by Fidelity will reveal whether it's been a buyer of Facebook shares in the current period.The fund complex also trimmed its net share count in Google-owner Alphabet's C-class shares (GOOG) by 5.6% and its A-class shares (GOOGL) by 1.4%. Alphabet has rallied 6% so far this year. It faded after clearing the 816.78 buy point of a flat base on Jan. 23. It's retaken the buy point.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) was a third tech big name to be trimmed by Fidelity. Fidelity also trimmed Salesforce.com (CRM), a provider of customer relationship management software.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia ranks No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, buoyed by a solid-gold 99 Comp Rating and six straight quarters of EPS growth acceleration. For details, check the stock's vital signs at IBD's Stock Checkup.Still, tech remained Fidelity's biggest sector, accounting for 26% of the fund family's shareholders' money. That was an increase from Sept. 30's 24% and June 30's 23% weighting.And many Fidelity funds, including some of its largest, remained owners of stock in which the overall complex made net trims.For instance, now-$35.3 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX) held Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia and Salesforce.com in its top 10 at year-end.And there were several tech names in which Fidelity made net increases in its share counts during Q4.Fidelity boosted its share count in software giant Microsoft (MSFT) by 9.3% to 148 million shares. That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.""A few other stocks that had double-digit percentage share increases include Autodesk (ADSK),"" Rosenbluth told IBD, referring to the developer of computer-aided design software applications.Financials were Fidelity's second-largest sector, with 15% of shareholders' assets. That increase took place as Fidelity increased its exposure to some big U.S. banks.Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) all saw double-digit percentage share count growth, Rosenbluth wrote. He added, ""CFRA thinks investor optimism for banks improved amid expectations for higher interest rates and regulatory reform.""President Trump and Congress are widely expected to lighten the regulatory restrictions on some banks.In addition, Fidelity made a double-digit percentage increase in its share count in Capital One Financial (COF).The $414.3 million Fidelity Blue Chip Value (FBCVX) held Alphabet, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo in its top 10 at year end.Fidelity had a 9% weight in industrials as of the end of Q4. Fidelity managers made a 53% net addition to their share count in aerospace and defense contractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) in the quarter. They added 6.7% to their shares in General Electric (GE).Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon (VZ) were two stocks in which Fidelity managers made double-digit share increases.Tech was not the only space in which Fidelity funds made cuts. Fidelity managers made double-digit decreases to telecom titan AT&T (T), energy explorer and producer Chevron (CVX), medical products maker Medtronic (MDT) and to athletic apparel, footwear and equipment maker Nike (NKE).Each of those decreases appears vindicated at this early point following the quarter. Comp Ratings for each of those stocks current range from an anemic 27 for Chevron to Nike's 59.All of Rosenbluth's data applies to Fidelity's 232 stock and balanced funds (mixtures of stocks and bonds), which together hold nearly $1 trillion in shareholder assets, according to Morningtstar Inc.Fidelity runs an additional 70 funds that hold bonds or commodities, accounting for an additional $233 billion in shareholder money.RELATED:P-s-s-st!

57,MDT,"As Medtronic (MDT) preps to dredge Edwards Lifesciences' (EW) share of the heart valve-replacement market, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Boston Scientific (BSX) and St. Jude Medical (STJ) are lining up in 2017 to gouge various pieces of Medtronic's business.Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences stocks rifted Tuesday on differing analyst views for 2017. In the stock market today, Medtronic stock fell 0.86% to 70.62, after a Morgan Stanley analyst downgraded the stock. Edwards stock rose 1.9% to a two-month high of 95.49.David Lewis, of Morgan Stanley, downgraded Medtronic stock to equal weight from overweight. He also cut his price target to 77 from 85. Shares closed 2016 down 7%, vastly below their 50-day moving average and will likely be muted on growth perspectives this year, Lewis said.Medtronic completed its $43 billion acquisition of Covidien, an Irish medical products and device maker, in January 2015 and margins disappeared in the aftermath of the acquisition, as expected, but ""organic growth served as a nice bridge,"" Lewis wrote in his research report.""But organic growth has decelerated each of the last two quarters,"" he wrote. ""We are not convinced we see a path to outperformance in light of topline headwinds until management can demonstrate more durable cost opportunities in fiscal 2019.""IBD'S TAKE: Late last year, Boston Scientific acquired Neovasc's tissue business in a deal that could hurt rivals Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences. Check out how these Sector Leaders are battling it out in the medical products field.Medtronic's 2017 growth will hinge, in part, on traction of its MiniMed 670G, a hybrid closed loop diabetes management system, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of a large-valve indication for intermediate risk patients, expected in mid-2017.Lewis project 3%-4% organic growth if Medtronic's launches gain traction.Meanwhile, Medtronic will see increased competition in MRI safe launches from Boston. Boston and St. Jude are emerging rivals in deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's patients. Spectranetics will soon compete in drug-coated balloon (DCB) treatments, and J&J is getting into the minimally invasive procedure arena.Edwards stock, on the other hand, pulled in an upgrade Tuesday. Guggenheim analyst Chris Pasquale upgraded Edwards stock to a buy from neutral, and established a 120 price target. He says transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) expectations have ""come back down to Earth"" after a lackluster Q3.But there's still room for growth in the TAVR market, Pasquale wrote in his report. He estimates global TAVR sales for 2016 will come in at $2.545 billion, with Edwards bringing in $1.622 billion. Consensus estimates were 20% lower in January 2016, he noted.""It would have been hard to imagine this being considered a disappointing outcome a year ago, yet investor sentiment on both Edwards and the TAVR opportunity has soured somewhat in the wake of Q3 results that failed to show the kind of positive inflection many Street models forecast,"" he wrote.Analysts were exceptionally bullish after Edwards got an intermediate risk indication for TAVR patients in August, Pasquale noted. That, plus temporary capacity constraints at some centers and the natural ""ebb and flow"" of the market, likely led to the major Q3 disappointment.Pasquale estimates procedures still grew 40% year over year last quarter. He expects worldwide TAVR sales to double over the next five years — ""a trend that Edwards should be the primary beneficiary of even as competition increases,"" he said.RELATED:Edwards Heart-Valve Guidance Lags On Medtronic, Boston RivalryEdwards 2017 Guidance Likely Hinges On Rivalry With Medtronic, Boston

59,MDT,"Edwards Lifesciences' (EW) fiscal 2017 guidance lagged Wall Street for its heart-valve replacement tech amid fierce competition with Medtronic (MDT) and Boston Scientific (BSX), but sales views were in line and shares neared a month high Thursday.On the stock market today, Edwards Lifesciences stock lifted 6.65% to 89.30. Shares are up 13% year to date, but remain down sharply following Edwards' Q3 earnings report on Oct. 25. Then, shares toppled 19% on sales that fell short.For fiscal 2017, Edwards guided to $3 billion to $3.4 billion in sales, up 10%-14%, and $3.30 to $3.45 earnings per share ex items. Sales guidance met with consensus for 12% growth and EPS was in line with analysts' expectations for $3.40, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar wrote in a research report.But transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) guidance lagged the consensus, Kumar wrote. The firm guided to $1.7 billion to $2 billion in sales, up 15%-20%. The midpoint of Edwards' guidance lagged analysts' views for 19%-20% growth.Kumar noted, however, that Edwards typically guides conservatively and ""ends up beating and raising."" The TAVR guidance miss comes amid mounting pressure from rivals Medtronic and Boston Scientific.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration looks likely to approve Medtronic for a large-valve indication for intermediate risk patients in mid-2017. And Boston Scientific could potentially enter the TAVR market before the end of 2017, Kumar wrote in a report Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific acquired Neovasc's tissue business earlier this year.

In December, many of his team's funds were taking year-end profits.Still, the Federal Reserve's hike in its key interest rate and upward moves in oil and gold prices last week as well as U.S. consumer confidence are harbingers of reflation — rising inflation, nominal growth and wages, said Richard Turnill, asset management mammoth BlackRock's (BLK) global chief investment strategist in a Tuesday commentary.The chief beneficiaries of reflation should be value stocks, especially U.S. regional banks, some health care stocks and companies able to expand their dividends, Turnill wrote.""We see earnings growth and further rotation into big sectors such as financials underpinning a U.S. stock market advance in 2017, but we are cautious in the near term after large inflows and new record highs,"" he wrote.Turnill also likes European and Japanese stocks going forward, in part because of weak currencies ""though we are wary of political, policy and trade risks in the eurozone,"" he said.In addition, he wrote, ""We favor emerging market equities, given structural reforms, improving profitability and low valuations.""Darrell Riley, a vice president in T.

Market leadership indicated we were heading into an economic slowdown, with defensive sectors leading.""But once investors began to expect Trump and Republican victories — starting shortly before the election — ""there was a rebound in the market, with renewed energy and optimism,"" Weiss said.Investors began to anticipate the benefits of tax cuts, less business regulation and repatriation of corporate cash held abroad. ""That all coincided with a strengthening in oil prices,"" Weiss said, buoyed by an OPEC deal to cut production and stabilization of Chinese economic growth.But don't expect the economy or the markets to trend upward without interruptions in 2017. ""We will see volatility amid risk,"" Aymeric Forest, head of global income for the multi-asset team of global asset manager Schroders. Forest cites geopolitical risks globally.In the U.S., ""the new administration, like every new administration, will make mistakes,"" said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.And eventually — maybe as early as 2017 — rising interest rates might could slow economic activity, Weiss says.Forest added, ""It will be important for investors to remain flexible to take advantage of opportunities, and they should take a multi-asset approach, especially in their search for income.""RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewHot Stocks That Made Craig Hodges A Top Fund ManagerSix Steps To Take Now With Your Personal Financial Action Plan

61,MDT,"Edwards Lifesciences (EW) 2017 guidance, slated for release at its analyst day event on Thursday, could be somewhat strangled on the likelihood of rivals Medtronic (MDT) and Boston Scientific (BSX) pressuring the U.S. heart valve replacement market, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar said Tuesday.Kumar expects Edwards to issue a conservative transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) view for 2017 on tough comps and continued competitive pressure. The FDA is expected to grant Medtronic a large-valve indication for intermediate risk patients in mid-2017, and Boston could compete in the U.S. by year-end.That follows international pressure beginning in 2014 when Edwards' TAVR sales began to decelerate following the entry of Medtronic and Boston, Kumar wrote. Wall Street models 19%-22% growth in the U.S. in 2017, with FactSet polling at 11%-22% growth internationally.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific's acquisition of Neovasc could rattle Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences. Hit up Sector Leaders for the deep dive.Edwards will likely issue TAVR guidance at 15%-25% growth, the midpoint just missing broader analyst views, Kumar wrote. But Edwards has historically issued a conservative outlook and then raised it over the course of a year, he says.""Given these moving parts, we wouldn't be surprised to (see) the range widen,"" he wrote in a research report.Investors are likely to key in Thursday on Edwards' plan for dealing with competitive pressure in the U.S., Kumar said. Still, Edwards has a strong track record of outlasting rivals, with U.S. sales growing by half thus far in 2016 despite additional pressure.Meanwhile, TAVR sales are cannibalizing SAVR (surgical aortic valve replacement) sales, Kumar says. He also identifies TMVR (transcatheter mitral valve replacement/repair) as the ""single largest pipeline opportunity for Edwards Lifesciences and other cardio players over the next five years.""TMVR is especially important as there are two methods of treatment: replacement and repair. Edwards has traditionally played in the replacement arena, with its acquisition of CardiAC. The acquisition of ValTech's Cardioband opens up the repair side, Kumar says.Kumar sees Edwards touching on the TMVR market in its analyst day commentary.""While we thought this was a complementary acquisition, some investors have wondered whether this was a sign that Edwards Lifesciences was hedging its bet in this crucial pipeline opportunity,"" he wrote.He kept his hold rating and 105 price target on Edwards stock. At the close on the stock market today, Edwards stock was up 0.9% to close at 83.22 Tuesday, but it's down more than 30% from a record high near 122 touched in late September, plunging 17% in October on weak Q3 sales. Shares of Medtronic lifted 0.6% to 72.11 while Boston added 0.5% to finshed the day at 20.81.RELATED:Medtronic Dives To Nine-Month Low On Sluggish Diabetes, Valve SalesEdwards, Medtronic Rebound After Negative Report; Medtech Spiraling

65,MDT,"Decades of research and billions of dollars have poured into developing artificial intelligence, which has crossed over from science fiction to gameshow novelty to the cusp of widespread business applications.Artificial intelligence is an area of computer science where computers are designed to think and operate much like a human brain, supported by advanced forms of computing and software. But it’s only as smart as the amount of information fed into its memory banks. The more information, the smarter it gets. The greatest advancements have been demonstrated in the area of game playing, but AI is now showing its mettle in the business world.""People are starting to kick the tires, looking to see how it can help their business and the bottom line,"" said David Schubmehl, who follows the AI field for research firm IDC. ""The return on investment evidence is not yet clear, but it's starting to happen.""Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL), IBM (IBM) and Nvidia (NVDA) are among tech leaders with big artificial intelligence ambitions.“We’re starting to see a lot of companies beginning to use different types of AI tech for various uses,” said Schubmehl. “We’re also seeing a lot of venture capital money flowing in and a lot of acquisitions taking place.”IBM, which may have the deepest AI investments and most far-reaching ability of any company, has pitched ""cognitive computing"" as a tool for businesses via its cloud-based Watson platform.Facebook is using AI to decipher the best ways to bring Internet service to remote areas of the world and to make its News Feed feature more relevant to users of the social network.Alphabet is using it to enhance Google search abilities, improve voice recognition and to derive more data from images and video.Nvidia has developed chip technology for AI platforms used in autonomous driving features, and to enhance how a driver and car communicate.Alphabet, Mobileye (MBLY) and others also are tapping AI in the race for driverless cars. It's not enough to have Google Maps loaded up: A self-driving system must identify potholes, weather conditions, traffic congestion and other drivers' behavior -- improvising and improving on the fly.Artificial intelligence, a term coined in 1955, was popularized when IBM’s “Big Blue” became the first computer to beat a reigning world chess champion, Gary Kasparov, in 1997. IBM won again in 2011, when its Watson computer on “Jeopardy!” outsmarted the game show's two top players ever.Last October, an AI computer beat a three-time European champion in the ancient Asian game of “Go.” AphaGo, built by DeepMind, part of Alphabet's Google, beat Fan Hui by 5 games to 0, the first time a computer program has ever beaten a professional Go player and a feat thought to be a decade away. On Tuesday, AlphaGo won the first game vs. Lee Sodol, who is ranked No. 5 in the world. Tuesday's match shows that AlphaGo has made big improvements since beating the No. 633 ranked Fan Hui last year.Google paid $400 million to acquire DeepMind in 2014.But despite rapid advances, artificial intelligence is still in the early stages of business deployment.“A lot of what AI is being used for today only scratches the surface of what can be done,” said Babak Hodjat, co-founder and chief scientist at Sentient Technologies. “It will become so ubiquitous that we won’t even call it AI anymore.”Sentient emerged from stealth mode in late 2014 with a massively distributed AI platform that companies can use to boost performance. As shoppers at Shoeme.ca browse through photos of shoes and click on ones they like, Sentient's technology narrows the selection, so people don’t get overwhelmed by choices. There’s no need for text-based searches or drill-down navigation, said Hodjat. The AI technology deciphers what shoppers are looking for, letting them quickly dive deeper into a catalog to find the perfect item that might otherwise go undiscovered.“We’ve revolutionized the user experience on an e-commerce website,” said Hodjat. “It’s a huge change in the way users interact with products online and therefore drives conversion.”Sentient has received $143 million in venture capital funding, the most of any AI startup, according to research firm CB Insights. Since 2010, AI startups have received $967 million in funding. Intel (INTC) alone has invested in 16 AI companies, including Saffron Technology.Saffron says its platform ""mimics the fundamental principles of how humans remember and learn."" In a case study on its website, Saffron helped an insurer to identify fraudulent auto insurance claims. Over 10 weeks, Saffron examined 113,000 claims from one year in one state and found three potential fraud rings. It then detected that these rings were part of a larger ring involved with 38 claims, of which the insurance company had paid out about $400,000 in claims. Saffron was able to collect data that identified relevant and unknown relationships, including different providers, demographics and injury descriptions, creating a knowledge store that had never been done before. Saffron forecasts that the insurer can avoid a payout of tens of millions of dollars a year.AI goes by terms such as machine learning and deep learning. IBM calls it cognitive computing. In October it launched Cognitive Business Solutions, with 2,000 consultants skilled in data analytics, cloud computing and other areas.More than 500 companies have deals to use Watson, as a cloud service, to develop commercial products, apps and services. Turner Broadcasting on Feb. 29 signed a deal to use Watson in its ad sales efforts. The Time Warner (TWX), unit owns TBS, TNT and CNN. Using IBM Watson, Turner expects to parse through all manner of data to help draw in more advertisers and provide them with greater impact.Watson Health is a platform for physicians, researchers, insurers and other companies focused on health and wellness. Medtronic (MDT) is collaborating with IBM on personalized care for people with diabetes. By analyzing patient info and data from Medtronic devices, Watson can predict low blood sugar programs three hours in advance.Artificial intelligence is all about using advanced technologies to help develop brainy reasoning from disorganized information -- unstructured data -- to derive accurate decisions.“What we’ve done with all our research is to really understand how to add unstructured data to a decision,” said David Kenny, general manager of IBM Watson.Unstructured data comes from a multitude of sources that is not organized. It can be the data bits from photos, medical images or video and audio transmissions. It can be the tons of data that flows in from cameras or sensors in buildings or smartphones, from Web traffic, tweets, inside emails, government filings or business documents. The more information an artificially intelligent computer can digest the smarter it gets.Collecting data on a massive scale is among the reasons IBM acquired several Weather Co. properties, including Weather.com, Weather Underground and mobile and cloud-based assets, for a reported $2 billion in October.IBM will be able to analyze data from more than 2 billion weather reference points, over 40 million smartphones and 50,000 airplane flights per day, letting it offer a broad range of data-driven products and services to more than 5,000 clients in the media, aviation, energy, insurance and government industries. IBM said it can provide predictive weather analytics along with real-time analysis of social media chatter, detailed understanding of transportation flows and other data that will benefit retailers and distributors.The Weather Co. assets will serve as the foundation of a new Watson unit focused on the Internet of Things (IoT). Early this year, IBM announced that it would invest $3 billion to build out IoT products and services.
"
66,MDT,"“The more we do this, the smarter Watson gets and the smarter AI gets,” said Kenny.As to why AI is becoming more widespread: “It works,” Kenny said. “Users of AI are saving time and money. They’re making faster decisions and getting better outcomes.”An analysis of Facebook and Alphabet's Google by research firm Innography shows a surge in AI patent filings that began in 2010. Alphabet currently has more than 3,000 AI patents that are active or pending government approval. Facebook has about 870.Facebook last June opened an artificial intelligence lab in Paris with a goal of improving the way users interact on the world's largest social network.
"
67,MDT,"""It's our hope that this research will ultimately help us make services like News Feed, photos and search even better and enable an entirely new set of ways to connect and share,"" Facebook said at the time. It also has AI research teams at its Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters and in New York.Facebook in February revealed its Connectivity Lab project. It used AI to analyze 8.3 million square miles of land, using roads, schools and other structures to determine where and how many people live in a given area. That can tell Facebook's Aquila drones where to go to provide Internet access to less-developed areas, as part of the company's Internet.org initiative.“This data will give us a greater understanding of how populations are dispersed, so governments and others can prioritize investments in infrastructure, from transportation to healthcare and education,” Facebook said.

The investigation is separate from an existing investigation into a company, Salix Pharmaceuticals, that Valeant bought last year, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.Drugmaker Endo International (ENDP) crashed 21% in massive volume after saying it would close its Astora Women's Health division by the end of March to reduce the potential for product liability related to future vaginal mesh implants. Endo had failed to find a buyer for Astora.The announcement overshadowed a better-than-expected Q4 earnings report, in which the company reported that profit jumped 42% to $1.36 a share. Sales climbed 62% to $1.07 billion.Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) led broad declines in the IBD 50, sinking 5% after hitting resistance at its 50-day moving average.Mining stocks were among the day's best performers, following gold prices higher.Newmont Mining (NEM) rose almost 2% as it tried to clear a 26.20 buy point of a long, deep cup-with-handle base.For the month, the S&P 500 edged down 0.2%, and the Nasdaq slipped  1%, according to preliminary data. The Dow industrials ended the month up 0.4%, halting a two-month skid.Companies due to report quarterly earnings Tuesday include AutoZone (AZO), DollarTree (DLTR), Ross Stores (ROST) and Medtronic (MDT).Economic data scheduled for Tuesday include construction spending for January, auto sales for February and the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index for February.

69,MDT,"Medical-device maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) was rising in heavy trading Thursday after it received an upgrade based on a bullish outlook for its Sapien 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Bruce Nudell upgraded Edwards stock to buy from neutral and raised his price target to 88 from 86 based on last Friday's announcement that the FDA had approved a new study of the Sapien 3 in elderly patients who have severe aortic stenosis and have a low risk of death from traditional surgical valve replacement. Edwards launched Sapien 3 last year for high-risk patients, but the study could potentially expand its market, based on somewhat more lenient standards than expected, Nudell wrote.""Following FDA approval to initiate a Sapien 3 low-risk IDE (investigational device exemption) study with a one-year primary endpoint (vs. anticipated two-year follow-up), we've updated our TAVR market model to reflect this expedited timeline for label expansion into this substantial patient pool,"" Nudell wrote in his research note. ""Our estimate for the TAVR market increases from $4.8 billion in 2021 to $5 billion (in line with company projections) and from $6.3 billion in 2025 to $6.55 billion.""Currently, the TAVR market is split between Edwards' Sapien and Medtronic's (MDT) CoreValve.Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy also raised her estimates for the same reason, while maintaining an outperform rating on Edwards stock.""Our updated model assumes — and conservatively so, we believe — just a modest uptake in low-risk patients, reaching 26% penetration in both the U.S. and Europe within two years of approval,"" Antalffy wrote in her research note Thursday. ""With a low-risk approval, we believe 10%+ global TAVR market growth is sustainable for the foreseeable future, with ramping volumes helping to offset what we model to be mid-single-digit to 10% annual price declines as new competitors enter the market, predominantly in the U.S.""Edwards is one of the leading stocks in the Medical Products group, with a strong IBD Composite Rating of 92.

Diabetes devices generated $645 million in sales, rising 26%. On a constant-currency basis, growth was 21.3%. Medtronic noted strong demand for its new sensor-augmented insulin pump systems.The results should help to stem ongoing concerns about Medtronic's diabetes devices segment, Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said in his report to clients.""Diabetes looked particularly strong, in our view, and if there was any lingering doubt that Medtronic had solved its production issues to meet demand, it should be erased with this result,"" he said.Minimally invasive therapies also topped the consensus by 11%, Evercore's Kumar said.

Pain therapies generated $332 million, rising 12.9% on a reported basis and 9.9% on a constant-currency basis.""Even spine had a nice quarter despite an ongoing sluggish market, and we feel it may have gained some share,"" Edward Jones' Boylan said.For the year, Medtronic guided to 4%-4.5% organic sales growth and adjusted profit of $5.10-$5.15 per share. The consensus had modeled $31.1 billion in sales and adjusted income of $5.15 per share.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro noted he'd been looking for 5% organic growth in the current fiscal year. But overall fourth-quarter sales were strong, while growth in the cardiac and vascular unit was slower. Medtronic is also in several competitive markets.Edward Jones' Boylan maintained his buy rating on Medtronic.""We are reiterating our view that Medtronic is positioned well for growth due to new products, ongoing cost savings from the Covidien acquisition and continued focus on emerging markets,"" he said.

75,MDT,"Integer Holdings (ITGR) is the IBD Stock Of The Day as shares broke out to a record high Friday, three weeks before the medtech player is set to report earnings.Integer stock popped 7.5%, to close at 73.50, after touching a record high at 73.94, on the stock market today. Shares broke out above a buy point at 68 of a flat base. The breakout came amid bullish views from Zacks Equity Research, which says Integer stock is stronger than Abiomed (ABMD) stock.Zacks analysts have buy ratings on both Integer and Abiomed stocks. This is based on improving revisions to earnings expectations. Integer is an outsource manufacturer of medical devices. Abiomed makes heart devices.The early Friday report also looked at forward price-earnings ratios. Integer's is lower at 20.40. This could signal the stock is undervalued or that the medtech firm is doing exceptionally well relative to past trends. Abiomed stock has a price-earnings ratio of 118.54.In terms of earnings growth expectations, Integer also has a lower PEG (price/earnings to growth) ratio. This accounts for its expected annual earnings growth relative to the price-earnings ratio. At a ratio of 1.36, Integer appears less expensive than Abiomed, which has a ratio of 4.39.Zacks also subtracted the companies' liabilities from assets, in an effort to compare their market prices to book value. In this price-to-book ratio, Integer again comes out on top with a ratio of 2.38 to Abiomed's 26.62.""Integer holds a value grade of A, while Abiomed has a value grade of D,"" analysts wrote. ""Both Integer and Abiomed are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that Integer is the superior value option right now.""Investors are also likely bullish on Integer's upcoming second-quarter earnings release, set for early Aug. 2.Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research call for adjusted profit of 86 cents per share on $382 million in sales. On a year-over-year basis, earnings minus specific items are expected to grow nearly 39%.

76,MDT,"With artificial intelligence now firmly entrenched in many hospital operating rooms, the field of robotic surgery is starting to get competitive.Giant companies like Alphabet (GOOGL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Medtronic (MDT) are training their sights on Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), the king of robotic surgery companies. But analysts say the booming medical technology segment has lots of room to run.Robotic surgery is an area that could grow by billions of dollars as more machines are used to treat patients. Intuitive commands the space with $3.3 billion in annual sales. Its signature da Vinci robotic surgeons, however, are limited in the types of procedures they handle. The multi-limbed da Vinci can be used in a variety of procedures — including cardiac, colorectal, gynecological, head and neck, thoracic and urologic surgeries — but only as long as they're minimally invasive.How big the market could be is still unclear, yet analysts agree the potential has yet to be tapped. So more players are moving in, and quickly.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

""This is a technological revolution that investors can't afford to miss.""Analysts say that in March, Auris Health became the first company to pose a formidable threat to Intuitive when its catheter-based Monarch Platform gained U.S. approval. Intuitive will counterpunch by seeking approval for a flexible catheter similar to the Auris device, likely this year, RBC analyst Brandon Henry said in a recent report.Meanwhile, others are working in areas where Intuitive Surgical doesn't have a foothold. Smith & Nephew (SNN) has a robotic assistant for knee replacements. Stryker (SYK) has a robotic joint replacement system. Mazor Robotics (MZOR) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) have robotic offerings in brain and spinal surgery. Mazor alone could see around $3 billion in sales just from its systems.But these players have a long way to go to take Intuitive Surgical's throne.In 2005, Intuitive had a market cap of $1.3 billion. Today, it's worth nearly $52 billion. Capron calls Intuitive ""an amazing stock.""""I think the investment community has been scratching their heads trying to figure out the impact of those new entrants for Intuitive Surgical,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""We feel pretty relaxed about it. The size is big enough for small players to come in.""Shares of medical tech companies have been relatively insulated from the woes frustrating biotech and pharmaceutical stocks of late. The stocks of medical equipment makers such as Intuitive and Mazor have collectively spiked 15% year to date.Intuitive's ""blowout quarter"" in April helped to spur excitement, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar said in a recent note to clients. Recent investor days from J&J and Medtronic are helping to drive that frenzy.""Robotic surgery is the topic currently in medtech with a blowout quarter from Intuitive Surgical hinting that the pace of manual-to-robotic transition might be picking up,"" Kumar said. ""The topic of competition elicits various responses from investors.""Intuitive Surgical stock is up 33% this year, after climbing 78% in 2017. Kumar expects Intuitive Surgical's competition to become more apparent over the next 12 to 18 months. Intuitive's da Vinci Surgical System now boasts ""five million patients and counting.""The da Vinci systems are also moving deeper into hernias and are seeing early-stage adoption in bariatrics surgery performed to induce weight loss.Myriam Curet, executive vice president and chief medical officer for Intuitive, noted in an email to IBD that an estimated 82% of prostatectomies in the U.S. are performed via robotic-assisted surgery. The same is true for about 80% of malignant hysterectomies.""General surgery is our fastest-growing specialty, and one where we are still in early stages of adoption for procedures such as ventral and inguinal hernia repair, colorectal and bariatric surgery,"" she said. ""We believe there is substantial opportunity to expand robotic usage in these categories, and we are developing additional tools and technologies to do so.""For the year, Intuitive guided on its first-quarter earnings conference call to 12%-15% growth in the number of procedures performed with its systems this year. That followed what many considered a strong fourth quarter in which recurring revenue — including instruments and accessories for its da Vinci systems — grew 11%. Recurring revenue represents 73% of the sales pie.Still, even Intuitive Surgical sees itself in the early innings and expects robotic surgery to present a huge total addressable market. The number of da Vinci procedures performed each year grew nearly 68% from 2013 to 2017.Among other robotic surgery companies, Intuitive's closest competitor, Auris, doesn't trade publicly. Until recently it was in ""stealth mode,"" Kumar said. But in May the medical technology company signed a commercialization agreement with a division of J&J. The agreement came two months after Auris' Monarch system grabbed approval in the U.S.Monarch is a flexible catheter. Surgeons thread it through a patient's mouth and into the lungs by remote control. Before its approval, investors believed ""credible competitors"" to Intuitive would be years away, Kumar says. But Monarch got approval months ahead of views. Intuitive Surgical plans to seek approval of its own flexible catheter later this year.On its website, Auris says Monarch's first target is lung cancer. Some experts estimate half a million lung biopsies are performed in the U.S. each year. Surgeons could also use flexible catheters in urinary tract procedures, which number roughly 400,000 procedures a year.Intuitive isn't sweating the competition. Auris' chief executive, interestingly, is Frederic Moll, who founded Intuitive Surgical in 1995. Intuitive's current CEO, Gary Guthart, joined the medical technology firm in 1996 and took over as CEO in 2010.""We have built technologies and made decisions about our architecture based on first principles, not by looking over our shoulder at what other people are doing, but by really engaging customers deeply and understanding their clinical needs,"" Guthart said on a recent earnings call.RBC's Henry notes Auris' Monarch has a 25% larger catheter than Intuitive's to allow for its camera. Intuitive sees a benefit in a smaller catheter that can move deeper into the lungs, Henry wrote in a recent report. That would allow surgeons to potentially use it to remove diseased tissue.Meanwhile, J&J has teamed up with Google on a company called Verb Surgical. Analysts are unsure what system the team is creating. They do expect it to enter the robotic surgery market in 2020, though.At the same time, Medtronic is partnered with Mazor. Medtronic also expects its own robotic surgery system to launch in 2020.It's not unreasonable to suggest Intuitive could keep 80% of the market, Evercore's Kumar told IBD. New robotic surgery companies will have to differentiate themselves.""They can't have a straightforward, 'me too' product,"" he said. ""Investors have put a pretty punchy marketable valuation on Intuitive Surgical because we're still in the early stages of this robotic conversation.""But, he added, ""This market is big enough to sustain multiple players.""That's where companies like Mazor and Zimmer Biomet, which makes systems called ROSA, come in. Both have systems that surgeons use in brain and spinal procedures.Like others, Mazor CEO Ori Hadomi says sizing the opportunity for robotic surgery companies is difficult. Surgeons use the $1.1 million Mazor X system in spinal surgeries. The company's Renaissance system can perform spinal and brain surgeries and costs $500,000.Disposable instruments and materials comprised 40% to 60% of Mazor's revenue, Hadomi told IBD. For each surgery performed with the Mazor X, the list price is $1,500 in terms of disposable items. An estimated half a million procedures would generate $750 million.Stakeholders expect spine procedures to grow rapidly.""People are being more and more active,"" he said, meaning they will suffer more injuries and require surgery more often. ""The procedures will become less invasive. The safer the procedures will become, the more patients will be willing and interested to be treated, to be operated on.""The benefits of robotic surgery are plentiful, Hadomi says. Revision surgery — surgery to correct mistakes or tweak prior surgeries — are significantly lower with a robot assisting. The precision of the robot helps to curb potential errors, he says.Last October, Mazor unveiled the results of a 379-patient study. It found a fivefold reduction of complications for surgeries performed with its Mazor robotic surgery technology. Notably, there was also a sevenfold reduction in revision surgery compared with freehand lumbar fusion surgeries.""There's no doubt from the patient's perspective, I would not consider going to surgery without the robot there knowing the chance of going through revision (surgery) is seven times higher,"" he said. Revision surgery is also costly for the hospital, which can face reimbursement hurdles.All agree that robotic surgery won't replace human surgeons. Hadomi likens his system and others like it to ""the toolbox of the surgeon"". These are simply medical technology tools that make operating easier on the surgeon and safer for the patient, he says.The benefits are also growing for investors, says Robo Global's Capron.""What's really exciting is the fact that we are at an inflection point where the technologies that enable robotic surgeries and the price point are attractive,"" he said. ""Now there's a lot of action around J&J and Medtronic. I see that as confirmation that this is a substantial, addressable market.""RELATED:Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

77,MDT,"Dow Jones component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) could engage in a bidding war to sweep Boston Scientific (BSX) out from under Stryker (SYK), an analyst said Tuesday following rumors the latter two could merge.A report emerged Monday that Stryker approached Boston with a takeover bid. Boston shares spiked on the rumor as Stryker toppled. But Canaccord analysts say Stryker could be far from the only medical device maker with interest in Boston.""If the headlines are substantiated and Stryker is in fact making a bid on Boston Scientific, we see a high likelihood that J&J could emerge as another potential bidder,"" they said in a note to clients. ""J&J had been bantered about as a potential Boston Scientific acquirer for years, and if a bidding war emerges, we'd place a high likelihood on J&J being involved.""On the stock market today, Boston stock dipped 1.4% to close at 33.84. Stryker shares plunged 4.3% to 162.54. Even J&J stock looked somewhat dim, easing by a fraction to 122.54.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe deal had analysts somewhat split on Tuesday.""Regarding the materiality of this report, we do not find the potential of such a marriage to be shocking,"" Canaccord analysts said. ""Indeed, we see merits to such a combination from the standpoint of product line synergies.""For Stryker, the acquisition would help it add products in sectors with higher potential for growth and in bigger markets. It would also help Stryker to differentiate its portfolio of technologies and compete with large companies like J&J and Medtronic (MDT).In Boston's case, the deal would cap a five-year turnaround, allowing it to ""end on a high-note,"" Canaccord analysts said.""In sum, we definitively think Boston Scientific is game to do a fair deal here,"" they said.But RBC analyst Glenn Novarro viewed the deal ""unfavorably,"" though acknowledged from a strategic rationale the it would make sense. It's also likely Boston won't OK any deal for less than $40 per share.""It would combine two of the premier growth companies in the (medical device) space, and there would be limited product overlap,"" he said. However, ""the bar for value creation is set high given the potential valuations of both companies.""A combined Stryker-Boston Scientific would have 2019 revenue of around $25 billion. It stands to grow at a sustainable 6% or higher compound annual growth rate in the medium term, Novarro said. It would have an enterprise value of about $61 billion.Canaccord analysts called the potential deal a ""merger of equals."" Stryker is only about a third larger than Boston. It could also lead to further med-tech consolidation.""If consummated, this would create four $100 billion behemoths in (medical devices) with Stryker/Boston Scientific joining Abbott (ABT), J&J and Medtronic,"" they said.

The massive annual Consumer Electronics Show ends Saturday.Rometty talked about how Medtronic ([STOCK[MDT]]), Under Armour ([STOCK[UA]]) and SoftBank Robotics are using Watson's big data analytics capabilities in vastly different ways.Medtronic CEO Omar Ishrak said his company is using Watson [PAGE[technology]] for diabetes [PAGE[management]]. In a new app rolling out this summer, medical technology firm Medtronic will track a diabetes patient's blood-sugar levels and predict life-threatening hypoglycemic events up to three hours in advance of symptoms.Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank said his company hooked up to IBM's Watson because he wanted his customers to get more meaningful data-backed health and fitness insights.The company's UA Record app will provide athletes with timely, evidence-based coaching around their sleep, fitness, activity and nutrition, including outcomes achieved based on others ""like you.""The app can act as a personal health consultant, fitness trainer and assistant, he said.Plank said he was driven to create the app because he was frustrated by the fact that people have more data about the health of their cars or investments than their own bodies.Watson also is providing artificial intelligence for a social humanoid robot called Pepper from SoftBank Robotics. Pepper currently is being used as a customer service robot in a limited number of Mizuho Financial Group's ([STOCK[MFG]]) bank branches and Nestle ([STOCK[NSRGY]]) coffee shops in Japan.Watson's cognitive computing capabilities are ready to be put to use in a host of industries, Rometty said.Also at CES, IBM announced ventures involving Watson with medical diagnostic firm Pathway Genomics and home appliance maker Whirlpool ([STOCK[WHR]]).Pathway Genomics unveiled a test version of the Pathway Genomics OME app, powered by Watson.

Both metrics topped the consensus for $9.72 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $1.37 per share.Boston is ""riding the 'wave' amidst a choppy earnings season,"" Kumar said. Neuromodulator sales were a source of upside in the quarter. Revenue from the implantable devices, which treat chronic pain and neurological diseases, grew 19.3% on a reported basis and 17.2% operationally.That was helped by sales of the Spectra WaveWriter, a spinal cord stimulator used to treat chronic pain. The device gained approval in January and subsequently launched. Revenue from implantable cardioverter defibrillators also helped, growing by double digits, Kumar said.Cardiac rhythm management sales were in line, up 2.4% organically. Interventional cardiology grew 1.3% on an organic basis, below Kumar's view for 2.3% growth.Investors are likely nervous that Boston hasn't yet offered an update on its transcatheter heart valve replacement, or TAVR, device called Lotus. TAVR is a method of replacing a diseased heart valve by using a catheter rather than resorting to open-heart surgery.Boston voluntarily recalled its Lotus and Lotus Edge Aortic Valve Systems in Europe last year after discovering some issues with the system. In February, Boston said it planned to launch the Lotus Edge system in the U.S. and Europe in 2019.The Lotus products would compete against TAVR systems from Edwards and Medtronic (MDT), which have a respective mid-60%/mid-30% split of the market, analysts say.""If we had to nitpick, possibly the lack of Lotus update and better revenue flow-through at high end not translating into operating margin expansion come to mind,"" Kumar said.

Intuitive raised the bottom line of its 2018 outlook to 12%-15% growth in procedures. Placement of new da Vinci systems in hospitals also was a highlight, growing 46% year over year.""Ultimately, procedure growth should remain the key focus for investors, as procedure volume growth has historically been a leading indicator of additional system placements,"" Mills said.Intuitive expects it's still in the early innings of the large hernia repair market, Mills said. Hernia and general surgery are expected to be the biggest procedure volume bucket.Whereas Mills sees Intuitive as firing ""on all cylinders,"" Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar notes Intuitive didn't raise the top-end of its 2018 outlook for procedure volume. In 2017, procedures grew by 16%, he said in a note to clients.The question comes down to valuation for Intuitive stock, Kumar said. If hospitals are, in fact, purchasing da Vinci systems in anticipation of future procedure demand, then a lofty price/earnings ratio could be justified.""However, given historical comments that procedures are a leading indicator for system placements, procedures coming in-line with expectations would argue against a greater than 40 times price/earnings ratio on capital expenditures revenue beat,"" he said.Maintaining a high valuation also depends on whether Intuitive can maintain its standing as the predominant player in the market, Kumar said. Auris Health recently launched its Monarch Platform for lung biopsy. At the same time, Dow Jones component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Medtronic (MDT) are moving into the robotic surgery market.""Investors are more comfortable paying premium price/earnings ratios for assets perceived as having monopoly power,"" he said. But with other entrants coming, ""one could make a case against the sustenance of this monopoly power.""Bulls may argue that Intuitive has a technological lead on rivals. The debate is likely to come to a head in the next 12 months, Kumar said.In the meantime, Kumar says he is staying on the sidelines.

97,MDT,"Medical supplier stocks collectively toppled to a 10-month low intraday Tuesday with Becton Dickinson (BDX) among the biggest losers after reports emerged that Amazon.com (AMZN) is planning to sell supplies to hospitals.X But analysts largely doubted Amazon could put pressure on manufacturers of ""higher tech"" products, including implantable devices.This would insulate companies like Medtronic (MDT), Stryker (SYK), Cantel Medical (CMD), Conmed (CNMD) and Teleflex (TFX), Needham analyst Mike Matson wrote in a note to clients. In other industries, Amazon has typically disrupted the middlemen more than the manufacturers, he said.""In our view, Amazon's model may work for 'lower tech' products but is unlikely to work with 'higher tech' products,"" Matson said.Among lower-tech products he lists lower-priced single-use items that don't require service and are typically used without a sales representative present. Higher-tech items are often implantable, need service and require a sales rep present during their use.""Perhaps not surprisingly, lower-tech products are already typically sold through distributors such as Owens & Minor (OMI), while higher-tech products are typically sold directly by the manufacturer,"" he said. ""In our view, Amazon would simply represent another distribution channel for lower-tech products.""IBD'S TAKE: The stock market remains off its 2018 high. With the market still in the throes of a correction, it's important to keep tabs on key action by visiting The Big Picture.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar says Amazon could be a ""formidable player"" in the basic medical supplies category, which includes plastics, gloves, drapes and simple catheters.

101,MDT,"Alphabet, the world's Internet search leader, is prospecting beyond its core business to strike success in the health care world. The company's glucose monitoring contact lens for diabetics is inching closer to drugstore shelves, while sales of its $200 self-stabilizing spoon, designed to help people with uncontrollable hand tremors eat comfortably, topped 1,000 in the first six months.Google — which restructured last year to become the largest operating unit within a new parent, Alphabet (GOOGL) — bought biotech company Lift Labs in 2014, just a few months after the health-focused startup began product sales.Pointing to its broadening emphasis on that and other health and medical advancements, Alphabet last month renamed its Google Life Sciences division Verily Life Sciences. The division brings together clinicians and scientists and is focused on understanding and improving chronic conditions that impact massive numbers of people — health issues including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative disease and mental health.""This is a development in health care that I think is far-reaching and will be long-lasting because we are seeing a period of convergence between the technology companies and the health care companies,"" California Life Sciences Association trade group CEO Sara Radcliffe told IBD.She said changes driving health care and tech firms into partnerships include ""the explosion of Big Data"" and the resulting demand for ways to manage all that patient information.Growth of access to data via the Internet cloud and mobile technologies such as Fitbit (FIT) wearables are ""shifting health care to maintaining and tracking health, rather than simply treating disease,"" she said.Companies Teaming UpRecent notable health-tech partnerships include Alphabet's Verily division teaming up last month with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) to develop surgical robots.

103,MDT,"When the going gets tough, the tough build and monitor their ETF watch lists. When most investors are feeling skittish after a sharp stock market sell-off, the wise focus on the inevitable upside.Smart investors also consider the overall direction of the market when making buy and sell decisions. The IBD market direction recently shifted to correction status again.So it's time for active ETF investors to be cautious. Even several of last year's ETF winners have sunk below their 50-day moving averages, a key support level.But cautious doesn't mean idle. Several sector equity ETFs tracked by IBD are within 10% of their buy points. Buying ETFs and stocks as they break out above buy points in price chart basing formations increases the chances of nailing big gains. Here are three ETFs worth getting to know while waiting for the stock market trend to turn bullish again:SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD) holds 42 equal-weighted stocks. A behemoth like Intel (INTC) has roughly the same stake of portfolio assets as smaller but top-notch players such as Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR).The ETF has an average daily trading volume of roughly 172,000 shares. Its IBD RS Rating of 82 means its price performance has surpassed most stocks in IBD's database over the past 12 months.XSD is 7% from a 45.72 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. It consolidated after hitting a 52-week high of 46.48 in June, but has rallied significantly from an interim September low.Last year, XSD pegged a 10% gain.Global X Social Media (SOCL) holds 30 stocks including LinkedIn (LNKD), Facebook (FB) and Tencent Holdings (TCEHY).The ETF has an average daily volume of about 87,000 shares. It has an RS Rating of 81.SOCL is 5% off a 20.74 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. It rallied off its 50-day line in the first and second quarters of 2015, then fell into a long consolidation.Over the full course of 2015, SOCL jumped 10%.IShares U.S. Medical Devices (IHI) targets the niche of medical device manufacturers and distributors. It holds 50 stocks, with the biggest positions in Medtronic (MDT), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO).The ETF trades roughly 88,000 shares a day on average. It has an RS Rating of 79.IHI is 6% from a 127.92 buy point, but sliced through the key 50-day and 200-day support levels amid broad losses on the stock market Monday.In 2015, IHI bagged a 10% gain.

106,MDT,"Exchange traded funds' popularity keeps growing as investors plow money into the popular low-cost vehicles that offer access to a basket of stocks.X And that trend doesn't appear to be waning. The combined assets of U.S. ETFs surged to $3.6 trillion in January, according to the Investment Company Institute, up 38% from a year ago. And the total number of U.S. ETFs rose 7% to 1,853 from January 2017.In the 25 years since the launch of the very first ETF, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), there are now some 2,000 funds available across a variety of categories and styles.To gain further insight into ETFs, their potential benefits and growth outlook, we checked in with Todd Rosenbluth, senior director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. Before CFRA acquired S&P Global in 2016, Rosenbluth was director of ETF and mutual fund research in the U.S. for S&P Capital IQ. His previous experience includes managing editor of Value Line Mutual Fund Survey and financial advisor at Morgan Stanley.The full interview with Rosenbluth, who also discusses current trends in the ETF space, follows:IBD: Should an investor own ETFs, and why?Rosenbluth: Investors who want exposure to the stock or bond market should look to ETFs, which typically provide low-cost exposure to a broad investment category or a narrower thesis with the benefits of diversification and transparency. For example, rather than own just Merck (MRK), investors in Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) or Fidelity MSCI Health Care Index ETF (FHLC) would hold Merck; its peers, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer (PFE); and companies in other related industries, including Medtronic (MDT) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). Unlike in an actively managed mutual fund, investors can see daily what's in an ETF and determine if they think it continues to fit their portfolio.IBD: Are there too many ETFs out there?Rosenbluth: Approximately one-third of CFRA-rated ETFs came to market since March 2015. So we think (that before investing) investors should determine whether an ETF serves a legitimate investing purpose. If so, it's more likely to gain sufficient assets to be viable.Keep in mind that CFRA rates far more mutual funds than ETFs, with several dozen asset managers offering similar-sounding products. Given the sentiment shift toward lower-cost ETFs and away from more expensive mutual funds, CFRA expects more mutual funds to be closed or merged in response.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!IBD: What do you think could fuel further ETF growth — and what could hinder growth?Rosenbluth: Investor and advisor adoption of ETFs designed to support their asset-allocation needs is going to further drive ETF growth. Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) or iShares Core MSCI EAFE (IEFA) are examples of such well-diversified products. As more investors gain comfort with ETFs, money will continue to flow into both established and up-and-coming products.Some investors will always favor the mutual-fund wrapper, wanting active management. To address this, many large asset managers including Davis Funds, Legg Mason, PIMCO and Vanguard offer actively managed ETFs — another area of potential growth.IBD: Even though factor-based ETFs aren't new, ""smart beta"" continues to be a buzzword. What has contributed to the rising popularity of smart-beta funds?Rosenbluth: As actively managed mutual funds struggle to keep up with the returns of the S&P 500 or the MSCI EAFE index, investors are seeking an alternative. Smart-beta ETFs launched in the last three years, including popular Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity (GSLC) and iShares Edge MSCI MultiFactor USA ETF (LRGF), combine factor approaches to offer a diversified yet lower cost approach to quantitative investing.Here again, many large asset managers have expanded their ETF presence using smart-beta products in response to growing demand. In the last six months, JPMorgan U.S. Minimum Volatility (JMIN), Oppenheimer Russell 1000 Low Volatility Factor (OVOL) and USAA MSCI USA Value Momentum Blend Index ETF (ULVM) have launched. All of these are covered by CFRA Research.IBD: ESG (environmental, social and governance) funds have been in the news too. Do you think that's a lasting trend?Rosenbluth: ESG mutual fund assets have been quite sticky, even as many actively managed mutual funds slowly bleed assets in favor of index-based ETFs. We expect over time, ESG ETFs will gain traction as investors further embrace ETFs and put money to work focused on the conviction of their values.IBD: Any new trends you're seeing now?Rosenbluth: We're seeing investors look more closely at thematic ETFs. Unlike traditional sector or well-diversified ETFs, these ETFs focus on robotics, blockchain or other potentially long-term investment trends. These more narrowly constructed products — such as Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence (BOTZ), ROBO Global Robotics & Automation Index (ROBO), Reality Shares NASDAQ Nexgen Economy (BLCN) and Innovation Shares NextGen Protocol ETF (KOIN) — tend to charge a premium price relative to market-cap-weighted ETFs, but as more asset managers compete for investor interest, fees have and will continue to move lower.IBD: Which types of ETFs do you expect to outperform as interest rates rise?Rosenbluth: With equity ETFs, CFRA thinks more economically sensitive sectors, including financials and industrials, should benefit if rates rise due to a strong U.S. economy. Vanguard Financials Index ETF (VFH) and iShares Transportation Average (IYT) are a couple of examples.In addition, as interest rates rise, CFRA is focused on bond ETFs with limited interest-rate sensitivity. These low-duration products reduce the downside impact as the Federal Reserve raises rates. IShares 0-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond (SHYG) and SPDR Bloomberg Barclays Short Term High Yield Bond ETF (SJNK) are examples of short-term ETFs rated favorably by CFRA.IBD: Given the Feb. 5 market sell-off and early redemption of VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV), what are your thoughts on VIX-tied volatility ETFs? Are they appropriate for any type of investors?Rosenbluth: VIX-based products are not rated by CFRA as we focus on ETFs that directly hold stocks or bonds and not derivatives. However, investors need to understand that inverse and leveraged ETFs can aggressively move without warning and losses can pile up quickly.IBD: Does XIV's early redemption mean it's harder for investors to manage risk — and if so, how does that affect how the market operates?Rosenbluth: XIV was an exchange traded note, not a traditional ETF as are the other products we've talked about. With ETNs, investors need to understand that there is issuer risk to consider on top of the usual investment risks. With an ETF that shuts down, investors get fair warning and can understand what's inside the portfolio. This helps them track what they will receive if they hold until the product closes. With XIV, the mechanics were much different and the road to closure was much shorter.It's important to note, however, that what happened with XIV was spelled out in its prospectus. So this is less an example of a larger market issue and more an example of why investors need to know exactly what they're getting involved with, particularly with leveraged, inverse and volatility products.IBD: What is a sound strategy for a long-term investor in ETFs?Rosenbluth: Long-term investors should regularly review what's inside the ETFs they're holding to understand how the securities fit going forward. Investors should also periodically rebalance their assets as positions do not move up or down in tandem. You should not necessarily stand still even with passively managed ETFs.IBD: How does CFRA assess ETFs — and how does that differ from other industry researchers?Rosenbluth: CFRA provides a forward-looking rating on more than 1,300 ETFs, combining holdings analysis with fund attributes, including expense ratio and technical analysis. What's inside an ETF and how much it costs is a bigger driver of future returns than its three-year track record or how well it tracks a typically unique index. ETFs that rate favorably to CFRA do so because we have confidence in the valuation and risk considerations of the holdings. We also compare ETFs with one another and separate from mutual funds, as the relevant metrics differ, while others compare active mutual funds trying to beat the S&P 500 with ETFs such as SPDR S&P 500 that seeks to replicate the index.Since our equity ETF ratings launched nearly 10 years ago, under the S&P Global umbrella, our top-rated ETFs have outperformed the S&P 500 index and the bottom-rated ETFs have underperformed.

107,MDT,"The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average undercut their 50-day moving averages but on Friday those two indexes and the Nasdaq composite rallied strongly. Walmart (WMT) sold off as earnings, guidance and online sales were weaker than expected. Hot recent IPO Roku (ROKU) tumbled on its revenue outlook. Home Depot (HD) beat and gave bullish guidance. Fed policymakers seemed slightly hawkish. Rite Aid (RAD) agreed to an Albertsons buyout.X The major averages suffered modest losses through Thursday, closing near session lows several times, while the Dow Jones and S&P 500 index fell back below their 50-day moving averages. But on Friday, all three indexes surged more than 1%, closing the week higher. Walmart (WMT) and Roku were big weekly losers. Treasury yields popped to fresh four-year highs on Fed minutes, but they backed off somewhat.The world's largest retailer reported better-than-expected Q4 sales and same-store sales, but earnings missed estimates. U.S. online sales grew 23%, less than half Q3's 50% annual rise, as Walmart (WMT) struggles to compete with Amazon.com (AMZN). Walmart still sees 40% e-commerce growth this fiscal year. But its earnings guidance was light. Walmart online chief Marc Lore denied a report he might leave the retailer. Walmart said it will roll out a more-upscale home furnishings shopping portal. Walmart stock crashed 10% on Tuesday.Amazon, for its part, reportedly plans to roll out six more cashierless Amazon Go convenience stores after recently opening its first Go store in Seattle to the general public.Federal Reserve policymakers still backed gradual interest rate hikes in 2018 at their Jan. 30-31 meeting. But they see stronger growth prospects in 2018 than they did in December, in part due to the Trump tax cuts. Fed officials see inflation rising to 2% over time. The 10-year Treasury yield, already up sharply this year, rose to fresh four-year highs, pushing stocks lower Wednesday. Meanwhile, existing-home sales posted their biggest annual drop in 3 years, while applications for loan to buy a home tumbled again.Streaming video platform Roku (ROKU) earned an adjusted 6 cents a share on sales of $188.3 million in Q4, vs. expectations for a loss of 11 cents a share on sales of $183 million. But for the current quarter, Roku expects revenue of $125 million, based on the midpoint of its guidance, vs. Wall Street expectations for $130 million. Roku said its active user base rose 44% year over year to 19.3 million in the fourth quarter. Roku stock plunged on weak guidance.Home Depot (HD) reported adjusted earnings per share advanced 17% to $1.69 as sales climbed 7.5% to $23.88 billion. Home Depot expects recent tax cuts will fuel continued growth in the housing sector even as mortgage rates climb. Home Depot expects EPS to jump 28% to $9.31 this year. It's projected to buy back $4 billion in shares. Shares rose fractionally for the week.Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) cut its offer to buy Qualcomm (QCOM) to $79 a share in cash and stock from $82 after Qualcomm raised its bid for NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Broadcom said Qualcomm's revised NXP offer amounted to a transfer of value to NXP shareholders. If Qualcomm's purchase of NXP doesn't go through, Broadcom will pay $82 a share. Broadcom has asked Qualcomm investors to vote for its slate of six nominees to Qualcomm's board at the company's March 6 shareholder meeting.Grocery giant Albertsons, under private ownership for over a decade, announced it would merge with Rite Aid (RAD). The combined company, which will be public will have a value of $24 billion, including debt. The deal comes after Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) gave up on an effort last year to buy all of Rite Aid due to regulatory objections, instead acquiring less than half of the smaller rival's stores. Merger activity is heading up in the sector as pharmacies look to keep market share in the face of growing competition from Amazon (AMZN).The Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 1.6 million barrels vs. the week prior vs. analyst expectations for a 1.9 million barrel increase, while production was steady at 10.27 million barrels per day. U.S. shale firms Parsley Energy (PE), Continental Resources (CLR), Matador Resources (MTDR) and Concho Resources (CXO) see higher production this year as oil prices rebound.Planet Fitness (PLNT) saw EPS climb 20% to 24 cents a share as revenue grew 16% to $134 million. The fitness-chain operator, whose affordable offerings have resonated with casual and first-time gym users, expects full-year sales to increase by roughly 20% and adjusted EPS to grow by about 40%. Planet Fitness also added $80 million to its stock buyback program. Shares rallied 12% on Friday.The two halves of the former Hewlett-Packard reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings. HP Enterprise (HPE), the server, networking equipment and data center gear maker also gave upbeat Q2 guidance, hiked its dividend 50% and boosted its stock buyback program. Printer-and-PC maker HP Inc. (HPQ) also guided higher for Q2 and the full year. HPE and HP Inc. shares jumped Friday.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) came up short on sales, but its stock appeared to be propped up by a report saying that Burger King-parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) was thinking about making a bid. Quarterly same-store sales at Wendy's (WEN) also missed estimates. Jack in the Box (JACK) met expectations, and the company said it had declared a cash dividend of 40 cents per share. Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) was just shy on same-store sales. Wingstop (WING) shares fell Friday on a weak 2018 EPS outlook.MGM Resorts International (MGM) missed Q4 earnings per share estimates, while sales topped, helped by the casino-resort operator's opening of MGM National Harbor in December 2016. But U.S. same-store casino revenue was flat, and MGM sees weaker sales on the Las Vegas Strip in Q1.Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) reported Q4 EPS that beat estimates, revenue that just missed. The cruise line operator forecast Q1 and full-year EPS above views.Stamps.com (STMP) earned $4.30 a share, up 73% from a year ago, on revenue of $132 million, up 25%. Shares jumped 7.7%.Medtronic (MDT) on Tuesday reported adjusted income of $1.17 per share on $7.37 billion in sales, beating expectations.

Copper revenue surged 52% on higher prices and an output boost, while BHP's iron ore division saw 4% growth. The mining giant pushed back against structural changes sought by activist hedge fund Elliott Advisors but boosted its dividend and said it's expediting the sale of its $10 billion in U.S. shale assets.General Mills (GIS) will buy natural cat and dog food maker Blue Buffalo Pet Products (BLUE) for about $8 billion, or $40 a share.Intuit (INTU) earned 35 cents a share in its Q2, beating views by a penny. The Turbo Tax software maker also narrowly exceeded revenue expectations with $1.165 billion. Bur shares fell Friday on weak guidance.OLED technology provider Universal Display (OLED) posted better-than-expected December-quarter results, but shares fell on disappointing sales guidance for 2018. For 2018, Universal Display expects revenue of $350 million to $380 million, vs. analyst expectations for $400 million.Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) offered bullish 2018 EPS guidance of $1.22-$1.28 vs views for $1.20 a share, on sales growth of 11.5%-12.5%, after reporting 33% Q4 profit growth to 16 cents on a 16% sales rise to $1.14 billion.

108,MDT,"Let's say you design cars for a living. Before rushing them out into the world, you'd probably want to test them to see how they handle in real life. You could, if you wanted, build test car after test car, and drive them into the ground until the transmission evaporates. Maybe you'll just keep crashing them into walls, until you've anticipated every possible scenario and, perhaps, destroyed your budget.   X Or, you might do what Ford (F), General Motors (GM), Boeing (BA), Airbus (EADSY) and thousands of businesses worldwide are doing to be more prudent with their time and more precise with their designs: Use software made by a relatively unknown IPO, Altair Engineering (ALTR), to simulate and predict how their products will perform in the real world. Usage of Altair's software seems ever likelier, analysts say, as computing costs fall and an array of products — including from the automakers that drive the bulk of Altair's sales — get smarter. And they say Altair's sales growth is set to outpace that of its rivals, helped by the company's early adoption of the technology, acquisitions and a way of selling products that plays toward engineers' curiosity.""The portfolio of products that we have, it's very well-positioned to support the automotive market in that space as well as the supplier universe,"" Chief Financial Officer Howard Morof told Investors Business Daily. ""That's not just specific to automotive — there are sensors almost everywhere nowadays.""Over the years, Altair's portfolio has helped NASA better predict how a space capsule might fare in a splashdown landing. It has given Medtronic (MDT) more insight into how to design a better stent. It gave Unilever (UL) more clarity into how it could design a better deodorant can for Lynx — better known as Axe, of body-spray fame, in the U.S.As Altair bombards product designs with code rather than the elements, companies with products to test can make better decisions about ways to design products, and save money otherwise spent designing actual, physical prototypes.""They're the editor that says 'Take this chapter out, or move this character there' — that kind of thing,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis said. While Altair came public just two months ago to pay down debt, it entered the stock market as a company that already had a global presence. Founded in 1985, the company over that time has added some 5,000 customers and tens of thousands of users to its name, with 69 offices in 24 nations. Over that time, the pencil drawings on paper or computer that were once the basis of product testing have given way to simulation technology, which Altair Chief Executive James Scapa, at a conference on Wednesday, said could have the ability to ""dictate"" the parameters of design. ""What's happened now is that the physical design is being replaced with simulations,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Nandan Amladi said. ""So you can essentially design the physical object in a simulated environment and do the crash-testing simulation within that environment so that you don't actually have to build the physical prototype until much later on in the process.""And since 1996, Altair has acquired 19 companies or technologies, cramming 11 of them into the past three years, RBC analysts said. Horof said mergers would continue to be a part of its long-term growth strategy. Analysts say Altair could be headed for a stretch of mid-teens annual sales gains, in a roughly $6 billion simulation and analysis software market that has only grown in the high-single digits on overage. That industry-outpacing expansion would also be propelled by the company's unique way of selling its product. In that model, which the company calls a ""units""-based model, a customer receives the company's entire product line — amounting to dozens of applications — and the customers license those units based on how many people will use the software. Historically, Amladi says, software companies have sold a specific set of products. Altair's model encourages broader, more active use, he says. In 2016, RBC notes, the average customer used around 15 of the applications offered by the company. ""If you're an innovative engineer, it's a nice sandbox to play in,"" Amladi told IBD, ""because you can essentially use whatever's suitable.""The company gets most of its sales via HyperWorks, its flagship simulation platform. Altair also has products in the Internet of Things and cloud computing. According to RBC, 48% of Altair's sales in 2016 came from customers in the automotive industry. In one way, that works out in its favor, as Ford and GM pump more money into self-driving cars and electric vehicles.   ""We expect heavy user industries like auto that are at or near cyclical peaks will continue to invest as new initiatives around electric vehicles and autonomous driving motivate more simulation regardless of the economic backdrop of the current business,"" JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty said in the firm's investment thesis on the company.  None of Altair's customers accounted for more than 10% of its billings in 2016. But if the auto industry got sick — U.S. auto sales slipped last year and are expected to do so this year — Altair could catch cold too. As the company builds up its sales force by 10%-15%, execution will become more important. JPMorgan analysts say they're confident in Altair's technology, but cite sales execution as a primary risk to its financial targets for the company.  Other risks include foreign exchange. Altair also competes against some much bigger rivals, like Germany's Siemens (SIEGY) and France's Dassault Systemes, which might have more cushion to discount their software.  Around 60% of Altair's new business comes from existing customers, according to Deutsche Bank. Wall Street could press the company to shift that ratio — toward snapping up new business from new customers — something Amladi said remained an important issue to watch.  As a new issue with only one earnings report under its belt, a few quarters likely are needed for shares to even out. Shares jumped in the three weeks after their debut, but have gotten choppier over the past week, running in the red before climbing back up Thursday. Canaccord's Davis, in his Nov. 27 initiation note on the company, said that despite its potential the stock, which was just under $23 then, was still too expensive. A pullback to below $20, or signs of better growth and profitability within a year or so, could make the company more attractive, he said.  ""As one guy explained to me, being public is like being nibbled to death by ducks,"" Davis told IBD. ""None of the individual investors will kill you, but it's kind of irritating.""Shares of Altair jumped 4.7% to 26.70 in afternoon trading Friday.

109,MDT,"Boston Scientific (BSX) dipped Wednesday after announcing another delay for its heart-valve replacement product, called Lotus Edge — a potential competitor to products from Medtronic (MDT) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT).X By the closing bell on the stock market today, Boston fell 1.7% to finish at 25.95. Abbott lost 0.8% to close at 55.58 while Medtronic dipped 0.4% to end the day at 82.11.Earlier this year, Boston voluntarily recalled the Lotus and Lotus Edge Aortic Valve Systems, citing an issue with the locking mechanism. It had planned to relaunch Lotus Edge in Europe in the first quarter of 2018 and file an application with the Food and Drug Administration in January.Late Tuesday, Boston said it would again delay those plans.""While we are disappointed in this delay to our timelines, we are working carefully to analyze and implement necessary modifications to pass our rigorous internal quality standards,"" Chief Executive Mike Mahoney said in a prepared statement.Although it didn't provide a timeline for when it plans to relaunch in Europe and file in the U.S., Boston said it doesn't expect the delay to have a material impact on fourth-quarter and 2017 guidance. It will provide an update during its fourth-quarter earnings conference call on Feb. 1.Boston's Lotus Edge is a system for replacing a diseased heart value without using open-heart surgery. Abbott and Medtronic also make these devices, called transcatheter aortic heart valve replacements, or TAVR.IBD'S TAKE: Boston has an IBD Composite Rating of 84, meaning it outperforms more than eight in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still lags top leaders with best-possible CRs of 99. Get the names of those leaders by visiting IBD Stock Checkup.Canaccord analyst Jason Mills lowered his worldwide transcatheter aortic heart valve replacement sales model for Boston in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 by $70 million, $114 million, $67 million and $9 million, respectively. He also cut his price target to 35 from 36, but kept his buy rating.Needham analyst Mike Matson estimates the transcatheter aortic heart valve replacement market grew 22% in the third quarter, down from 24% in the prior quarter.For 2017, he expects the market to have grown 25% to $3.4 billion worldwide and 28% year over year to $1.7 billion in the U.S. Next year, Matson calls for the market to grow 18% to $4.1 billion worldwide and 20% in the U.S. to $2 billion.""Boston was expected to be third to market in the U.S. with Lotus Edge,"" he said. ""We think this is still possible, but note that Abbott's Portico TAVR pivotal trial enrollment is completed and we think it could be launched in the U.S. by late 2019.""Matson kept his buy rating and 32 price target on Boston stock.RELATED:Medtronic Surges After Topping Quarterly Earnings Views How These Rivals Could Take A Chunk Of Medtronic's Heart-Unit SalesHow Electricity Could Replace Opioids In Treating Chronic Pain

111,MDT,"Medtronic (MDT) surged to a three-month high Tuesday after the No. 1 medical devices-maker topped fiscal second-quarter earnings views and reported revenue from heart valve replacements grew by more than a third.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Medtronic surged 4.8% to close at 82.66. Meanwhile, shares of Edwards Lifesciences (EW) — Medtronic's key rival in what's known as transcatheter aortic heart-valve replacements — lifted 2.2% to finish the regular trading day at 109.52.For its fiscal second quarter, Medtronic reported adjusted income of $1.07 per share on $7.05 billion in sales. Revenue was in line with Medtronic's pre-announcement and beat views for $6.96 billion. Earnings crushed the consensus for 99 cents.On a year-over-year basis, both metrics declined 4%, Medtronic said in a release. Adjusting for foreign exchange rates, divestitures and the impact of Hurricane Maria, revenue and earnings would have climbed 4% and 5%, respectively.The firm's cardiac and vascular group posted $2.77 billion in sales, up 7%. This was helped by sales of transcatheter aortic heart valves, or TAVR, which grew by a ""high-thirties"" percentage. TAVR is a method of repairing a damaged heart valve without resorting to open-heart surgery.IBD'S TAKE: In the biotech sector, large-caps struggled during the quarter as smaller firms led the way, outperforming expectations. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a breakdown on the quarter.Edwards rivals Medtronic in TAVR. Boston Scientific (BSX) doesn't have a product approved in the U.S., but is expected to re-enter the European market in early 2018 after recalling its product due to problems with its locking mechanism.Minimally invasive and restorative therapies groups split a $55 million to $65 million impact from Hurricane Maria, which bashed Puerto Rico during the quarter. On a comparable basis, sales from those groups grew 2% apiece.The firm reiterated its guidance for constant-currency sales growth of 4%-5% in fiscal 2018, and adjusted profit per share growth of 9%-10%.RELATED:How These Rivals Could Take A Chunk Of Medtronic's Heart-Unit SalesHow Electricity Could Replace Opioids In Treating Chronic PainEdwards Lifesciences Crashes After Heart Valve Sales Miss Lofty Views

112,MDT,"Medtronic (MDT) will overcome Hurricane Maria's impact in fiscal 2018, but the maker of medical devices is expected to face growing competition from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Boston Scientific (BSX) in heart implants, an analyst said Thursday.XIn September, Abbott caught up to Medtronic and Boston, gaining approval for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, or ICD, that allows a patient to undergo an MRI scan if needed. These devices are implanted to help control abnormal heart rhythm.Still, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro says the lower end of Medtronic's full-year forecast in August for 4%-5% sales growth on a constant basis remains realistic. He increased his view for fiscal 2018 to $29.55 billion in sales and adjusted income of $4.74 per share.""The impact of MR-compliant ICDs from Abbott and Boston is another topic of interest as it relates to the second half of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019,"" he said. For Medtronic's fiscal 2019, Novarro forecasts the firm as managing 3% constant-currency growth.Competitive concerns also extend to heart-valve replacements, Novarro said. In early 2018, he sees Boston re-entering the European market with its Lotus Edge product. Boston recalled the device, not approved in the U.S., due to problems with its locking mechanism.IBD'S TAKE: Medtronic has an IBD Composite Rating of 57, meaning it performs in the top half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still falls to No. 54 in the Medical-Products industry group in terms of rankings. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated medtech players.Despite the mounting competition for its cardiac and vascular group, Novarro sees Medtronic as capable of pulling off its full-year guidance.""We expect management to reaffirm guidance for constant-currency revenue growth and refine guidance further on the (fiscal third-quarter) call,"" he said. ""The only possible change in fiscal 2018 earnings per share guidance will be the impact from Hurricane Maria.""On Tuesday, Medtronic is slated to report its fiscal second-quarter earnings. The consensus expects Medtronic to report adjusted income of 99 cents per share on $6.93 billion in sales. The sales view is below the Medtronic pre-announcement on Nov. 8 for $7.05 billion.Hurricane Maria, which battered Puerto Rico in September, is expected to have a $55 million to $65 million impact on Medtronic's second-quarter sales and to trim adjusted profit by 3 cents. The majority of the impact was on the company's minimally-invasive and restorative-therapies groups.For that reason, Novarro shifted his segment views for Medtronic's second quarter. In the U.S., he sees the diabetes group diving 12% and minimally-invasive therapies losing 1%. He expects flat sales in restorative therapies, partly offset by 4% growth in cardiac and vascular.Internationally, Novarro expects the cardiac and vascular and diabetes groups to grow 8% apiece. He sees the minimally-invasive and restorative-therapies groups growing a respective 6% and 5%. Only the pain-therapies group is expected to decline, by 5%.Medtronic's diabetes group has been plagued recently by a shortage in glucose sensors. Growth in the latter half of fiscal 2018 will come on the backs of new products, Medtronic has said.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Medtronic gained 0.7% to close at 79.26.RELATED:How Electricity Could Replace Opioids In Treating Chronic PainEdwards Lifesciences Crashes After Heart Valve Sales Miss Lofty ViewsDow Component J&J Pops After Topping Views On Pharma Strength

113,MDT,"Medical-device giant Medtronic (MDT) was up in early trading Thursday after it beat fiscal Q2 earnings estimates and raised the low end of its full-year profit guidance.In the quarter ended Oct. 30, Medtronic made $1.03 a share, excluding one-time items. That's up 1% from the year-earlier quarter and 3 cents above analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales totaled $7.06 billion, in line with consensus and up 6% on a pro forma basis, adjusted for the acquisition of Covidien last spring and for foreign-currency headwinds.Medtronic guided full-year EPS at $4.33 to $4.40, raising the low end of its previous range by 3 cents. It affirmed previous guidance of 4% to 6% sales growth. This came despite the fact that Medtronic is expecting a stronger foreign-currency headwind than it did before, taking 45 to 50 cents off full-year EPS.Medtronic stock was up nearly 3% in morning trading in the stock market today, near 78. It's trading within 2% of the all-time high of 79.50 it hit on March 25.""EPS upside (was) driven by slightly better than expected expense control, a lower tax rate, and lower net interest expense,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro in a research note. ""A lower tax rate contributed +$0.02 to EPS while lower net interest expense contributed another +$0.01.""We expect EPS growth to accelerate in fiscal second-half 2016 as cost savings from Covidien kick in. We forecast operating margins of 29%-30% in the second half vs. 27% in the first half.""Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy also saw potential upside from the Covidien integration.""While this underlying operational sales growth guidance falls basically in line with what we believe is the growth trajectory for cardio more broadly — notably Medtronic's primary competitors Boston Scientific (BSX) and St. Jude Medical (STJ) — we do believe this guidance could prove conservative as Medtronic continues to integrate recently acquired Covidien and potentially recognizes sales synergies, though it may be too early, with potentially more to come in fiscal 2017 and beyond.""Antalffy added that strong sales in Medtronic's Coronary & Structural Heart division indicated that the market for transcatheter aortic valve replacements is growing faster than expected, which bodes well for Edwards Lifesciences (EW), Medtronic's lone competitor in that field.Edwards stock, though, was down nearly 1% in morning trading Thursday.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

114,MDT,"Pfizer (PFE) is near a massive deal to buy Allergan (AGN) and redomicile in Ireland, multiple reports said, even as the Treasury Department plans to impose new restrictions on tax inversions.Pfizer are discussing a deal that would pay $370-$380 a share for Botox maker Allergan, Bloomberg and Reuters reported late Wednesday. Allergan rose 4.5% to 310.83 on Wednesday, but retreated after hours following news of the inversion rules. Allergan traded as low as 237.50 on Oct. 21 before Pfizer-Allergan deal buzz picked up. Pfizer rose 1.3% to 33.31 on Wednesday, and was little changed late Wednesday.At $380 a share, it would be a $150 billion takeover, the largest health care deal ever and the biggest takeover of any kind this year.Bloomberg said the companies want to announce a deal as soon as Monday while Reuters said an announcement was not necessarily imminent. Both said that the Treasury's Wednesday announcement to issue ""targeted"" tax inversion guidance later this week could affect the timing of any agreement.By acquiring the Irish drugmaker, Pfizer would be able to limit its exposure to the punitive U.S. corporate tax system. America's corporate rates are the highest in the industrial world and the country taxes U.S. companies' overseas profits when they are repatriated.The Treasury issues restrictions on tax inversions in September 2014. That stopped an AbbVie (ABBV) acquisition, but deals involving Burger King (now Restaurant Brands (QSR), Medtronic (MDT) and Mylan (MYL) went ahead.It's unclear what new limits Treasury will impose, but the Obama administration can't ban inversions outright. In addition to the inversion benefits, Pfizer would beef up its brand-name drugs, and boost its pipeline of treatments in mid- or late-stage trials.Pfizer could use the Allergan deal to lead to a Pfizer breakup into two or three companies.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter @IBD_ECarson and on Facebook.

123,MDT,"Medical-device maker Boston Scientific (BSX) beat analysts' Q3 estimates and raised guidance Wednesday, sending the stock up sharply.Boston Scientific made 24 cents a share in the quarter, excluding one-time items, up 20% from the year-earlier quarter and beating analysts' consensus by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 2% to $1.89 billion, some $27 million above Wall Street's estimate. Excluding the foreign-exchange impact, sales grew 9%.Boston Scientific raised its full-year sales guidance by about $200 million, now $7.47 billion to $7.51 billion, vs. $7.38 billion last year. It raised the low end of its EPS guidance, now 90-92 cents, up from 84 cents last year.

126,MDT,"Edwards Lifesciences (EW) crashed to its lowest point in six months after lagging overly aggressive expectations for its flagship heart valve replacement business, an analyst said Wednesday.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Edwards had plunged 9.6% to finish at 103.33, after earlier falling as much as 11.5% to its lowest point since April. Shares began forming a flat base in July with a buy point at 121.55.During the quarter, Edwards' domestic transcatheter aortic valve replacement, also known as TAVR, sales grew 20.1%, in line with that market. But that fell short of the Street's lofty expectations for what Canaccord analyst Jason Mills called an otherwise ""rock star"" business.TAVR is a method of fixing a narrowed or hardened heart valve without resorting to open-heart surgery. In the quarter, Edwards' transcatheter heart valve therapy unit brought in $481.2 million in sales, up 17.3%, with $311.6 million of that from the U.S. The consensus had modeled $316 million in domestic sales.""We think management's commentary insinuated that while the U.S. market remains strong, the market is beginning to incur the inevitability of the 'law of larger numbers,' "" Mills said in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Keep up with earnings season by bookmarking Your Weekly Review for a quick rundown of which companies reported and how their stocks are moving.The attempt to rein in expectations for 2018 is a prudent move, he said. Analysts became overly aggressive in their TAVR predictions. Boston Scientific (BSX) looks to enter the U.S. market soon and Medtronic (MDT) is increasing access to more patients, which could create some headwinds for Edwards in 2018.But Edwards retained its guidance for 2017, which implies U.S. TAVR growth of 15% to 17% in the fourth quarter, Mills said. He expects the Street to recalibrate its expectations.""That said, we remain bullish about the market's potential, the (total addressable market), the relative underpenetration, and the potential for Edwards' growth reacceleration along with low-risk approval,"" he wrote.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro says conversations with investors suggest the Street would have been happier with $320 million in domestic TAVR sales. Growth in the third quarter slowed again (to 20.1%) from 38% in the first quarter and 28% in the second quarter, he wrote in a note to clients.Edwards is targeting a $5 billion-plus opportunity in this segment by 2021. Novarro expects more clarity on 2018 guidance to be given during Edwards' investor day in December.""While a midteens sales (compound annual growth rate) is sufficient between 2018 and 2021 for achieving Edwards' (transcatheter heart valve therapy) sales forecast for more than $5 billion by 2021, we believe a higher growth rate will be necessary for Edwards shares to maintain a healthy premium to large-cap medtech peers,"" he said.RELATED:Edwards Topples On Third-Quarter Misses, Soft GuidanceCould GlaxoSmithKline Scoop Up Pfizer's Over-The-Counter Unit?Biogen Dives Despite Topping Views; Lilly, Novartis Beat
"
127,MDT,"It was nearly 13 years ago that Lori Swearingen changed her life forever after a fall on the job — and it took a decade for her to discover what it was like to be relatively pain-free again.A Reno, Nev., firefighter at the time, Swearingen was helping guide a rig back down an icy hill on New Year's Eve 2004. When she slipped and landed on her backside, she was the only woman in the crew.""I got right back up, shook it off and kept going,"" she recalls.But Swearingen soon began experiencing pelvic pain radiating into her lower back that affected her daily for another decade. No one thought to check her tailbone which, as it turns out, had been fractured. After a number of surgeries and drugs failed to relieve the mind-numbing pain, she discovered the answer: an implantable device called a neuromodulator.XSuch implants are now part of a big business that could well someday do the job of opioids and other medications for treating pain. All told, it's estimated to be a $3.9 billion total addressable market this year, Needham analyst Mike Matson wrote in a recent note to clients.Matson expects the neuromodulation market to grow in the upper-single digit range for the next few years. The leader in the space is Medtronic (MDT) with 52.3% of the market, while Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Boston Scientific (BSX) are on its heels, Matson says.And competition is mounting. Matson estimates that Medtronic's neuromodulation sales were down 6% in its fiscal first quarter, reported in August, to about $416 million, short of his original forecast. (Medtronic doesn't break out its neuromodulation sales.) Meanwhile, companies like Nevro (NVRO) and LivaNova (LIVN) are swiping share.Neuromodulation, also called neurostimulation, has been around for decades. It's only been in recent years, though, that the techniques have become less ""crude,"" says Dr. Mark Malone, founder of Advanced Pain Care in Austin, Texas. Malone, who uses one of the devices himself as a patient, sees neuromodulation becoming mainstream in coming years.""In the last 18 months or so, a new generation has come out including (Abbott's) Burst and Dorsal Root Ganglion,"" Malone told Investor's Business Daily. ""These two techniques are far more effective and it's really an amazing revolution. For the first time ever, we've been able to say things like 'cure chronic pain.'""Neuromodulation essentially tricks the brain into thinking a region of the body is no longer in pain, says Dr. Allen Burton, Abbott's medical director for neuromodulation, movement disorders and pain. The modern iteration is the result of a better understanding of the nervous system.""This is the application of electrical energy in the nervous system to quiet down pain impulses,"" he told IBD. ""It's more of a language. You're speaking to the nervous system in the language of the nervous system and telling the brain the pain is no longer important.""Burton explains the difference in old vs. new technology in terms of a hammer. When you hammer a nail and miss, hitting your thumb, you rub the thumb to dull the pain. That introduces a new sensory signal, thereby blocking the pain signal. It's called tonic stimulation.With the new technology, neuromodulation has adopted the electrical signals of the nervous system. Abbott uses what it calls BurstDR and Dorsal Root Ganglion stimulation, the latter of which treats a mysterious pain condition called complex regional pain syndrome.Boston's Precision Spectra System, Precision Novi and Precision Montage MRI products use software called Illumina 3D to treat chronic pain, including complex regional pain syndrome and failed back surgery syndrome.For patients like Swearingen, it's not the specific device maker that matters — though she did a lot of research before settling on a device from Boston Scientific — it's the pain relief.Swearingen had her tailbone removed several years after the incident, plus an appendectomy, a partial hysterectomy and back surgery — all in an effort to ease the pain in her pelvis. None of it helped.She worked for another few years, staving off the pain on a cocktail of opioids, antidepressants, epidurals, radio-frequency ablation and acupuncture. Sometimes Swearingen worked in emergency medical, other times she went back on the fire line, pain permitting. After eight years, Swearingen finally took a medical retirement.IBD'S TAKE: The 119-company Medical-Products industry group is now ranked No. 23 out of 197 groups tracked. It's led by Align Technology, which has a best-possible Composite Rating of 99, meaning it performs in the top 1% of all stocks. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other strong medtech players.""I met with a psychologist to learn coping skills and techniques for my family to not focus on my pain,"" she told IBD. ""I was pretty depressed. I was gaining weight because I had a very physical job and a very physical lifestyle. I was kind of circling that depression drain.""Two years later, she discovered the neuromodulator.After retiring from firefighting, Swearingen moved to Seattle, where she began seeing a pain management doctor. Her doctor's office featured a poster on neuromodulation. Swearingen says she didn't know anything about the devices when she first saw the poster.""I thought maybe it was a delivery system for drugs,"" she said. ""Then I realized those were leads going up my spinal cord and I thought, 'Oh, heck no.' I spent two years looking at that poster.""Physicians are looking at neuromodulation as a first step to treat some forms of chronic pain — often in the back — replacing doctors' penchant for prescribing an addictive course of opioids. Opioids are a huge drug market, projected to reach $17.7 billion by 2021 in the U.S. alone.Opioids are also tied to major unintended consequences, including addiction and dependence, often leading to overdoses. There's also a major black market for opioids, which has created somewhat of a stigma for patients seeking pain treatment, Malone says.""Doctors question the motives,"" he said. ""It's a mess out there. All of that on top of the current opioid crisis on the news every day. So it's really an amazing gift that we suddenly have this treatment that's so effective for even the worst pain patients and it's completely drug free.""Malone has had his own neuromodulator for more than six months. Before his implant, he was on disability for a year and had worked part-time for several years following a back injury. When he saw the success of 80%-100% in his own patients, he had his medical-practice partner implant an Abbott device.The difference was night and day. Malone gets choked up talking about it. His relief is near 100%.""I can tell patients I've been through it, it's very real,"" he said. ""Even my own wife was wondering, 'Has he given up? He doesn't want to work anymore.' I was just laying in bed day after day. The pain is real.""During the trial period, a temporary device is implanted under sedation and attached to an external battery taped to the skin. The patient can use a remote control to flick through different signal settings and strength, Malone said. Abbott's Burton estimates that nine in 10 opt for the permanent implant.Neuromodulators differ from opioids in that they are completely drug-free and reversible. Before they are implanted, a patient learns the potential risks and benefits. And the patient has a unique chance to try out the device before going the permanent — though still reversible — route, Burton said.""One of the big problems with opioids is people are often initiated without much talk about the risks and benefits,"" he said. ""The first prescription comes from the ER for a pain pill, a short, low dose. But as the pain becomes chronic and doesn't turn around or heal up, suddenly the patient becomes resistant.""What started as a traumatic injury often leads to a chronic pain problem, and the need for sleeping meds and/or antidepressants, he said. Now, a patient who never before needed medications is on three or four of them, all of which interact with one another.Electricity isn't addictive, Burton said. And there's no euphoric side effect.Still, neuromodulation isn't the end-all answer for every type of pain. It has its limitations. The most notable uses are in chronic back pain including complex regional pain syndrome and failed back surgery syndrome. But it wouldn't work in widespread pain like fibromyalgia.The lion's share of Malone's patients are those who've gone ahead with back surgery and attained no relief. But Needham's Matson says there's also a market for neuromodulation in Parkinson's disease, essential tremors, incontinence, epilepsy, depression, migraines and obesity.Still, neuromodulation remains the best, accidental secret in the pain community. Interventional pain management is a new specialty, Malone says. Most neurosurgeons and orthopedists aren't aware of it.For Swearingen, she was finally persuaded to give neuromodulation a shot after attending a patient seminar and doing exhaustive research on her own part — a recommendation she would give to anyone considering an implant. Indeed, days into her trial implant, she was ready for the permanent device.Today, she's back in the gym, strengthening her core and has lost the weight she gained due to immobility. She rides her bicycle and horses, and lifts hay bales on her property in Seattle. Walking to the mailbox is no longer a daunting prospect, she said.""In the last couple of years, my husband says, 'I have my Lors back,' "" she said. ""And I am back.""Meanwhile Swearingen is left to wonder if she could have stayed on at the firehouse.""I will never know that. There would be a possibility, but I'm 54 now. I retired on medical and at this point I don't care to (return to work),"" she said. Instead, she's focused on the positive.""This was life-changing for me, for my family, for everyone around me,"" she said.RELATED:Abbott Zeros In On A 2-Year High After Topping Q2 Sales, ProfitsThis Drug Bellwether's Sales Miss Actually Bodes Well For The SectorMedtronic Sinks After Sales Lag, Though Earnings Beat Views

150,MDT,"Medtronic (MDT) stock plunged to a nine-month low Tuesday after the medical device maker reported fiscal Q2 sales that missed Wall Street views — though earnings topped by a penny — and lowered its 2017 guidance.Medtronic stock closed down 8.7% at 73.60. Heart valve rival Edwards Lifesciences (EW) saw its shares tumble 4.7% to 85.04, an eight-month low.For its fiscal Q2 ended Oct. 28, Medtronic reported $7.35 billion in sales, missing analysts' views for $7.46 billion, up 4% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Medtronic's $1.12 earnings per share ex items were up 8.7%.""Q2 revenue was disappointing and did not meet our expectations,"" Medtronic CEO Omar Ishrak said in the earnings release. ""We faced issues that affected our growth, including slower than expected revenue as we await new product introductions, particularly in CVG and diabetes.""IBD'S TAKE: Medtronic stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 50, meaning it performs in the middle of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Who's a better bet? Dig into IBD's Stock Checkup for more.Revenue for Medtronic's cardiac and vascular group (CVG) rose 4%, mainly on growth following the acquisition of HeartWare and growth in the aortic and peripheral vascular (APV) division. But sales from the coronary and structural heart (CSH) division were flat.The minimally invasive therapies group (MITG) grew 5%, largely due to 5% growth in surgical solutions. But that growth was partially offset in the U.S. by competitive pressure in reprocessing advanced energy tools and by timing issues in the Middle East.Medtronic slashed its 2017 guidance to mid-single-digit revenue growth vs. earlier views for higher-single-digit growth. The company now expects a $20 million to $60 million sales hit, assuming exchange rates remain the same.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar noted that Medtronic stock has pulled back recently as customers await new products. Large valves have been approved for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and should help in the second half, he wrote in a research note.Diabetes sales slowed to 3% growth in Q2 as customers await the MiniMed, which is set to launch in early 2017. The MiniMed 670G is the first hybrid closed loop system to get U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval. It automatically adjusts delivery of basal insulin.""All in, this was a disappointing quarter from Medtronic,"" Kumar wrote. ""That said, we think the recent pullback (underperformed by about 7% vs. S&P 500) bakes in some of this.""Kumar kept a buy rating and 94 price target on Medtronic stock.RELATED:Edwards, Medtronic Rebound After Negative Report; Medtech Spiraling

151,MDT,"Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and Medtronic (MDT) stocks rebounded Tuesday after a report suggested a key heart procedure could be deadlier than surgery, but the medical tech sector remains poised for a historically bad quarter, says Evercore.The iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF is up 7.7% for the year, but it dipped 1.1% on Monday after a German study of 5,997 patients treated for aortic stenosis from 2011-13 showed higher death rates for those treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) vs. surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR).At one year, the mortality rate for TAVR patients was 17%, vs. 8.9% in SAVR patients. After adjusting for sickness level and age in patients, the mortality rates were 16% and 11%, respectively.On Monday, shares of Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic toppled 4.9% and 4%, respectively, on the news. The two are alone in the TAVR market. But Edwards Lifesciences rallied 2.7% on Tuesday to close at 88.91, and Medtronic rose 1.9% to 80.27 on the stock market today.IBD's 122-company Medical-Products industry group fell 0.73% Monday and added 1.9% Tuesday. The iShares medtech ETF climbed 2%.IBD'S TAKE: ETFs are a good proxy for broader sectors. Make sure to keep tabs on IBD's ETFs & Funds page for hot — and cold — sectors.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar says the TAVR patients were higher risk and doesn't put much stock into the report, presented at the American Heart Association conference. TAVR is an important, growing area and represents a $2 billion opportunity, he says. By 2021, that's expected to reach $5 billion.""We looked at AHA slides, and we believe that the TAVR patients were a high-risk pool relative to SAVR, and the comparison was apples to oranges,"" he wrote in a research report. ""As such, we do not expect the German registry data to have any impact on TAVR adoption.""That said, the medtech industry is in a downturn. On a relative basis, the iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF is down 9% quarter to date vs. the S&P 500, which Evercore says would be the second-worst quarter since the 2008 financial crisis. Shares ducked 10% in Q3 2010, the worst quarter.Kumar blames uncertainty surrounding the Affordable Care Act following the election of Donald Trump. Trump campaigned on the premise that he would repeal Obamacare, but has since waffled, saying he likes pieces of the law — like the provision against denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions.Prior corrections in medtech were pre-empted by periods of soft volumes and peak pricing pressure. That's not the case this time around, Kumar says. Pricing is currently stable, utilization has been strong, and new products are opening up a number of greenfield opportunities.Rather, ""the correction is implying the ACA goes away,"" he wrote.""We believe that medtech stocks are currently pricing in a (scaling) back in ACA that could lead to volume weakness,"" he wrote. ""As long as there are no new incremental negatives, fundamentally we think stocks are compelling here.""RELATEDZimmer Plunges On Lowered Full-Year Forecast, Weak Q3 SalesEdward Lifesciences Revenue Miss Jolts Investors

153,MDT,"Biotech stocks have nearly ""round-tripped"" their Donald Trump-inspired rally, but RBC analyst Michael Yee sees an upcoming U.S. Food and Drug Administration appointment, and data from Roche (RHHBY) and Biogen (BIIB) acting as catalysts.The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) and SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) exchange-traded funds are down 6.6% and 3.1% following a rally on Trump's election. On Wednesday, Trump dumped water on analysts' theory he would be less likely to go after spiraling drug prices.""I'm going to bring down drug prices,"" he told Time Magazine. ""I don't like what has happened with drug prices.""Trump's commentary sent biotech stocks tumbling on Wednesday. IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group closed down 3.1%. The iShares and S&P Biotech ETFs ended the day down 2.9% and 4%, respectively.After sinking more on Thursday, biotech stocks managed to climb out of the hole on the stock market today, IBD's 421-company biotech group was up fractionally as were the ETFs.IBD'S TAKE: Can biotechs recover from Trump's pledge to curb drug prices? Get the deep dive on IBD's Industry Themes.Yee noted Trump's effect extends far beyond his commentary. Trump has appointed Georgia Rep. Tom Price as his Health and Human Services secretary. Price has said he favors a major overhaul of the Medicare system, and has advocated against the Affordable Care Act.His next appointment, though, could light a fire under biotech stocks, Yee wrote. On deck, Trump is prepping to announce his next commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Media reports target Jim O'Neill and Scott Gottlieb as leading candidates.O'Neill is a former venture capitalist and managing director at Peter Theil's Mithril Capital. He has advocated for relaxing FDA regulations for drug approvals. Gottlieb is a VC partner and practicing physician who has served at the FDA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The decision will follow Congress' approval late Wednesday of a bill to speed up FDA processes.And Trump? His commentary on drug pricing is far from set in stone, Yee wrote in a research note. He notes the Republican Congress next year is unlikely to break from conservative dogma to work on easing drug prices.""Despite the worries about Trump mentioning drug pricing, we'd remind investors that he has said a lot of things over the past year and seems to negotiate in the public eye but hasn't necessarily been truly perceived to actually want to do a lot of them,"" Yee wrote.Outside Trump, biotechs have suffered industry-specific injuries including Eli Lilly (LLY) missing key Alzheimer's data, and lagging Q3 metrics from Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) and Medtronic (MDT), Yee wrote. But Biogen and Roche have upcoming data that could help the industry.Biogen has phase 1 and 2 data for Alzheimer's drug aducanumab due Friday. Roche's phase 3 hemophilia data is due ""imminently,"" Yee said. The Prescription Drug Free User (PDUFA) is due Dec. 28 for Roche's multiple sclerosis drug ocrelizumab. And Regeneron (REGN) rival Ophthotech (OPHT) has phase 3 data coming soon.Meanwhile, M&A looks imminent for the sector. Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) is in talks to buy European biotech Actelion. Sanofi (SNY) is rumored to have informal interest in Actelion, insiders say. M&A could pull generalist investors back into the space, Yee wrote.There's a ""perception of no major near-term catalysts in biotech other than 'it's cheap' and we need much more M&A to get the stocks rallying again,"" he wrote.RELATEDCould Trump Tax Cut Plans, Republican Congress Spur Biotech M&A?Could Trump 'Make Drug Development Great Again'?

This plan would indeed spur companies to bring back overseas cash, says Goldman Sachs.In 2017, for only the second time in 20 years, stockrepurchases will account for the largest share of cash used by S&P 500 companies, forecasts Goldman Sachs.

157,MDT,"Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and other technology companies could gain from President-elect Donald Trump's support of a one-time repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas — if the idea gets enacted by a still-Republican-held Congress.Trump has proposed a 10% repatriation tax on profits of U.S. corporate foreign subsidiaries, down from the statutory 35%. The top five overseas cash holders are Apple, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco and Oracle (ORCL).Trump's cash repatriation proposal ""could bring a flood of money back into the U.S. that would be available for dividends, share buybacks and possibly for capital investments,"" said Kevin Logan, an HSBC economist, in a research report. ""The tax revenue raised could be used to fund an infrastructure spending program, something that was advocated by both candidates during the presidential campaign.""Moody's Investor Service says Apple is on track to have $230 billion in overseas cash by the end of 2016, followed by Microsoft at $113 billion, Cisco at $62 billion, Oracle at $52 billion and Google at $49 billion. It projects that the top five will have $505 billion overseas by year-end, or 86% of their total cash, up from $441 billion in 2015.""We expect most companies would take advantage of a hypothetical tax reduction on permanently repatriated moneys to the maximum extent possible, but the devil is always in the details,"" Moody's analyst Richard Lane told IBD via email. "" Nevertheless, a hypothetical 10% tax on the $1.3 trillion offshore that we project for 2016 translates into $130 billion in tax revenue that could be invested in efficiency enhancing, domestic infrastructure investments.""More important than temporary, one-time tax relief, however, would be permanent tax reform that provides companies clarity to make long-term capital allocation decisions.""Trump has also proposed reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15%, down from 35%, in an effort to keep companies from leaving for countries with lower rates.""Given the Republican control, there is a possibility of some tax relief to incent companies to bring foreign cash back to the U.S. offering an opportunity for them to invest, buyback stock and acquire assets,"" Abhey Lamba, a Mizuho Securities analyst, said in a report.Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst, says a Republican-controlled House and U.S. Senate ""is not likely to block"" the 10% cash repatriation proposal. Republicans kept a narrow lead in the Senate and maintained a solid advantage in the House.Pritchard says Adobe Systems (ADBE), Autodesk (ADSK), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Red Hat (RHT) and VMware (VMW) are among companies that could bring back cash.""We believe the chances increase of a larger share repurchase or (lesser chance) dividend from these companies,"" Pritchard said in a research report.The biotechs with sizable overseas holdings include Amgen (AMGN), Medtronic (MDT) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), says a UBS research report. It says other companies with lots of overseas cash include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Coca-Cola (KO).""While the specifics would depend on the ultimate legislation, we would expect that a significant amount of the overseas cash balances (perhaps 75% or greater) would be repatriated and used to continue to repurchase shares and pay dividends, but also to increase the pace of M&A and growth capex, of which the latter has been a missing component in the current cycle,"" UBS analyst Julian Emanuel said in the report.Among big tech stocks, Oracle was up 1.1% to 39.55 and Cisco added 1.2% to 31.36 at the close on the stock market today.

159,MDT,"Medical device maker Medtronic (MDT) has won approval for the U.S.'s first artificial pancreas that can automatically monitor patients' blood sugar and supply insulin as needed, it was reported Wednesday.The Food and Drug Administration cleared the device, called MiniMed 670G, for patients with Type 1 diabetes who are at least 14 years old. The decision came months sooner than investors expected and without an advisory panel review that precedes the introduction of many innovative products. The device measures blood sugar, or glucose, levels every five minutes and withholds or supplies insulin based on the results, the agency said in a prepared statement.The news didn't seem to affect Medtronic shares much, as the stock ticked up only 7 cents to close at 86.74. But shares of rival DexCom (DXCM) tumbled nearly 10% at one point before the stock recovered some of its losses and was off 4.2% to close at 89.84. DexCom makes continuous glucose monitoring systems used by diabetics, and that could be displaced by Medtronic's device.The artificial pancreas allows diabetics to turn over part of their daily routine of glucose tests and insulin injections to an automatic system that can operate without human input. The 670G, which is about the size of a smartphone, wirelessly connects an insulin pump and a glucose monitor.Blood sugar levels are monitored with a sensor that reads just under the skin, the FDA said. A computer algorithm then ensures patients have the right amount of insulin, a hormone that's needed to turn blood sugar into energy.""This first-of-its-kind technology can provide people with type 1 diabetes greater freedom to live their lives without having to consistently and manually monitor baseline glucose levels and administer insulin,"" Jeffrey Shuren, director of FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in the statement.Medtronic said it wouldn't be ready to introduce the MiniMed 670G until the spring of 2017.The device is known as an artificial pancreas because it takes on the responsibilities of the human organ, which is tasked by the body with producing the hormone insulin in precise quantities. While Medtronic previously released a system that could shut off if glucose levels fell too low, it didn't automatically deliver the hormone when blood sugar climbed.The system works without human involvement with the exception of mealtime, when patients need to manually set the device to give them a dose of insulin before eating.

165,MDT,"Boston Scientific (BSX) has agreed to buy EndoChoice Holdings (GI) for about $210 million to expand its endoscopy business, a move that sent EndoChoice's shares soaring in early trades on Tuesday.The purchase price of $8 a share is almost double EndoChoice's closing price of $4.22 as of Monday. EndoChoice shares finished the day at 7.95, a gain of 88.4%.The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, Boston Scientific said Tuesday in a prepared statement. The company is based just outside Boston in Marlborough, Mass. Shares of Boston Scientific were off slightly to 23.57 in recent trades.EndoChoice, based in the Atlanta suburb of Alpharetta, Ga., develops products and services used in the treatment of gastrointestinal conditions, including resection and retrieval devices, needles, graspers and infection-control kits. The company has sales of about $75 million in the 12 months ended June 30, according to the statement.With $8 billion in annual sales, Boston Scientific is one of three major medical device makers, competing with the likes of Medtronic (MDT) and St. Jude Medical (STJ). Medtronic and St. Jude both are trading near all-time highs, though St. Jude is scheduled to be purchased by Abbott Laboratories (ABT) at the end of the year.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific has been climbing back since reaching a low of 4.79 in mid-2012. The stock has been in a flat base since July, and now is trading below its 50-day line. Still, it holds a 98 Composite Rating from IBD, with the highest possible score at 99.

166,MDT,"Investors could toast the third quarter, the strongest of the year, but September alone was about as exciting as a bottle of bubbly that gone's flat.In the third quarter, the S&P 500 rose 3.85%, lifting U.S. diversified stock mutual funds by 4.8% on average. The broad market advanced despite barely breaking even in September, nosing upward a modest 0.02%. Stock funds edged ahead a mere 0.22% last month.That raised stock funds to a 6.38% gain year to date.The stock market's start-and-stop motion in the third quarter has prompted many fund managers to plan ahead by sticking with names driven by strong trends, such as the shift to cloud computing, and with companies that seem capable of grinding out growth no matter how blah growth may be in the broader economy.Click Here To See A List Of IBD Mutual Fund Quarterly Leaders""The first half of the year saw more of a defensive-led rally,"" said Lew Piantedosi, a manager of seven Eaton Vance funds with $3.8 billion in total assets. ""But in Q3 that reversed. Cyclicals like tech and industrials did better.""Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersWorld equity funds advanced 6.42% in Q3, outperforming U.S. diversified stock funds.

In September they racked up a 2.39% return.If cyclical sectors stay hot, then stocks tied to transportation of industrial goods and commodities could continue their third-quarter gains. Piantedosi held Norfolk Southern (NSC), which gained 14% in the third quarter, in his Focused Growth Opportunities Class I (EIFGX) as of July 31.His Tax-Managed Growth 1.1 (EITMX) held Union Pacific (UNP), which rolled to a 12% gain.But what if most cyclicals lose their head of steam? Piantedosi prefers the long view.""I focus on big-picture growth trends that are sustainable despite shifting macro noise,"" he said.Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are sustainable growers.""They benefit from great secular tailwinds,"" he said.

167,MDT,"IShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI) finds itself near highs as most of its holdings participate in the hottest segments of the medical sector this year.Most of the 47 stocks in the fund fall into one of two IBD industry groups: medical products or medical systems and equipment. Both have been in the top 25 of 197 IBD groups for many weeks, and both have the best year-to-date performance among 14 groups that make up the medical sector.Medical systems and equipment is up about 20% as a group, while the medical products group has climbed some 15%. Since the market low of June, however, biotechs and generic-drug stocks have made much stronger gains. Still, the medical equipment subset is up 18% in that period and the products group is up 15% -- better than nearly all other health care groups.You won't find any pharmaceutical companies in iShares U.S. Medical Devices, but rather companies that provide the tools to develop drugs and to help patients deal with medical problems. Indeed, the companies' product offerings span from syringes, to heart valves, to robotic surgical systems.The ETF -- which itself is up more than 17% in 2016 -- is trying to break out past the 145.85 buy point of a flat base. If it can hold above the 50-day moving average, there's a better chance of rising past the entry. Shares had their best run of 2016 from February to early August.The ETF's chart closely resembles that of its largest holding, Medtronic (MDT). The stock has been forming a shallow base and is near new highs. Among its many products, Medtronic makes insulin pumps, ear infection treatments, coronary stents and brain-stimulus devices to treat nervous-system disorders.Thermo Fischer Scientific (TMO), the fund's second-largest holding, rallied for most of September and also is nearing new highs. The company, which is in the research equipment and services industry group, makes medical research instruments.On Sept. 19, it completed its $4.2 billion acquisition of FEI, a maker of high-performance microscopes. Acquisitions have been part of the story in the medical devices industry, though not always resulting in stock gains.Danaher (DHR) has been a drag on the portfolio. The stock was basing nicely near highs in August but started tumbling with the Sept. 6 announcement that it is acquiring Cepheid (CPHD), which makes a system for fast genetic testing, for $4 billion.Abbott Laboratories (ABT), with nearly an 8% weighting in the ETF, also hasn't been much of a contributor. Shares remain locked in a 14-month-old consolidation.IShares U.S. Medical Devices has an average annual return of 20.35% over three years and 20.81% over five years.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

168,MDT,"Shares of medical-device maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) popped Thursday afternoon after the FDA granted an expanded indication for its leading product that could boost its market by 50%.The agency approved the Sapien 3 and Sapien XT transcatheter aortic valve replacements (TAVR) for patients with ""intermediate risk"" of death or complications from open-heart surgery. The valves, which can be implanted via catheter through a small incision in the patient's groin, were previously approved only for patients at high risk.The approval had been expected since early April, when the results of a large clinical trial of the intermediate-risk population drove the stock up 17% in one day. The results showed a significantly lower rate of death and stroke among patients who received the valve by the TAVR method compared to the surgical method.The TAVR line already accounts for more than half of Edwards' revenue and has been fueling its growth, as well as its rise on the stock market. In his June 8 initiation report on Edwards, Guggenheim analyst Chris Pasquale wrote that the intermediate-risk approval would increase the addressable U.S. market by half. It would also give Edwards an edge over its rival Medtronic (MDT), whose CoreValve TAVR's intermediate risk data isn't due until next year.Edwards stock closed 2% higher in the stock market today, to 114.95, a record closing high. Edwards stock hit its record high, 117.46, late last month. Medtronic stock was down a fraction.IBD'S TAKE: With its highest-possible Composite Rating of 99, Edwards Lifesciences is a longtime resident of the IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks. It's also a regular on the IBD Big Cap 20 growth stocks selected for added stability.

Meanwhile, St. Jude Medical (STJ) tumbled after a claim that its products could be hacked.Medtronic's fiscal Q1 profit of $1.03 a share beat consensus by 2 cents, and was up slightly from the year-earlier quarter, but revenue was a bit below expectations and down 1% from the prior year.Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy wrote before the market opened that this probably wouldn't help the stock, because expectations were high going in after peers like Boston Scientific (BSX), St. Jude Medical and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) all reported strong quarters.""Operating margins -- a key metric upon which Medtronic has underperformed in the past -- again missed Street expectations, coming in 40 basis points below consensus and 10 basis points below us,"" Antalffy wrote in a research note.IBD'S TAKE: Medtronic is in a strong group, Medical Products, currently No. 19 out of 197 in Industry Group Rank. But within the group, Medtronic ranks just No. 34, with smaller, upstart Abiomed taking the top spot.RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro wrote that the Cardiac & Vascular Group, which he thought might outperform, was showing signs of competitive pressure.""Medtronic's cardiac resynchronization therapy devices continued to outperform the market with new entrants in the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (Evera MRI in U.S.) and pacemaker (Micra TPS) segments, but it appears that share gains are slowing given recent launches by Boston Scientific,"" Novarro wrote in a research note. ""Medtronic's CoreValve Evolut R is benefiting from strong procedure growth, but Medtronic's performance in the quarter suggests lost share to Edwards.""Antalffy added, however, that Medtronic's longer-term record is solid.""With now seven consecutive quarters of mid- to high-single-digit sales growth on a constant currency basis ... Medtronic continues to build a consistent track record for at-or-above market growth,"" she wrote.Medtronic stock fell 1.5% to close at 85.39 on the stock market today. It was headed toward the sell zone after dropping out of a flat base it had formed since hitting a lifetime high on July 15.Separately, St. Jude Medical fell 5% to 77.82 after short-seller Muddy Waters said St. Jude's ICDs and CRTs (cardiac resynchronization therapy devices) are at risk of cyberattacks.

172,MDT,"There are times in the life of every medical-device company when a single Food and Drug Administration ruling will have a pivotal impact on its future. Edwards Lifesciences recently got one such decision.The ruling came Thursday regarding Sapien 3, Edwards' (EW) transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR. It's an artificial valve implanted in patients with aortic stenosis, a disease brought about when the real valve starts to malfunction due to calcification. And the FDA's decision means it would instantly increase the potential market for its leading product by half.What makes Sapien different from other valves is the ""transcatheter"" part.Traditionally, aortic valves had to be replaced by, in medical vernacular, ""cracking the chest."" Not surprisingly, that's pretty traumatic to the patient, and especially risky when you're talking about an elderly population suffering from heart disease. A TAVR can be delivered by catheter through a small hole in the groin, making it much less of a shock.""In less than a decade since the first commercial TAVR cases were performed in Europe in 2007, the technology has proved not only to be an invaluable option for patients too sick or frail to undergo open heart surgery, but also a superior treatment strategy in a large swath of the traditional surgical population,"" wrote Guggenheim analyst Chris Pasquale in his June 9 initiation report on Edwards.However, the FDA and heart surgeons are naturally cautious about new technologies, given that you don't mess with a vital organ lightly. So when the first-generation Sapien was approved in the U.S. in 2011, it was only for patients at the highest risk of death from surgery. To expand to other patients, Edwards has had to conduct large clinical trials for each segment of the population to prove that Sapien's benefits outweigh the risks.In April, Edwards demonstrated exactly that through its 2,000-person study of patients with ""intermediate risk"" of complications from surgery. Within 30 days of the procedure, 1.1% of patients treated with TAVR died compared with 4% of patients who'd received surgical valve replacement. After a year, the death rate was 7.4% in the TAVR group and 13% in the surgery group. A similar contrast appeared in the prevalence of stroke.Investors knew what this meant: Edwards' stock leaped almost 17% the day after the news hit.""(The) clinical data presentations represent a 'best case' scenario for Sapien and the broader TAVR market,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro in a research note at the time. ""The key debate will be on whether the FDA accelerates the approval timeline for an intermediate-risk label.""As it turned out, the FDA approved the indication this past Thursday, in line with management's recent guidance that it would come sometime during the third quarter. In a statement, Edwards called it a ""major milestone."" Shares rose 2% Thursday and another 1.3% in early Friday trading.The timing is significant not only because it helps Edwards' near-term financials, but also its competitive position. The only other TAVR player on the market is Medtronic (MDT), through its acquisition of CoreValve in 2009.CoreValve and Sapien both hit the European market in 2007, but Medtronic has lagged a bit behind Edwards in the U.S. timeline, getting CoreValve approved in January 2014. That was more than two years after Sapien.Medtronic also is conducting a trial of intermediate-risk patients, but results aren't due until next year.""While we expect some off-label use of CoreValve in intermediate risk patients once the Sapien label is expanded, penetration into this population is likely to accrue disproportionately to Edwards until Medtronic's SURTAVI trial reads out in 2017,"" analyst Pasquale wrote in his report.The stakes are big. There are 1.8 million aortic-stenosis sufferers in the U.S. alone, and as Sapien and CoreValve have grown, analysts have been seeing them not just displace surgeries but increase demand for aortic replacements in general. With every quarterly report, estimates of the overall TAVR market size go up.IBD'S TAKE: Edwards Lifesciences is one of the top-rated stocks on IBD's Leaderboard. Check here to find out when it's in a buying range.""To us, better-than-expected growth for now nine quarters in a row despite ramping competition both in the U.S. and Europe signifies that: (1) The TAVR market is clearly growing seemingly sustainably faster than expected, which we now expect to exceed $5.3 billion by 2021 (+22% over the 2015-2021 time frame); and (2) Edwards' Sapien 3 is best-in-class, particularly now with data demonstrating overwhelming superiority vs. surgery in intermediate-risk patients,"" Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy wrote in a research note after Edwards' second-quarter report on July 27.The quarterly report pushed the stock to another new high, as revenue and earnings growth accelerated over the last three quarters. Earnings rose 33% over the year-earlier quarter to 76 cents a share, while sales were up 23% to $759 million. The strong financials and stock performance have kept Edwards a constant presence in the IBD 50 and the Big Cap 20 over the last few months.While the TAVR line was the growth driver, and now accounts for more than half of revenue, Edwards is continuing work in other heart-related devices. On Aug. 15 it rolled out its new Intuity Elite valve system, one of a number of products it makes for traditional surgical valve replacement.""We believe surgery will continue to have a vital role for patients even as TAVR expands,"" Edwards spokeswoman Heather Chambers told Investor's Business Daily in an email. ""There will be patients, including younger patients and patients with complex needs, who will continue to be well-served by surgery.""Chambers added that there are lots of other structural heart defects for which surgery is the best option.Some of those other defects are also ripe for the minimally-invasive approach. Transcatheter mitral-valve replacement (TMVR) has lately become a hot area in the cardiac device field, with Medtronic, Boston Scientific (BSX) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) all working on devices. Edwards has been developing an in-house TMVR called Fortis, but last year added to the program by acquiring privately held CardiAQ Valve Technologies for $350 million.""TMVR could turn out to be an even bigger opportunity than TAVR, given the higher prevalence of mitral regurgitation in the population and challenges treating many of these patients surgically,"" Pasquale wrote in his report.He added: ""Many questions remain unanswered, however, including which treatment strategy is optimal (repair or replacement), which disease morphology will benefit most from a transcatheter approach (degenerative or functional), and how prospective clinical studies should be designed to evaluate new technologies.""

188,MDT,"The United States doesn't necessarily have to choose between larger budget deficits and fixing an onerous corporate tax system that's out of step with the rest of the world.
"
189,MDT,"In the 1970s, economist Arthur Laffer famously put forward the proposition that tax rates can be so high they choke off economic activity and actually reduce revenue. If so, lowering rates will raise tax receipts. This could very well be the case for U.S. corporate taxes.
"
190,MDT,"In 2007, American Enterprise Institute economists Kevin Hassett and Alex Brill determined the tax-revenue-maximizing top U.S. corporate rate went from 34% in the late 1980s to 26.7% in 2005.
"
191,MDT,"Reasons for the decline: increasing international mobility of capital and other countries' cuts in corporate tax rates.

192,MDT,"Other countries have kept on cutting their corporate tax rates since 2005, so the revenue-maximizing rate has probably come down a few percentage points since then. But we'll stick with Hassett and Brill's 26.7% and see where it takes us.
"
193,MDT,"For the U.S., going down to the revenue-maximizing rate would add about a third to corporate tax receipts. Why? Lower taxes reduce the incentives for moving abroad and stashing profits overseas.

194,MDT,"More important, it would encourage both American and foreign companies to expand and invest in the United States, raising overall economic growth, corporate earnings and tax receipts.
"
195,MDT,"Sound too good to be true? The Tax Foundation's William McBride took a look at Canada. From 1988-2000, with the top rate at 43%, corporate tax revenues averaged 2.9% of GDP.

196,MDT,"Since 2000, as the country reduced rates to 26%, corporate tax revenues rose to 3.3% of GDP. By comparison, the high U.S. corporate tax rates have yielded average revenues of just 2.3% of GDP.
"
197,MDT,"Cutting U.S. corporate tax rates would raise both before- and after-tax earnings — good news for companies and their shareholders.
"
198,MDT,"The before-tax kick comes from greater incentives to do business in the U.S., so we'd see more companies stay home, more transplants from overseas, more new businesses, more investment from both domestic and foreign sources, and more economic growth — all leading to higher corporate revenues and profits.

199,MDT,"After-tax gains are more direct: For every $100 in profits, firms would now keep $73 rather than $61. Stock price gains will depend on several factors — including how much actual tax relief U.S. companies get and whether other countries respond with more tax cuts. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest the market gains could be substantial in going from today's high rates to 26.7% or even lower.
"
200,MDT,"With corporate tax rates closer to the worldwide norm, the U.S. will find it easier to change another flaw in its corporate tax system.

205,MDT," Alm is writer in residence at the Center.Countries worldwide have cut their corporate tax rates in the past two decades. Germany lowered its top rate to 29.6% from 59.7% in 1993. Canada went from 44.3% to 26%, Ireland from 40% to 12.5%. The average top rate for 34 non-U.S. countries went from 36.9% in 1993 to 25.1% in 2014.The United States has bucked the trend, stubbornly clinging to a top rate of slightly more than 39% — 35% at the federal level, plus an average 4.1% for states.The Tax Foundation scoured 163 countries, finding only two with top corporate tax burdens higher than the U.S. — the United Arab Emirates (55%) and Chad (40%).Adopting Global NormsLowering U.S. corporate tax rates to the global norm — further, if politically feasible — would no doubt benefit our companies and investors. Moving the U.S. into the global mainstream on corporate taxes might even hold out a carrot for the political class — more corporate tax revenues.High U.S. corporate tax rates make no sense in an increasingly global economy. High rates don't raise the revenue they once did — an estimated 11.1% of all receipts in this fiscal year, down from 19.6% in 1969. Even worse, high rates encourage tax-driven tactics and strategies that weaken the U.S. economy.We've seen companies move jobs and operations to countries with lower tax rates. We've seen American companies stash nearly $2 trillion in profits overseas to avoid the U.S. tax bite.We've seen companies such as Burger King Worldwide (BKW), Chiquita Brands International (CQB), Medtronic (MDT), AbbVie (ABBV) and Mylan (MYL) announce corporate ""inversions"" — mergers and acquisitions that transfer headquarters overseas.

215,MDT,"Companies always look for an edge. One way to get one: create trust among your team by operating with integrity and a big purpose while serving others, says Larry Julian, author of ""God Is My CEO."" This approach helps motivate people and drives them to succeed.Here's how to do it:• Form bonds.  Bring the organization together around a sense of purpose, says Diane Swanson, a Kansas State University ethics professor. Come up with a common mission, such as serving customers and shareholders, that the entire group can rally around.She points to Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) credo of putting the health of patients and clients first. ""Executives with integrity will be guided by a sense of purpose,"" Swanson told IBD.• Give incentives.  Publicly reward employees who follow the firm's mission. Recognize their work toward employee safety or outstanding service — and back it with action. ""If you're not hiring and promoting people based on integrity, then it's not going to work,"" Swanson said.• See the big picture.  Succeed over the long term by focusing on the group's mission, says Julian, a Minneapolis-based executive coach. ""I know you need to be making money,"" he said. ""But it's also important to have a purpose that transcends the bottom line. That goes to the aspect of people.""• Show the results. Bill George, former CEO of medical device maker Medtronic (MDT), every Christmas brought in people whose lives were changed because of the firm's products. He showed employees how big a difference their efforts made, Julian says. Such a display helped turn around a Medtronic unit that made drug pumps for cerebral palsy patients.• Back it up.  Match your actions to your beliefs. It doesn't do any good to preach the importance of safety yet cut costs on measures that help protect workers.""Watch what (bosses) budget for and who they hire,"" Swanson said. ""Employees are watching for signals that matter.""• Take the blame. Buck the trend and push the credit down to others, but take responsibility for problems. Many managers do the reverse. ""It's important to be able to put yourself in the shoes of other employees,"" Swanson said.• Make it count. Cheryl Bachelder, CEO of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (PLKI), shifted the restaurant operator's focus from serving investors to meeting the needs of franchisees.""That was a tremendous success story,"" Julian said. ""Not only did she help franchisees make money, but that also increased profit.""• Share the wealth. Put power in the hands of your people, Swanson says. They'll take their cues from you to keep the culture in place.""If the CEO is going to model integrity and purpose, there have to be employees watching and learning,"" she said.• Build character. Tony Dungy started his head-coaching career in the National Football League by changing a losing culture when he took over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1996. He went to the team's senior leaders and told them they had to help the young players become the best they could be. He brought in assistant coaches who shared his values: accountability, trust and teamwork.""He said if you want to win championships, you have to focus first on building champions,"" Julian said. ""Then the championships will come."" Three years later, his Bucs had a division title.He then took over the Indianapolis Colts and coached them to win the Super Bowl for the 2006 season.

226,MDT,"In business, it pays to follow the path of least resistance. When consumers demand a product and you don't offer it, you may want to change your strategy.This is what happened with some durable medical equipment (DME) companies whose business model usually focuses on delivering stationary oxygen concentrators and cylinders to patients.The arrival of Inogen's (INGN) portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) on the market changed all that. Not only did the California-based company create lighter, quieter and more efficient products, it also chose to distribute directly to customers, bypassing the DME firms as the ""middleman.""Its POCs work in real-time by removing nitrogen from the air and directly provide oxygen to patients via inhalation. There is no need to have to carry or move around heavy oxygen tanks that only provide a finite amount of oxygen before needing a recharge.Inogen's strategy proved to be a great success. So much so that patients started asking for POCs from conventional DME companies. Despite the initial resistance, DMEs finally came to view offering Inogen's POCs as key to addressing increased demand from customers.All the better for Inogen, which saw sales in the U.S. business-to-business segment jump 86% to $14.5 million for the first nine months of 2014 vs. a year earlier. International B2B sales advanced 35% to $17.4 million.Resellers Ride BrandwagonDomestic B2B growth was mostly driven by resellers who jumped on the opportunity of providing Inogen's POCs via online stores and other means directly to customers. In addition, several DMEs partnered with Inogen to get its products to their client base.""A significant portion of that is really driven by our pull-through demand from consumers,"" said Inogen Chief Financial Officer Alison Bauerlein. ""As we ramped up our direct-to-consumer advertising, we saw significant pull-through in those business-to-business domestic sales, as patients have really started to see us as a brand name and a name that they're requesting from other businesses.""While the B2B area has grown significantly, to Inogen's surprise, the company's direct-to-consumer segment is still the largest revenue contributor at 62% of sales for the first nine months of 2014, which are its first three quarters of the year.Inogen's gross margins have been impressive, 54% for oxygen machine rentals and 48% for sold units in the third quarter.""They are taking share in the home oxygen market,"" said Mike Matson, an analyst at Needham & Co. ""They're offering a more attractive solution to the patient than some of the other companies that are out there. And they've gone direct to the patient, they are marketing through TV ads and magazine ads and Internet sites to try to attract patients that are on Medicare or have insurance — or they'd even be willing to pay for one of these units out of their own pocket.""The U.S. oxygen therapy market opportunity is $3 billion to $4 billion, Inogen says, and it notes that POCs now in use represent less than 5% of that.New Home Oxygen MachineIn October, Inogen released a home oxygen concentrator called the Inogen At Home. It is the lightest five-liter-per-minute continuous-flow oxygen concentrator currently available. It weighs just 18 pounds vs. the typical home oxygen machine weight of 40-50 pounds.It is meant to be used mostly at night by patients who do not yet require a portable solution. Those patients represent about 30% of total oxygen patients in the U.S. It also uses less power, providing up to $20 in monthly electricity savings.""It's still very early in the process,"" said Bauerlein. ""We're really trying to optimize what is the right selling price, what is the right selling strategy, so it's still very early. This is a new market for us and there really isn't a retail market for stationary oxygen concentrators at this point.""She said that the firm will need at least another quarter to determine what the best strategy is for Inogen At Home. However, because the concentrator is less complex, pricing will most likely be cheaper than Inogen's other machines.The company's portable concentrators include the Inogen One G2 and G3. The latter is the latest and lightest of the machines at 4.8 pounds. Its retail price starts at $2,495. The company is working on an even smaller and lighter model, the Inogen One G4, expected to be released in the first half of 2016. The goal with the G4 is to offer a product that is less expensive to manufacture, said Bauerlein.Inogen went public in February 2014 at $16 a share and its stock nearly doubled from the IPO price by the end of the year.With a market cap approaching $600 million, Inogen ranks 50th in size among 108 names in IBD's Medical-Products industry group, which is dominated by the likes of Medtronic (MDT), Covidien (COV) and Baxter International (BAX).The group ranks No. 27 in performance of 197 that IBD tracks. Inogen's outsized stock gain of 37% for the second half of 2014, vs. the group's 6% rise, is among factors lifting the medical products group from 65th place half a year ago.Inogen's largest competitors are Invacare (IVC), Inova Labs and Respironics, a unit of Philips (PHG). Analyst Matson says one risk is that a rival will try to improve on Inogen products. But the trajectory to market is pretty long. Plus, Inogen holds 27 U.S. patents with at least eight years remaining, which should provide a buffer zone.The company has been generating positive cash flow, finishing the third quarter with $56.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. It also secured access to a credit facility from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the bank that led Inogen's IPO.At its Dec. 15 analyst day event, Inogen reaffirmed revenue guidance it raised in November. It expects $106 million to $110 million for 2014 and $130 million to $135 million in 2015, or 20%-25% growth this year.The consensus opinion of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters calls for a 36% earnings per share gain to 30 cents for 2014 and a 40% gain this year to 42 cents.

"
284,MDT,"Salix agreed to buy Cosmo Tech, an Irish subsidiary of Italian drugmaker Cosmo Pharmaceuticals, in July via a stock swap. The company planned to use the deal to relocate to Ireland to take advantage of its lower corporate tax rate. But in the breakup announcement Friday, Salix CEO Carolyn Logan said times have changed.
"

297,MDT,"On a conference call with analysts Monday morning, company leaders said the two firms complement each other both technologically and geographically. CareFusion (CFN) sells mostly in the U.S. while BD sells mostly outside of it, and the combined portfolio of products and services should offer a full suite for the $20 billion medication management industry, they said.
"
298,MDT,"They also fielded questions about why BD is making such a large buyout, which does not fit its recent history of tuck-in deals. In response, they cited the consolidation of the customer base, the need to cut costs and the necessity of a global presence when most growth in the industry is coming from emerging markets.
"
299,MDT,"Such factors have been driving consolidation in the medtech market, with both Medtronic's (MDT) $43 billion buyout of Covidien (COV) and Zimmer's (ZMH) $13.35 billion acquisition of Biomet already in the works.
"
300,MDT,"""As the third big MedTech deal to be announced this year, this transaction will likely be viewed as yet another indication that scale is taking on an increasing level of importance to management teams as they plan for future positioning of their companies,"" wrote Leerink analyst Richard Newitter in a research note. ""It could add pressure to companies with strong balance sheets (and often talked about as likely acquirers) like Stryker (SYK) or Abbott (ABT) to put capital to work sooner rather than later and potentially toward a larger-sized transaction.""
"
301,MDT,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro echoed the point in his note and added that ""acquisition of smaller cap medtech companies may continue to be pushed out as large-cap medtech companies digest their recent sizeable acquisitions.""

347,MDT,"For a tech company, 16 years is practically middle-aged. And with revenue expected to top $6 billion this fiscal year, some might question how much growth is left for cloud and customer relationship management pioneer Salesforce.com (CRM).Top executives steering the San Francisco-based company known for automating all manner of sales functions insist there is still plenty.CEO Marc Benioff and President Keith Block believe that Salesforce will reach the $10 billion revenue mark in record time for an enterprise software company, though no time frame was given.""We also believe we will go from the sixth largest software company to the third largest, surpassing SAP (SAP),"" Block said in an interview with IBD.That would put it third behind Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL).And it's not just its core business in sales-force automation and customer relationship management, he says.""I think we will be the most relevant technology company in the world in the next few years,"" Block said. ""We will be influencing and advising companies and gaining their trust on how they can change their business model and disrupt the market.""Six Key ServicesSalesforce introduced its first customer relationship management, or CRM, solution in 2000, a year after Benioff co-founded the firm.In addition to its sales-cloud franchise, it now sells five other core services, including recently introduced analytics, community and marketing clouds.The Salesforce1 Platform provides the technology to power its products and lets customers and partners build their own apps.CRM apps allow sales and marketing staffs to record, organize, automate and strategize on customer interactions, using data as a key tool.The company's Marketing Cloud was born out of its $2.25 billion acquisition in 2013 of ExactTarget. It's the fastest growing top-five marketing vendor, Block says, citing research from Gartner.Analytics IntroducedSalesforce is also taking market share while other top-five vendors are losing share, he says.Analytics Cloud was launched in November at the company's annual ""Dreamforce"" conference, which drew 125,000 attendees — ""the largest technology conference in the world,"" Block says.Within two weeks of the Analytics Cloud launch, Salesforce was closing on $1 million-plus deals with several Fortune 500 companies, he says. However, the company has not yet reported sales results.Analytics Cloud lets customers run analytical reports on all digital platforms, including mobile phones and tablets.""In the old world, you go to the IT department to run reports and get the information in three to six weeks,"" Block said. ""They don't provide insights. Ours is all about ... analysis. We put it in the hands of everybody"" to quickly turn ""insights into action.""Though the firm's cloud services are sold to customers of all sizes, Salesforce is transitioning to an ""enterprise-class company,"" Block says.He says it has closed nearly 550 transactions for fiscal 2015 in the ""seven-and-eight-figures,"" about 100 more than last year.""No other cloud computing (company) is closing transactions at this size, scale and volume,"" he said.Driving UberCar service Uber uses Salesforce's integrated platform, which includes analytics, service and marketing clouds to ""power their business,"" Block says.New or expanded client wins in the first quarter, as called out by Benioff in a conference call, included Bouygues Telecom in France, Tyco International (TYC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Expedia (EXPE), Medtronic (MDT) and Western Union (WU), among many others.Salesforce signed a ""major new deal"" with a transportation company — ""one of the world's greatest brands in their category,"" Block said in the call.The unnamed company was using ""on-premise legacy technology from Oracle,"" he said, adding that it plans to put Salesforce1 on mobile devices and ""into the hands of more than 10,000 field employees around the world.""Salesforce's chief rivals in CRM are Oracle, SAP and Microsoft. Management pegs its market share in CRM at 41%, making it the No. 1 player.""We created a bow wave, a movement and a market. Others are tying to surf in our wake,"" Block said, adding that the transition for players with legacy technology is like ""turning a battleship in stormy seas.""Salesforce's addressable market for all its cloud offerings stands at around $62 billion, and it's expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of 11%, according to Rob Breza, an analyst with Wunderlich Securities.Helping to fuel that growth will be new wins in international markets — especially Europe and Asia, analysts say.Only 26% of Salesforce's revenue in Q1 was generated outside the U.S., a lower percentage than at Oracle and Microsoft. The largest share was in Europe, where revenue grew 28% from a year earlier, in constant currency.Total revenue in the quarter ended in April rose 23% to $1.51 billion. That put it on track to surpass a $6 billion annual revenue run rate ""faster than any other enterprise software company,"" Benioff said in the Q1 report.Operating cash flow jumped 54% to $731 million. Earnings per share rose 45% to 16 cents.Based on robust Q1 results, Salesforce raised its full-year revenue forecast to $6.55 billion, at the high end of its previous range.Management also upped EPS guidance for 2015 by two cents, to 71 cents per share, for a 37% year-over-year gain.In recently initiating coverage on Salesforce with a ""buy"" rating, analyst Breza of Wunderlich Securities noted that billed and unbilled backlog of over $9.1 billion ""should reassure investors"" that the company can sustain long-term growth.Investors drove up Salesforce stock 12% on April 29 after Bloomberg reported that it was fielding buyout offers. Executives at the company have declined to comment on ""market rumors and speculation.""Government Business Ahead?Analysts expect new wins in U.S. government contracts to provide solid growth opportunities in the future.JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy noted that the U.S. General Services Administration is in the early stages of assembling a sizable purchase agreement with Salesforce for CRM products.Salesforce's ""dream"" of achieving $10 billion in revenue is a ""tangible target,"" Murphy wrote in a research note on June 25.The ""customer company,"" he said, has ""blossomed into a true multi-product success story as it now rides atop multiple product pillars of substantial scale and trajectory.""

348,MDT,"Edwards Lifesciences (EW) was up 4% early Tuesday after JPMorgan upgraded the stock to overweight from neutral, saying that its fundamentals are strong despite a recent market slowdown and increased competition from Medtronic (MDT).
"
349,MDT,"Analyst Michael Weinstein wrote in a research note that Edwards stock has fallen back from its March high on concerns of a slowdown in the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) market.
"
350,MDT,"Last year the market grew robustly due to the launch of Edwards' Sapien XT valve and the entry of Medtronic's CoreValve into the U.S. market, so year-over-year comparisons are tough, Weinstein admitted. However, he said that his field research suggests the market has picked up since the American College of Cardiology (ACC) meeting in mid-March.
"
351,MDT,"""Our field checks suggest that the TAVR market has accelerated post-ACC, meaning that both Edwards and the market are likely to surprise to the upside over the balance of 2015,"" Weinstein wrote. ""Reinforcing this view is a survey we conducted last week of 50 U.S. TAVR implanters, pointing to 2Q volumes up 16% sequentially vs. the current consensus expectation of up 2-3%.""
"
352,MDT,"Weinstein theorized that data supporting the survival benefits of TAVR at the ACC meeting drove this increase.
"

However, he said that his field research suggests the market has picked up since the American College of Cardiology (ACC) meeting in mid-March.""Our field checks suggest that the TAVR market has accelerated post-ACC, meaning that both Edwards and the market are likely to surprise to the upside over the balance of 2015,"" Weinstein wrote. ""Reinforcing this view is a survey we conducted last week of 50 U.S. TAVR implanters, pointing to 2Q volumes up 16% sequentially vs. the current consensus expectation of up 2-3%.""Weinstein theorized that data supporting the survival benefits of TAVR at the ACC meeting drove this increase.Despite the recent pullback, Edwards is one of the leading stocks in the IBD's Medical-Products industry groups with a Composite Rating of 95.

427,MDT,"Earlier this month, the Obama administration reversed course on spending cuts to the popular Medicare Advantage program. Instead of a nearly 1% cut in payments, private health insurers that offer Advantage plans to seniors would get a 1.25% boost.
"
428,MDT,"The turnabout hardly made news, which isn't surprising since it was the third year in a row that the administration said it was planning to cut payments only to reverse course.
"
429,MDT,"It is, however, emblematic of the fiscal trouble ObamaCare has planted in the federal budget.
"
430,MDT,"When ObamaCare was being debated, opponents said it relied on unsustainable spending cuts in Medicare, tax hikes that wouldn't work as expected, and other political land mines designed only so President Obama could claim when he signed the law in 2010 that: ""It is paid for. It is fiscally responsible.""
"
431,MDT,"Recent events are proving opponents right.
"
432,MDT,"Nearly half of ObamaCare's costs, for example, are supposed to be ""paid for"" by spending cuts to Medicare, including $136 billion from Medicare Advantage in the first 10 years.
"
433,MDT,"But since the law took effect, the administration has tried to minimize the cuts to the increasingly popular Advantage program, which lets seniors choose from a wide range of subsidized private plans, and now accounts for a third of Medicare enrollees.
"
434,MDT,"Medicare's Third Rail
"
435,MDT,"The administration effectively canceled the first two years' Medicare Advantage cuts with $8 billion in bonuses paid out as part of a ""demonstration project"" widely derided as phony. It also delayed rules changes that would have led to further cuts.
"
436,MDT,"""I think that CMS really racked their brains to see where rate relief could be implemented, because they know seniors love the program and enrollment has been robust,"" Ipsita Smolinski, founder of consultancy Capitol Street, told the Morning Consult.
"
437,MDT,"The other big chunk of Medicare savings — nearly $200 billion — is supposed to come from payment cuts to doctors and hospitals. But when the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' chief actuarylooked at this provision, he said such cuts were ""unsustainable"" because 15% of Medicare Part A providers would operate in the red by 2018.
"
438,MDT,"By 2040, ""half of hospitals, two-thirds of skilled nursing facilities, and 90% of home health agencies"" would be losing money. Congress just permanently repealed a payment cut plan for Medicare doctors, which Congress had repeatedly delayed since it was enacted in 1997.
"
439,MDT,"Even the little-known ""Medicare Improvement Fund"" has proved troublesome. ObamaCare eliminated this fund for a one-time $20.7 billion savings. But in 2014, Obama signed a law that recreated the fund and put more than $200 million back into it.
"
440,MDT,"The tax side of ObamaCare's fiscal equation is just as shaky as the spending-cut side.
"
441,MDT,"Rather than rely on a transparent, easily measured source of revenue to pay for the massive subsidies — like Social Security and Medicare do through the payroll tax — ObamaCare raised 21 separate taxes, most of them hidden from taxpayer view.
"
442,MDT,"One of them, a 2.3% excise tax on medical devices that is supposed to raise $20 billion, is hugely unpopular. Even far-left liberal Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Al Franken — who represent states with several big device makers like Medtronic (MDT) and Boston Scientific (BSX) — oppose the tax, saying it kills jobs and thwarts innovation. A House bill to repeal it has 277 co-sponsors, including 36 Democrats. And 79 senators voted to ditch the tax in a symbolic vote back in 2013.
"
443,MDT,"The so-called Cadillac Tax, which is set to take effect in 2018 and raise $87 billion in its first nine years, also faces stiff bipartisan opposition, mainly because unions fiercely oppose it.
"
444,MDT,"The tax is supposed to discourage ""gold plated"" health plans by imposing a huge 40% excise tax on any premiums over a set limit. But by design, the tax will eventually reach down to Chevy-type health plans because of the way the premium limits are adjusted each year.

"
447,MDT,"Several ObamaCare taxes, meanwhile, are raising far less money than expected. The medical device tax, for example, took in 25% less than projected in its first year, according to the Treasury Department. The tax on tanning salons, which is supposed to bring in $2.7 billion over a decade, is raising half that.
"
448,MDT,"And because of delays and expanded exemptions, the Congressional Budget Office says the employer and individual mandate penalties will raise less than they had first expected.
"
449,MDT,"The CBO also has sharply cut its five-year forecast for Cadillac Tax revenues by two-thirds.
"
450,MDT,"ObamaCare backers point out that while spending cuts and tax revenues might be less than expected, ObamaCare's subsidy costs are lower too. The Congressional Budget Office recently cut its 10-year forecast by 11%.
"
451,MDT,"That could quickly change, however, if medical spending and inflation pick up. Last year, for example, drug spending unexpectedly leapt 13% as several breakthrough treatments hit the market.
"
452,MDT,"Plus, one key feature holding projected subsidy costs down is a little-known but controversial provision that caps insurance subsidy payments after 2018. The CBO says that this ""may be difficult to sustain"" because it will lead to a widening gap between subsidies and premiums for ObamaCare plans.
"
453,MDT,"When the Government Accountability Office took a more realistic view at ObamaCare — eliminating cost-cutting that it felt was unlikely to happen — it concluded that the law would increase deficits by almost 1% of GDP over the next 75 years.

467,MDT,"IBM introduced Watson to the world on the game show ""Jeopardy"" in 2011, when the highly intelligent computer outsmarted two of the best contestants that game show had ever seen.
"
468,MDT,"Watson was just a toddler then, but oh how it's grown.
"
469,MDT,"Rather than compete in trivia games, IBM (IBM) Watson is helping solve complex issues in the field of health care, sifting through complex data to help doctors and institutions find answers to tough questions.
"
470,MDT,"And that's just a start.
"
471,MDT,"Watson is engaged with more than 100 universities and 20 industries to advance and develop its humanlike capabilities.
"
472,MDT,"Watson is helping the oil and gas industry boost production. It's helping create better building materials. It's helping chefs create new recipes. And it's a health coach for consumers and a travel agent.
"
473,MDT,"If you have a question, Watson has an answer. It might not always be the best answer, but it's surely a step in the right direction. One thing's for sure, says IBM: Watson represents a new era of computing.
"
474,MDT,"""We are just on the initial cusp of this new era,"" said John Gordon, vice president of the IBM Watson Group. He says the cognitive computing that Watson represents will be bigger than the Internet in terms of how we communicate and process data.
"
475,MDT,"""Fundamentally, the Internet connected us to information faster than ever before and opened up new opportunities,"" Gordon said. ""Watson is taking on a new challenge, not about how to connect but how to process information in new ways. It will allow for a new era of human innovation.""
"
476,MDT,"Cognitive computing also goes by names such as artificial intelligence, augmented intelligence and machine learning. Decades of research and development have gone into a technology that's drawn the interest of the tech elite.
"
477,MDT,"Companies is this field include Google (GOOGL). Last year it paid $400 million to acquire DeepMind, which specializes in machine learning and advanced algorithms. Google has used deep learning to enhance its search results, improve Android's voice recognition and derive more data from images and video.
"
478,MDT,"Microsoft (MSFT) has also invested heavily in the field, as has Facebook (FB). Microsoft is using machine learning technology to enhance the features and performance in its Office 365 software. Facebook is using artificial intelligence to make its News Feed feature more relevant to users of the social network.
"
479,MDT,"It's all about diving deeper into the immense power of new computing technologies, using parallel processing and neural networks along with the explosion of Big Data analytics and advancements in computer software.
"
480,MDT,"Watson processes information more like a human than a computer. It does work that required thousands of computers a decade ago.
"
481,MDT,"Rather than being programmed to anticipate every answer or action needed to perform tasks, cognitive computing systems are trained using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to sense, predict and infer.
"
482,MDT,"The system gets more intelligent over time as more information is fed into its memory banks and it has more interactions with users, which aids its imaging and speech recognition.
"
483,MDT,"""IBM is a leader in this field, a field that allows computers to learn without having to be programmed,"" said David Schubmehl, a research director at market research firm IDC. ""We'll see computer systems that learn over time in the way humans do.""
"
484,MDT,"Each Watson computer is different, depending on who's working with it and the kinds of information they feed into its memory banks.
"
485,MDT,"Watson is also available in the cloud. Companies essentially can rent their own personal portion of the Watson platform.
"
486,MDT,"IBM doesn't sell Watson, based on the company's line of Power Systems computers, though it does provide the computer to business partners.
"
487,MDT,"IBM derives revenue from the sale of Watson services. It also takes a share of revenue from partners who successfully introduce and market Watson-based apps. IBM says it has hundreds of commercial partners, supported by thousands of developers and entrepreneurs who are developing thousands of apps.
"
488,MDT,"""We're betting on a share of their success,"" Gordon said, ""and I expect a lot of them to be successful.""
"
489,MDT,"IBM established the IBM Watson Group in January 2014. IBM is investing $1 billion into the group for research and development that, in collaboration with research institutions and businesses, will help commercialize Watson. IBM also has a $100 million fund to invest in startups and others that want to build a business on top of Watson.
"
490,MDT,"IBM's investments include San Diego-based Pathway Genomics, which in the past six years has received about $90 million in financing from a variety of investors. Pathway, founded in 2008, provides genetic testing services used by large hospitals and physicians.
"
491,MDT,"A year ago, Michael Nova, Pathway's chief innovation officer, called the IBM Watson group with an idea. He wanted to know if IBM and Watson could help Pathway develop a fitness and diet tracking app.
"
492,MDT,"By feeding Pathway's enormous collection of health and medical data into Watson, it will help users with answers to health-related questions. The Pathway app is also expected to connect with wearable health-tracking devices such as Fitbit, pulling in a person's vitals, such as blood pressure, weight and pulse. Users can log in on their smartphone and ask a health question such as ""How much exercise should I do today?"" Or ""What food should I stop eating?"" Nova expects the app to be available in the fourth quarter.
"
493,MDT,"""Health care is the hardest data problem there is,"" Nova said. ""We needed Watson on board. It's a huge advantage for us to be linked up with them.""
"
494,MDT,"Among its other investments, IBM was part of a $5 million funding round in WayBlazer, a travel search and discovery company with a goal to redefine how consumers plan, personalize and purchase travel.
"
495,MDT,"Health care was the first market for Watson, and it's where IBM has spent the most time and money.
"
496,MDT,"""We started on health intentionally, figuring if there are going to be problems to solve that would be meaningful, it was the right place to start,"" Gordon said. ""The amount of information produced in that field is exploding.""
"
497,MDT,"In April, IBM unveiled its Watson Health Cloud unit, which it says provides a secure and open platform for physicians, researchers, insurers and other companies focused on health and wellness.
"
498,MDT,"Its partners include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which will work with IBM to develop ""intelligent virtual coaching solutions"" to help prepare patients for surgery, then deal with its after effects.
"
499,MDT,"Johnson & Johnson will also leverage IBM's relationship with Apple (AAPL) to deliver new iPhone and iPad applications. Apple is working with IBM to integrate Watson-based apps into its HealthKit and ResearchKit tool systems for developers.
"
500,MDT,"Another partner is medical device giant Medtronic (MDT), which is collaborating with IBM around delivery of personalized care for people with diabetes, analyzing patient info and data from Medtronic devices.
"
501,MDT,"IBM also has Watson partnerships with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, the Mayo Clinic and the New York Genome Center.

Companies essentially can rent their own personal portion of the Watson platform.IBM doesn't sell Watson, based on the company's line of Power Systems computers, though it does provide the computer to business partners.IBM derives revenue from the sale of Watson services. It also takes a share of revenue from partners who successfully introduce and market Watson-based apps. IBM says it has hundreds of commercial partners, supported by thousands of developers and entrepreneurs who are developing thousands of apps.""We're betting on a share of their success,"" Gordon said, ""and I expect a lot of them to be successful.""IBM established the IBM Watson Group in January 2014. IBM is investing $1 billion into the group for research and development that, in collaboration with research institutions and businesses, will help commercialize Watson. IBM also has a $100 million fund to invest in startups and others that want to build a business on top of Watson.IBM's investments include San Diego-based Pathway Genomics, which in the past six years has received about $90 million in financing from a variety of investors. Pathway, founded in 2008, provides genetic testing services used by large hospitals and physicians.A year ago, Michael Nova, Pathway's chief innovation officer, called the IBM Watson group with an idea. He wanted to know if IBM and Watson could help Pathway develop a fitness and diet tracking app.By feeding Pathway's enormous collection of health and medical data into Watson, it will help users with answers to health-related questions. The Pathway app is also expected to connect with wearable health-tracking devices such as Fitbit, pulling in a person's vitals, such as blood pressure, weight and pulse. Users can log in on their smartphone and ask a health question such as ""How much exercise should I do today?"" Or ""What food should I stop eating?"" Nova expects the app to be available in the fourth quarter.""Health care is the hardest data problem there is,"" Nova said. ""We needed Watson on board. It's a huge advantage for us to be linked up with them.""Among its other investments, IBM was part of a $5 million funding round in WayBlazer, a travel search and discovery company with a goal to redefine how consumers plan, personalize and purchase travel.Health care was the first market for Watson, and it's where IBM has spent the most time and money.""We started on health intentionally, figuring if there are going to be problems to solve that would be meaningful, it was the right place to start,"" Gordon said. ""The amount of information produced in that field is exploding.""In April, IBM unveiled its Watson Health Cloud unit, which it says provides a secure and open platform for physicians, researchers, insurers and other companies focused on health and wellness.Its partners include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which will work with IBM to develop ""intelligent virtual coaching solutions"" to help prepare patients for surgery, then deal with its after effects.Johnson & Johnson will also leverage IBM's relationship with Apple (AAPL) to deliver new iPhone and iPad applications. Apple is working with IBM to integrate Watson-based apps into its HealthKit and ResearchKit tool systems for developers.Another partner is medical device giant Medtronic (MDT), which is collaborating with IBM around delivery of personalized care for people with diabetes, analyzing patient info and data from Medtronic devices.IBM also has Watson partnerships with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, the Mayo Clinic and the New York Genome Center.""We're bullish on what we've seen,"" said Gordon. ""Innovators are building new companies around Watson. It's a new era of computing.""

"
524,MDT,"Medical product giants St. Jude Medical and Abbott Laboratories both beat analysts' Q2 expectations and raised their guidance Wednesday, but their shares had a bumpy ride on the market amid a fresh attack on drug-industry mergers.Abbott (ABT) reported its first sales beat in six quarters. Revenue rose 2% to $5.55 billion, about $30 million above consensus. Earnings climbed 17% to 54 cents a share, beating estimates by 4 cents.The company added a few pennies to its full-year EPS guidance, now $2.19 to $2.29. Analysts' average was $2.19. On the conference call with analysts to discuss the results, Abbott CFO Thomas Freyman said revenue should rise in the low to mid-single digits, which is on the high side of analysts' expectation of 2.6% growth.Freyman also guided Q3 sales growth in a similar range, and said earnings should be 59 to 61 cents, up from 55 cents a year ago. Both were in line with Street estimates.""ABT has been a bit of a 'show me' story in the last few quarters as the company worked through headwinds in its established products (i.e. generic drugs) and nutritionals businesses,"" Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy wrote in a research note Wednesday. ""But now with a sales and EPS beat in hand prompting an EPS guidance raise, and recent transactions executed to optimize the portfolio — including the acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals, a Chilean-based branded generics company, and the divestiture of its developed-markets (established products) businesses — ABT may be nearing a potential sales growth inflection point.""On Monday, Abbott announced it was selling its developed-markets established products business to Mylan (MYL), which plans to take the opportunity to re-incorporate in the Netherlands, following a virtual stampede of U.S. drugmakers to lower-tax countries.On Wednesday, however, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew issued a letter to Congress urging a moratorium on such arrangements until comprehensive tax reform is enacted. Lew wanted the ban to be retroactive to May.""Our view is that caution is certainly warranted concerning pending and recently announced deals, such as Mylan's announced acquisition of Abbott's established products business,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst David Maris wrote in a research note Wednesday.Perhaps because of this, Abbott's stock seesawed in trading Wednesday, opening up 1% and then dropping at midday before eventually closing down a fraction, at 41.05.But analysts were impressed with Abbott's cost controls, resulting in improvements to the gross profit margin that RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro said made for ""a quality beat.""And Morgan Stanley analyst David Lewis projects a 200-basis-point improvement in operating margin in the second half of this year.St. Jude (STJ), which has no plans for a tax inversion, said earnings rose 6% over the year-earlier quarter to $1.02 a share, beating analysts' consensus by 2 cents. Sales climbed 3% to $1.45 billion, vs. the Street's $1.44 billion.The company guided Q2 EPS at 95 cents to 97 cents, bracketing consensus, but sales guidance of $1.315 billion to $1.395 billion missed analysts' $1.399 billion. For the year, St. Jude guided EPS of $3.96 to $4.01 and sales of $5.64 billion to $5.76 billion, slightly higher than previous guidance and in line with expectations.St. Jude Sees Share GainsOn its conference call to discuss results, St. Jude CEO Daniel Starks said growth should start accelerating in the second half of the year, due mainly to new product launches. He said the ramping should continue into next year, with revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits vs. this year's expected 3% to 5% range.Starks also said St. Jude is still gaining share in the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) market. Sales of that division rose 2% to $733 million, although St. Jude says the overall market continues to shrink. Starks admitted, however, that in the first quarter the firm didn't know exactly what the ICD market was doing until rivals Boston Scientific (BSX) and Medtronic (MDT) had reported their quarters later. The Q2 earnings from Medtronic and Boston Scientific are still down the road. Their Q1 results, however, had indicated that St. Jude gained 100 basis points of market share.Still, analyst Antalffy wrote that St. Jude's guidance was disappointing given the Q2 beat. She also pointed out that the stock is richly valued — it hit an all-time high of 71.90 on July 7. In trading Wednesday, it did almost the reverse of Abbott, dropping nearly 2% early before recovering somewhat to close down nearly 1%, at 67.66.

""The CEO of a company, surely they have arrived, right? No, I can assure you, they have not arrived.""He contends that you'll be more successful in a humble profession that you love than a flashy one you dread.Plus, a job that fit you when you were 28 might not be great at middle age or after retirement.Kaplan compares smart career steering to weight loss: ""No one would say, 'I've lost 20 pounds, and now I can eat anything I want.' You have to work at that the rest of your life.""To stay career sharp, keep asking:• What do I love? The most potent source of career viability?Passion, said Kaplan: ""If you want to make money, that is fine, but realize that money, in almost every single career I can think of, is back-end loaded. It comes as a result of performing at a high level for many years.""• How to know?"" Think of a time in your life when you excelled and you were doing your best,"" Kaplan said. ""What were you doing? What was the task? What was the environment?""Other exercises: Pretend you're wealthy or had just three years to live. Now what would you do?• Am I any good?"" A high percentage of people I speak with don't have a clear sense of their core strengths,"" Kaplan said. ""At the same time, most people I talk with cannot accurately describe their weaknesses.""• Am I a writer? Speaker? Negotiator? Coach? Math whiz?A mentor can help you pin it all down. Then you'll grasp whether your dream job is really your dream job.• Why do I want it? People often have fantasies about what it means to work in a particular industry. Example: Entrepreneurialism is popular now, Kaplan says. But it's not easy for anyone, no matter what people say at cocktail parties.Push past the romance of any calling so you'll know what you're getting into.""Talk to people and ask: What are the two or three things you need to be great at to do that job?"" Kaplan said.• Lacking skills? It's never too late to return to the classroom or take a working professional to lunch to ask for advice, Kaplan reminds seasoned workers.• Ready to grow? Don't let grudges or emotional blocks keep you from forging a new direction in your life. Bill George, former Medtronic (MDT) CEO, one of Kaplan's colleagues at Harvard and co-author of ""True North,"" studied 125 top leaders to figure out what forms powerful, authentic chiefs.They have problems, just like everyone else.The difference?

590,MDT,"Drug industry mergers and acquisitions continued Wednesday as two pharma companies sold off non-core assets.British giant AstraZeneca (AZN) agreed to sell its small-molecule (i.e. non-biotech) antibiotics to Pfizer (PFE) for an upfront payment of $550 million plus another $175 million in January 2019, along with up to $250 million in milestone payments depending on whether the drugs still in the pipeline make it to market.The portfolio includes the already-commercialized drugs Merrem, Zinforo and Zavicefta, which treat a range of serious infections, as well as two late-stage pipeline candidates for drug-resistant infections. Allergan (AGN) holds the North American rights to Zavicefta and Zinforo and will continue to do so, with Pfizer acquiring the international rights.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer's size and patent losses have kept it from being a big growth stock lately, but it's a leading dividend stock, as outlined recently in IBD's column The Income Investor.The move fits AstraZeneca's strategy of focusing on its three chosen areas of oncology, respiratory/autoimmunity, and cardiovascular/metabolic diseases. For Pfizer, it adds to its existing portfolio of more than 60 anti-infectives.""As we continue to reshape our Essential Health portfolio, we are focusing on areas that further address global public health needs and that complement our core capabilities and experience in therapeutic areas,"" John Young, head of Pfizer Essential Health, said in a statement.The deal is expected to close in Q4.Pfizer stock closed 0.8% lower at 34.82 on the stock market today. AstraZeneca stock fell 1% to 33.50.Meanwhile, specialty drugmaker Mallinckrodt (MNK) said it's selling its diagnostic nuclear-imaging business to Belgium-based IBA Molecular for $690 million.The fact that Mallinckrodt has two not-especially-related businesses -- specialty drugs and imaging -- comes from its peculiar history. It was a more diversified company when Tyco International (TYC) bought it in 2000, but after Tyco spun off its medical business as Covidien (now part of Medtronic (MDT)) in 2007, and then Covidien spun off Mallinckrodt in 2013, the other divisions were stripped off. Since the spinoff, the drug business has been growing much faster than the imaging business, so a sale has been widely expected.The deal has to clear some unusual regulatory hurdles, including approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, so the companies say it will close in the first half of 2017.Mallinckrodt stock dropped 4.7% to 79.14 after setting an 11-month high intraday.RELATED:Pfizer-Medivation Deal Reignites Biotech Buyout Speculation3 More Drugmakers Beat Q2 Estimates, But Guidance Mixed

Analysts expect EPS ex items this quarter of $5.16, down 1.5%, on sales of $647.5 million, up 10%.Intuitive Surgical stock was up nearly 5% in after-hours trading, after the company released its results. Shares rose a fraction in Tuesday's regular session, to 671.90. Intuitive stock hit an all-time high of 681.59 on July 11, after moving out of a flat base at a 654.98 buy point on June 23.

Early Tuesday, J&J posted a Q2 earnings beat, and Johnson & Johnson stock hit a record high Tuesday, closing up 1.7% at 125.25. Medtronic (MDT) made a big move into this field with its acquisition last year of Covidien.The company said the number of da Vinci procedures rose nearly 16% in Q2 vs. Q2 2015, while it shipped 130 da Vinci systems vs. 118 in Q2 2015.In a pre-earnings research note, Leerink analyst Richard Newitter said Intuitive was increasingly benefiting from the ""next leg of growth"" for its da Vinci Xi system, launched in 2014.

592,MDT,"IShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI) is one of the year's top ETF Leaders as it rides some of the best parts of a mixed health care sector.This year, the medical sector has diverged, with some of its industries faring much better than others. Biotechs and other drugmakers are down roughly 20%. But IBD's medical products and equipment industry groups are up about 14%. Only the diversified medical companies are doing quite as well in 2016 in health care.Much of the outperformance in medical devices owes to superior results at some of the top manufacturers, where innovation has played a key role in igniting industry leaders.Of 47 stocks in the ETF, Medtronic (MDT) is the largest holding, with more than 12% of the portfolio. Shares have climbed as much as 12% from the 79.60 buy point of a breakout in April.The stock has performed decently despite the fact that earnings have been basically flat for five quarters. The outlook is improving, though: Analysts expect profit to rise 7% in the fiscal year ending in April and 11% the next year. At its investor day in June, Medtronic forecast mid-single-digit revenue growth as it develops its product pipeline and draws on its diversified markets.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is another stock that has shouldered the ETF's advance. Shares are near all-time highs. The main move this year was on April 4, after the company announced that its Sapien 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement was shown to reduce deaths from heart attacks in patients at moderate risk from open-heart surgery. Shares soared 17% on the news.Medtronic's CoreValve competes with Edwards in heart valve replacements for patients not able to have open-heart surgery. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity remained bullish on the stock following the earnings report, saying it dominates the market for transcatheter aortic valve replacements and shows potential for market expansion.Shares of Stryker (SYK) -- which has the broadest range of orthopedics products among its peers -- have climbed as much as 34% this year, but fell sharply after its July 22 earnings report. There was no clear explanation for the slide, other than some softness in emerging markets.Other key contributors to iShares U.S. Medical Devices are Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), which makes equipment for medical research, and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH), which just posted its strongest quarter of sales growth in nearly a decade. Becton Dickinson (BDX) had been trending higher, but fell sharply Thursday after it cut its full-year sales forecast, citing currency headwinds.The ETF is extended from a breakout in April and from a pullback to the 50-day moving average in June. But it remains near the 142.47 buy point of a three-weeks-tight pattern that formed during July. The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

593,MDT,"Shares of device maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) jumped 14% in early trading in the stock market today after word got out late Friday that the company had won a court injunction limiting the sale of Medtronic's (MDT) CoreValve artificial heart valve in the U.S.
"
594,MDT,"Medtronic stock was down 3%.
"
595,MDT,"CoreValve, which has been sold in Europe for several years, was approved by the FDA in January. But Edwards, whose rival Sapien product has been sold in America since 2011, has long fought CoreValve's entry with patent litigation. A jury trial found in 2010 that Medtronic had infringed Edwards' patent, and on Friday a federal judge granted an injunction limiting CoreValve's sale to patients at extreme risk, starting April 22. Medtronic said it will appeal.
"
596,MDT,"The judge did say that the CoreValve seemed to be a safer product with better outcomes, and he ordered the companies to agree on a way to allow physicians trained in CoreValve implantation (currently at about 60 U.S. hospitals) to continue to use the product according to their own clinical judgment.
"
597,MDT,"""Given how rare injunctions are in the U.S., we are surprised by the court's decision,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro in a research note Monday.
"
598,MDT,"Novarro sees three possible outcomes at this point. ""Scenario #1: MDT gains a stay before April 22 and there is no change to estimates. MDT then moves forward with an appeal of the injunction and it plays out in the courts for 1-2 years.
"
599,MDT,"""Scenario #2: MDT does not win a stay, and EW enforces the injunction. We note that EW has a petition into the U.S. Patent and Trademark office to extend the Anderson patent into early 2016. Thus, under a worst-case scenario, MDT will likely be off the U.S. market until early 2016.
"
600,MDT,"""Scenario #3: MDT does not gain a stay, but EW allows MDT to sell into the hospitals that are currently trained on CoreValve.""

603,MDT,"RELATED: Medtronic Price Target Raised, But Already Beats.Shares of device maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) jumped 14% in early trading in the stock market today after word got out late Friday that the company had won a court injunction limiting the sale of Medtronic's (MDT) CoreValve artificial heart valve in the U.S.Medtronic stock was down 3%.CoreValve, which has been sold in Europe for several years, was approved by the FDA in January. But Edwards, whose rival Sapien product has been sold in America since 2011, has long fought CoreValve's entry with patent litigation. A jury trial found in 2010 that Medtronic had infringed Edwards' patent, and on Friday a federal judge granted an injunction limiting CoreValve's sale to patients at extreme risk, starting April 22. Medtronic said it will appeal.The judge did say that the CoreValve seemed to be a safer product with better outcomes, and he ordered the companies to agree on a way to allow physicians trained in CoreValve implantation (currently at about 60 U.S. hospitals) to continue to use the product according to their own clinical judgment.""Given how rare injunctions are in the U.S., we are surprised by the court's decision,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro in a research note Monday.Novarro sees three possible outcomes at this point. ""Scenario #1: MDT gains a stay before April 22 and there is no change to estimates. MDT then moves forward with an appeal of the injunction and it plays out in the courts for 1-2 years.""Scenario #2: MDT does not win a stay, and EW enforces the injunction. We note that EW has a petition into the U.S. Patent and Trademark office to extend the Anderson patent into early 2016. Thus, under a worst-case scenario, MDT will likely be off the U.S. market until early 2016.""Scenario #3: MDT does not gain a stay, but EW allows MDT to sell into the hospitals that are currently trained on CoreValve.""Novarro maintains a sector perform rating on both stocks.

635,MDT,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's health care plan, released over the weekend, could have a positive impact for some companies in the medical hardware and development market, says Evercore ISI.Analyst Ross Muken wrote in a research report that Clinton's plan to encourage research and development spending should give a boost to providers of life science tools and services used in pharmaceutical development.""The added focus on generics and biosimilars can add an additional leg of growth to the pharma end market, largely continuing to benefit chromatography (Agilent (A), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)), Waters (WAT)) and separations players (Pall/Danaher (DHR)),"" Muken wrote. ""The one potential offset would be if the increased scrutiny on drug pricing led to fewer total dollars spend on R&D (we view that as unlikely).""All the above stocks are currently highly rated by IBD metrics -- especially Danaher, which hold a highest-possible Composite Rating of 99 and is trading at all-time highs. Danaher stock closed down 1% at 80.08 on the stock market today, after touching a record high of 81.28 on Friday.Agilent shares fell 0.2%, Thermo Fisher also lost 0.2% and Waters eased 0.5%.Clinton also wants to clear out the backlog of generic drug applications in the FDA and shorten the seven-year exclusivity period granted to biosimilar drugs. Muken says this should accelerate production by companies making these drugs and drive business for contract research organizations (CROs).""Additionally, the plan's intention to hold drug companies accountable and require value-based studies to justify the high drug prices could accelerate pharma's adoption of real-world data services,"" he said. ""This adoption could provide CROs another avenue of growth outside the traditional clinical trial outsourcing and is one of the reasons highlighted by Quintiles' (Q) management for the Quintiles/IMS Health (IMS) merger.""Parexel (PRXL) has also named real-world data services as a growth driver, Muken noted.Quintiles stock, with a middling CR of 58, fell 0.8% Monday. Parexel, which holds an excellent IBD EPS Rank of 97, dipped less than 0.1%.The outlook is more mixed for clinical devices and systems. On the one hand, if the plan succeeds in expanding the number of covered lives it will help boost demand for things like orthopedic and cardiovascular implants, and the focus on women's health could be positive for Hologic (HOLX), Muken wrote. On the other hand, it could increase the pricing pressure that's already been dogging the industry.""Players like Medtronic (MDT) who are already shifting to a value-based business model are best positioned for the next leg of evolution in the health care space,"" Muken wrote.Medtronic stock, with a strong CR of 90, hit a new intraday high of 88.91 Monday before closing at 88.51. Hologic stock, which has been consolidating as the company goes through a financial turnaround, fell 0.9% to 35.61.

645,MDT,"It's hard to beat Medtronic (MDT) for steady share price action, earnings and dividend growth lately.Shares of the world's biggest maker of medical devices have risen 27% this year, easily beating the S&P 500. They're up 38% from a year ago and 73% from a bottom of 30.18 in August 2011.The stock is 10% past a 47.50 buy point from a flat base, putting it well out of buying range. A test of the 10-week line could provide a follow-on buying opportunity.The Minneapolis-based company announced June 20 that it was increasing its quarterly dividend by 8% to 28 cents a share for shareholders of record on July 5. That brings the annual dividend to $1.12 per share, good for an annual yield of 2.2%, just below the 2.5% average for the S&P 500.The company is ""committed to returning 50% of free cash flow to shareholders each year through dividends and share repurchases, which still gives us ample flexibility to make necessary investments for sustainable growth,"" CEO Omar Ishrak said at the time.Medtronic has boosted the payout for 36 years in a row, making it a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index. It's nearly quadrupled in the past decade.The stock jumped May 21 after the company posted a better-than-expected 11% increase in profit for its fiscal fourth quarter. The 4% increase in sales also topped views.Medtronic boasts a three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 1 on a scale of 0 to 99, with 0 being most stable. Its annual profit grew through the 2008-09 recession.Medtronic earns 45% of its revenue outside the U.S., which makes it vulnerable to currency swings. It recently bought KangHui, a Chinese maker of orthopedic implants, to expand into China's fast-growing medical device market.

It's similar to Edwards' Sapien, which had the U.S. market to itself after it was approved in 2011, though the two share the market in Europe. Edwards has sued Medtronic for patent infringement, resulting in a jury award earlier this week, but that won't stop the launch of the competing product, unless Edwards wins a permanent injunction.

648,MDT,"""With approval earlier than expected, share loss for EW will likely occur sooner than expected,"" wrote analyst Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets in a research note. He also wrote that the CoreValve is smaller than the current Sapien model, which should give it a competitive advantage until Edwards' own smaller model, the Sapien XT, is approved, which he says will be in a few months.

650,MDT,"Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.The FDA approved Medtronic's (MDT) CoreValve artificial heart valve Friday, well ahead of its April 1 deadline, sending shares of competitor Edwards Lifesciences (EW) tumbling on the stock market today.The CoreValve is a transcatheter aortic valve, approved to treat in aortic stenosis in patients too frail for open-heart surgery. It's similar to Edwards' Sapien, which had the U.S. market to itself after it was approved in 2011, though the two share the market in Europe. Edwards has sued Medtronic for patent infringement, resulting in a jury award earlier this week, but that won't stop the launch of the competing product, unless Edwards wins a permanent injunction.""With approval earlier than expected, share loss for EW will likely occur sooner than expected,"" wrote analyst Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets in a research note. He also wrote that the CoreValve is smaller than the current Sapien model, which should give it a competitive advantage until Edwards' own smaller model, the Sapien XT, is approved, which he says will be in a few months.After the late-morning announcement, Medtronic's stock was up a fraction.

Zimmer said it's buying LDR for its technologies in cervical disc replacement, which it called ""the fastest-growing segment within the $10 billion spine industry."" LDR's technology is designed to make spinal surgery simpler and less invasive.LDR, founded in 2000, is still losing money, but Zimmer said it should have no impact on EPS this year or next.RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro said the buyout should boost Zimmer's profile in the fragmented spine industry.""The combined portfolio raises Zimmer's spine market share from 5% to 7%, putting the company within striking distance of Strkyer (SYK) and NuVasive, who hold 8% and 9% of the market, respectively,"" Novarro wrote in a research note.

747,MDT,"Finding research tools that work for you, match the way you think and help you reason your way through challenges is a big part of developing investing skills.
"
748,MDT,"One aspect of those skills should include some way to gauge the liquidity of the stocks you research.
"
749,MDT,"This gives you some sense of a stock's resilience to buying and selling pressure. It also gives you another way to read its volatility.
"
750,MDT,"There are at least a couple of ways to figure liquidity.
"
751,MDT,"The most basic is to track the number of shares traded. You can do this by reading the vertical volume lines at the bottom of many daily and weekly charts.
"
752,MDT,"More shares traded means a stock is less likely to surge or dive when a big investor grabs or sells a large block of shares. As a rule of thumb, a minimum of 400,000 shares traded a day signals a decent level of institutional support, a good cushion against volatility, and reduced risk.
"
753,MDT,"Another, less common way to gauge liquidity is using dollar volume. This levels the playing field, to some degree, between thinner, higher priced stocks and more heavily traded, but cheaper stocks. Given time, high-dollar volume tends to produce the biggest winners.
"
754,MDT,"To get daily dollar volume, multiply the number of shares traded on a day by the share price. For average daily dollar volume, multiply the 50-day average trading volume (shown in IBD's Research Tables and the online quotes at Investors.com) by the current share price.
"
755,MDT,"An extreme example, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), trades an average 1,200 shares a day at nearly $90,000 each. That puts daily dollar volume around $105 million. 
"
756,MDT,"Apple (AAPL), on the other hand, trades about 34 million shares a day. It is just above 90 a share, giving it a dollar volume slightly north of $3 billion.
"
757,MDT,"Stocks can also have similar prices, yet generate different dollar volume. AthenaHealth (ATHN) carries a dollar volume of around $18 million. Peer Quality Systems (QSII) clocks in at about the same level, $17.8 million. The dollar volume of Cerner (CERN) is more than $47 million, while Medtronics (MDT) sees about $292 million in action each day. All four stocks currently trade in the 30 to 40 range, but attract varying levels of dollar commitments from their shareholders.
"
758,MDT,"This doesn't necessarily mean that Cerner's a better stock, but it may be prone to less volatility.
"
759,MDT,"Scanning through all NYSE and Nasdaq stocks that carry IBD Composite Ratings of 90 or higher, Google (GOOG), at $1.99 billion, and Research In Motion (RIMM), at $1.3 billion, carry the highest daily average dollar volumes.
"
760,MDT,"Brink's Home Security Hold-ings (CFL), which went public in November, shows the lowest dollar volume action.
"
761,MDT,"About 34 stocks today carry a top-flight Composite Rating of 99. The top dollar volume among those are Gilead Sciences (GILD) at $442 million and Apollo Group (APOL) and Genentech (DNA), with around $33 million each.

1064,MDT,"Medtronic (MDT) shares sank early Tuesday after the firm suggested the first uses of its surgical robot, Hugo, on humans likely will be pushed into 2019, an analyst said.X The share drop came as the medical device maker topped Wall Street's quarterly expectations with diabetes business revenue that ""handily"" beat the consensus as Medtronic puts production issues in its rearview mirror, RBC analyst Brandon Henry wrote in a note to clients. But on the stock market today, Medtronic sank 2% to close at 81.61, on robotic issues.Previously, Medtronic had said the competitor to Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) would begin operating on patients at the end of fiscal 2018 with a full launch in fiscal 2019. On its call, though, the firm said software/hardware integration and testing is taking longer than expected.""We believe that commentary suggests first in-human cases with Medtronic's surgical robot will slip into fiscal 2019,"" Henry said. ""We believe the slippage in Medtronic's surgical robot timeline is a slight positive for both Intuitive and TransEnterix (TRXC).""IBD'S TAKE: It's hard to identify the start to an uptrend by simply relying on headlines. So how do savvy traders look for uptrends? Head to the Investor's Corner for key tips on operating in a resurgent market.The delay for Medtronic gives TransEnterix a longer second-mover advantage, Henry said. Transenterix gained approval in October for its Senhance Surgical Robotic System and sold its first system to a hospital system in Florida in November.Intuitive Surgical gained 1.4% to close at 421.76, as TransEnterix gained 9 cents to 1.49.For its fiscal third quarter, Medtronic reported adjusted income of $1.17 per share on $7.37 billion in sales for its third quarter, rising 4% and 1%, respectively, vs. the year-ago period. Analysts had called for adjusted profit of $1.16 per share on $7.2 billion in sales.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro noted ""all four segments contributed to the upside."" Cardiac and vascular sales rose 7% on a constant-currency basis. Restorative therapies, minimally invasive therapies and diabetes sales grew 5%, 6% and 13%, respectively.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!Edward Jones analyst John Boylan credited the sales beat to the diabetes group, which brought in $584 million worldwide, ""handily"" beating estimates. Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar said the consensus had projected $538 million in diabetes sales.""While the revenue beat was driven by broad strength across the board, the three standouts in our mind are diabetes, drug-eluting stents and pain therapies,"" Kumar said in a note. Drug-eluting stents grew by a midteens percentage. Pain therapies rose 8%.For 2018, Medtronic reiterated guidance for adjusted earnings to grow 9%-10% year over year, implying $4.76-$4.81 per share, Edward Jones' Boylan wrote. The consensus had modeled $4.76 a share.Sales are expected to grow 4%-5% on a constant-currency basis. The consensus was modeling $29.5 billion in sales for the fiscal year ending in April.RELATED:Why 2018 Could Be An Explosive Year For Biotech MergersThis Biotech Stock May Need Anesthesia After Collapsing Nearly 20%Abbott Laboratories Jumps After Boosting Quarterly Dividend

1151,MDT,"There is no sign of respite from the ongoing market uncertainty due to apprehensions of a trade war. On the one hand, Asian stocks have started to revive on improvement in U.S-North Korea relationship while on the other hand, investors are restraining themselves on possibilities of trade loss due to the proposed China trade restrictions.Medical Device Caught in the Trade War StormGoing by data provided in an article by Christian B. Jones in Mondaq, MedTech firms in the United States currently sell $4.7 billion annually to China, while the nation imports from China a total of $5 billionin medical device. U.S. exports of medical devices last year totaled $52 billion, creating a $1 billion worldwide trade surplus.Needless to say, the medical device lobby is extremely apprehensive about the proposed tariffs on Chinese products as it could significantly affect international trade. MedTech trade group AdvaMed made a more specific comment claiming that the Chinese tariffs account for more than half of all MedTech imports from the region (in a MassDevice article). The trade group stated that, “for our industry, the proposed additional tariff of 25% on imports of nearly $3bn of medical technology products is the wrong action at the wrong time.""AdvaMed countered United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) claim of China’s unfair trade practices in medical devices harming U.S. exports significantly. The group argued that the U.S. trades with China on medical devices on the USTR list are in fact in slight surplus. Accordingly, if the proposed tariffs on diagnostic products and other medical devices made in both the United States and China are not dropped, it may result in trade imbalance.Per RBC Capital Markets estimates, if the proposed 25% tariffs get implemented, this could cost the medical device industry up to $1.5 billion each year.Going by the latest update, per a Financial Express report, a bipartisan group of 40 lawmakers has urged US Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer to remove $3 billion worth of medical devices from the list of Chinese products proposed by the Trump administration for additional tariff.Investors in Trouble?With the risk of a trade war between the two largest economies heightening, investment in medical device stocks is taking a backseat.The proposed imposition of additional tariff on Chinese products and China’s retaliatory efforts have resulted in widespread share losses so far in the Medical device sector. Bearish emerging market trade outlook has dealt severe blows to the bigwigs. We note that the sector has gained significantly from profits earned by a number of medical device companies from the BRIC nations.In this regard, we note that stocks like Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report), GE Healthcare (GE  -  Free Report) and others are witnessing considerable weakness since Mar 23, when talks of a U.S.-China trade war started doing the rounds. We note that Medtronic earlier bought orthopedic devices maker, China Kanghui Holdings and since then has been consistently shipping products to the United States from this operation. If these shipments are now subject to additional tariff, it will definitely hamper the company’s China business.GE Healthcare has also urged the administration to remove certain parts from the list of Chinese products for additional tariff. Going by a Mass Device report, China produced parts are essential for a number of GE’s devices, including ultrasound machines, patient monitors, MRI machines, CT machines and X-ray machines, some of which are produced by GE owned facilities in China while others are produced by local Chinese companies.3 MedTech Stocks to Counter the Trade Restriction HazardConcerns about the implementation of the trade tariffs on MedTech products have been weighing on stocks lately. Even though the market has not yet shown any steady plunge, such fears are likely to dampen investor sentiment going forward.We have shortlisted three MedTech stocks, which, in spite of the tumultuous market conditions, are well poised on strong fundamentals and timely strategic developments. Our selection is also backed by a good Zacks Growth Score and Zacks Rank.We have narrowed down our choices with the help of our new Style Score system.Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities in the value investing space. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report): Although, the company has a strong presence in overseas markets, it has no such business relation with China. Hence, in spite of considering international diversification as a core component of the company’s strategy, the company can very well sidestep the volatility of the U.S.-China trade war and continue to enjoy the bountiful scope offered by emerging markets. The company, in fact, is benefiting from developing countries' incremental investments in health care systems.Baxter has a Growth Score of A and a Zacks Rank #2. The company has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 16.3%, higher than the industry’s 10.3%.Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report): In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, Varian Medical’s global market share growth was driven by orders-based share gains in EMEA. In fact, Varian Medical was awarded a contract for eight TrueBeam systems in Stockholm, Sweden. Further, the company signed an agreement to acquire Australia-based, Sirtex, which focused on interventional oncology therapies. This apart, Varian Medical has recently announced the opening of a new facility in Jundiaí, Brazil, which extends its global manufacturing and training footprint in the region. Although Varian Medical has business in Greater China, the company’s huge global base outside the country shields it from severe damage that may occur as a result of the trade restriction.Varian Medical has a Growth Score of B and a Zacks Rank #2.ABIOMED, Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report): Just like Baxter, despite having strong international foothold, ABIOMED does not have any significant presence in China. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Germany and Japan witnessed strong adoption of the exclusive Impella product line. In Germany, revenues grew 95% in the fourth quarter and 70% in fiscal 2018. In Japan, Abiomed exceeded expectations and expects to add $10 million in revenues in fiscal 2019.ABIOMED has a Growth Score of B and a Zacks Rank #1.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Adjusted Earnings rose 6.8% year over year. Adjustments in the quarter primarily included the impact of restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, debt redemption premium and acquisition-related items. After adjusting for foreign exchange tailwind of 2 cents, adjusted EPS was $1.44.Without these adjustments, the company’s reported net earnings of $1.07 per share, compared to 84 cents in the previous year.Full-year adjusted EPS came in at $4.77, a 4% improvement from the year-ago number.

The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion.

This also remained ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $29.76 billion.In the quarter under review, U.S. sales (52% of total revenues) fell 4.9% year over year (up 5.3% after adjusting for the divestitures) to $4.19 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.72 billion (33% of total revenues), reflecting a 4.6% increase organically (up 10.8% as reported). Emerging market revenues (15% of total revenues) amounted to $1.24 billion, up 15.5% organically (up 16.8% as reported).Segment DetailsThe company currently generates revenues from four major groups, viz. Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) and Diabetes Group.CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions (APV). MITG now includes the Surgical Innovations (SI) and the Respiratory, Gastrointestinal & Renal (RGR) divisions after the divestiture of Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis (Compression), and Nutritional Insufficiency (Enteral Feeding) businesses. RTG comprises the Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments, while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Service & Solutions (DSS) divisions.CVG revenues improved 5.4% at constant exchange rate or CER (up 10.1% as reported) to $3.14 billion, driven by strong, low-teens growth in CSH, mid-single digit growth in APV, and low-single digit growth in CRHF, all at CER.CRHF sales totaled $1.63 billion, up 1.5% year over year at CER (up 5.8% as reported). This came on the back of low-single digit growth in Arrhythmia Management. This apart, double digit growth in AF Solutions, Mechanical Circulatory Support, and TYRX in Infection Control also contributed to the growth.CSH revenues were up 12.8% at CER (up 18.7% as reported) to $81.01 billion on the back of low-20s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong global uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform. Moreover, the continued uptake of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in the United States and Japan revived the Coronary business.APV revenues registered 4.8% growth at CER (up 8.8% as reported) to $497 million, driven by low-single digit growth in both Aortic and Peripheral and mid-teens growth in endoVenous.Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteIn MITG, worldwide sales reached $2.24 billion, marking a 4.8% year-over-year increase at CER (down 14.1% on a reported basis) on high-single digit growth in SI, and a low-single digit growth in RGR, both at comparable CER basis.In RTG, worldwide revenues of $2.13 billion were up 6.1% year over year at CER (up 9% as reported) on low double-digit growth in Brain Therapies and Pain Therapies, mid-single digit growth in Specialty Therapies and low-single digit growth in the Spine business.Moreover, revenues at the Diabetes group increased 21.3% at CER (26% as reported) to $645 million.MarginsGross margin in the reported quarter expanded 136 basis points (bps) to 70.6% on a 4.9% rise in gross profit to $5.7 billion. Adjusted operating margin contracted 64 bps year over year to 29.7% owing to a 7.1% rise in research and development expenses (to $592 million) along with a 2.9% uptick in selling, general and administrative expenses (to $2.55 billion). Other expenses in the reported quarter totaled $188 million as compared with $48 million in the year-ago quarter.GuidanceThe company has provided its fiscal 2019 earnings and revenues guidance. For the full year, organic revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 4-4.5%. Currency fluctuation is expected to negatively impact the top line by $50 million- $150 million. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $31.05 billion.Fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS is expected in the range of $5.10 to $5.15, a 10% growth from the year-ago number at the mid-point of the range. This assumes a 5 cent benefit from foreign exchange. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.15 per share falls at the upper end of the guided range.Our TakeMedtronic exited the fiscal 2018 on a solid note with better-than-expected fourth quarter performances. The company demonstrated improved segmental performances at CER on growth in all business segments. However, escalating costs continue to be a concern.Moreover, all the major business groups contributed to solid top-line growth at CER, which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions, in addition to displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets. We are also encouraged by the company’s solid growth trend in the United States as well as healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies. Apart from product innovation, the company is focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses.Zacks Rank & Peer PerformancesMedtronic has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks that reported solid results this earnings season are ABIOMED, Inc.

1155,MDT,"Of late, Medtronic plc's (MDT  -  Free Report) spine business has been registering soft performance due to a challenging market scenario. Let us see if there is any possibility of a rebound this time around. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on May 24.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q4 performance is likely to be.Spine at a GlanceIn the last reported quarter, Medtronic’s spine division was flat year over year. Despite a mid-single-digit growth in BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) at CER, a low-single digit decline in Core Spine hampered overall sales.However, the company noted that though growth was sluggish, it was in line with the global spine market. Per management, the combination of advanced technologies in imaging, navigation, powered instruments and nerve monitoring has spurred growth in this division. The company has also started to demonstrate positive outcome related to its distribution relationship with Mazor Robotics.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteNevertheless, since the beginning of fiscal 2018, Medtronic is suffering from significant pricing pressure in this business, which offset the strong procedural growth. The company believes that this price reduction basically stems from consolidations within hospitals. The company stated that hospitals are getting more sophisticated with their buying patterns and are consolidating their vendor base resulting in price declines.Medtronic expects this competitive pricing pressure to reduce over the next couple of quarters leading to net procedural growth for the company. However, looking at the company’s outlook, we are uncertain of a near-term recovery. The company earlier noted that spine’s broader Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) segment growth may be marred by the impact of a slower spine market in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc.

1156,MDT,"Medtronic plc’s (MDT  -  Free Report) Diabetes Group has been on a solid growth trajectory of late, on encouraging contributions from majority of the sub-segments.We expect this strength to reflect in fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 results, which are scheduled to release before the opening bell on May 24.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q4 performance is likely to be.Diabetes in FocusMedtronic’s Diabetes Group presently comprises the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Services & Solutions (DSS) divisions. The Diabetes segment develops, manufactures, and markets advanced, integrated diabetes management solutions that includes insulin pump therapy, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, and therapy management software.We note that management expects double-digit revenue growth in the Diabetes Group in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Per management, consistently strong adoption of MiniMed 670G system in the United States along with enhanced sensor supply capacity will drive the upside.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Diabetes Group revenues of $621 million indicates a rise of 21.3% from the year-ago quarter. Also, our estimates for Diabetes Group revenues in the United States of $362 million reflect a rise of 19.5% from a year ago.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC Quote In the last reported quarter, the segment recorded improvement in sales and benefited from increased uptake of the new sensor-augmented insulin pump systems in the United States as well as in the international markets along with enhanced production capacity for the same. Notably, the MiniMed 670G system has served over 20,000 patients in the United States.This apart, management is optimistic about the uptick in consumable revenues from Animas Corporation’s (one of the Johnson & Johnson Diabetes Care Companies) users in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Moreover, they have stated that the company is progressing well with the smooth transition of Animas users. We expect the trend to continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter as well.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Medtronic proceeded with initiatives to boost the performance of its MiniMed portfolio. In February, the company expanded its product portfolio with the addition of MiniMed Mio Advance infusion set. The latest offering in the Diabetes business was planned to be made commercially available in Canada, Hong Kong and certain countries in Europe in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.In the same month, the company announced that the FDA has approved a new arm indication for the Guardian Sensor 3 continuous glucose monitor (CGM) used with the MiniMed 670G insulin pump. Notably, the Guardian Sensor 3 is the company’s latest and most accurate CGM. Per Medtronic, this is the only sensor to have received an FDA nod for controlling automated insulin delivery via a hybrid closed loop system, the MiniMed 670G.This new arm indication for the Guardian Sensor 3 offers more convenience and flexibility to patients. It is available in the United States for use with the MiniMed 670G system. We believe these developments will be beneficial to the company’s Diabetes Group portfolio, which should get reflected in the yet-to-be-reported quarter results.Let's see how things are shaping up in these sub-segments before the fourth-quarter release.IIM revenues rose in the high-teens at CER in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. However, the company witnessed 15% growth in new patient count in the United States. This growth was led by solid uptake of MiniMed 670G system in the United States with the Guardian sensor 3 CGM. In addition, the division delivered low-20s digit constant currency growth in international markets on account of continued strength in the MiniMed 640G system.Given the developments with regard to the MiniMed 670G system, we expect top-line contributions from the continued uptake of this product to rise and get reflected in the soon-to-be reported quarter results.DSS grew mid-single digits at CER as consumables benefitted from rise in installed base and enhanced patient utilization. The improvement in this business is expected to continue.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc.

Quote Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayLucrative Prospects in the RCM SpaceQuality Systems is a major player in the U.S. RCM market. The company’s NextGen RCM platform continues to win contracts from healthcare providers. The company is also increasing headcount to boost RCM adoption. NextGen Healthcare scored the highest among all ambulatory vendors for its performance in the following key RCM areas — effectiveness of claims processing, patient-facing support performance, efficiency gained by customers, sustainability of pricing and trust as a business partner.Based on the popularity of the RCM solution, the company plans to expand into dental and hospital markets, which will further boost thetopline in the quarter to be reported.In fact, based on the exclusivity of Quality Systems’ solutions, the company announced that several of its platforms received ‘Certified’ status by HITRUST in March. The HITRUST CSF Certification provides organizations with certain platforms that safeguard sensitive data through a comprehensive and flexible framework of security protocols.These are likely to boost the company’s fourth-quarter bottom line.Solid Demand for NextGen SolutionsApart from RCM, Quality Systems will continue to benefit from strong demand for its other NextGen solutions that include Hospitals, EHR and practice management in the fourth quarter. NextGen’s Inpatient Clinicals, Lab and Patient Portal EHR solutions have also been gaining considerable traction. The latest deals in the platforms with EagleDream and Entrada look promising.In fact, NextGen Healthcare unveiled a new corporate logo and brand identityin March. The new logo is the perfect representation of Quality Systems’ recent acquisitions that provided the company with a competitive edge in the MedTech space.Recurring Revenue BaseStrong recurring-revenue base has been a growth catalyst for Quality Systems, which offset the decline in perpetual licenses and related services. Solid expansion of the recurring base is likely to boost the company’s upcoming quarterly results.Meanwhile, a peek at the last reported quarter reveals that subscription-based recurring revenues accounted for 84% of total revenues. In fact, recurring revenues grew 5.5% year over year to $110 million.What Does Our Model Predict?Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Quality Systems has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +5.00%. The combination suggests that the company is likely to beat earnings estimates in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other stocks worth considering as they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the quarter to be reported.Brady Corporation (BRC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.03% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1158,MDT,"Medtronic plc’s (MDT  -  Free Report) Restorative TherapiesGroup (“RTG”) has been on a strong growth trajectory of late, on encouraging contributions from the majority of sub-segments.We expect this strength to reflect in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 results, which are scheduled to release before the opening bell on May 24.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q4 performance is expected to be.RTG in FocusMedtronic’s RTG presently comprises of Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies divisions. We note that management expects 3-4% revenue growth in RTG business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Per management, this guidance balances the ongoing strength in Pain and Brain Therapies segments with any adverse impact from the weakening spine market.Consequently, RTG’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $2.09 billion indicates rise of 60.8% from the year-ago quarter.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteIn the last reported quarter, the segment recorded improvement in sales, driven by low-double-digit growth in Brain Therapies, mid-single-digit growth in Specialty Therapies and high-single-digit growth in Pain Therapies at CER. However, revenues from the Spine business remained flat at CER on a year-over-year basis.Let's see how things are shaping up in these sub-segments before fourth-quarter results.Brain Therapies: In Brain Therapies, which now includes Neurovascular and Neurosurgery businesses, the company has been witnessing major developments. In the Neurovascular business, which received solid contributions from stroke portfolio in the last reported quarter, Medtronic announced the receipt of FDA approval for the Riptide Aspiration System in January 2018. This adds a valuable tool to the company’s Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) product portfolio benefit of which should get reflected from the yet-to-be-reported quarter itself.Further, in April, Medtronic announced the CE Mark receipt and launch of the Visualase MRI-Guided Laser Ablation System in Europe. Notably, the Visualase system can be used in neurosurgery procedures and provides advanced MRI-guided laser ablation technology. These developments should help the company continue to witness strength in the Brain Therapies business.Pain Therapies: The Pain Therapies division, which now includes Pain (Spinal Cord Stimulation and Drug Pumps) and Interventional Spine businesses, contributed encouragingly to the company’s top line in third-quarter fiscal 2018. Pain Therapies witnessed growth on the solid uptake of Intellis platform for spinal-cord stimulation as well as strength in drug pumps.In January, the company announced the receipt of FDA approval for a new clinician programmer for use with the SynchroMed II Intrathecal Drug Delivery system. Again, in April, Medtronic announced its U.S. launch of OptiSphere embolization spheres, a resorbable embolic platform, developed for embolization of hypervascular tumors.In view of the company’s efforts to develop its Pain Therapies division,we believe that solid trend will continue to reflect in the to-be-reported quarter results as well.Spine: Medtronic’s Spine division includes the Core Spine, BMP and Kanghui businesses. In the last reported quarter, a low-single-digit decline in Core Spine was more than offset by mid-single-digit growth in BMP at CER.Per management, the combination of enabling technologies like imaging, navigation, powered instruments, nerve monitoring and Mazor Robotics with spine implants has spurred growth in this division.We expect encouraging top-line contributions from the business in the to-be-reported quarter.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report). While Intuitive Surgical and Illumina sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Amedisys carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Intuitive Surgical has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 12.1%.Illumina has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 20%.Amedisys has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 17.5%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1159,MDT,"On Jul 6, we issued an updated research report on Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report). While we are encouraged by the company’s global accepted advanced therapies, its escalating costs and expenses raise concerns. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past three months, shares of Medtronic have outperformed the industry. The stock has grown 9.2% compared with the industry’s 8.8% rise.Notably, Medtronic exited fiscal 2018 on a solid note with better-than-expected fourth-quarter performances. All major business groups contributed to its solid top-line growth at CER, highlighting sustainability across groups and regions in addition to displaying a successful integration and achievement of synergy targets. Also, a gradually stabilizing Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF) market buoys optimism on the stock.The receipt of FDA approval for the DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) therapy as an adjunctive treatment to reduce partial-onset seizures raises hope for the company in the target medical market. Medtronic is also focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses. The company is highly positive about its foray into the $1-billion standalone CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) market with its Guardian Connect.We are currently upbeat about the latest FDA nod to its MiniMed 670G system for patients with type 1 diabetes between seven and 13 years of age.Significantly, Medtronic’s new restructuring initiative — Enterprise Excellence plan — is aimed at $3-billion annual growth run rate savings by the end of fiscal 2022. Per the company, this new program has been designed to increase its effectiveness and growth-related reinvestment ability along with providing a consistent boost to its margin expansion as well as driving the EPS leverage.On the flip side, the company has been exposed to steep costs and expenses, weighing heavily on its margins. Also, its 2019 guidance remains conservative on the apprehension of lackluster Cardiac and Vascular Group (CVG) plus Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG) performances. This in turn, dampens investors’ confidence in the stock.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report).Genomic Health has an expected earnings growth rate of 187.5% for the quarter to be reported. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Align Technology has a projected long-term earnings growth rate of 28.4% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Stryker has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 9.7% and a Zacks Rank of 2.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1160,MDT,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Medtronic has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Medtronic’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 24.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Medtronic has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 16.8, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Medtronic stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Medtronic has a P/S ratio of about 3.9. This higher than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3x right now. However, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, MDT is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Medtronic currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Medtronic a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Medtronic might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of D. This gives MDT a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been downbeat. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to six lower, while the full year estimate has seen two up and nine down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 4.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.6%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Medtronic PLC Price and Consensus  Medtronic PLC Price and Consensus | Medtronic PLC QuoteThe stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineMedtronic is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 34% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1161,MDT,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on May 24.Last reported quarter, the company delivered earnings ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.86%. In fact, Medtronic’s bottom line outpaced estimates in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3.54%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsWe look forward to another quarter of solid growth on the company’s successful execution of three growth strategies such as therapy innovation, globalization and an increase in Medtronic’s economic value. Combined with the demographics of an aging population, these positives have started to open up opportunities for Medtronic, which should further get reflected in the fiscal fourth quarter as well.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC Quote The space for therapy innovation is filled with multiple developments. Under the Cardiac and Vascular Group (CVG), new therapies are helping the company gain traction in the rapidly growing MedTech markets for left ventricular assist device (LVAD), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), drug-coated balloons, atrial fibrillation ablation and insertable diagnostics.In the to-be-reported quarter, Medtronic is expected to have maintained a market share in the core pacing, ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) and CRT (cardiac resynchronization therapy) product lines within the scope of CRHF (cardiac rhythm and heart failure) while creating new meaningful markets to enhance the company’s weighted average market growth.Within the TAVR space, the company hopes to see continued global growth on strong adoption of Evolut PRO valve around the world as well as expansion in the traditional U.S. TAVR centers and U.S. share capture, resulting from Medtronic’s new intermediate risk indication.After several quarters of dull Drug Eluting stent (DES) performance in coronary, the company’s DES product line witnessed growth in both the United States and Japan since the last few quarters. This upside is driven by the recent launch of Resolute Onyx in the said markets. Further, these developments buoy optimism and strengthen our belief for a strong quarterly performance by the company.Notably, following the FDA approval in February, Medtronic announced the U.S. launch of the Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm DES, the smallest sized DES in the market. We expect this to contribute to the company’s DES business in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVG revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter is pegged at $3.10 billion, 9.1% higher than the year-ago number of $2.85 billion.Within Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), surgical innovations should register sturdy growth, driven by new products in advanced stapling and advanced energy. Advanced stapling growth should come on the back of endo stapling specialty reloads with Tri-Staple technology as well as Signia. Advanced Energy growth should bank on a consistent rollout of the company’s LigaSure instruments and Valleylab FT10 energy platform.Medtronic currently remains confident about its ability to grow MITG in the mid-single-digit over the longer term.Within the Restorative Therapies Group (RTG), the company witnesses encouraging developments regarding the brain therapy space. This division experienced 5% growth during the fiscal third quarter, driven by high teens growth in neurovascular and strong sales of StealthStation navigation as well as O-arm imaging technologies, which further led to low double-digit growth in neurosurgery. We expect this bullish trend to continue in the last-completed quarter as well.Within Pain, the company awaits a positive customer uptake from Intellis platform and an evolved workflow.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTG revenues in the soon-to-be-reported quarter stands at $2.09 billion, 60.3% above the year-ago reported figure.Here’s What the Quantitative Model Predicts:Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Medtronic has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +0.09%, which raises confidence about a positive surprise. Together, the combination suggests that the company is likely to beat on earnings this period to be reported. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other stocks worth considering from the same space as our proven model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to surpass estimates in the upcoming releases:Best Buy Co., Inc.

1163,MDT,"The United States has hit rough waters of late. Few analysts label the troubles as self-invited while others foresee a revolution. Rising trade war tensions between the United States and China are showing no signs of abatement. The issue has escalated to a point where imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs may go up to $450 billion on both the sides.Moreover, President Trump’s mulling over a restriction for Chinese companies when it comes to investing in U.S. tech firms to avert technology export is likely to worsen the scenario. If this wasn’t enough, the United States is urging countries to stop importing oil from Iran by November, raising supply-related concernsFurthermore, Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from China, the European Union, Mexico and Canada along with threats of higher tariffs for imported cars and auto parts have raised concerns.MedTech on Stable GroundIn the wake of such a rocky scenario, investors are consistently on the lookout for safer sectors. With tailwinds like favorable consumer behavior, growing demand for liquid biopsy tests along with deferred implementation of an industry-wide Medical Device tax backing the sector, the medical device space seems to be in safer territories. Per Emergo, the U.S. Medical Device industry is likely to be worth $173 billion by 2019.Minimally-Invasive Surgical Device Market Hogs LimelightFor investors trying to pick a sub-industry with booming prospects, the minimally-invasive surgical device market is the final stop.Reduced stay at hospital, lower healthcare costs and pain, scaring and tissue-damage  are certain benefits of opting for minimally-invasive surgery over the traditional process.Persistence Market Research estimates the global minimally-invasive surgical device market to value around $18,900 million in 2022, at a CAGR of 6.8% between 2017 and 2022. Per a report by Mordor intelligence, the U.S. minimally invasive surgery device market is projected to see a CAGR of 8.65% between 2018 and 2023.Factors Driving the MarketThe minimally-invasive surgical device market is largely dependent on the aging population. Per the U.S. Census Bureau report, in 2050, people aged 65 or more are likely to total 83.7 million, almost double its estimated population of 43.1 million in 2012. Data also shows that the median age is increasing in most areas of the country and the global scenario is pretty similar.Strengthening emerging markets have been contributing largely to the rise in demand for minimally-invasive surgical devices. Geographically, the market is divided into North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and Middle East & Africa. Per Wise Guy Reports, the demand for minimally-invasive surgical devices will be solid in the Asia-Pacific region, the expected CAGR being 12.2% between 2016 and 2021.The growing dominance of AI applications in healthcare and technological revolution, new avenues and opportunities in the minimally-invasive surgical devices space with robot-assisted surgeries being in vogue.

This new breakthrough is expected to expand the company’s Interventional Pain Therapies business within the broader Restorative Therapies Group (RTG).Per Medtronic, the fixation will be done using sacral vertebroplasty or sacroplasty. With this expanded indication, the company will be able to broaden its commitment toward the treatment of pathological fractures of the vertebral body caused by osteoporosis, cancer or benign lesions. The company claims this advancement to offer clinicians more options in curing patients with sacral insufficiency fractures (SIF).Notably, SIFs are a common cause for debilitating back pain. Per American Journal of Neuroradiology (ANJR), SIFs are a frequent yet often unsuspected reason behind low back pain in the elderly patients. Very recently, sacroplasty emerged as an alternative therapy for the treatment of SIFs. According to ANJR, prospective studies and case reports suggest that it is a safe and effective remedy.Per Medtronic, SIFs show the symptoms of lumbar spine pathology. Going by studies, more than two-thirds of SIF patients fail to associate their pain with a traumatic event. Evidently, they are often being prescribed with conservative treatment options including physical therapy and prolonged bed rest. These are highly expensive choices inducing loss of productivity within the healthcare system. Also, patients put to bed rest are at a rising risk of pulmonary embolism and DVT as well as further muscle atrophy and bone loss.Meanwhile, SIF patients treated with sacroplasty experience immediate pain relief, allowing them to resume daily activity and/or physical therapy without suffering pain and physical limitations. More encouragingly, the procedure of sacroplasty with HV-R cement is pretty simple owing to its minimally-invasive procedure and the therapy can be performed in an outpatient setting.Demographic Change and SIFGoing by a report published in National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), epidemiologic changes in first and second world countries will inevitably lead to a constant increase of the grey populace. Also, per the United Nations data, global aging population (aged 60 years or above) came in at 962 million in 2017, more than double the figure registered in 1980, when the strength of senior citizens was 382 million worldwide. The number is again expected to grow twice as dense by 2050 when it is projected to reach nearly 2.1 billion.Therefore, detection of SIF among elderly adults, is markedly gaining prominence with huge prospects for its treatment market. Hence, we believe Medtronic’s latest innovation in this space to be well-timed and strategic.Price Performance Medtronic has outperformed the industry in three months’ time. The stock has gained 9.9% compared with the industry's rise of 7.4%.Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corp.

1165,MDT,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) recently announced the initiation of a clinical study — The Bifurcation Cohort — to evaluate the efficiency and safety standards of drug-eluting stents (DES) for treating bifurcation lesions.Study in DetailsThe Bifurcation Cohort, part of the RESOLUTE ONYX Post-Approval Study, will cover 250 patients with bifurcation lesions from 30 sites in the United States and Europe. It will be enrolling patients suffering with coronary artery disease (CAD) and receiving Resolute Onyx DES in diameter sizes varying from 2.0-5.0 mm. Notably, the Resolute Onyx DES is not approved for treating bifurcation lesions in the United States. Further, the primary endpoint for the study will be target vessel failure at 12 months.Per Medtronic, data from the study will be submitted to the FDA for expanded indication approval including bifurcation lesions for the Resolute Onyx DES. Further, the company stated that bifurcation lesions are responsible for 20% of all percutaneous coronary interventions. Thus, we believe the positive data will provide impetus to the company’s efforts to achieve expanded FDA approval for the Resolute Onyx DES and accelerate business growth.CSH PerformanceMedtronic is consistently trying to enhance its Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) segment, which is part of the Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG) segment.CSH revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2018 were up 14% at CER (18% as reported) on low-30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform and expanded FDA approval to include patients at intermediate risk.Moreover, continued uptake of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in the United States and Japan revived the business.We encouragingly note that Medtronic recently received FDA nod for the U.S. launch of the Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm drug-eluting stent. The stent is the smallest in size in the market presently. The Resolute Onyx DES is available for use in all sizes in the United States, Europe and in countries that recognize the CE Mark.Market PotentialMedtronic’s strategy to gain traction in the CSH segment seems to be aligned with data provided by Transparency Market Research. Per the report, the global coronary stent market is expected to see a CAGR of 6.6% from 2013 to 2019.More specifically, the DES market within the Coronary stents market is expanding fast.

1167,MDT,"With several tailwinds gradually flowing in, opportunities are growing enormously within the medical device space. The sector is currently enjoying the investment world’s attention. While investors are putting their efforts in picking a subindustry that is beaming with prospects, the name which pops up first is the cardiovascular devices market.Per World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases are disorders of the heart and blood vessels. It includes coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions.Going by the latest Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics 2018 report by American Heart Association, around 92.1 million U.S. adults are living with some form of cardiovascular disease or the after-effects of stroke. Further, cardiovascular diseases have been deemed to be a major cause of death of around 836,546 people in the United States.  Notably, this is gradually taking the shape of a deadly epidemic. Globally, the scenario is quite intriguing. Per a WHO report, cardiovascular diseases are the major cause behind 31% of all global deaths and took the lives of 17.7 million people in 2015.Notably, projections related to the disease hint at the continuation of the present trend. In this regard, the number of deaths globally due to cardiovascular diseases is expected to increase to more than 23.6 million by 2030. Moreover, total direct expenditures related to cardiovascular diseases are expected to rise to $749 billion in 2035.It goes without saying that the rising incidence of cardiovascular diseases globally has opened up opportunities for cardiovascular device makers. The market is expected to witness CAGR of 6.7% to reach $81.38 billion between 2017 and 2027 (per a report by Visiongain).Accordingly, for investors who are keen to effectively put their money for longer-term gains, the cardiovascular devices market undoubtedly holds immense potential.Factors Driving Cardiovascular Devices MarketRising healthcare expenditures, unhealthy lifestyle practices along with expanded treatment options have been driving demand. Per a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board, U.S. healthcare spending is projected to rise to around $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of GDP (based on the assumption that the Affordable Care Act will continue through 2025).The cardiovascular devices market is largely dependent on the aging population. Per the U.S. Census Bureau report, in 2050, people aged 65 or more are likely to total 83.7 million, almost double its estimated population of 43.1 million in 2012. Data also shows that the median age is increasing in most areas of the country and the global scenario is pretty similar.Strengthening emerging markets have been contributing largely to the rise in demand for cardiovascular devices. Per an article by a leading market intelligence firm, Life Science Intelligence, the demand for some cardiovascular devices has been growing at solid double-digit rates in many emerging countries, including the BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) and Turkey of late.AI Brings a New EraAccording to a research firm TechEmergence, AI is being broadly used in the following three categories for better management of cardiovascular diseases.Artificial intelligence is being applied to automate the Atrial fibrillation process falling under the ECG monitoring category. It is also being used by companies to accurately predict the risk of cardiovascular disease and its related impacts. Finally, the companies are also involved in actively using the AI platform to improve the accuracy of patient scans for detecting cardiovascular diseases.There are certain developments, which deserve a mention here. A leading digital health company Analytics 4 Life is actively involved in designing a machine learning algorithm to detect coronary artery disease non-invasively (without radiation or accelerating the heart).Cardiotrack, an India-based start-up, recently introduced a technology platform that uses a hand-held device, cloud storage and artificial intelligence to capture and analyze electrocardiogram signals for specific heart conditions.Stocks to Watch Out ForWe have selected three companies, which we believe can tap the promising prospects of the cardiovascular devices market.Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has Cardiovascular and Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) as two of its three reportable segments.

1169,MDT,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) has made another encouraging move with respect to its Aortic & Peripheral Vascular (APV) business. The company recently announced the receipt of FDA approval for 200mm and 250mm lengths of the IN.PACT Admiral Drug-Coated Balloon (DCB) for treating long superficial femoral artery (SFA) lesions in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).Per the company, in April, Medtronic received approval to treat SFA lesions of up to 360mm in length, on the back of supporting clinical data from the complex lesion imaging cohorts of the IN.PACT Global Study, also covering long lesion, in-stent restenosis and chronic total occlusion groups with lesion lengths >180mm.We note that the IN.PACT Admiral DCB received FDA approval in December 2014, to treat superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. Moreover, it is commercially available in Europe since its receipt of the CE mark approval in 2009. So far, more than 200,000 PAD patients in Europe have been treated with the device.A Glimpse of APV BusinessInterestingly, Medtronic’s revenues from the APV division improved 8.8% year over year (up 4.8% at constant exchange rate) in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. Moreover, the Peripheral Vascular business grew on a low-single digit.

1170,MDT,"With the suspension of the controversial 2.3% medical device tax for another two years, the medical device industry is currently riding high on optimism. AdvaMed, the medical device industry’s lobbying group, which strongly advocated for this relief, noted that the tax repeal will provide a huge impetus to the companies to channelize their turnovers into strategic consolidations, research and developments and also help in creating new job opportunities.According to an article published in Daily News, the tax before going into effect from January 2020 will save the device companies as much as $3.7 billion during the two-year suspension.The U.S. medical device market is undergoing substantial transformation. An aging population, longer expectancy for life, growing healthcare awareness in emerging economies combined with powerful long-term tailwinds, including mergers & acquisitions (M&As) and product innovation, have been contributing to growth of the sector.M&A Boom Continues It is yet to be seen how far the benefits of the tax repeal have been redirected to M&As till now. Meanwhile, according to Mark Bonifacio, President of Bonifacio Consulting Services, private equity and strategic OEM (Original equipment manufacturer) buyers are competing for assets in all sectors of medical contract manufacturing and broadening their portfolios or investing in new technologies.He strongly stated that although the start of 2018 was sluggish with respect to M&As, it was due to uncertainties over changes in the global healthcare market and the fate of Obamacare’s medical device tax. Now that the doubts are gradually getting cleared, the industry is once again heading toward another year of significant M&A activity.This year’s biggest M&A deal seems to be in the cards with the Wall Street Journal’s latest rumored news related to two mammoths of MedTech space, Boston Scientific BSX and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report). The report says that both the rivals may consider a bid for consolidation.The analysts seem to be optimistic about the rumored deal and believe that after the colossal mergers of Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report)-Covidien and Abbott (ABT)-St. Jude Medical in the last couple of years, Boston Scientific also needs to make a mammoth move to maintain its foothold in the highly competitive medical-technology space.Following the company’s $25 billion consolidation with St. Jude Medical in January, Abbott ABT recently closed the $5.3-billion acquisition of Alere. With the successful wrap up of this transaction, the combined company is anticipated to emerge as a leading player in the $7 billion point-of-care diagnostic space.Another mega consolidation in the recent times was that of medical device major, Becton, Dickinson and Co. and medical, surgical, diagnostic, and patient care devices provider C. R. Bard, for $24 billion. After the completion of the deal in January, Becton, Dickinson is on its way to expand to new areas like vascular access segments – PICCs (peripherally inserted central catheters), midlines and drug delivery ports.Baxter International BAX purchased RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant from specialty pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt plc (MNK  -  Free Report).Varian Medical (VAR  -  Free Report) also inked a major M&A deal. The company recently signed an agreement to acquire Australia-based global life sciences company, Sirtex Medical Limited for a total deal value of $1.28 billion. The investment will strengthen the company’s position in interventional oncology therapies. This apart, in its effort to gain foothold in the emerging economy, the company recently acquired Cooperative CL Enterprises, a leading distributor of radiotherapy equipment in Taiwan.Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary DePuy Synthes inked a deal to acquire Medical Enterprises Distribution in May.This apart, in 2018, Boston Scientific announced several strategic acquisitions including NxThera and nVision in Urology and Pelvic Health, EmCision in Endoscopy, Securus in EP and Millipede in Structural Heart. This inorganic expansion plan bodes well for the stocks’ operational growth.Divestments Medical device majors continue to offload their non-core business lines and assets that are similar to the ones acquired through mergers to focus on the main segments. These divestures have been mandated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other international anti-trust regulators. This restricts chances of monopoly in the market.Earlier this month, Johnson & Johnson got a $2.7 billion offer from Fortive Corporation to sell its subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc.’s Advanced Sterilization Products business units to Fortive. If JNJ accepts the proposal, it will be a step toward streamlining of its business per its strategic roadmap for better resource utilization and higher shareholders’ return.This apart, according to a MASSDEVICE report, Medtronic recently divested its stake in LifeTech Scientific to China Everbright Ltd. and another unnamed investor. BD also divested its soft tissue core needle biopsy line and Aspira product line to Merit Medical for $100 million. The divestment is related to its acquisition of C.R.

1171,MDT,"Medtronic plc’s (MDT  -  Free Report) brain therapy business gets a boost with the recent FDA approval for the company’s latest Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Clinician Programmer and ActivaProgramming Application. This U.S. approval has come close on the heels of the European CE mark approval for the same in March 2018.Notably, DBS therapy is a surgical procedure for placing a medical device to deliver electrical stimulation to the accurate lead location of the brain in order to reduce some of the most disabling motor symptoms.Per Medtronic, the ActivaProgramming Application, designed for use with Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 tablets, incorporates the inputs of above 100 clinicians globally. Therefore, this treatment is helpful in streamlining workflows and enhancing clinical programming experience. The company also claims this program to be useful in providing support to neurologists and neurosurgeons in treating Parkinson`s and Dystonia patients using the company’s Activa DBS system therapy.Apart from these two neurological diseases, the Medtronic DBS Clinician Programmer is also approved for use with Medtronic Activa DBS systems, which treat medically refractory epilepsy, a therapy to be launched later this year in the United States.Approximately 125,000 Medtronic Activa devices have been globally implanted so far. Needless to say, the latest FDA and CE Mark approvals for the ActivaProgramming Application will immediately improve programming interactions, which are critical to post-implant care for thousands of patients. The programmer will also enable the upgrade of Activa rechargeable implantable neurostimulators service life to 15 years, providing patients with additional six years until their next device replacement.Medtronic and Brain TherapyIn Brain therapies, Medtronic is leading the development of the endovascular therapy market for the treatment of ischemic strokes resulting in high-teens growth in neurovascular in the last reported fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. The company also had a great quarter in neurosurgery with low-double-digit growth highlighting strong demand for StealthStation S8 Navigation systems, the Mazor X robotic guidance systems and Visualase MRI-guided laser ablation system. Worldwide, Medtronic’s DBS therapy has already gained much popularity. It has won approval in several places internationally including the United States and Europe, to cure disabling symptoms of essential tremor and the Parkinson's disease. In 2017, the company announced the receipt of Health Canada license for SureTune 3 software for DBS. In Europe, Canada and Australia, DBS therapy already owns the license to treat refractory epilepsy.Per a Transparency Market Research report, the global deep brain stimulation devices market is estimated to reach a value of worth of $3.21 billion in 2020 at a CAGR of 8.9%. The company clearly boasts a huge growth potential in this market.Share Price PerformanceOver the past three months, shares of Medtronic have outperformed the industry it belongs to.

1172,MDT,"Patterson Companies, Inc.’s (PDCO  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results are expected to release on May 24, before the market opens. While results are likely to show a decline in the core Dental segment, growth across other segments is likely to make up to some extent.The third quarter of fiscal 2018 was a dismal one, with adjusted earnings of 43 cents per share declining 25.9% year over year. Moreover, the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents. Patterson recorded revenues of $1.375 billion, which also fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.382 billion. Also, revenues dropped 1.6% from the year-ago quarter.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.43 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 1%. The same for earnings per share is pinned at 31 cents, showing a year-over-year decline of 55.1%.Notably, Patterson has a negative average earnings surprise of 2.8% for the trailing four quarters.Let’s delve deeper.Patterson Companies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Patterson Companies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Patterson Companies, Inc. QuoteDental Segment in FocusIn the last reported quarter, this segment accounted for 42% of total sales. Revenues in the segment came in at $577.9 million in the quarter, down 8.1% at constant currency (cc). Revenues were marred by changes in sales force, disruptions from enterprise resource planning implementation and the expansion of the company’s digital equipment portfolio.Moreover, for the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues is pegged at $574 million, which shows a decline of 5.4% on a year-over-year basis.Dental Consumables accounted for 22% of the total revenues in the last reported quarter. The segment posted revenues of $302.3 million, down 7.4% year over year.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the sub-segment’s revenues is pinned at $319 million, down 5.9% from the prior-year quarter.Meanwhile, the Equipment and Software sub-segment accounted for 4.8% of total sales in the fiscal third quarter. The segment posted revenues worth $65.6 million, down 3.4% from a year ago.Furthermore, for the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues is fixed at $182 million, down 6.2% year over year.Other Factors at PlayGuidance DownbeatFollowing an unsatisfactory fiscal third quarter, Patterson lowered its guidance for fiscal 2018. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.65-$1.70, much lower than the previously issued band of $2-$2.10.Deal amortization expenses of $26.9 million or 29 cents per share are expected in fiscal 2018.Moreover, the company estimates integration and business restructuring expenses of $5.7 million or 6 cents per share.ERP IssueThe loss of exclusive distribution rights with Dentsply Sirona has forced the company to shift to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to efficiently manage inventory. The ongoing ERP transition has proven to be disruptive to performance and is likely to pose challenges in the days ahead. In the last reported quarter, ERP issues have dented margins, leading to gross margin contraction of 200 basis points (bps).Moreover, the Dental segment’s sales were affected by the company’s expanding digital equipment portfolio. Per management, the company’s working capital continues to be impacted negatively by the implementation of the ERP system.The company is also grappling with certain legislative issues. We believe these headwinds will mar Patterson’s results in the quarter to be reported.Animal Health SegmentPer management, though Patterson’s core Animal Health segment faced product mix-related challenges in the last reported quarter, it represented 58% of total sales. Furthermore, sales rose 4.2% at cc on a year-over-year basis to $794.9 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $847 million, up 6.5% sequentially. Management expects a sequential upside in sales.Animal Health consumable is also expected to see a strong fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the sub-segment’s sales is pinned at $828 million, up 7.3%, sequentially.What Does Our Model Predict?Our quantitative model does not show a beat for Patterson this earnings season.

1173,MDT,"As a major setback to the company’s investors, Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report)  recently foresees a significant impact of Hurricane Maria on second-quarter fiscal 2018 sales. Having acquired a category 5 status, Hurricane Maria has been placed among the top 10 most intense Atlantic hurricanes on record, thus hitting the company’s business in Puerto Rico quite hard.Adding to the woes, the company has a level of manufacturing setup for all its four business groups — viz. Cardiac & Vascular Group (''CVG''), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (''MITG''), Restorative Therapies Group (''RTG'') and Diabetes Group — in Puerto Rico. While the facilities are gradually getting operative since Oct 2, the sites are only partially active at present on power supply from back-up generators.With considerable repairing done, the company expects the normal manufacturing process to get fully restored in the coming weeks.Financial ImpactsMedtronic has provided a statement on the company’s financial health badly hurt by  Maria and further affecting the overall business. Notably, in line with business continuity protocols, the company is utilizing the existing inventory levels and increasing manufacturing processes in locations outside Puerto Rico for multiple products.Medtronic projects both fiscal second-quarter 2018 revenue and adjusted net earnings to show the impact to the extent of $250 million. More specifically, the MITG and the RTG groups are expected to be worst hit. Notably, this quarter will close on Oct 27, 2017.Significantly, the company forecasts some non-recurring expenses, directly related to recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, which will be excluded from adjusted earnings. However, expenses related to the effects outside Puerto Rico will be considered operating expenses.Incidentally, Medtronic is lacks enough visibility about the impact of Maria, post the second quarter. However, forecasting a strong new product demand, particularly in the CVG and Diabetes Group, the company continues to expect mid-single digit revenue growth (on a comparable, constant currency basis) in the second half of fiscal 2018.Despite the Maria-related impact, the company reaffirmed the fiscal second quarter and full-year fiscal 2018 guidances.Among the company’s many supports toward disaster management, the Medtronic Foundation has directed $1 million for disaster relief to date and is matching employee contributions to authorized agencies.Price Performance Over the last three months, Medtronic has been observed to underperform the broader industry.  The stock has declined 8.5% versus the broader industry’s  4.7% gain during this period. Sad but true, this gloomy scenario is likely to continue per the company’s latest financial prediction due to Maria.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Orthofix International N.V. (OFIX  -  Free Report), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report). While Orthofix International sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), IDEXX Laboratories and Thermo Fisher carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1174,MDT,"Shares of Mazor Robotics (MZOR  -  Free Report) surged over 5% on Wednesday to touch a new all-time high. Now the question for investors is: should you consider buying the surgical robotics maker’s stock?Mazor Robotics’ medical devices focus on robotic guidance technology to help assist surgeons. The company has seen its stock price skyrocket from under $25 per share at the start of the year to its new all-time intraday trading high of $52.20 a share. This alone might scare away investors who are worried that it will be hard for Mazor Robotics to break through a new threshold soon.Let’s take a look at what the company does and some of its current fundamentals to see if it might be a stock for investors to consider.Company Mazor Robotics is a young surgical robotics company with a market cap of $1.28 billion that operates out of offices in Orlando, Florida and Caesarea, Israel. The company currently makes two different pieces of robotic surgery equipment, the “Mazor X” and “Renaissance.” The products are designed to help innovate surgical techniques for spine surgeries. The surgical assurance platforms help surgeons maximize procedural predictability and patient benefits. The larger, trademarked Mazor X features a workstation with a large touchscreen monitor that serves as a guidance screen and the surgeon’s control panel. The robotic guidance system has a surgical arm, a 3D camera with special tracking, and a surgical control system.The company’s core focus is on pre-op analytics, intra-op guidance, and intra-op verification, which allows the surgeon to review the surgical plan in 3D, while the brace along with the surgical arm provide more control and precision than a human.The concept is relatively simple: a surgeon operates at a workstation near the patient and the robotic components essentially perform the physical act of the surgery on the patient.Mazor Robotics’ products have caught some investors’ eyes already, including medical device giant Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report). Medtronic purchased a stake in Mazor Robotics last year as part of a deal that allowed Medtronic to distribute the Mazor X system.Mazor Robotics announced recently that the two companies would further their partnership, with Medtronic’s total investment in the company climbing to $72 million.Current Fundamentals Mazor Robotics is currently a Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy), with “C” grades for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system. Like many young experimental medical and biotech companies, Mazor Robotics does not currently represent great value to investors. Because it is still unprofitable, the company currently has no price-to-earnings ratio, and has a P/B ratio of 19.34 and a 26.26 P/S ratio.Mazor Robotics’ 0.60 Sales/Assets ratio falls just short of the industry average. Yet the company looks to be on a solid growth trajectory with current cash flow growth of 20.08%, beating the “Medical – Instruments” industry average of 4.37%.Over the last 12 weeks, the company’s stock price has climbed 17.80%, which tops the industry’s 0.31% loss. Mazor Robotics 129.33% year-to-date price change crushes the industry average as well as the S&P 500.Within the last 60 days, the surgical robotics company has received one full-year upward earnings estimate revision, as well as one for the following year. Mazor Robotics earnings are projected to pop 4.35% for its current quarter based on our consensus estimates. The firm’s full-year EPS is expected to fall 3.01% to post an $0.89 per share loss.Yet, the company’s revenues are projected to skyrocket 92.66% this quarter and 59.16% for the year. This indicates that the early stage medical device company is clearly expanding rapidly but this expansion has been costly.Bottom LineInvestors who can handle the ebbs and flows that often come along with young firms in the biotech and medical device industries might consider Mazor Robotics, especially if Medtronic decides to buy the firm outright down the road.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1176,MDT,"On Nov 17, 2017, we issued an updated research report on medical device major, Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As we wait for the company to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results on Nov 21 2017, the market depicts a bearish picture per the latest preliminary sales update by Medtronic.Over the past three months, shares of the company have significantly underperformed the broader industry. The stock has declined 5% versus the broader industry’s gain of 4.5%.Per the preliminary results, worldwide revenues for the quarter are expected to dip 4% year over year to $7.05 billion. This dull revenue estimate for the quarter to be reported is mainly due to the company’s divestiture of its Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis (Compression) and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses to Cardinal Health at the beginning of the quarter.Also, per the preliminary report, the impact from Hurricane Maria was approximately $55-$65 million on the company’s second-quarter top line. Besides, the hurricane left an adverse impact of roughly 3 cents on its second-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS).However, despite this year-over-year drag in preliminary sales, it is encouraging to note that the latest projection is actually an improvement from the company’s earlier anticipation of Maria’s impact on its financial standing, provided a month back. That time, Medtronic had projected both fiscal second-quarter 2018 revenues and adjusted net earnings to the extent of $250 million.Also we believe that the aforementioned divestitures align with the company’s disciplined portfolio management strategy. Per the company, the above businesses do not fall under Medtronic’s core product line and hence remain deprived of the required investment and focus at present.Divestment of these non-core non-profitable businesses will help Medtronic focus more on core products. This in turn will also enable the company to invest in long-term, high-return, internal and external opportunities that are more directly aligned with the company’s growth strategies of therapy innovation, globalization and economic value.The stabilizing trend in the global Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF) market is another upside. We are optimistic about this solid growth trend continuing in the United States as well as the healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) and Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1179,MDT,"United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of $4.41 per share (including stock-based compensation benefit but excluding charges) for the second quarter of 2017, which were better than $4.39 per share in the year-ago quarter.United Therapeutics said it has set aside $210 million for a potential settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to resolve an investigation related to its contribution to non-profit organizations that provide financial assistance to patients, thereby violating federal securities laws. In the quarter, the company recorded a $210 million charge as an estimated loss contingency in relation to this matter. It also recorded an impairment charge related to cost method investments in a privately-held company, which experienced an event triggering an impairment analysis.Including these charges and stock-based compensation benefit, the company incurred a loss of $1.25 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.61 by 134.63%.Revenues for the reported quarter rose 8% year over year to $445.0 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $402 million. Stronger sales across the pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) franchise pulled up the top line in the quarter.Despite the better-than-expected sales performance, shares declined almost 5% on Thursday in response to the potential settlement expense. A look at United Therapeutics’ share price movement shows that the stock has underperformed the industry this year so far. United Therapeutics stock has declined 12.8% during this period, while the industry rose 7.1%.The Quarter in DetailUnited Therapeutics markets four products for the treatment of PAH – Remodulin, Tyvaso, Adcirca and Orenitram.Orenitram reported sales of $46.0 million in the quarter, up 21% year over year.

However, sales of both Tyvaso and Remodulin improved sequentially in the quarter. Unituxin (for the treatment of pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma) sales of $16.1 million were down 10% year over year.Lately, the growth of United Therapeutics’ PAH drugs Orenitram, Tyvaso and Remodulin have slowed down due to competition. Last quarter, the company had said that patients were staying longer on front-line oral AMBITION therapy (Adcirca + Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Letairis) and delaying the transition to inhaled/injectable therapies like Tyvaso/Remodulin, thereby hurting their demand.Meanwhile, the drugs are also facing strong competition from Actelion’s, now a part of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), new drug Uptravi (selexipag).Initial treatment in PAH is typically with orally delivered drugs followed by prostacyclins therapies. At the first quarter earnings call, management had said that the longer use of oral therapies resulted in a large backlog of patients eligible for prostacyclin therapy like its PAH medicines – suggesting that sales trends could improve. With sales of Tyvaso, Remodulin and Orenitram improving in the second quarter from first quarter levels, management believes that it is seeing early signs of this transition from ambition regimen back to its PAH drugs.Research and development (R&D) expenses (including stock-based compensation benefit) increased 70% to $59.8 million due to higher costs to support its pipeline of cardiopulmonary and cancer drugs and to develop organ manufacturing projects.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses (including stock-based compensation benefit) declined 7% to $67.4 million as lower consulting and marketing costs offset higher legal costs.Pipeline UpdateUnited Therapeutics is working with medical device maker Medtronic, Inc. (MDT  -  Free Report) to get an implantable pump for delivering Remodulin (RemoSynch) approved by the FDA. In order to launch RemoSynch in the U.S., United Therapeutics and Medtronic are pursuing parallel regulatory filings related to the device and the drugWe remind investors that in April, United Therapeutics announced that regulatory issues will delay the planned U.S. launch of RemoSynch. The company now expects to launch RemoSynch sometime in 2018 against the first half of this year, as expected previously.  United Therapeutics is also working with DEKA for the development of a pre-filled, semi-disposable pump system for the subcutaneous delivery of Remodulin (RemUnity- launch expected in 2019). Clinical studies on RemoPro, a pain-free new chemical entity version of treprostinil, are expected to begin this year.Other phase III pipeline programs include an oral combination therapy of Orenitram - OreniPlus (FREEDOM-EV study), Tysuberprost (esuberaprost in combination with Tyvaso), Tyvaso-ILD (Tyvaso being evaluated in patients with PAH associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) and OreniLeft (PAH with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction).United Therapeutics is also developing dinutuximab, the active ingredient in Unituxin, for small cell lung cancer (phase III) and other high-risk forms of cancer with GD2 expressing cell tumors such as ovarian cancer and several sarcomas.United Therapeutics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1180,MDT,"One of the world’s largest medical technology, services and solutions companies, Medtronic plc  (MDT  -  Free Report) is making efforts to expand its Pelvic Health & Gastric Therapies business, part of the company's core Restorative Therapies Group. The company has announced that its InterStim system provides sustained long-term efficacy and improved quality of life for overactive bladder (OAB) patients at the end of five years.What is the InterStim system?Notably, the InterStim system delivers sacral neuromodulation therapy for bladder control issues. InterStim therapy uses neuromodulation or gentle nerve stimulation to normalize the brain-bladder communication pathway. On the other hand, OAB hampers the quality of life by disturbing the routine activities of individuals because of urinary incontinence and excessive urination.InterStim system is thought to restore bladder function by targeting the sacral nerves to help alleviate symptoms.Taking the rapidly growing market of OAB into consideration, we expect this development to be perfectly strategic for Medtronic. Going by data provided by Medtronic, the number of OAB patients in America is over 37 million, which implies that one in every six individuals faces the problem in America. According to a market research report by Technavio’s analysts, the OAB therapeutics market will see a CAGR of almost 2% during the 2017–2021 period. InSite study results revealed that 82% of OAB patients had therapeutic success (greater than 50% improvement in symptoms) at the end of five years with sustained, safe and better quality of life. Notably, thestudy assessed the efficiency and safety of the system at five-years in patients who had bothersome OAB symptoms and could not tolerate more traditional treatments, including urinary urge incontinence (UI) and/or urgency-frequency (UF). However, implanting an InterStim system is as risky as any surgical procedure. Device-related unfavorable events were undesirable change in stimulation, implant site pain and ineffectiveness.Over the last six months, Medtronic has outperformed the S&P 500 index. As per the latest share price movement, the company has gained 14.3%, compared to the S&P 500’s 8.9% gain.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company had announced the receipt of a binding offer from Platinum Equity in March.The LifeScan unit makes blood glucose monitoring products and generated revenues of $1.5 billion last year.J&J stock has declined 12.3% this year so far, which compares unfavorably with a decrease of 4% recorded by the industry.The move was in line with J&J’s strategic plans for its diabetes business. The company has been planning to streamline its non-core assets since last year. As part of the streamlining efforts, J&J had announced the closing of operations at its Animas Corporation diabetes care unit in October last year. The company has arranged a deal with medical device maker, Medtronic, Inc. (MDT  -  Free Report) for the transition of patients on Animas insulin pump to Medtronic pump. Meanwhile, J&J also received an offer of $2.8 billion from Fortive Corporation (FTV  -  Free Report) earlier this month for its Advanced Sterilization Products business.Moreover, sales in J&J’s Diabetes Care franchise declined 9.7% in 2017 to $1.6 billion due to price decline and competitive pressure. Thus, streamlining these assets is likely to boost margins as well cash position of the company.Johnson & Johnson Price  Johnson & Johnson Price | Johnson & Johnson QuoteZacks RankJ&J currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1182,MDT,"Shares of Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) gained 7.4% to close at $34.32 on Jun 11, 2018, following a speculation that the company's rival Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) might consider a bid for acquiring the former. This news is per a Wall Street Journal report.Trading in both stocks was temporarily paused during Monday's session on the NYSE. Per yesterday’s close, Boston Scientific’s market cap was $47.5 billion as compared to Stryker's $63 billion.Following the above, a Reuters’ report stated that it is still unclear whether Boston Scientific is open to a potential buyout proposal by Stryker. The prospective acquirer too declined to comment on the report.Meanwhile, a Benzinga report wrote, “Any bid would have to surpass $40 per share, according to Stifel Nicolaus, and Wells Fargo predicted shares could be valued around $42, based on the Becton Dickinson-CR Bard deal, according to Bloomberg.”Previous BSX-Stryker AllianceSignificantly, this is not the first time that Stryker and Boston Scientific have come up for strategic collaborations. Back in 2010, the orthopaedic devices giant bought Boston Scientific’s Neurovascular unit for $1.5 billion. That time, the rationale behind this divestment decision by Boston Scientific came as part of the company’s aggressive restructuring initiatives. More specifically, the neurovascular division, one of the company’s non-core businesses, was struggling with depressed sales.Rationale Behind Latest Rumored DealWhile Boston Scientific’s position on the prospects of the possible sell-off rumor is still unknown, some analysts believe that the reason behind the company’s contemplation over a probable sell-off might lie in its interest to gain a further competitive edge in the medical device space.It is important to note that post the colossal mergers of Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report)-Covidien and Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report)-St. Jude Medical over the last couple of years, Boston Scientific also needed to make a mammoth move to maintain its foothold in the highly competitive medical-technology space.If the merger gets to materialize finally, considering both Boston Scientific and Stryker’s present market cap, then the consolidated entity will have a combined market cap of more than $110 billion. According to Wells Fargo Securities, this is a position only behind Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson in terms of total device revenues.Reacting to this widely speculated buyout bid, retired Twin Cities med-tech stock analyst Thom Gunderson said that it  “makes perfect sense to me. Go big or go home is the rule of the day.""The analysts seem optimistic about the alleged deal and believe that if it finally works out, Boston Scientific will score a vantage point in the fast-growing competitive heart valve replacement market where it is currently trailing behind Edwards Lifesciences (EW  -  Free Report) and Medtronic.Also, this merger is expected to reduce costs for the combined company at a time when the healthcare industry is already battling against severe pricing pressure.Share Price ComparisonOver the past year, shares of Boston Scientific have rallied 22.9%, ahead of Stryker’s 20.3% increase. While the broader sector remained much below with a 2.2% rise.Both Boston Scientific and Stryker currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1183,MDT,"The medical device tax suspension up to Jan 1, 2020, is one of the very few amendments that have garnered the maximum number of bipartisan votes in the House.Since its enactment in 2013, the 2.3% tax has been quite a menace for the medical device industry. Per a statement by the Advanced Medical Technology Association lobbying group, the tax had a significant negative impact on medical innovation and employment. Considering this, the House placed a suspension on the tax from January 2016 to December 2017 only to bring it back on Jan 1, 2018.But recently, the House came up with a $31-billion bill on tax cuts, which included the abatement of the infamous medical device tax.While the MedTech fraternity has been cheering the latest repeal, the share price and net margin performance of the medical device manufacturers is showing a different story. Let’s delve deeper.How Glitzy is the Repeal for MedTech?Innumerable reports claim that the repeal will ramp up domestic production, increase hiring of skilled professionals and lower the nation’s overdependence on offshore production.Further, MedTech bigwigs are expected to enhance the R&D, improve margins, launch products, reduce capital depreciation, invest in early-stage MedTech companies, execute clinical trials and in turn fuel the next generation of U.S. Medical-Device industry by reinvesting profits (tax savings).Notably, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) shelled out a lump sum $180 million as medical device sales tax in 2014. Meanwhile, medical device giant Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) reported net earnings of $1.14 billion and paid approximately $229 million as medical device excise tax in 2015 — nearly 16% of earnings (data from a Med Device Online report). If the tax didn’t exist, analysts believe the companies could have used the cash to expand and improve their pipelines.This drew heavy criticism, compelling the Democrats and the Republicans to lift the tax.History Says a Different StorySince the tax was abolished in 2015-end, the companies were expected to rake in profits and also put up an impressive show on the bourses starting 2016. However, the price performance and margin trend contradicted expectations.In fact, the tax repeal news created quite a stir amongst analysts back in 2016, dealing a blow to shares of medical device manufacturers. Our data shows that the broader Medical-Products industry has underperformed the S&P 500 market in the last two years. The industry’s 31.3% cuts a sorry figure in comparison to the S&P 500’s 34.5%. Here we take a sneak peek at the net margin trend of companies since the last tax repeal. Although no single metric can determine the profitability of a business accurately, investors can count on net margin to get a fair idea of the amount of profit a company is making. A declining net margin post the tax repeal amendment throws light on the enormous risks and costs associated with the R&D and compliance requirements of MedTech manufacturers. This also raises a question on how will the tax repeal provide an impetus to the MedTech space, if it could do nothing significant two years back.5 Stocks Grappling With Declining Prices & Net MarginHere we have five MedTech stocks that have witnessed significant margin contraction despite the tax repeal in 2015.We would like to draw your attention to the share price and net margin performance of companies following the tax’s abolition in 2015.Over the past two years, Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) has been observed to underperform the broader markets. As per the latest share price movement, the stock lost 7%, comparing unfavorably with the S&P 500’s gain of 35.4%.The company has been facing escalating costs and expenses that are weighing on its margins. Also, the company’s reiteration of 2018 guidance despite the projection of favorable foreign currency translation fails to lift investors’ spirits. Over the past two years, Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) has underperformed the S&P 500 index. The stock has lost 18.8%. We are disappointed with the continued deterioration in the company gross, operating and net margins, thanks to higher cost of sales and expenses. Also, a tough competitive landscape and pricing pressure weigh on the stock.The U.S. healthcare products and service distribution industry is highly competitive and consist principally of national, regional and local distributors. In the North American dental products market, the company faces stiff competition from Patterson Dental business of Patterson Companies Inc. and Benco Dental Supply.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.’s (XRAY  -  Free Report) share price movement has been disheartening over the past two years. The company has lost 7.1% in the period. A lackluster margin trend over the same time frame indicates the company’s failure to garner profits post the tax repeal.For the days to comeDENTSPLY expects gross and operating margins to remain flat to decline slightly from 2017 levels as underlying margin rate improvement is expected to be offset by adverse foreign exchange and target inventory equipment reduction.Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc. (MDRX  -  Free Report) has underperformed the broader market in terms of price in the past two months. Notably, the stock has returned 5.2%, compared with the S&P 500’s rally of 35.4%. Further, the company’s margins have contracted significantly in the past two years.Allscripts also expects a modest increase in operating expenses. The company faces sluggishness in the international market and competition from larger players.Bruker Corporation (BRKR  -  Free Report) has underperformed the broader market in terms of price in the past two years. The stock has returned just 10.3%, much lower than the S&P 500 market. Further, the company’s margins have declined steeply in the past two years.Bruker conducts 80% of its business in international markets. As a result, currency fluctuations continue to result in foreign currency transaction losses.Will the latest MedTech tax overhaul paint a different picture for these stocks?Will History Repeat Itself?Our analysis clearly shows that the broader industry hasn’t reacted positively to the tax repeal amendment that was legislated in 2015. If we consider the repeal’s effect on the MedTech space, the trend is expected to continue this time around as well!However, the MedTech industry has been favored by a massive change in consumer behavior lately. This coupled with changing market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation of the U.S. healthcare system over the last couple of years. This is evident from the rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.Further, the strategic application of Artificial Intelligence in every sphere of healthcare can provide boost productivity in the MedTech space. Companies that have adopted AI technologies witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and are expected to record strong margin expansion as well.You never know, the current favorable trend might turn the tables for the MedTech industry!More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

1184,MDT,"Going by the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, more than 100 million U.S. adults are living with diabetes or prediabetic condition. Notably, this is gradually taking the shape of a deadly epidemic.Diabetes rates in the United States have moved up from 5.5% in 1994 to 9.3% in 2012. Furthermore, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2016, resulting in approximately $245 billion of medical costs and reduced productivity every year (per an article by The State of Obesity).Globally, the scenario is quite intriguing. Per a Global Report on Diabetes by World Health Organization, prevalence of diabetes in adults rose from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. Moreover, worldwide expenses related to diabetes were around $850 billion in 2017 (per the International Diabetes Foundation).Notably, projections related to the disease hint at the continuation of the present trend. In this regard, the number of patients aged 18-99 years and diagnosed with diabetes is expected to rise to 693 million by 2045 from 451 million in 2017 (per the International Diabetes Foundation).It goes without saying that the rising incidence of diabetes has opened up opportunities for diabetes device makers. The market is expected to see a CAGR of 6.4% to reach a worth of $7.35 billion between 2016 and 2021 (per a report by Mordor Intelligence). Globally, the market is expected to value $66,053.1 million, at a CAGR of 6.7% between 2016 and 2025 (per a Transparency Market Research report).Thus, for investors who are keen on placing a bet on the healthcare space for long-term gains, the diabetes devices market undoubtedly holds immense potential.Factors Driving Diabetes Devices MarketRising healthcare expenditures, unhealthy lifestyle practices along with expanded treatment options have been driving demand. Per a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board, U.S. healthcare spending is projected to rise to around $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of GDP (based on assumption that the Affordable Care Act will continue through 2025).The diabetes devices market is largely dependent on the aging population. Per the U.S. Census Bureau report, in 2050, people aged 65 or more are likely to total 83.7 million, almost double its estimated population of 43.1 million in 2012. Data also shows that the median age is increasing in most areas of the country and the global scenario is pretty similar.Strengthening emerging markets have been contributing largely to the rise in demand for diabetes care devices. A report by Cision puts more light on this. Per the report, the demand for insulin delivery and blood glucose monitoring devices have been rising in the highly-populated countries — China and India. According to the International Diabetes Federation, China recorded the highest number at around 96.2 million diabetic patients in 2014 followed by 66.8 million in India.AI Shapes Diabetes Devices MarketCognitive Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been transforming the way diabetes is managed throughout the world. Hi-tech medical devices and analytical predictive-diagnostics tools are helping create customized programs that support blood glucose management and improved medication adherence.Going by a report by Statista, worldwide revenues from eHealth solutions for diabetes are expected at $1.01 billion in 2018. Furthermore, the market is expected to see a CAGR of 29.8% between 2018 and 2020. According to the report, growing demand and increased availability of connected medical devices for in-home usages, apps for smartphones to aid self-management and telemedical services along with service-oriented apps have been stimulating growth in this niche market.In view of the above-mentioned factors, a number of bigwigs have been expending lump sum amounts on R&D to continuously innovate and develop devices with improved efficacy and no side effects.For instance, back in 2016, Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) partnered with IBM Watson to utilize the latter’s machine learning algorithms to incorporate AI in its diabetes app MiniMed.  In 2017, the companies jointly launched the first artificial pancreas systems. Medtronic has utilized sugar IQ with the cognitive computing capability of IBM Watson to detect important patterns and trends for diabetes.In line with the developments in the diabetes business, in February 2018, Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) announced the availability of FreeStyle LibreLink app in Europe for use in smartphones (both iPhone and Android). We encouragingly note that, Abbott is planning for a mobile app solution for FreeStyle Libre users outside Europe, based on in-country regulatory approval.Moreover, Boston, Taipei, Hong Kong and Bangalore-based company DIABNEXT has developed a Diabetes AI that provides personalized metric analysis and decision-making tools for physicians and patients to improvise pre-diabetes and diabetes management.3 Stocks to Bet OnWe have selected three companies, which we believe can tap into the promising prospects of the diabetes devices market.Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report): The company has a strong presence in the diabetes care market with a global market share of 27%.

1185,MDT,"Per a recent report by the Reuters, Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) is likely to take over Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report), creating a market value of more than $110 billion.If the deal materializes, the combined entity will have one of the MedTech’s broadest spectrums of product offerings that include cardiology, orthopaedics, surgical supplies and neuroscience. Yesterday, shares of Stryker have dropped 5.1% to close at $169.78. Boston Scientific’s shares have increased 7.4% to close at $34.32.How Likely is the Deal to Materialize?The chances of the deal are uncertain because there are no confirmatory statements or press releases from the company representatives.In fact, investors should never forget about Stryker’s highly-rumored acquisition plans of Smith & Nephew from 2015, which never materialized.On the brighter side, this is not the first time Stryker has been tied up with Boston Scientific. Stryker acquired Boston Scientific's neurovascular unit in 2010 for $1.5 billion, which indicates probability of a second collaboration now.However, reaching any particular conclusions at this moment might be a bit too early.Analysts’ OpinionThe Wall Street Journal claims this agreement to be “one of the largest in a year that is shaping up to be one of the busiest ever for mergers and acquisitions”.If the deal matures, Wells Fargo Securities analyst Lawrence expects it to outpace Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) in total device revenues.Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang focused on the need of increasing consolidation in healthcare to provide a comprehensive product portfolio to customers. Stryker’s supposed deal with Boston Scientific seems prudent in this regard.How Will Stryker Benefit?If the deal happens, Stryker will gain control of Boston Scientific's line of heart devices such as stents, defibrillators and Watchman device to prevent blood clots. Boston Scientific achieved clinical milestones for Ranger Drug Coated Balloon and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device.Further, the company will also leverage on Boston Scientific’s solid foothold in the underpenetrated emerging economies. The company also registered double-digit growth on a year-over-year basis in the emerging markets in the last reported quarter. If the deal materializes, Stryker might profit from Boston Scientific’s strength, especially in the BRIC nations.Stryker has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares of the company have outperformed the industry over a year’s time. The stock has returned almost 20.2%, better than the industry's rise of 14.7%.  Stryker’s Acquisition Profile Shines BrightStryker has been following an acquisition-driven strategy to boost growth. Recently, the company acquired Entellus Medical, Inc in an all cash transaction for $24 per share or an equity value of approximately $662 million.Stryker also acquired VEXIM for €183 million. VEXIM specializes in the development and sale of vertebral compression fracture solutions for.In 2017, Stryker completed the acquisition of NOVADAQ for a net purchase price of $674 million. NOVADAQ is a leading developer of SPY fluorescence imaging technology that provides surgeons with visualization of blood flow and perfusion with more than250 clinical studies and array of specialties. The company's product portfolio is highly complementary to Stryker's visualization platform.‘Let’s Wait and Watch’If Stryker manages to acquire Boston Scientific, the Medical world will achieve a solid benchmark in terms of providing a comprehensive suite of MedTech solutions. This will reduce pricing pressure and competition. Further, the companies with a strong acquisition policy gain from rapidly-expanding large customer base, moderate leverage and enhanced cash flow.Meanwhile, the MedTech fraternity has been riding on the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&A) trends, making it one of the most profitable investment arenas.Glancing at major acquisitions in the recent past, Becton, Dickinson and Company’s takeover of C.

1186,MDT,"On Jun 4, we issued an updated research report on Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report). While we are encouraged by the global acceptance of the company’s advanced therapies, its escalating costs and expenses raise concerns. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past three months, shares of Medtronic have outperformed the industry.  The stock has grown 10.1% against the industry’s 2.1% decline.Notably, Medtronic exited the fiscal 2018 on a solid note with better-than-expected fourth-quarter performances. All major business groups contributed to its solid top-line growth at CER, highlighting sustainability across groups and regions, in addition to displaying a successful integration and achievement of synergy targets. Also, a gradually stabilizing Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure(CRHF) market buoys optimism.Medtronic PLC Price Medtronic PLC Price | Medtronic PLC Quote The receipt of FDA approval for the DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) therapy as an adjunctive treatment to reduce partial-onset seizures raises hope for the company in the target medical market. Medtronic is also focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses. The company is highly positive about its foray into the $1-billion standalone CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) market with its Guardian Connect.We are currently upbeat about Medtronic’s recently-launched restructuring initiative called Enterprise Excellence plan, aimed at $3-billion annual growth run rate savings by the end of fiscal 2022. Per the company, this new program has been designed to increase its effectiveness and growth-related reinvestment ability along with providing a consistent boost to its margin expansion and driving the EPS leverage.On the flip side, the company has been exposed to steep costs and expenses, weighing heavily on its margins. Also, its 2019 guidance remains conservative on the apprehension of lackluster Cardiac and Vascular Group (CVG) and Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG) performances. This in turn dampens investors’ confidence in the stock.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc (AMED  -  Free Report). While Intuitive Surgical and Illumina sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Amedisys carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The market is dominated by some well-established players like Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report), Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), among others.Abbott’s strategy to gain traction in the Rhythm Management sub-segment seems to be aligned with data provided by Allied Market Research.  Per the report, the global Cardiac Monitoring and Cardiac Rhythm Management market is expected to see a CAGR of 7.6% from 2016 to 2022 to reach a value of $32,216 million.We believe that unhealthy lifestyle and a rise in ageing population will continue to result in high incidence of cardiovascular diseases. This is further supported by data provided by GBI Research. Per the report, the global cardiovascular diseases market will see a CAGR of 4.1% by 2019, and within this space, the U.S. market is expected to witness the highest momentum at a CAGR of 4.7%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

1188,MDT,"Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report) recently launched an advanced Resonate family of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) systems featuring the HeartLogic Heart Failure Diagnostic.Notably, these devices are FDA approved for conditional use in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment and help physicians improve heart failure (HF) management through personalized care. The devices combine the company's SmartCRT Technology with EnduraLife Battery Technology. This allows physicians to customize device settings according to individual patient needs, without draining the battery or having to go through unnecessary replacement procedures.HeartLogic Diagnostic alarms doctors about worsening HF conditions by combining data from sensors assessing heart sounds, respiration rate and volume, thoracic impedance, heart rate and activity.All CRT-Ds in the Resonate family of devices are enabled with SmartCRT Technology. This helps physicians modify where, when and how to pace the lower chambers of the heart using the Multisite Pacing capability for multi-electrode pacing.The company recently initiated enrolment of patients in the MANAGE-HF study to further assess HeartLogic Diagnostic. Boston Scientific recently announced positive clinical trial data from the Multisensor Chronic Evaluation in Ambulatory Heart Failure Patients (MultiSENSE) study. The study (based on 900 patients) was conducted to examine the performance of HeartLogic Diagnostic for prediction of possibilities of HFdecompensation. The study demonstrated that HeartLogic Diagnostic increases the ability to classify patients at high or low-risk of experiencing an HF event.In the last reported second quarter, Boston Scientific’s Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) segment reflected a 2% year-over-year increase in sales. Meanwhile, the company has been consistently focusing on product development to strengthen its position in this niche.According to a report by GlobalData, the heart failure market is estimated to reach a value of $11.8 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 13.7%. Considering the huge potential of the market, we believe the latest development is strategically placed.However, the company is facing tough competition in the global cardiac monitoring and rhythmmanagement devices market from established players like Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1194,MDT,"United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of $3.76 per share for the first quarter of 2018, which rose 4% from the year-ago quarter due to lower SG&A costs and tax rate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $3.46 per share. Adjusted earnings excluded the impact of share-based compensation gains.Revenues for the reported quarter were $389.2 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $385 million. Revenues rose 5% year over year. Sales, however, declined 16.3% sequentially due to unfavorable timing/pricing of distributor orders.United Therapeutics’ first-quarter revenues are usually down or flat from the prior-year fourth quarter levels due to unfavorable timing and magnitude of distributor orders, which are typically placed once a month based on current utilization trends and contractual minimum inventory requirements.Shares of United Therapeutics were down almost 7% on Wednesday. In fact, the stock has underperformed the industry this year so far, having declined 29.5% compared with the industry's decline of 2.5% during the period. Quarter in DetailUnited Therapeutics markets four products for the treatment of PAH – Remodulin, Tyvaso, Adcirca and Orenitram.

Remodulin sales were $126.8 million, down 13% year over year due to a reduction in orders from U.S. and international distributors. Tyvaso sales totaled 94.6 million, up 8% year over year due to price increases. However, the amendment in contractual minimum inventory levels, discussed above, hurt sales of both Remodulin and Tyvaso.Please note that Remodulin and Adcirca are expected to face generic competition this year, which could reduce sales from these products.Unituxin’s (for the treatment of pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma) sales of $18.0 million were flat year over year.Research and development (R&D) expenses escalated 41% to $58.2 million due to higher costs to support the company’s pipeline of cardiopulmonary and cancer drugs and to develop its organ manufacturing projects.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses declined 4% to $66.1 million.Pipeline Update United Therapeutics is working on expanded indications for some of its marketed products like Orenitram and Tyvaso. The company, at present, has seven phase III programs in the fields of cardiopulmonary diseases and oncology. A phase III FREEDOM-EV study is evaluating an oral combination therapy of Orenitram –OreniPlus. Full data from this study is expected this year.

Per this commitment, Medtronic has started to deliver $225-$250 million in cost synergies and $850 million in annual savings by the end of fiscal 2018.On the flip side, shares of Medtronic have underperformed the broader industry over the past three months. The stock has lost 8% versus the broader industry’s 2.5% gain.The company has been exposed to escalating costs and expenses, weighing heavily on its margins. Its reiteration of 2018 guidance despite a favorable foreign currency translation forecast dampens investors’ confidence in the stock.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc.

1196,MDT,"The transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) market, which is projected to witness CAGR of 18.3% between 2017 and 2022 (per a report by Azoth Analytics published on ReportsnReports), has been constantly under the radar of market experts, courtesy of the stir caused by one of the forerunners within this space — Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report).Last February, the company voluntarily recalled all its core Lotus Valve devices, including Lotus with Depth Guard. This dragged down its shares by 9.4% in the pre-market trading session (per an article on Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry).Sadly, again in November, Boston Scientific announced a further delay in the re-launch of the LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System after it failed to meet the committed timeline, hurting shareholder sentiments even more. Per an article on the Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry, the company had opted out from the Piper Jaffray healthcare conference in New York on the same day, pulling down the stock by 7.5%, which was followed by a decline in its market cap by around $2.9 billion.Meanwhile, rejoicing at this situation is Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), a leading player in the TAVR market. Encouragingly, the company’s shares have soared 45.4% since Lotus Valve devices’ recall last February. Let’s take a sneak peek into what’s brewing in this market for investors who are keen to effectively put in their money in the healthcare space.The BackdropBoston Scientific has been consistently dominating headlines on developments in the Lotus Valve devices, though for all the unpleasant reasons. Last February, the company had to call back all Lotus Valve devices due to issues related with the premature release of a pin which connects Lotus Valve to the delivery system.  However, this was not the first time when the company had to face such a situation.Earlier in 2016, the company had to retract the Lotus Edge Valve system on similar grounds. Even in 2014, it had to face the brunt of the FDA’s order and withdraw 278 units of Lotus Valve from circulation in Europe, due to the Lotus Valve getting unlocked from the delivery system during release.The company has also been disappointing investors by continuously delaying the filing of the premarket approval (PMA) with FDA for the Lotus Edge Valve system.Currently, the company expects LOTUS Edge to be back in the European market not before 2019. It also intends to roll out the same in the United States in the same year.Nevertheless, some major market analysts believe such numerous product missteps have always ended up tarnishing the brand image, along with deviated customer and clinician interests.Edwards Lifesciences - Seizing the OpportunitiesWhile Boston Scientific hit a rough patch on issues surrounding its Lotus Valve devices in 2017, Edwards Lifesciences reaped the maximum benefits from its solid Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) platform. During the company’s annual investor conference, its chairman and CEO Michael A. Mussallem noted, ""As we come to the end of 2017, our performance and accomplishments this year significantly exceeded our expectations, and we expect 2018 to be another strong year for Edwards Lifesciences.” “The primary factor driving the company’s global growth is the prospering transcatheter aortic valve therapy business,” he further asserted.In this regard, management currently projects sales of $2.1-$2.4 billion in Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy in 2018.Moreover, Edwards Lifesciences expects the global TAVR opportunity to be more than $5 billion by 2021. And to make the most of it, the company has been firing on all cylinders, lately.In line with this, Edwards Lifesciences has its near-term product pipeline on track. It expects that the new SAPIEN 3 Ultra system, featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology, will be launched in the United States and Europe later this year. Also, the company anticipates to begin the U.S. pivotal trial for the CE Marked CENTERA valve system in 2018. Furthermore, Edwards Lifesciences expects results from its PARTNER 3 trial of the SAPIEN 3 valve to be presented at ACC 2019, followed by the FDA’s approval later that year.We note that some market speculators believe Edwards Lifesciences’ solid global presence, particularly in high-potential regions like Europe and Japan, along with delay in the comeback of some key competitive products like Boston Scientific’s Lotus Valve, will help the company further cement its hold in the highly potential TAVR space.Other Major Players Riding the Gains Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report), with its CoreValve Evolut TAVR platform comprising the CoreValve, CoreValve Evolut R and the CoreValve Evolut PRO systems, has well maintained the company’s position as a formidable player in the TAVR space. Per an article by Reuters, shares of Medtronic had inched up 1% on Boston Scientific’s announcement of the withdrawal of Lotus Valve devices, last February. Notably, the company recorded TAVR growth in the mid-20s in the United States and low 40s in international markets, in the last reported quarter.Furthermore, post the acquisition of St. Jude Medical in 2017, Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) integrated the popular CE Marked Portico TAVR of the former into its Structural Heart portfolio and is expected to gain momentum in this space.Boston Scientific — A Rebound in the Cards?As Winston Churchill had rightly said,“All men make mistakes, but only wise men learn from their mistakes.”Unwilling to let go of the bountiful opportunities in the TAVR market, Boston Scientific acquired Symetis SA, a structural heart company focused on minimally-invasive TAVR devices, in 2017. The company has started selling ACURATE neo Aortic Valve in Europe. It is also working on designing the ACURATE neo 2 Aortic Valve System equipped with an enhanced outer sealing skirtfeature.Moreover, Boston Scientific is looking forward to leveraging on its existing LOTUS infrastructure to enhance the ACURATE neo AS Valve system through better field support, geographic expansion and next-generation products. The company plans to invest in the United States and Japan trials as well.Will ACURATE Replace Lotus?However, several opinions have been making rounds in the TAVR space, of late.  Some market experts believe the company will eventually replace the Lotus Valve devices with the Symetis’ portfolio, while others speculate that the deal has been clinched to cushion it from the jitters which might stem from the Lotus Valve devices’ withdrawal. A few analysts are also of the opinion that Boston Scientific expended the huge amount on the Symetis buyout deal to use it as a contingency plan in case the Lotus Valve device issue remains unresolved.Nonetheless, dismissing all such speculations, Boston Scientific has been consistently emphasizing on the Symetis acquisition as a move to broaden its TAVR suite and not a replacement of Lotus Valve devices.To end all speculations, let’s wait and watch to find out whether or not Boston Scientific’s Lotus (valve) will find the right weather to bloom again.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

1197,MDT,"In the era of big data, unless one's portfolio is in tune with the evolving digital trend, making prudent investment choices can prove to be a daunting task. Millennials have started to recognize the increasing need of the emerging automation trend and subsequently robotics, IoT, 3D printing are becoming part of our daily life with the latest buzzword being Artificial Intelligence (AI).While Siri and Ok Google have made life easier, the latest version of Global Positioning System helps track almost anything and everything along with its intelligent route map. Also, not being a pro on social network sites like Facebook, Twitter or snapchat can be seen as primitive.According to investment giant Jim Cramer, AI along with big data will soon let companies to bat a thousand. Interestingly, the benefits of the same will not remain restricted to any particular industry but will be felt across all business segments and investment arenas.AI to Help MedTech Gain TractionNon-healthcare bigwigs like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Google, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), IBM and Microsoft with their digital affluence are already eyeing the healthcare and device market of late, courtesy of its solid prospects. Two things to be noted here:Health treatment costs have skyrocketed over the past few years. Surprisingly, medical devices and pharmaceuticals account for only a small portion of healthcare expenses. Per Josh Makower, MD, general partner venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates, the greater part of healthcare costs goes in paying the salaries of healthcare employees. AI can help to curtail this high labor cost.Going by 2018 Deloitte data, global health care spending is projected to increase at an annual rate of 4.1% in 2017-2021, a significant escalation from just 1.3% in 2012-2016. Per the report, rising labor cost is acting as a major spending growth driver.Also, with growth in the aged population, the necessity for AI has increased by leaps and bounds. Per the U.S. Census Bureau report, between 2012 and 2050, there will be a significant rise in the aged population in the United States. In 2050, the population aged 65 or older is projected to be 83.7 million, almost double its estimated population of 43.1 million in 2012. Data also shows that the median age is increasing in most areas of the country and this is the global scenario as well.Notably, the industry is bearing the brunt of an exploding population at present. The World Health Organization's (""WHO"") latest available data show that more than 45% of WHO Member States worldwide report to have less than 1 physician per 1000 population. The density of physicians to patients in the United States is 2.3:1000.The strategic application of AI in every sphere of healthcare can provide an impetus to  productivity. Evidently, companies that adopted AI technologies have already witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and have also experienced improved patient outcome by more than 50%.MedTech Stocks Going the AI WayMedtronic (MDT  -  Free Report) is undoubtedly among the first MedTech manufacturers forging ahead with initiatives to bring in AI techniques in manufacturing processes. Back in 2016, the company partnered with IBM Watson to utilize the latter’s machine learning algorithms to incorporate AI in its diabetes app MiniMed.  In 2017, they jointly launched the first artificial pancreas systems. Metronic has utilized sugar IQ with the cognitive computing capability of IBM Watson to detect important patterns and trends for diabetes.EHR technologies developer Cerner (CERN  -  Free Report) is also adopting AI techniques rapidly. Lately, the company has been in the headlines, courtesy of its efforts to digitize electronic health record systems. In this regard, the company recently entered into two collaborations, one with Salesforce, a renowned player in the field of customer relationship management, and the other with Centrus Health, a clinically integrated, physician-led network. With the latest development, the company is planning to advance its flagship big-data platform HealtheIntent.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system — an advanced robot-assisted surgical platform. This AI platform enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps negate trauma associated with open surgery. The company plans to expand the usage of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, colorectal surgery and hernia repair.Of late, Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report) has also been putting an all-out effort to incorporate AI techniques in neuromodulation, cardiac rhythm management, cardiology, electrophysiology, peripheral interventions, oncology, endoscopy, urology and pelvic health.ConclusionA long debate can be structured on how an intelligent machine intensive technology can make human capabilities outmoded gradually — but that’s a different story. Despite several adversities, AI undoubtedly has emanated to change the behavioral pattern of consumers in medical device space like all other sectors. Once again going by Jim Cramer’s say, “I love behavior-change investing. It can be incredibly lucrative, and when you have a behavior-change theme you can use selloffs to pick stocks based on those changes.” Thus, it goes without saying that the market holds ample promise and the proper execution of AI will definitely prove to be a trump card for the space.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1199,MDT,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Medtronic PLC (MDT  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 2.1% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MDT due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsMedtronic reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.17, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Earnings rose 4.5% year over year.Adjustments in the quarter primarily included the impact of restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, divestiture-related items and acquisition-related items. After adjusting for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of a penny, adjusted EPS was $1.18.Without these adjustments, the company’s reported a net loss of $1.03 per share, compared to 59 cents in the previous year. This included a $2.2-billion net tax expense related to the U.S. tax reform.Total RevenuesWorldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed $7.37 billion, up 7% on a constant exchange rate or CER basis (up 1.2% on a reported basis). The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.20 billion. Foreign currency fluctuation favorably impacted Medtronic’s third-quarter revenues by $177 million.In the quarter under review, U.S. sales (53.1% of total revenues) fell 4.9% year over year (up 6% at CER) to $3.91 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.36 billion (32% of total revenues), reflecting a 5% increase at CER (up 7.8% as reported). Emerging market revenues (14.9% of total revenues) amounted to $1.10 billion, up 12% at CER (up 11.8% as reported).Segment DetailsThe company currently generates revenues from four major groups, viz. Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) and Diabetes Group.CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions (APV). MITG now includes the Surgical Innovations (SI) and the Respiratory, Gastrointestinal & Renal (RGR) divisions after the divestiture of Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis (Compression), and Nutritional Insufficiency (Enteral Feeding) businesses. RTG comprises the Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments, while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Service & Solutions (DSS) divisions.CVG revenues improved 7% at CER (up 10% as reported) to $2.80 billion, driven by strong, balanced growth across all three divisions.CRHF sales totaled $1.46 billion, up 4% year over year at CER (up 6% as reported). This came on the back of growth in Arrhythmia Management led by high-teens growth in atrial fibrillation Solutions at CER, amplified penetration of the Micra transcatheter pacing system, and strong uptake of the TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope. This apart, strong demand for the company's suite of quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy-pacemakers (CRT-P) along with growth in Mechanical Circulatory Support drove Heart Failure division revenues.CSH revenues were up 14% at CER (18% as reported) to $886 million on the back of low-30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform and expanded FDA approval to include patients at intermediate risk. Moreover, the continued uptake of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in the United States and Japan revived the Coronary business.APV revenues registered 5% growth at CER (up 7% as reported) to $457 million, driven by continued adoption of the Valiant Captiviathoracic stent graft systems. Peripheral was driven by double-digit growth in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and drug-coated balloons. Moreover, solid contributions from VenaSeal closure system drove high-single digit growth in endoVenous.In MITG, worldwide sales reached $2.04 billion, marking a 6% year-over-year increase at CER (down 16% on a reported basis) on high-single digit growth in SI, and a low-single digit growth in RGR, both at CER.In RTG, worldwide revenues of $1.94 billion were up 5% year over year at CER (up 7% as reported) on low double-digit growth in Brain Therapies, mid-single digit growth in Specialty Therapies and high-single digit growth in Pain Therapies, at CER. However, revenues from the Spine business remained flat at CER on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, revenues at the Diabetes group increased 13% at CER (17% as reported) to $584 million.MarginsGross margin in the reported quarter expanded 140 basis points (bps) to 70.3% on a 3.3% rise in gross profit to $5.18 billion. Adjusted operating margin expanded 10 bps year over year to 28.9% owing to a 5.3% rise in research and development expenses (to $558 million) along with a 4.6% uptick in selling, general and administrative expenses (to $2.49 billion). Other expenses in the reported quarter totaled $140 million as compared with $46 million in the year-ago quarter.GuidanceMedtronic reiterated its fiscal 2018 constant-currency revenue and EPS guidance. The company maintains full-year revenue growth projection at the range of 4-5% at CER. However, the company revised its foreign currency fluctuation estimation, which is now projected to have a positive $480-$500 million impact on fiscal results compared with $275-$375 million estimated earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues remains at $29.50 billion.Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share growth is still expected in the range of 9-10% at CER. Currency translation is likely to have an adverse impact of 4 cents compared with the earlier expectation of a negative effect of 2 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at $4.76.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Medtronic expects currency translation to have a favorable impact of $300-$320 million on revenues.

1200,MDT,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) announced dull preliminary sales results for second-quarter fiscal 2018. Preliminary worldwide revenues for the quarter dipped 4% year over year to $7.05 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.09 billion remains a tad higher than the reported preliminary revenue figure.Per Medtronic, the year-over-year decline in the preliminary sales performance was driven by the company’s divestiture of its Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis (Compression) and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses to Cardinal Health that occurred at the beginning of the quarter.On a comparable, constant currency basis (adjusting for the divestiture and a positive impact of $35 million from foreign currency), the company’s second-quarter preliminary revenues increased 3% year over year. The company also noted that excluding the impact of Hurricane Maria, second-quarter revenue growth would have been 4% on a comparable, constant currency basis.Medtronic PLC Price Medtronic PLC Price | Medtronic PLC QuoteAlso, per the preliminary report, the impact from Maria was approximately $55-$65 million on the company’s second-quarter top line. Besides, the hurricane left an adverse impact of roughly 3 cents on its second-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS).Excluding the effect of Maria, Medtronic reaffirmed its fiscal second-quarter guidance.The company expects adjusted EPS to be flat to slightly up on a comparable, constant currency basis from $1.04 in the year-ago quarter. It also expects a favorable impact of a penny from foreign currency translation on the quarter’s adjusted EPS.Despite the year-over-year drag in preliminary sales, it is encouraging to note that the latest projection is actually an improvement from the company’s earlier anticipationabout the financial impact of Maria which was provided a month back. That time, Medtronic had projected both fiscal second-quarter 2018 revenues and adjusted net earnings to the extent of $250 million.More specifically, the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group and the Restorative Therapies Group were expected to be worst hit. Notably, Medtronic is slated to release its second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on November 21 before the market opens.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

1201,MDT,"Cardinal Health Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.09 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.01. However, earnings declined 12.1% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues increased 1.9% on a year-over-year basis to almost $32.64 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.43 billion. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Segmental AnalysisPharmaceutical Segment: Pharmaceutical revenues inched up 1% to $28.92 billion on a year-over-year basis. The segment witnessed strong growth in the Specialty business and also gained a huge number of Pharmaceutical Distribution customers.The segment witnessed a 13% drop in profits, thanks to generic pharmaceutical pricing and the company's recent investments in its Pharmaceutical IT platform. However, solid performance by the Red Oak Sourcing platform has partially offset the negative effect.Medical Segment: Revenues at the segment increased 14% to $3.72 billion primarily on higher contributions from new and existing customers.Medical segment profits increased 1% to $129 million, courtesy of higher contributions from new and existing customers and acquisitions. However, lower contributions from the Veterans Affairs contract partially affected sales at the segment. Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and Consensus  Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and Consensus | Cardinal Health, Inc. Quote Major HighlightsIn the reported quarter, Cardinal Health closed the acquisition of Medtronic's (MDT  -  Free Report) Patient Recovery business for $6.1 billion in cash. Further, Cardinal Health launched ConnectSource, a new cloud-based patient engagement platform in the first quarter.Cardinal Health entered into an agreement in the first quarter to distribute self-manufactured surgeon gloves directly in certain international markets.The company also announced an agreement to make its Cordis subsidiary the exclusive distributor of Medinol coronary stents in the United States.MarginsAs a percentage of revenues, gross margin expanded 220 basis points (bps) to 5.1% of net revenues.Distribution, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 15% on a year-over-year basis to $1062 million in the reported quarter.GuidanceThe company reaffirmed its fiscal 2018 guidance for adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations at $4.85-$5.10.Our TakeCardinal Health ended first-quarter fiscal 2017 on a solid note, courtesy of a solid performance by the Medical segment. An encouraging fiscal 2018 guidance instills our confidence in the stock. Meanwhile, the company is banking on strategic buyouts, joint ventures and supply agreements to drive growth. The deal with MedTech bigwig Medtronic is likely to boost the company’s growth trajectory. On the flipside, although the Pharmaceutical segment witnessed strong growth in the Specialty business and gained a huge number of Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, profits at the segment were hurt by generic pharmaceutical pricing. Increasing generic pricing pressure is a major headwind. Intensifying competition and customer concentration are other bottlenecks.

1202,MDT,"We are in the thick of the earnings season with more than 64.2% of the index’s total market capitalization having already released their quarterly numbers. Meanwhile, in the MedTech space, uncertainty related to the Trump administration’s Obamacare repeal & replacement effort continues to make headlines. The latest uproar is related to the President’s newly-released executive order, designed to provide affordable quality healthcare to the nation.Let us now have a quick look at how the medical device space has fared so far in the reporting cycle.Q3 PerformanceVarious reports suggest that hurricanes at the end of the third quarter are likely to mar revenues and earnings of several MedTech companies, primarily in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico. MedTech major Ecolab (ECL  -  Free Report) expects the impact of the hurricanes on full-year sales and costs to be approximately 8 cents per share. In fact, Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report) acknowledged the impact of the Hurricane Maria on its quarterly metrics. The company expects almost $250 million impact on revenues and earnings.The overall lack of visibility befuddles the favorable trend of the past few quarters in the broader Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). Per the latest Earnings Preview, the third-quarter expected earnings growth rate for the sector is 5.2% on 4.8% revenue growth. In comparison, the reported earnings growth rate of second-quarter 2017 was quite impressive at 7% on 4.4% revenue growth.To note, there are some powerful long-term tailwinds in the medical space, including mergers & acquisitions (M&A), emerging market expansion, positive demographic trends and new product innovation. These have been a major driving force behind the sector’s impressive performance over the past few quarters even amid severe socio-economic and political instabilities.How to Make the Right Pick?With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings could be a daunting task.

Following the FDA approval, the company has recently made a significant breakthrough with the U.S. launch of the Intellis platform for management of certain types of chronic intractable pain.Per Medtronic, this Intellis platform is able to overcome certain limitations related to current spinal cord stimulation (SCS) systems like battery performance. The platform can power the Evolve workflow, which standardizes guidance and balances high-dose (HD) and low-dose (LD) therapy settings.Among other advancements of this platform, it is worth mentioning that it can be managed on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 tablet interface. This provides the physicians with faster delivery of evolving workflows and software upgrades. The Intellis platform includes both Medtronic’s proprietary SureScan MRI technology (for the broadest access available to MRI diagnostic imaging and simple eligibility determination) as well as AdaptiveStim technology (for automatic adjustments to deliver the right therapy dose to the right location as the pain target shifts according to body position).Per a Transparency Market Research report, Global Pain Management Therapeutics Market is expected to ascend to $83 billion by 2024from $60.2 billion in 2015.

1205,MDT,"About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for Medtronic PLC (MDT  -  Free Report). Shares have lost 2.7% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsMedtronic reported financial results for first-quarter fiscal 2018. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in the reported quarter came in at $1.12, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.7% and up 8.7% year over year.Adjustments in the quarter primarily included certain impact of restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization and acquisition-related items. After adjusting unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 2 cents, adjusted EPS came in at $1.14, up 11% year over year.Without these adjustments, the company reported net income of 74 cents per share, up 12.1% year over year.Total RevenueWorldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed $7.39 billion, up 4% on a constant exchange rate or CER basis (up 3% on a reported basis). The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.45 billion. Foreign currency fluctuation affected Medtronic’s fiscal first quarter revenues by $33 million.In the quarter under review, U.S. sales (55% of total revenue) increased 1% year over year to $4.04 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.31 billion (31% of total revenue), reflecting a 5% increase at CER (up 4% as reported). Emerging markets (14% of total revenue) amounted to $1.04 billion, up 12% at CER (up 11% as reported).Segment DetailsThe company currently generates revenues from four major groups, viz. Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) and Diabetes Group.CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions (APV). MITG includes both the Surgical Solutions and the Patient Monitoring & Recovery (PMR) divisions. RTG includes the Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments, while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Service & Solutions (DSS) divisions.Revenues at CVG improved 6% at CER (or up 5% as reported) to $2.65 billion, driven by strong, balanced growth across all three divisions.CRHF sales were $1.39 billion with 5% year over year at CER (up 4% as reported). This came on the back of growth in Arrhythmia Management led by high-teens growth in atrial fibrillation Solutions at CER, amplified penetration of the Micra transcatheter pacing system, strong uptake of the TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope and continued worldwide customer demand for the Reveal LINQ insertable cardiac monitor. This apart, the HeartWare International acquisition drove growth in the Heart Failure division.CSH revenues were up 8% at CER (7% as reported) to $817 million on the back of high 30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform in the United States and continued demand for the CoreValve Evolut R 34mm valve in the United States as well as Europe.APV revenues registered 5% growth at CER (up 4% as reported) to $439 million, driven by the continued adoption of the Endurant IIs aortic stent graft and remarkable strength of the Heli-FX EndoAnchor System. Peripheral was driven by low-double digit growth in both atherectomy and drug-coated balloons.In MITG, worldwide sales reached $2.49 billion, marking a 3% year-over-year increase at CER (same as reported) on mid-single digit growth in Surgical Solutions and low-single digit growth in PMR.In RTG, worldwide revenues of $1.81 billion were up 2% year over year at CER (same as reported) on high-single digit growth in Brain Therapies, mid-single digit growth in Specialty Therapies and low-single digit growth in Spine, thus mitigating a decline in Pain Therapies. However, revenues from the Diabetes group decreased 1% at CER (same as reported) to $449 million.MarginsGross margin during the reported quarter contracted 20 basis points (bps) to 68.2% despite a 2.8% increase in gross profit to $5.04 billion. Adjusted operating margin remained flat year over year at 26.3%. This was owing to a 1.4% decline in research and development expenses (to $548 million) which was offset by a 2.3% rise in selling, general and administrative expenses (to $2.49 billion). Other expenses in the reported quarter were $66 million as compared with $39 million in the year-ago period.GuidanceMedtronic reiterated its fiscal 2018 constant-currency revenue and EPS guidance. The company still expects full-year revenue growth in the range of 4-5% at CER. However, the company revised its foreign currency fluctuation estimation, which is now projected to have a positive $380-$480 million impact in the fiscal year compared to an expected positive impact of $75-$175 million stated previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues remains at $30.72 billion for fiscal 2018.Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share growth is still expected in the range of 9-10% at CER. Currency translation is now expected to have an adverse impact of 3 cents to a positive impact of 1 cent compared with the earlier expectation of negative impact of approximately 5-10 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at $4.89.Moreover for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, Medtronic expects currency translation to have a favorable impact of $25-$75 million on revenues. Currency translation is expected to have a favorable impact of 0-2 cents on second-quarter earnings per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Analysts were quiet during the last month as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions.Medtronic PLC Price and Consensus  Medtronic PLC Price and Consensus | Medtronic PLC QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Medtronic's stock has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a D.  The stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for value and growth investors.OutlookThe stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect below average returns from the stock in the next few months.

1206,MDT,"Q3 earnings season has taken center stage, with 272 S&P 500 members, which account for 64.2% of the index’s total market capitalization, having reported their numbers. Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies are up 8.7% from the same period last year on 6.7% higher revenues, with 75.7% beating earnings and 66.2% surpassing revenue estimates.With 134 S&P 500 members lined up to release their quarterly results this week, we are decidedly bullish on the equity market, which is gradually demonstrating an improvement sequentially. Needless to say, the ongoing week is a crucial one for this season as by the end of it we will have results from more than 80% of the S&P 500 bigwigs.Medical, one of the broader sectors among the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to put up an impressive show this quarter. For the third quarter, the expected earnings growth rate for the sector is 5.2% on 4.8% revenue growth. In comparison, the reported earnings growth rate from the second-quarter 2017 was quite impressive at 7% on 4.4% revenue growth.Let us take a look at the major factors that are likely to influence the earnings results of MedTech companies within the broader Medical universe.Factors Influencing MedTech in Q3Hurricanes Wreak Havoc Various reports suggest that hurricanes at the end of the third quarter are likely to mar revenues and earnings of several MedTech companies, primarily in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico. MedTech major Ecolab (ECL  -  Free Report) expects the impact of the hurricanes on full-year sales and costs to be approximately 8 cents per share. In fact, Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report) acknowledged the impact of Hurricane Maria on its quarterly metrics. The company expects an almost $250 million impact on revenues and earnings.Apart from the natural factors, a rise in unemployment (though short lived) and decline in consumer income, coupled with increasing aggregate spending, are likely to deal a heavy blow to MedTech numbers.Political ConundrumWhile the overall investment world has been gaining prominence, investors in the MedTech industry are unfortunately seeing a reverse trend. Stocks tumbled and things got riskier when the Graham-Cassidy bill to retract Obamacare failed to gain support again. And, President Trump’s latest executive order has already become a serious threat to the healthcare community at large.In this regard, let’s not forget the tax-reform pledges that Trump has taken to abolish the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax. Although investor confidence trends upwards with the hope of ‘enactment of new tax reforms,' we believe the market has not got a whiff of it due to the lack of favorable developments on the regulatory front.Favorable Consumer Behavior Despite the political issues in the healthcare space, the change in consumer demand and market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation in the entire U.S. healthcare system over the last couple of years. This is evident from the growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, rising demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.Let’s take a look at the major Medical Product stocks slated to release their quarterly reports on Nov 2:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report)Becton, Dickinson is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results before the opening bell.For fiscal 2017, revenues are anticipated to increase 4.5% to 5.0%. Looking at quarterly estimates, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the BD Medical segment is at $2.105 billion for the fourth quarter, signifying sequential growth of 2.8%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Medical Surgical Systems is pegged at $908 million, up 4.4% from last quarter's reported number.The company’s innovative product pipeline is a key catalyst in our view. A plethora of regulatory approvals in the United States and international markets are helping the company to rapidly expand its product portfolio.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment stands at $38.34 billion. This reflects an improvement of almost 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.On the flipside, although generic inflation has been nominal, the rate of deflation is rising gradually. Furthermore, an anticipated shift in product mix toward lower-margin and higher-priced specialty and branded drugs will affect the company’s bottom line (read more: AmerisourceBergen Q4 Earnings: Will it Disappoint?).Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AmerisourceBergen’s earnings stands at $1.32 per share, up 1.8% year-over-year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues stands at $47.4 million, up 6% from the year-ago reported number. The company’s strong focus on High Flow Nasal Cannula Therapy (HFNCT) is likely to lend it a competitive edge in the niche space.Solid growth in the preloaded anti-microbial and anti-thrombogenic VPS PICCs platform is likely to strengthen the vascular platform. In the surgical segment, new products like EFx and Ae05 products fortify the company’s foothold. Finally, the company’s flagship LMA unique product strengthens its Anasthesia product line.Our quantitative model predicts an earnings beat for Teleflex in the third quarter.

Unituxin (for treatment of pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma) sales of $17 million were down 2% year over year.Research and development (R&D) expenses escalated 20% to $55 million due to higher costs to support the company’s pipeline of cardiopulmonary and cancer drugs and to develop its organ manufacturing projects.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses plunged 53% to $47.2 million as lower consulting and marketing costs offset higher legal costs.Pipeline UpdateUnited Therapeutics is working with medical device maker Medtronic, Inc.

In order to launch RemoSynch in the United States, both companies are pursuing parallel regulatory filings related to the device and the drug.We remind investors that in April, United Therapeutics announced that regulatory issues will delay the planned U.S. launch of RemoSynch. The company now expects to launch the same sometime in 2018 instead of the first half of this year, as expected previously.

1208,MDT,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) announced positive results from two analyses conducted on AdaptivCRT algorithm at the European Heart Rhythm Association (“EHRA”) Scientific Sessions 2018 in Barcelona, Spain.The study demonstrated that AdaptivCRT algorithm reduces atrial fibrillation (""AF"") episodes, along with higher patient activity levels. The results were based on 408 heart failure patients with Medtronic cardiac resynchronization therapy (""CRT"") device at 26 centers in Italy.The ResultsThe first study showed a significant reduction in the occurrence of AF episodes of all measured durations in 210 patients with AdaptivCRT ON compared to 198 patients with traditional CRT.  The second study revealed AdaptivCRT was linked with a higher daily activity level for patients with the feature ON compared to patients with conventional CRT.Per the company, CRT is an established treatment for patients with heart failure who use an implantable defibrillator (CRT-D) or pacemaker (CRT-P) to enhance the heart’s pumping efficiency.The AdaptivCRT Platform at a GlanceIn medicine, a CRT resynchronizes the contractions of heart's ventricles by sending electrical impulses to the heart muscle. Thus, CRT helps the heart pump blood throughout the body more efficiently and is a very promising technique in the markets of cardiac rhythm management and heart failure.Medtronic’s AdaptivCRT platform minutely evaluates cardiac rhythms on the back of two pacing operations, namely, Adaptive LV and Adaptive Bi-V.Of the major CRT platforms of Medtronic, Claria MRI CRT-D SureScan and Percepta CRT-P MRI SureScan deserve a mention.Developments in Cardiac Rhythm and Heart Failure DivisionThe company is consistently trying to improve its Cardiac Rhythm and Heart Failure division — part of Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG). In line with this, Medtronic recently announced the receipt of FDA approval and commercial launch of its portfolio of Azure pacemakers with BlueSync technology. In May 2017, Medtronic received the FDA’s approval for quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy-pacemakers (CRT-Ps) that improve therapy delivery for patients with heart failure.Market PotentialPer a GlobalData report, the global heart failure market is set to reach a worth of $11.8 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 13.7%. Considering the bullish market sentiments, we believe that the latest development is a timely one.Stock Performance & Estimate RevisionOver the past month, shares of Medtronic have underperformed the industry.

1209,MDT,"Emerging market investment has taken a backseat of late, thanks to the nonstop blows to the economy. The lingering geopolitical tension in Gulf, debt and policy related hazards in Latin America or the missile tests in North Korea have led stock investors to reconsider their outlay in these markets, earlier proclaimed to offer better growth opportunities than the United States.Going by the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, the last five-year annualized growth rate was just 5.02%. On the other hand, GDP per capita growth rate over the last five years for the United States was 5.83% (International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook Database).In the face of such adversities, Goldman Sachs’ statement to Bloomberg last week, addressing emerging market stocks as world’s best bet, has created quite a stir in the investment world. According to the report, following the selloff in February and unlike other market corrections, investors are keen to put money in riskier assets of the emerging economy this time around.Although the MSCI Index has not shown any significant improvement since then, the comment by Sheila Patel, chief executive officer of International GSAM, has forced investors to think all over again before taking their assets out of this market.Going by the Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs is particularly betting on Indian healthcare firms, Mexican consumer stocks and Argentine debt. “She expects India’s government will boost spending on public health under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. And although political risks can’t be ignored investors’ pessimism toward Mexico and Argentina is overdone”- the report says.Emerging Market Healthcare Scenario Way Better Than the United StatesWhile Patel particularly talked about the growing prospects of the Indian healthcare market, data shows that the prospects of the broader emerging market are equally encouraging. On the contrary, the healthcare scenario in the United States is muddled.A survey report by Gallup Analytics last July revealed that U.S. adults cited healthcare as the second major problem faced by the country under the new presidential administration. Following the new healthcare reform announcement in December, a Gallup poll the next month stated that the past decade marked the biggest increase in the uninsured rate. Whatever the new healthcare reform may bring in, the near-term scenario remains pretty unclear as of now.Meanwhile, with exploding population, rising middle class and increasing governmental awareness of health issues, emerging geographies are facing huge demand for modern but cheaper healthcare options. Going by a report in The Guardian, International Finance Corp’s (IFJ) data shows that developing countries account for 80% of global deaths from chronic diseases indicating enormous market opportunity.Emerging Market Openings for MedTechPer a recent BCG report, the share of emerging markets, which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third of revenues by 2022. The MedTech market in China, currently the second largest in the world, is projected to grow about 13% annually from 2015 through 2022. India, the fifth largest MedTech market in the world, currently records 17% annual growth. At this pace, India may emerge as a strong competitor to Japan and Germany by 2022.Among other emerging geographical regions, Latin America, even in the face of economic stagnation, holds enormous potential. Per a January 2017 report by MedTech Intelligence, Central and South American nations significantly increased per capita spending on healthcare between 2008 and 2014.Given the huge potential in these regions, long back, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) had set up manufacturing and R&D centers in India, China and Brazil. The company’s emerging markets medical device segment continues to grow three to four times faster than the developed markets.Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50% of sales from this region. In the recent quarters, sales in key emerging markets were up in double digits, driven by strength in BRIC as well as strong growth in several countries throughout Latin America, including Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Argentina.At Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report), in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, businesses in China, Latin America, and Southeast Asia showed sustained strength, growing in double digits. Overall, Medtronic’s long-term outlook on emerging markets is encouraging.Boston Scientific’s (BSX  -  Free Report) emerging markets’ business registered 13% organic growth in fourth-quarter 2017, reflecting a significant increase from 8% growth in 2013. Business in China was once again remarkable (up 19% year over year).ConclusionThe growth pace of the emerging market has declined from the pre-financial crisis years. However, this market has historically played a crucial role for large corporations by hedging their international trade risk.  According to a BCG report, going forward, emerging market GDP is projected to grow around 2% faster than that of developed economies. The market will account for around 40% of total consumer spending — more than $20 trillion by 2020. From an investor point of view, it will be imprudent to disregard the immense growth potential of the emerging economy due to the occasional rough spots.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1211,MDT,"A few months down the line, the Republicans will complete a full year in power. Unfortunately, since the political power change, the healthcare community hasn’t had many opportunities to rejoice.A survey report by Gallup Analytics last month revealed that  U.S. adults cited healthcare as the second major problem faced by the country under the new presidential administration. In fact, the debate over repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare has been raging for a while now. Per the report, it peaked when it reached the Congress in August. Considering the prevailing uncertainty in the implementation of the health policy, any respite from it in the near term seems unlikely.MedTech in the United States: A Blurred PictureNeedless to say, the current crisis  in the U.S. MedTech industry, an integral part of the broader healthcare space, shows no signs of abating. A few months back, companies  in the space were hopeful about the promised cancellation of the 2.3% MedTech tax of Obamacare under the new government. Unquestionably, the latest political developments have landed the MedTech space in an uncertain territory.Investors are mulling over whether they should retain their existing MedTech stocks or forego their holdings  in favor of companies in other industries to boost their financial resources. That said, in spite of what the future may hold, we believe investors should stick to the MedTech space as it has shown signs of prosperity in recent times globally.Yes, you read that right. Even considering the dull performance of the U.S. medical device market (that still holds the leading position with almost one-third of the world market share) on rising regulatory and legislative uncertainty, global growth has been quite encouraging. In 2016, this industry grew 5%, a pace last seen before the financial crisis.Emerging Markets Hold Immense PromiseThe uncertainty in the United States along with the worsening economic condition in Europe automatically shifted the focus to emerging geographies like China, India, Latin America and others.These emerging economies are seeing  a rise in the uptake of medical devices largely due to growing medical awareness and economic prosperity. An aging population, increasing wealth, government focus on healthcare infrastructure and expansion of medical insurance coverage make these markets a happy hunting ground for global medical device players. Add to it, rising healthcare spending and improving healthcare infrastructure, this growth should continue in 2017 and beyond.Going by a recent BCG report, the share of emerging markets, which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third of revenues by 2022. The MedTech market in China, currently the second largest in the world, is projected to grow about 13% annually from 2015 through 2022. India’s Medtech market, the fifth largest in the world, is currently demonstrating 17% annual growth. If this continues, India may give good competition to Japan and Germany by 2022.Among other emerging geographies, Latin America, even in the face of general economic stagnation, holds enormous potential. Per a January 2017 report by MedTech Intelligence, the Central and South American nations significantly increased per capita spending on healthcare in the period between 2008 and 2014. According to World Bank data, Guatemala increased spending by 27%, Brazil 31%, Chile 54%, Colombia 58%, Uruguay 95%, Paraguay 115%, Bolivia 138%, and Ecuador 139%. Lower domestic production in Latin America has made it as an open market for U.S. exporters. Investment in Emerging Market Players Looks SensibleIn such a scenario, we believe it will be wise of investors who are keen on MedTech stocks to keep an eye on companies who have turned the emerging markets into a happy hunting ground with their expertise and network. No wonder, these stocks, cashing in on the enormous growth potential of these emerging geographies have perfectly shielded themselves from the political turmoil within the United States.Let us look at a few MedTech players with significant emerging market presence.Given the huge potential in these regions, long back, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) had set up manufacturing and R&D centers in Brazil, China and India. The company’s medical device segment of emerging markets is growing three to four times faster than the developed markets.

1212,MDT,"While the Wall Street is gearing up for the third-quarter releases, the Republicans have lost another battle pertaining to the repeal of Affordable Care Act (ACA), or Obamacare, with the recent Graham-Cassidy bill defeat.“Sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.” – President Trump.However, recent developments suggest that tables might turn again. The President’s latest ‘Executive Order’ that aims to exempt certain Association health plans to buy health insurance from the core Obamacare schedule, can take the shape of a serious threat for the healthcare community at large. Also, Rep. Lindsey Graham’s promise to revisit the Graham-Cassidy legislation deserves a mention here.Despite these issues, the MedTech industry has so far had a bullish run in 2017. Notwithstanding this, the third quarter is likely to take a hit from the policy debacle. In fact, the latest GOP defeat dampens probabilities of a new Republican healthcare reform with better tax paradigms, any time soon.Here we take a sneak peek into two other burning issues that are likely to impact the quarterly numbers in the MedTech fraternity.Tax Woes: At present, the point of focus at the Capitol Hill seems to be tax cuts. The MedTech community had been quite hopeful since the change in presidential power, as Trump’s proposed policies have been in favor of the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax. Undoubtedly, abolition of these tax paradigms are far from being achieved.Added to this, a stronger dollar, pricing and shipping-related issues as well as core market challenges are likely to affect the quarterly numbers of MedTech majors this season.Hurricanes Deal a Blow: Various reports suggest that the unfortunate occurrences of the hurricanes at the end of the third quarter are likely to mar revenues and earnings of several MedTech companies, primarily in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico. MedTech major Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report) acknowledged the impact of the Hurricane Maria on its quarterly metrics. The company expects almost $250 million impact on revenues and earnings.Apart from the natural calamities, a rise in unemployment (though short lived) and decline in consumer income coupled with increasing aggregate spending are likely to deal a heavy blow to MedTech numbers.Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Q3We have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to shortlist MedTech stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and are expected to yield solid results in the third quarter. We have zeroed in on stocks that andhave a favorable Growth Style Score of A or B.

1214,MDT,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) has presented positive data from an at-home pediatric study on patients aged between seven and 13 years. Notably, the data is based on MiniMed 670G system and was demonstrated at the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes’ 11th International Conference in Vienna, Austria.Study Results in DetailThe multi-center study had enrolled 105 participants within the 7-13 years’ age group. The trial consisted of a two-week run-in phase along with a study phase of three months. 97% of the participants chose to continue using the system as part of a Continued Access Program. Moreover, the study results demonstrated data from the pivotal trial of MiniMed 670G system on patients aged 14 years and above.Using the study results, the company has applied for an expanded FDA approval to include the patients ranging from seven to 13 years as eligible for using the MiniMed 670G system. At the same time, the company is working to expand the usage of the product on children aged between two and six years. Hopes are harbored on the effectiveness of this system, which should get greater customer adoptability over time.MiniMed 670G at a GlancePost the receipt of the FDA approval in 2016, Medtronic had commercially launched the MiniMed 670G system in June 2017. It is a Hybrid Closed Loop insulin delivery system for Type I diabetic patients aged 14 years or older. The MiniMed 670G system features Medtronic’s latest Guardian Sensor 3, a glucose sensor with increased accuracy and enhanced performance. This is the only FDA approved sensor to control a hybrid closed loop system including diagnostic technology that continuously checks sensor health. The system also carries Medtronic’s most advanced algorithm known as, SmartGuard HCL technology.Developments in Diabetes BusinessMedtronic witnessed sluggish growth in Diabetes business last quarter. However, the company gained on a strong uptake of new sensor-augmented insulin pump systems in the United States as well as in the international markets. This growth was temporarily offset by a limited supply of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) sensors. Moreover, a strong customer enrollment under the Priority Access Program briefly affected revenues.Per management, the diabetes business should witness revenue growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as the company has finished shipping pumps for the Priority Access Program. Also, the company is moving steadily with its sensor capacity expansion plans, scheduled to be completed in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.Additionally, Medtronic geared up for the international launch of the MiniMed 670G and the U.S. launch of CGM system Guardian Connect with sugar IQ in late 2018 and its new professional CGM iPro 3 in 2019. In this regard, the company also announced favorable results supporting the use of CGM on people with type 2 diabetes in October 2017.This apart, we are upbeat about Animas Corporation’s (one of the Johnson & Johnson Diabetes Care Companies) exit from the insulin pump business with Medtronic as partner to support a smooth transition for patients, caregivers and healthcare providers. Notably, patients using an Animas insulin pump will be offered the choice to switch to a Medtronic pump.Market PotentialAn ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and a rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare are likely to drive growth in the diabetes market. Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 5.93%. Given the bullish market sentiments, we believe the latest positive study results have come at an opportune moment.Share Price MovementMedtronic has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the past three months, the company’s share price has outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 4.7% in comparison to the broader industry’s 1.8% increase.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1215,MDT,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on Feb 20.Last quarter, the company delivered earnings ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.1%. In fact, Medtronic’s bottom line outpaced the estimates in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3.55%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsWe look forward to another quarter of solid growth on the company’s successful execution of three growth strategies such as therapy innovation, globalization and increasing the economic value for Medtronic. Combined with the demographics of an aging population, these positives have started to open up opportunities for Medtronic, which should get reflected in the third quarter as well.The space of therapy innovation is filled with multiple developments. Under the Cardiac and Vascular Group (CVG), new therapies are helping the company gain traction in the rapidly growing MedTech markets for left ventricular assist device (LVAD), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), drug-coated balloons, atrial fibrillation ablation and insertable diagnostics.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC Quote In the fiscal third quarter, Medtronic is expected to have maintained a market share in the core pacing, ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) and CRT (cardiac resynchronization therapy) product lines within the scope of CRHF (cardiac rhythm and heart failure) while creating new meaningful markets to enhance the company’s weighted average market growth.Within the TAVR space, the company expects to see continued global growth on strong adoption around the world for Evolut PRO valve as well as expansion in the traditional U.S. TAVR centers and U.S. share capture resulting from Medtronic’s new intermediate risk indication.After several quarters of dull Drug Eluting stent (DES) performance in coronary, the company’s DES product line witnessed growth in both the United States and Japan since the last couple of quarters. This upside is driven by the recent launch of Resolute Onyx in the said markets. Further, these developments buoy optimism and strengthen our belief for a strong quarterly performance by the company in the to-be-reported quarter.In fiscal 2018, CVG is projected to rise 5.5-7% with growth pertaining to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 on a more favorable prior-year comparison. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVG revenues in the fiscal third quarter is pegged at $2.77 billion, 9% higher than the year-ago reported number of $2.54 billion.Within Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), surgical innovations should register sturdy growth, driven by new products in advanced stapling and advanced energy. Advanced stapling growth should come on the back of endo stapling specialty reloads with Tri-Staple technology as well as Signia. Advanced Energy growth should bank on a continued rollout of the company’s LigaSure instruments and Valleylab FT10 energy platform.Medtronic expects MITG revenue increase in the range of 3-3.5% in fiscal 2018. Notably, the first half of fiscal 2018 lodged lower MITG rise due to adverse impact from Hurricane Maria, implying an accelerated second-half improvement of 3.5-4.5%.Within the Restorative Therapies Group (RTG), the company witnesses encouraging developments regarding the brain therapy space. This division experienced a very strong second quarter, driven by high 20s’ growth in neurovascular with strength across the entire stroke portfolio, plus a mid-teens increase in neurosurgery. We expect this bullish trend to continue in the third quarter as well.Medtronic estimates its RTG growth of approximately 3% in fiscal 2018, balancing the impact of Hurricane Maria and in spine market, the projection is flat to slightly down with continued strength in brain therapies. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MITG revenues in the soon-to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.91 billion, 5.5% higher than the year-ago reported figure.Overall, Medtronic expects full-year revenue growth of 4-5% at CER. Currency fluctuation is expected to leave a positive impact of $275-$375 million on fiscal results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues remains at $29.49 billion.Adjusted earnings per share growth for fiscal 2018 is expected in the range of 9-10% at CER. Currency translation is expected to adversely impact with a couple of cents. The consensus mark for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at $4.76.Here’s What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Medtronic does not have the right combination of the two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP:Medtronic has an Earnings ESP of -0.08%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Medtronic carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP.

1216,MDT,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) has recently announced a major investment in Santa Rosa, CA-based Millipede, Inc., to augment its position in the field of mitral regurgitation (MR). Millipede is the developer of IRIS Transcatheter Annuloplasty Ring System for the treatment of severe MR.Per the terms of the agreement, Boston Scientific has purchased a portion of Millipede for $90 million. The company has also kept an option to acquire the remaining shares of Millipede at any point of time prior to the completion of a first-in-human clinical study that meets certain parameters.Also, Millipede has the option to compel Boston Scientific to purchase its remaining shares upon the closure of the clinical study. The full buyout of Millipede needs additional $325 million payment by Boston Scientific and a further $125 million will be paid upon achievement of a commercial milestone.In this regard, management noted that MR occurs by a leaking mitral valve causing blood to regurgitate from the left ventricle to the left atrium of the heart. This condition can gradually lead to heart failure and heart rhythm problems. Patients with severe MR often complain of compromised heart functions and  cannot tolerate open-heart surgery for the repair or replacement of the leaking valve.Management is optimistic  about the large patient population in this space, which is  unfortunately underserved at the moment. Hence, this area represents a lucrative market to be tapped into. This patient population could benefit from a fully-percutaneous transcatheter procedure that can fix the dilated mitral annulus and reduce regurgitation without undergoing surgery.Encouragingly, the Millipede IRIS annuloplasty ring claims to be highly customizable to a specific patient's anatomy and disease state. This device is supplied via a transcatheter-transseptal delivery system and follows the standard surgical approach to mend and decrease the size of a dilated mitral annulus.On a positive note, the global transcatheter mitral valve replacement market is growing stupendously at a CAGR of approximately 22% over 2016-2020, as per the data provided by Technavio.Apart from Boston Scientific, other major players in this field are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) and Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1218,MDT,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has recently entered into an agreement with In Vitro Diagnostics technologies player, Surmodics, Inc. (SRDX  -  Free Report). Per the terms of the deal, the former will have exclusive worldwide commercialization rights over Surmodics' SurVeil drug-coated balloon. The deal remains aligned with Abbott’s focus to expand its broad line of vascular care products.Notably, the SurVeil drug-coated balloon by Surmodics is used to treat the superficial femoral artery and is under evaluation in a U.S. pivotal clinical trial. Significantly, this new-generation device is likely to complement and extend the company’s vascular devices portfolio including stents and vessel closure devices for addressing peripheral artery disease (PAD).Per the American Heart Association, PAD is the narrowing of arteries causing reduced blood flow to the legs, stomach, arms and head. According to Abbott, this condition is often underdiagnosed leading to other serious vascular conditions. In this regard, drug-coated balloons have emerged an important treatment option for the treatment of PAD.Globally, over 200 million people are affected with PAD while 12-20% of Americans alone aged above 60 years are suffering from the disease. Undoubtedly, the market for the therapies related to this indication looks lucrative.Per Abbott, the SurVeil drug-coated balloon holds greater promises in capturing the market compared with traditional devices. This is because it includes a proprietary drug-excipient formulation for a durable balloon coating and is manufactured using an innovative process to improve coating uniformity.Pre-clinical data for SurVeil has shown a three- to five-times higher target tissue drug concentration, a more evenly distributed and durable drug effect, and lower incidence of downstream drug particles in comparison to the control drug-coated balloon.Accordingly, the Surmodics deal seems highly strategic from Abbott’s point of view in monopolizing the huge and growing market for PAD-regulating drug-coated balloons.Apart from SurVeil-related pact, Abbott has choices to negotiate agreements for Surmodics' below-the-knee and arteriovenous fistula drug-coated balloon products, currently in pre-clinical development.Per data by ReportsnReports, the global market for peripheral vascular interventions including lower extremity stents, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloons, PTA drug-eluting balloons, carotid stents and renal stents is estimated to rise from $2.1 billion in 2015 to $3.4 billion by 2022 at a CAGR of 6.8%.Two major players in the drug coated balloons market are Medtronic, Inc. (MDT  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1220,MDT,"On Aug 25, we issued an updated research report on Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report).Medtronic exited the fiscal first quarter on a mixed note, with earnings exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. Over the last three months, Medtronic has underperformed the broader industry. The company has witnessed a decline in its share price since the release of quarterly results. Per the last share price movement, the company has lost 6.2%, as against the broader industry’s 0.8% gain over the last three months.Moreover, escalating costs and expenses are weighing on margins. Also, unfavorable foreign exchange continues to remain a drag.On a positive note, apart from displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets, Medtronic’s major business groups continue to contribute to top-line growth which highlighted sustainability across all segments and geographies. Recently, the company announced the receipt of CE Mark for Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan Active-Fixation heart lead. We are also encouraged by the solid growth trend, continuing in the United States as well as the healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies.Moreover, a consistent and gradually stabilizing movement in the global Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF) market can be observed. This should improve further in the coming quarters.We are also looking forward to Medtronic to receive $6 billion in cash for the Patient Monitoring & Recovery (PMR) division divestment, which will strengthen the company’s position to make further developmental investments..Meanwhile, post the Covidien acquisition, the consolidated company has so far successfully demonstrated strong segmental performance, reflecting successful integration and achievement of synergy targets.This apart, we note that despite facing severe macroeconomic pressure, Medtronic saw 12% growth in the emerging markets in the last reported quarter which contributed nearly 14% to the company’s overall revenues. Despite strong growth, the figure was in line with the company’s double-digit growth projections for the long term.The company is currently resorting to all possible means to boost growth. This includes penetrating the emerging markets, expansion of portfolio and restructuring of initiatives. These should benefit Medtronic over the long term. We are also encouraged by its foray into the rapidly growing transcatheter mitral valve replacement market through its $458-million acquisition of California-based medical device start-up Twelve, Inc.At present, Medtronic carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

1221,MDT,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) has made another encouraging move with respect to its Medical Devices business. The company recently announced FDA approval for Full MagLev HeartMate 3 Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD).Built on the sophisticated Full MagLev (fully magnetically-levitated) Flow technology, the HeartMate 3 system provides advanced short-term hemodynamic support to advanced heart failure patients.The Full MagLev technology enables HeartMate 3 system to lower trauma to the blood passing through the pump while optimizing blood flow. Interestingly, HeartMate 3 is an upgraded version to the existing HeartMate II system, which is used for longer duration.The much-awaited FDA approval was awarded to Abbott post successful results from the MOMENTUM 3 clinical study. We also encouragingly note that HeartMate 3 received CE Mark in 2015.Per management, over 5.7 million people in the United States suffer from heart failure and roughly 915,000 new patients are diagnosed with the condition every year. Supporting this data, Statista’s report on the U.S. Heart Failure market states that the market is projected to value $1,969 million by 2020, witnessing a CAGR of 16.2%. Moreover, they see an encouraging growth in the user penetration rate (as a share out of all ailing people) to 11.1% in 2020 from 8.1% in 2017. Thus, considering this data base, we believe that the latest FDA nod will accelerate the top-line growth.Per a report by Culrav.org, the global LVAD market is projected to value $2,323.4 million witnessing a CAGR of 8.9% from 2017 to 2025. Moreover, as per Transperency Market Research, the North American market for ventricular assist devices is expected to see a CAGR of 9.2% in the 2016 to 2024 period.Thus, considering the market potential, Abbott’s latest development will help it gain traction in the LVAD space.Interestingly, Abbott’s Medical Devices operating segment (39.1% of total revenues) stood out as the highest revenue grossing business in the second quarter of 2017.  Moreover, the company’s Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation sub-segment was the highest contributor, making up for 87.1% of the total Medical Devices revenues with 49.1% sales from the United States alone. Thus, the company’s latest development will help boost performance in this segment.We believe an ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the heart failure market.However, this market is dominated by many well-established players with Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) and Boston Scientiific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) being the most prominent ones.Moreover, Abbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the past three months, the company’s share price has outperformed the industry. The stock has gained 11.7%, higher than the broader industry’s gain of 0.8%. The company has also outperformed the 1% gain of the S&P 500 market over the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Key PickAbbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The companyrecently announced the CE Mark approval for Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan Active-Fixation heart lead.This is in line with the company’s strategy to focus on research and development of high-end medical device products within its core business lines. Notably, the company is engaged in clinics trials for evaluating Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan Active-Fixation heart lead in the United States, Canada and other regions.Medtronic’s latest offering features active-fixation technology that assists in precise lead placement and stability when paired with the company’s quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillators (CRT-D) and -pacemakers (CRT-P). The company also initiated a multicenter clinical study with a target to enroll roughly 471 patients across 56 sites in the United States, Canada, Europe, Hong Kong and Malaysia. This global study is aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of the lead in heart failure patients.Interestingly, Medtronic’s Cardiac & Vascular group (CVG) segment accounted for 35.9% to total revenues in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Moreover, the company’s CRHF sub-segment was the highest contributor, making up for 52.3% of the total CVG revenues. This was largely backed by strong growth in Arrhythmia Management as well as the HeartWare International acquisition. Thus, the company’s latest development will help boost performance in this segment.Medtronic’s strategy to gain traction in the CRHFsub-segment seems to be aligned with data provided by Allied Market Research.  Per the report, the global Cardiac Monitoring and Cardiac Rhythm Management market is expected to see a CAGR of 7.6% from 2016 to 2022 to reach a value of $32,216 million.We believe the high incidence of cardiac diseases due to unhealthy lifestyle, penetration by the concerned companies in the untapped markets, technological advancements and increasing awareness among people will continue to drive the global acceptance of this technology. In the view of these encouraging factors, we believe that the company’s European development for Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan Active-Fixation heart lead is strategic and will broaden its customer base.However, over the last month, Medtronic has been underperforming the broader industry. The stock has declined 3.9% as compared to the industry’s 2.9% fall. It also underperformed the 0.9% decline of the S&P 500 over the same time frame.

1224,MDT,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) has made another encouraging move with respect to its Aortic & Peripheral Vascular (APV) business. The company recently announced the receipt of regulatory approval for IN.PACT Admiral Drug-Coated Balloon (DCB) from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (“MHLW”).Medtronic’s IN.PACT Admiral DCB gained approval for treating peripheral artery disease (PAD) in the upper leg, - particularly thigh (superficial femoral arteries and behind the knee (popliteal arteries). However, before the commercial launch of the product, Medtronic has to collaborate with Japanese MHLW to attain reimbursement approval. The company believes that reimbursement approval will widen the global customer base for IN.PACT Admiral DCB.The Japanese regulatory approval was granted to IN.PACT Admiral DCB on the grounds of successful results from the IN.PACT SFA Japan Trial. This development is in line with the company’s strategy to focus on research and development of high-end medical device products within its core business lines.We note that the IN.PACT Admiral DCB received FDA approval in December 2014 to treat superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. Moreover, it is commercially available in Europe since its receipt of the CE mark approval in 2009. So far, 200,000 PAD patients in Europe have been treated with the device.Interestingly, Medtronic’s revenues from the APV division improved 4% year over year (up 5% at constant exchange rate) in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Moreover, Peripheral Vascular business grew low double digits in both atherectomy and drug-coated balloons. The latest development should boost the company’s performance in this segment.Medtronic’s strategy to gain traction in the peripheral vascular sub-segment seems to be aligned with data provided by MarketsAndMarkets. Per the report, the interventional cardiology & peripheral vascular devices market is expected to see a CAGR of 7.1% from 2016 to 2021 to reach a value of $31.47 billion.We believe the high incidence of peripheral artery disease due to unhealthy lifestyle and aging population, penetration by the companies in the untapped markets, rising needs for minimally-invasive angioplasty procedures, technological advancements and increasing awareness among people will continue to drive the global acceptance of this technology. In view of these encouraging factors, we believe that the company’s Japanese development for IN.PACT Admiral DCB is strategic and will broaden its customer base.However, over the last month, Medtronic has been underperforming the broader industry. The stock has declined 2.6% in contrast to the industry’s 2.5% gain. It also underperformed the 0.8% gain of the S&P 500 over the same time frame. Nevertheless, we believe the latest Japanese regulatory approval will boost investor confidence in the stock.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1225,MDT,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) reported financial results for first-quarter fiscal 2018. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in the reported quarter came in at $1.12, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.7% and up 8.7% year over year. Adjustments in the quarter primarily included certain impact of restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization and acquisition-related items. After adjusting unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 2 cents, adjusted EPS came in at $1.14, up 11% year over year.Without these adjustments, the company reported net income of 74 cents per share, up 12.1% year over year.Total RevenueWorldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed $7.39 billion, up 4% on a constant exchange rate or CER basis (up 3% on a reported basis). The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.45 billion. Foreign currency fluctuation affected Medtronic’s fiscal first quarter revenues by $33 million.In the quarter under review, U.S. sales (55% of total revenue) increased 1% year over year to $4.04 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.31 billion (31% of total revenue), reflecting a 5% increase at CER (up 4% as reported). Emerging markets (14% of total revenue) amounted to $1.04 billion, up 12% at CER (up 11% as reported).Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteSegment DetailsThe company currently generates revenues from four major groups, viz. Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) and Diabetes Group.CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions (APV). MITG includes both the Surgical Solutions and the Patient Monitoring & Recovery (PMR) divisions. RTG includes the Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments, while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Service & Solutions (DSS) divisions.Revenues at CVG improved 6% at CER (or up 5% as reported) to $2.65 billion, driven by strong, balanced growth across all three divisions.CRHF sales were $1.39 billion with 5% year over year at CER (up 4% as reported). This came on the back of growth in Arrhythmia Management led by high-teens growth in atrial fibrillation Solutions at CER, amplified penetration of the Micra transcatheter pacing system, strong uptake of the TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope and continued worldwide customer demand for the Reveal LINQ insertable cardiac monitor. This apart, the HeartWare International acquisition drove growth in the Heart Failure division.CSH revenues were up 8% at CER (7% as reported) to $817 million on the back of high 30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform in the United States and continued demand for the CoreValve Evolut R 34mm valve in the United States as well as Europe.APV revenues registered 5% growth at CER (up 4% as reported) to $439 million, driven by the continued adoption of the Endurant IIs aortic stent graft and remarkable strength of the Heli-FX EndoAnchor System. Peripheral was driven by low-double digit growth in both atherectomy and drug-coated balloons.In MITG, worldwide sales reached $2.49 billion, marking a 3% year-over-year increase at CER (same as reported) on mid-single digit growth in Surgical Solutions and low-single digit growth in PMR.In RTG, worldwide revenues of $1.81 billion were up 2% year over year at CER (same as reported) on high-single digit growth in Brain Therapies, mid-single digit growth in Specialty Therapies and low-single digit growth in Spine, thus mitigating a decline in Pain Therapies. However, revenues from the Diabetes group decreased 1% at CER (same as reported) to $449 million.MarginsGross margin during the reported quarter contracted 20 basis points (bps) to 68.2% despite a 2.8% increase in gross profit to $5.04 billion. Adjusted operating margin remained flat year over year at 26.3%. This was owing to a 1.4% decline in research and development expenses (to $548 million) which was offset by a 2.3% rise in selling, general and administrative expenses (to $2.49 billion). Other expenses in the reported quarter were $66 million as compared with $39 million in the year-ago period.GuidanceMedtronic reiterated its fiscal 2018 constant-currency revenue and EPS guidance. The company still expects full-year revenue growth in the range of 4-5% at CER. However, the company revised its foreign currency fluctuation estimation, which is now projected to have a positive $380-$480 million impact in the fiscal year compared to an expected positive impact of $75-$175 million stated previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues remains at $30.72 billion for fiscal 2018.Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share growth is still expected in the range of 9-10% at CER. Currency translation is now expected to have an adverse impact of 3 cents to a positive impact of 1 cent compared with the earlier expectation of negative impact of approximately 5-10 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at $4.89.Moreover for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, Medtronic expects currency translation to have a favorable impact of $25-$75 million on revenues. Currency translation is expected to have a favorable impact of 0-2 cents on second-quarter earnings per share.Our TakeMedtronic’s exited the fiscal fourth-quarter on a mixed note with earnings ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the reported revenues failing to meet the estimates. While the company demonstrated improved segmental performances at CER, escalating costs and expenses continue to weigh on bottom line. Unfavorable currency translation acted as a dampener to the company’s quarterly performance. However, the fiscal guidance represents chances of respite.On a positive note, three major business groups contributed to solid top-line growth at CER, which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions, in addition to displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets. We are also encouraged by the solid growth trend, successfully continuing in the U.S. as well as the healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies. Apart from product innovation, the company is currently focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses.Zacks Rank & Peer PerformancesMedtronics currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1228,MDT,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) announced study results showing the superiority of Medtronic ITB (Intrathecal baclofen) Therapy to conventional medical management (CMM) for the reduction of severe post-stroke spasticity (PSS) in adults. Notably, the results from the ‘Spasticity In Stroke-Randomised Study’ (SISTERS) trial were published in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry (JNNP).The results demonstrate that ITB Therapy with Lioresal Intrathecal (baclofen injection) delivered via the SynchroMed II Infusion System is superior to oral antispastic medications in decreasing muscle tone in the affected lower and upper extremities.Going by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons’ data, more than 12 million people suffer from spasticity worldwide. According to the company, severe spasticity patients have tight, stiff muscles that make everyday activities tiring and difficult. If proper treatment is not provided then the excessive muscle tone can significantly reduce the quality of life. Hence in an initiative to provide effective treatment to severe PSS patients, the company demonstrated the efficacy of ITB therapy over oral medication.  SISTERS is the first randomized, controlled, open-label, multicentre study to examine the effectiveness and safety of ITB Therapy compared to CMM with oral medications for treatment of PSS after six months of active treatment.Developments in Pain TherapiesMedtronic is consistently trying to boost its Pain Therapies division, which is part of the Restorative Therapies Group.

1229,MDT,"On Jan 10, we issued an updated research report on Surmodics, Inc. (SRDX  -  Free Report). Solid growth in Medical Device and IVD businesses drove Surmodics’ growth trajectory. However, foreign exchange woes continue to be headwind for the company. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Robust sales growth in the core business segments holds promise for Surmodics. The Medical Devices segment contributes about three-quarters to the company’s total revenues, with majority of it coming from hydrophilic coatings royalties and product sales, including balloon catheters and specialty catheter-based technologies among others.Meanwhile, the IVD segment has witnessed strong sales of stabilization reagents and molecular diagnostics products. The company plans to continue developing Surmodics' core medical device coatings and diagnostic reagents businesses.  The company's initiative to strengthen research and development programs is also a positive. In the last few years, the company has made several acquisitions which have diversified its revenue base. Further, the latest regulatory approval for SurVeil reflects Surmodics’ solid foothold in the drug-delivery space. Buoyed by these developments, Surmodics issued a solid guidance for fiscal 2018.On the negative side, weakening U.S. dollar as compared with the Euro is a headwind. As a result, Surmodics reported a $0.3 million foreign exchange loss on its euro-denominated contingent consideration obligation related to the Creagh Medical acquisition in the last quarter. The company had significant foreign currency losses and operating losses in Ireland.Of the other major concerns, cutthroat competition in the niche space is a drawback. Surmodics’ flagship SurVeil Drug-Coated Balloons faces stiff competition with Medtronic’s (MDT  -  Free Report) admiral IN.PACT platformGloomy Price ScenarioSurmodics’ shares have underperformed the industry over the last year. Specifically, the stock has gained 10.7% against the industry's rally of 24.2%. The current level is also lower than S&P 500 index’s return of 21.6% over the same time frame.

1230,MDT,"AngioDynamics Inc. (ANGO  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 4, before market opens. Last quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of 12 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents.On an average, AngioDynamics delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.79% in the trailing four quarters. However, a lackluster price performance over the last year and high debt levels continue to hinder the company. AngioDynamics’ shares have returned a mere 0.7% compared with the industry’s rally of 24%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayStrong Product Portfolio: AngioDynamics’ wide array of products like AngioVac, BioFlo and NanoKnife enhances market opportunities. Notably, the PV business (peripheral vascular sales) has also built a strong momentum. AngioDynamics has been experiencing growth in other product families like Food Management, Thrombus Management, BioFlo products and NanoKnife disposables in the Oncology section.Solero MTA System to Drive Growth: The company rides on the market’s solid response to Solero Microwave Tissue Ablation (MTA) system, especially within the Microwave Ablation space. The platform is intended to be used for the ablation of soft tissue during open procedures. Per management, Solero was the primary driver for the whopping 11% year-over-year increase in the oncology surgery sales last quarter.Robust Fundamental Growth Story: Over the last 4 years, the company’s sales witnessed a CAGR of 0.3%, whereas, earnings per share saw a CAGR of 11.3%. The company expects to benefit from the ongoing market transition toward less invasive interventional procedures in the upcoming years.Unfavorable Estimate Revision Trend: The estimate revision trend for the current quarter has been unfavorable for AngioDynamics. In the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues fell 1.4% year over year to $87.80 million. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings declined 12.3% to 17 cents per share on a year-over-year basis.AngioDynamics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise AngioDynamics, Inc.

The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.07 billion. Foreign currency fluctuation affected Medtronic’s second-quarter revenues by $35 million.In the quarter under review, U.S. sales (52.9% of total revenues) declined 10.1% year over year to $3.73 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.24 billion (31.8% of total revenues), reflecting a 4.7% increase at CER (up 1.4% as reported). Emerging market revenues (15.3% of total revenues) amounted to $1.08 billion, up 12.4% at CER (up 9.8% as reported).Segment DetailsThe company currently generates revenues from four major groups, viz. Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) and Diabetes Group.CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions (APV). MITG now includes the Surgical Innovations (SI) and the Respiratory, Gastrointestinal & Renal (RGR) divisions after the divestiture of Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis (Compression), and Nutritional Insufficiency (Enteral Feeding) businesses. RTG comprises the Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments, while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Service & Solutions (DSS) divisions.CVG revenues improved 7% at CER (up 7.4% as reported) to $2.77 billion, driven by strong, balanced growth across all three divisions.CRHF sales totaled $1.47 billion, up 4% year over year at CER (up 5% as reported). This came on the back of growth in Arrhythmia Management led by high-teens growth in atrial fibrillation Solutions and low-double digit rise in Diagnostics at CER, amplified penetration of the Micra transcatheter pacing system, and strong uptake of the TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope. This apart, strong demand for the company's suite of quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy-pacemakers (CRT-P) along with growth in Mechanical Circulatory Support drove Heart Failure division revenues.CSH revenues were up 12% at CER (13% as reported) to $854 million on the back of high-30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform. Moreover, the company's recent launch of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in the United States and Japan revived the Coronary business.APV revenues registered 4% growth at CER (up 5% as reported) to $452 million, driven by continued adoption of the Valiant Captiviathoracic stent graft systems and strength in the Heli-FX EndoAnchor System. Peripheral was driven by double-digit growth in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and drug-coated balloons. Moreover, the recently-launched Concerto 3D detachable coil system drove mid-single digit growth in endoVenous.In MITG, worldwide sales reached $1.95 billion, marking a 2% year-over-year increase at CER (down 21% on a reported basis) on mid-single digit growth in SI, which was affected by Hurricane Maria, and partially offset by low-single digit decline in RGR.In RTG, worldwide revenues of $1.86 billion were up 2% year over year at CER (same as reported) on low double-digit growth in Brain Therapies, offsetting declines in Spine, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies. Moreover, the Spine and Pain Therapies divisions along with the Pelvic Health business in the Specialty Therapies division in the United States were affected by Hurricane Maria.However, revenues at the Diabetes group declined 2% at CER (flat as reported) to $462 million.MarginsGross margin in the reported quarter expanded 160 basis points (bps) to 69.9% despite a 1.8% decline in gross profit to $4.93 billion. Adjusted operating margin contracted 40 bps year over year to 27.5% owing to a 0.2% rise in research and development expenses (to $555 million) along with a 0.8% uptick in selling, general and administrative expenses (to $2.44 billion). Other expenses in the reported quarter totaled $111 million as compared with $89 million in the year-ago quarter.GuidanceMedtronic reiterated its fiscal 2018 constant-currency revenue and EPS guidance. The company maintains full-year revenue growth projection in the range of 4-5% at CER.

1232,MDT,"We’re actually seeing pre-market indexes in the green at this hour today, in the latter third of a month that is on pace for the biggest monthly decline since October 2016.

And as we wrap up Q2 earnings season, we still have a few notable companies worth hearing from.Medical devices major Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report) reported mixed results ahead of the opening bell today: the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated company posted a 4-cent beat to $1.12 per share on its bottom line, whereas revenues in the quarter reached $7.39 billion, shy of the $7.44 billion expected. Two of Medtronic’s stronger departments — Cardiac & Vascular and Minimally Invasive Therapies — rose 6% and 3% year over year, respectively.Luxury home builder Toll Brothers (TOL  -  Free Report) beat expectations on both top and bottom lines, posting 87 cents per share on $1.50 billion in revenues compared to the 68 cents per share and $1.48 billion analysts had been looking for.

1233,MDT,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) announced the FDA nod and U.S. launch of the Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm Drug-Eluting Stent (DES). The new stent is the smallest in size in the market presently. The Resolute Onyx DES is available for use in all sizes in the United States, Europe and in countries that recognize the CE Mark.The stent has been exclusively designed to help interventional cardiologists treat patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). These patients have small vessels and are often untreatable with larger stent technologies during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).Management believes the introduction of Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm DES enables doctors to broaden treatment options for patients with smaller vessels. Notably, the Resolute Onyx DES platform is the only DES to feature Core Wire Technology (an evolution of Continuous Sinusoid Technology). It is also to be noted that the RESOLUTE ONYX 2.0 mm Clinical Study supports the Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm DES. This study was presented at the 2017 EuroPCR Annual Meeting and simultaneously published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC): Cardiovascular Intervention.Coronary & Structural Heart PerformanceMedtronic is consistently trying to enhance its Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) segment, which is part of the Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG) segment.CSH revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2018 were up 14% at CER (18% as reported) to $886 million on low-30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform and expanded FDA approval to include patients at intermediate risk.Moreover, the continued uptake of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in the United States and Japan revived the business.Market PotentialMedtronic’s strategy to gain traction in the CSH sub-segment seems to be aligned with data provided by Transparency Market Research. Per the report, the global coronary stents market is expected to see a CAGR of 6.6% from 2013 to 2019.More specifically, the DES market within the Coronary stents market is expanding fast. It is estimated to witness a CAGR of 9.54% in the 2013-2019 period. The market is likely to expand 9% in the United States, 10% in the Asia Pacific, and 3.1% in Europe as well as the Rest of the World.Stock Performance & Estimate RevisionOver the last three months, Medtronic has underperformed the industry, declining 0.1% as compared to the industry’s 3.8% gain over the last three months. It also underperformed the 5.8% gain of the S&P 500 market over the same time frame.Also, the estimate revision trend for the current year remains unfavorable with nine estimates moving south over the last two months, compared to two movements in the opposite direction. Earnings estimates rose around 0.4% to $4.75 per share over the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories sports a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

1234,MDT,"On Feb 20, we issued an updated research report on Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company exited the second quarter on a solid note, courtesy of encouraging performance by the Medical segment. The Pharmaceutical segment also witnessed strong growth in the Specialty business and gained a large number of Pharmaceutical Distribution customers. A strong fiscal 2018 outlook buoys optimism.Cardinal Health’s share price movement over the last year has failed to impress. The stock has lost almost 17.4%, comparing unfavorably with the industry's gain of around 9.9%. Cardinal Health faces the risk of losing considerable business in case of loss of a major customer, which in turn will severely impair revenues. However, the company’s share price has been rising since the second-quarter earnings release. The stock has gained 4.1% till yesterday’s close.Cardinal Health’s Medical and Pharmaceutical offerings lend the company a competitive edge in the niche space. The company offers industry expertise and an expanding portfolio of safe products. Also, Cardinal Health follows an acquisition-driven strategy and continues to focus on investment in key growth businesses to gain market traction and boost profits. Cardinal Health recently announced the acquisition of Medtronic's (MDT  -  Free Report) Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis and Nutritional Insufficiency business for $6.1 billion. The buyout particularly boosted the company’s Medical segment.Further,Cardinal Health is pursuing growth via joint ventures and long-term supply agreements. The company entered a long-term strategic agreement with Henry Schein, under which the latter purchased Cardinal Health’s medical supplies for physician practices. The collaboration is expected to drive core sales and prove accretive to Cardinal Health’s earnings in the long term.Despite growth in business, profits at the company’s Pharmaceutical segment were hurt by generic pharmaceutical pricing. Huge investments in Pharmaceutical IT platform and lackluster generics performance are likely to mar Cardinal Health’s operational efficiency in the upcoming quarter. Intense competition and customer concentration are other bottlenecks.Other Key PicksA couple of other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The company has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 25%.PerkinElmer has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 12.3%.

1235,MDT,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) expanded its product portfolio with the introduction of MiniMed Mio Advance infusion set. The recent offering from the Diabetes business will be commercially available in Canada, Hong Kong and certain countries in Europe in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. However, the company plans an extensive launch of the same in 2018.Notably, the MiniMed Mio Advance infusion set witnessed a limited launch in some countries under the initial product introduction period during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. 85% of the 200 customers were satisfied with their experience with MiniMed Mio Advance infusion set during the limited launch period. The company is optimistic about the effectiveness of this system, which is expected to witness greater customer adoptability over time and drive the top line.Progress in MiniMed PortfolioMedtronic has been forging ahead with initiatives to boost the performance of its MiniMed portfolio. Recently, the company reported positive data from an at-home pediatric study on patients aged between seven and 13 years. The data is based on MiniMed 670G system and was demonstrated at the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes’ 11th International Conference in Vienna, Austria.Notably, Medtronic commercially launched the MiniMed 670G system in June 2017. It is a Hybrid Closed Loop insulin delivery system for Type I diabetic patients aged 14 years or older. The MiniMed 670G system features Medtronic’s latest Guardian Sensor 3, a glucose sensor with increased accuracy and enhanced performance.Developments in Diabetes BusinessMedtronic witnessed a 13% rise at constant exchange rate in revenues in the Diabetes business in third-quarter fiscal 2018. The company benefited from positive uptake of new sensor-augmented insulin pump systems in the United States as well as in the international markets along with enhanced production capacity for the same. Notably, Medtronic expects double-digit growth in the segment in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, courtesy of consistent performance of MiniMed 670G system in the United States along with enhanced sensor supply capacity.Additionally, Medtronic has been gearing up for the international launch of the MiniMed 670G and the U.S. launch of CGM system Guardian Connect with sugar IQ in late 2018 and its new professional CGM iPro 3 in 2019. In this regard, the company also announced favorable results supporting the use of CGM on patients with type 2 diabetes in October 2017.Market PotentialAn ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and a rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare are likely to drive growth in the diabetes market. Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 5.93%. Considering the bullish market sentiments, we believe that the latest development has arrived at an opportune moment.Price MovementMedtronic has been underperforming the broader industry over the past three months. The stock has declined 3.4% versus the industry’s 2.7% rally. However, we believe that the introduction of MiniMed Mio Advance infusion set will help the company regain investors’ optimism.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories sports a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

1237,MDT,"We expect Ireland-based medical device major Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter and fiscal 2018 results on Aug 22, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company posted earnings of $1.33 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. In fact, Medtronic’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters with an average beat of 1.33%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Medtronic is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  Medtronic has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.09 is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Medtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteWhat is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?We look forward to another quarter of solid growth on successful execution of its three growth strategies, therapy innovation, globalization and economic value for Medtronic. Combined with the demographics of an aging population, these positives have started to open up opportunities for Medtronic, which should get reflected in the first quarter as well.Within therapy innovation, there have been multiple developments. Under the Cardiac and vascular group, new therapies are helping the company gain traction in the rapidly growing MedTech markets such as left ventricular assist device (LVAD), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), drug-coated balloons, atrial fibrillation ablation and insertable diagnostics.Within cardiac rhythm implantables, the company is fast capturing market share on its differentiated 3T MRI technology. Within TAVR, we expect Medtronic to register strong growth in the quarter on the back of the FDA approval for the extended use of its self-expanding CoreValve Evolut TAVR platform in July 2017. With this approval, patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and at an intermediate risk for open-heart surgery will be eligible for treatment using the technology.In coronary, Medtronic has been seeing weak Drug Eluting stent (DES) performance, particularly in the United States. Per management, the FDA approval of the Resolute Onyx DES in May 2017 put a check on the decline in U.S. DES sales by fiscal 2018. Also, Medtronic has started selling Resolute Onyx DES in the high-growth Japan market from Jul 10, as per a Cardiovascular Business report released on Jul 7. These developments buoy optimism and strengthen our belief for strong quarterly performance by the company in first-quarter fiscal 2018.Over the recent past, the company has been witnessing soft sequential performance in its diabetes business owing to the anticipated full launch of the MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system. In June 2017, Medtronic announced the U.S. launch of the MiniMed 670G system for type 1 diabetes. This should reflect in the company’s top line from the first-quarter fiscal 2018.In June 2017, Medtronic announced a new outcomes-based agreement with Aetna for type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients currently on multiple daily insulin injections. This development may also start contributing to the company's diabetes business in near term.Also, within the brain therapy space, under the Restorative Therapies Group business, the company saw encouraging developments. Medtronic announced the receipt of Health Canada licence for SureTune 3 software for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in June 2017. The latest innovations in the SureTune technology allow for more precise, efficient treatment while also improving patient management with centralized data storage for easy reference. The company received CE Mark for its SureTune software for deep brain stimulation in the same month.The company’s estimate revision trend for the fiscal first quarter has also been positive. In the past seven days, one analyst moved north, with no movement in the opposite direction. However, the magnitude of the estimate revision trend with earnings estimates remained at $1.08 over the same time frame.Medtronic has provided its initial fiscal 2018 revenues and EPS guidance. The company expects full-year revenue growth in the range of 4% to 5% at CER. Foreign currency fluctuation is expected to have a positive $75 million to $175 million impact in the fiscal. Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share are expected to grow 9% to 10% at CER. Currency translation will negatively impact full-year earnings by approximately 5 cents to 10 cents, including the 3 cents to 5 cents impact in the first-quarter fiscal 2018.With Medtronic gaining a significant portion of its sales from the international market, currency fluctuations are a major concern. This has been a dampener for the company over the last few quarters. Considering this, for first-quarter fiscal 2018, Medtronic anticipates currency headwind to affect revenues by $10 million to $60 million. Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Big Lots, Inc. (BIG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.56% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Best Buy Co., Inc.

1238,MDT,"Medical device major Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) is focusing on expanding its core Coronary and Structural Heart business. Keeping in line with this, the company recently announced a global randomized clinical trial to evaluate one-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients implanted with the Resolute Onyx Drug-Eluting Stent (DES) during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures.DAPT is a combination of aspirin and anti-clotting medication. Notably, Resolute Onyx DES is the first DES which works on the Core Wire Technology, an evolution of Continuous Sinusoid Technology (CST).Resolute Onyx DES provides enhanced visibility to surgeons, delivering superior clinical performance.According to Medtronic, the RESOLUTE ONYX ONE-MONTH DAPT study aims to help inform DAPT guidelines for newer-generation DES that currently support bare-metal stents (BMS) for stable ischemic heart disease patients who might require a shorter dual antiplatelet regimen. The study will also demonstrate Medtronic’s clinical investment to provide relevant DAPT evidence to physicians for both current and previous generation DES.DAPT therapy guidelines vary geographically as well as by patient presentation. Duration of DAPT evaluation is made based on individuals along with clinical judgment, evaluating the benefit/risk ratio, product labeling, and patient preference. The study will be based on approximately 2,000 patients worldwide.As per the company’s press release, the RESOLUTE ONYX ONE-MONTH DAPT study outcomes will build on the RESOLUTE Pooled DAPT Interruption analysis that showed no increased risk of stent thrombosis with DAPT interruption or discontinuation after a month.Taking into consideration the huge and growing global coronary stent market, we believe the latest initiative by Medtronic is well timed. Per a report by Transparency Market Research, the global coronary stents market is expected to see a CAGR of 6.6% from 2013 to 2019.Recent Developments on Coronary StentRecently, Medtronic announced that DES has met its primary endpoint of Target Lesion Failure (TLF) at one year for the treatment of coronary artery disease in extra-small vessels.Also, of late, the Resolute Onyx DES received FDA approval.Further, post the successful launch of Resolute Onyx DES in the U.S. in May 2017, Medtronic has started selling it in the Japan market from Jul 10, as per a Cardiovascular Business report released on Jul 7.To note, over the last six months, Medtronic has outperformed the S&P 500 Index. As per the latest share price movement, the company has gained 7.2%, compared to the S&P 500’s 5.2% gain.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Earnings rose 4.5% year over year. Adjustments in the quarter primarily included the impact of restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, divestiture-related items and acquisition-related items. After adjusting for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of a penny, adjusted EPS was $1.18.Without these adjustments, the company’s reported a net loss of $1.03 per share, compared to 59 cents in the previous year. This included a $2.2-billion net tax expense related to the U.S. tax reform.Total RevenuesWorldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed $7.37 billion, up 7% on a constant exchange rate or CER basis (up 1.2% on a reported basis). The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.20 billion. Foreign currency fluctuation favorably impacted Medtronic’s third-quarter revenues by $177 million.In the quarter under review, U.S. sales (53.1% of total revenues) fell 4.9% year over year (up 6% at CER) to $3.91 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.36 billion (32% of total revenues), reflecting a 5% increase at CER (up 7.8% as reported). Emerging market revenues (14.9% of total revenues) amounted to $1.10 billion, up 12% at CER (up 11.8% as reported).Medtronic plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Medtronic plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Medtronic plc Quote Segment DetailsThe company currently generates revenues from four major groups, viz. Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) and Diabetes Group.CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions (APV). MITG now includes the Surgical Innovations (SI) and the Respiratory, Gastrointestinal & Renal (RGR) divisions after the divestiture of Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis (Compression), and Nutritional Insufficiency (Enteral Feeding) businesses. RTG comprises the Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments, while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Service & Solutions (DSS) divisions.CVG revenues improved 7% at CER (up 10% as reported) to $2.80 billion, driven by strong, balanced growth across all three divisions.CRHF sales totaled $1.46 billion, up 4% year over year at CER (up 6% as reported). This came on the back of growth in Arrhythmia Management led by high-teens growth in atrial fibrillation Solutions at CER, amplified penetration of the Micra transcatheter pacing system, and strong uptake of the TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope. This apart, strong demand for the company's suite of quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy-pacemakers (CRT-P) along with growth in Mechanical Circulatory Support drove Heart Failure division revenues.CSH revenues were up 14% at CER (18% as reported) to $886 million on the back of low-30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform and expanded FDA approval to include patients at intermediate risk. Moreover, the continued uptake of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in the United States and Japan revived the Coronary business.APV revenues registered 5% growth at CER (up 7% as reported) to $457 million, driven by continued adoption of the Valiant Captiviathoracic stent graft systems. Peripheral was driven by double-digit growth in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and drug-coated balloons. Moreover, solid contributions from VenaSeal closure system drove high-single digit growth in endoVenous.In MITG, worldwide sales reached $2.04 billion, marking a 6% year-over-year increase at CER (down 16% on a reported basis) on high-single digit growth in SI, and a low-single digit growth in RGR, both at CER.In RTG, worldwide revenues of $1.94 billion were up 5% year over year at CER (up 7% as reported) on low double-digit growth in Brain Therapies, mid-single digit growth in Specialty Therapies and high-single digit growth in Pain Therapies, at CER. However, revenues from the Spine business remained flat at CER on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, revenues at the Diabetes group increased 13% at CER (17% as reported) to $584 million.MarginsGross margin in the reported quarter expanded 140 basis points (bps) to 70.3% on a 3.3% rise in gross profit to $5.18 billion. Adjusted operating margin expanded 10 bps year over year to 28.9% owing to a 5.3% rise in research and development expenses (to $558 million) along with a 4.6% uptick in selling, general and administrative expenses (to $2.49 billion). Other expenses in the reported quarter totaled $140 million as compared with $46 million in the year-ago quarter.GuidanceMedtronic reiterated its fiscal 2018 constant-currency revenue and EPS guidance. The company maintains full-year revenue growth projection at the range of 4-5% at CER. However, the company revised its foreign currency fluctuation estimation, which is now projected to have a positive $480-$500 million impact on fiscal results compared with $275-$375 million estimated earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues remains at $29.50 billion.Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share growth is still expected in the range of 9-10% at CER. Currency translation is likely to have an adverse impact of 4 cents compared with the earlier expectation of a negative effect of 2 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at $4.76.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Medtronic expects currency translation to have a favorable impact of $300-$320 million on revenues. Currency translation is expected affect fourth-quarter earnings per share by 2 cents.Our TakeMedtronic exited the fiscal third quarter on a solid note. The company demonstrated improved segmental performances at CER on growth in all business segments. However, escalating costs continue to be a concern.Moreover, all the major business groups contributed to solid top-line growth at CER, which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions, in addition to displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets. We are also encouraged by the company’s solid growth trend in the United States as well as healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies. Apart from product innovation, the company is focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses. Moreover, the company’s recent receipt of FDA approval for the Riptide Aspiration System under the Neurovascular unit within the RTG business buoys optimism. This adds a valuable tool to the company’s Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) product portfolio.Zacks Rank & Peer PerformancesMedtronic has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks that reported solid results this earnings season are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).

1243,MDT,"As a major development in its Ear, Nose & Throat (ENT) products business, Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) recently launched StealthStation ENT. This FDA approved and CE Marked surgical navigation system allows surgeons to treat conditions within the ENT anatomy.This technology uses a proprietary electromagnetic (EM) tracking technology, similar to a GPS system used for cars. Per the company, it generates an electromagnetic field around the target patient anatomy during surgery so that instrument positioning is dynamically tracked throughout a procedure.The StealthStation ENT system enables surgeons to gain better visualization. According to the company, this system offers an edge over the traditional endoscope in the sense that the former includes software and hardware innovation like Virtual Endoscopy, helping surgeons gain a simulated view of sinus cavities unlike the latter. According to a report by Markets and Markets, the global surgical navigation systems market is expected to reach a worth of $906.8 million by 2021, at a CAGR of 6.5% during the 2016-2021 period. Considering the huge potential of the market, we believe the latest development is a strategical fit.Over the last three months, Medtronic has underperformed the broader industry. As per the latest share price movement, the company lost 6.1%, as compared to the 1.7% gain of the broader industry over this period. However, we expect the slew of new developments across its businesses to help it make a comeback.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1244,MDT,"Medtronic plc. (MDT  -  Free Report) has initiated a voluntary product recall of specific series of infusion sets used with all models of Medtronic insulin pumps. Shares of the company registered a 0.57% drop to close at $81.56 following this announcement.The company decided to recall the insulin pumps on the risk that these devices may potentially over-deliver insulin, exposing respective patients to threat of hypoglycemia.Medtronic has taken this decision on the basis of recent field reports from patients and root cause analysis. Per the report, vent membrane — a component of the recalled infusion sets — may be susceptible to blockage by fluid during the process of priming/fill-tubing.Medtronic plans to replace the recalled lots of infusion sets with the currently manufactured specimens at no cost. This new version has been in use since April and includes a design update of vent membrane which per the company, reduces risk of insulin over-delivery after an infusion set is changed for good.In the press release, Medtronic has not specifically mentioned about the number of defective infusion sets. However, we apprehend about a huge chunk of disputed units to be replaced, following the statement by Pamela Reese, Medtronic senior manager for communications, published on Medscape Medical News: “Because this recall applies to all versions of infusion sets that are used with Medtronic insulin pumps, to publish a list of specific lot numbers would be unwieldy. This is why we designed the [online] lot look-up tool.”This product recall is anticipated to act as a setback for Medtronic’s growing Diabetes business. Considering the large number of MiniMed infusion sets already being rolled out, we believe the recall of the flawed bunch may adversely impact the company’s diabetes arm’s revenue in the ongoing quarter.Within this particular business space, the company is currently putting an all-out effort to capitalize on distinctive innovation and strengthen foothold in the market. Based on the company’s class apart strategy to move toward fully closed loop systems, algorithms and CGM sensors to automate insulin dosing, Medtronic has been of late consistently observing a strong demand graph globally for its new diabetes technology. We apprehend, with the latest recall news, this positive momentum within the Diabetes group may get interrupted to some extent. Over the past three months, Medtronic has been constantly trading below the broader industry. The company has lost 6.9% versus the industry’s 2.5% gain during the period.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked medical stocks include Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

1245,MDT,"Most of the healthcare community has started to rejoice over Capitol Hill’s regulatory apprise in the recent past. The way the full-Obamacare repeal proposal, Republicans’ prime agenda within their healthcare roster, fell flat on its face, was intense! And things got even stagier when the “skinny"" repeal bill also failed to get passable support at the Senate.We believe the immense support to retain the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare came on the heels of the latest cost estimate released by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation’s (JCT). While the Republican bill primarily promises improved insurance coverage from the existing law with significantly lower American premiums, the cost estimate revealed something totally contrary.Per the report, if ACA is repealed, the number of uninsured people will increase by 17 million in 2018 from the present uninsured number. This apart, average premium in the nongroup market (for individual policies purchased through marketplaces or directly from insurers) will increase 25% in 2018.Troubled Times for MedTech? While twists and turns continue to unfold at the Capitol Hill, thus boosting the chances of the existing healthcare policy, the scenario within the medical device space is getting gloomier. Amid such political conundrum, market watchers should be keeping a tab on the MedTech space.The community had been quite hopeful since the change in power as Trump’s proposed policies always talked about the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax. This dreadful tax, which was commonly addressed as ‘fund of the ACA’, simply took a toll on the entire medical device industry, since its enactment in 2013. This tax was imposed on the selling price instead of net profit, amounting to a stupendous sum, wiping out almost a quarter of the profit at medical technology owners.A report by FierceMedical Device released at that time revealed that Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) made a payment of $180 million as medical device sales tax in 2014. Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report), the legacy Covidien, Smith & Nephew (SNN  -  Free Report) paid $112 million, $60 million and $25 million, respectively during that year.This was the story of the industry forerunners. The position of the smaller companies was much worse. Let alone making profits, they were in fact struggling to survive.Realizing the severe linkage effect of this tax among the MedTech bigwigs as well as small players, finally, from the beginning of 2015, the U.S. House and Senate temporarily suspended it (for two years only). Now, MedTech players find themselves facing a similar situation (from the beginning of 2018 itself), if the policy remains intact.We note that voters who are in favor of the ACA are also talking about the abolishment of the Cadillac tax (40% excise tax on high-cost healthcare plans), another dreadful fiscal revenue generating means of the Democrats.Unfortunately, while the Trump administration has been targeting a complete annulment of this Cadillac tax in the near future, it has not come up with any concrete plan to replace MedTech tax yet. The future of the MedTech fraternity thus hangs in the balance.How the MedTech Community Perceived it to Be?According to the MedTech community, suspension of MedTech tax would have directly addressed issues like lack of opportunity for research and development, innovation, pipeline development and increased investments needed to accelerate patient and provider access to innovative health care products. This would have also helped in boosting job creation and quality of patient care. Accordingly, they are going all out to shelve this tax.Going by an article by Peter Sullivan (published in The Hill), following the Congress’s failure to approve the repeal of the existing healthcare law, the trade group for medical device companies is launching a new campaign to push lawmakers to repeal ObamaCare’s tax on medical devices.What Awaits MedTech Players?Amid this political cacophony, market watchers have a bearish stance toward the space. While pondering over medical device stocks that stand to gain or lose due to the political gridlock, we find that retention or repeal of Obamacare will actually create a vicious circle within the sector.On the one hand, if Obamacare stays, MedTech profit will be hit significantly, thus posing challenges for research and development, which is quite expensive.On the other hand, while the repeal of Obamacare will lead to intensive research and development and creation of expensive cutting-edge MedTech products, there are questions over its effectiveness. This is because with higher number of uninsured, the industry is likely to witness a shrinking customer base post-enactment, indicating a decline in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices.No matter how the policy shapes up, it will prove to be beneficial as well as challenging at the same time for the players within the space. Investors meanwhile can be hopeful about the fact that the overall impact of the existing policy’s amendment or retention will not be that appalling as it apparently seems.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

Performance in the segment is affected by sluggishness in the Medication Management Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems units in the United States.Within the Diabetes Care unit, BD temporarily has paused shipments of insulin infusion sets, thanks to higher-than-anticipated rate of complaints associated with insertion during the pilot launch of the product. However, management conducted a clinical trial to gather insights and ensure that patients ultimately realize the full benefits of BD FlowSmart technology.

1248,MDT,"After months of discussions, House Republicans has finally passed the much-controversial $1.5-trillion tax-reform bill by a vote of 227 to 205 on Nov 16. The members of the Senate Finance Committee voted 14 to 12 to approve their version of the tax package on Nov 16. This paves the way for the full Senate to hold a debate on the bill once the session resumes post-Thanksgiving. However, Republicans are going to make every effort to get the bill signed by President Trump before Christmas.Overwhelmed with the House victory, Trump said before a cabinet meeting that, “We’re going to give the American people a huge tax cut for Christmas — hopefully that will be a great, big, beautiful Christmas present.”Meanwhile, investors keen on the MedTech space are closely following the developments with the hope that the final tax stature may result in the abolition of the infamous MedTech tax. Before delving deeper into that, let us take a look at the primary objectives of the bills.A Brief on the House and Senate BillsAs per an article by Thomas Kaplan and Alan Rappeport, published in The New York Times, the House bill proposes a reduction in corporate tax rates to 20% from 35%. It also shrinks the number of tax brackets from seven to four. Alongside, the bill intends to introduce an international tax system for the nation, more consistent with the tax structure of the rest of the world.It might also revoke or scale back many well-accepted deductions, including one for state and local taxes. The bill also focuses on doubling the standard deduction claimed by most tax payers. At the same time, it roots for the lifting of the child tax credit from $1,000 to $1600. Simultaneously, it calls for complete eradication of the estate tax and allowance of roughly $10,000 in property tax deduction.Meanwhile, the Senate Bill raises the child tax credit to $2,000. It also cuts the top marginal tax rate from 39.6% to 38.5%. Also, the tax cuts for individuals are supposed to expire by the end of 2025. At the same time, the plan does not propagate a complete repeal of estate taxes. In fact, it calls for the abolishment of the Individual Mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) under which majority of the people will be required to have health insurance or pay a penalty.Considering the differences in the bills, it is a challenging task for the Republicans to come to a neutral ground and decide on the final structure.Tax Reform Bills: Boon or Bane for MedTech?According to a Business Insider report, the Republican tax plan repeals an itemized deduction that applies to healthcare expenses. This will affect families with high healthcare expenditure as these expenses will not be deducted from their taxes. Hence, most people will refrain from opting for expensive healthcare or MedTech procedures.  A report by The Hill says that the Section 4303 of the Republican tax bill plan imposes a 20% excise tax on goods manufactured overseas by subsidiaries of U.S. companies. Under the U.S. tax code, Puerto Rico is considered a foreign land which implies that U.S. parent companies will have to pay excise taxes if they purchase from their subsidiaries in the island. In this regard, the FDA recently found that around 30% of Puerto Rico’s gross domestic product was driven by pharmaceuticals and medical devices in 2016. Undoubtedly, the latest tax plan has created an uproar among MedTech players who might witness a huge reduction in their turnover following the approval of the bill.While the reduction in corporate taxes will lead to extensive research and development and creation of expensive cutting-edge MedTech products, the question over its effectiveness looms large. This is because with a higher number of uninsured and lesser deductions on healthcare expenses, the industry is likely to witness a shrink in customer base post-enactment, indicating a decline in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices.No matter how the policy shapes up, it will prove beneficial to some and challenging to other players in the MedTech space. Meanwhile, it’s best for investors to stay on the sidelines until the tax situation stabilizes.Bills Mum on Medical Device Tax RepealThe community has been hopeful since Trump proposed policies that entailed the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax. This dreaded tax, which was commonly addressed as ‘fund of the ACA’, dealt a heavy blow to the medical device industry since its enactment in 2013. This tax is imposed on the selling price instead of net profit, amounting to a stupendous sum, wiping out almost a quarter of the profit for medical technology companies.Realizing the severe linkage effect of this tax among the MedTech bigwigs as well as small players, the U.S. House and Senate temporarily suspended it for two years at the beginning of 2015. Thus, the reimposition of the tax on Jan 1, 2018 is much feared by medical device stalwarts.A report by FierceMedical Device released at that time revealed that Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) made a payment of $180 million as medical device sales tax in 2014. Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report), Covidien and Smith & Nephew plc (SNN  -  Free Report) shelled out $112 million, $60 million and $25 million, respectively, in that year.  The situation for smaller companies has been much worse.In this context, ABIOMED, Inc.’s (ABMD  -  Free Report) CEO Michael Minogue quote (in an article by Cheryl Swanson published by The Motley Fool) is quite pertinent. He stated ""I don't think taxing the innovators and taxing the group of companies that provide innovation for healthcare is a smart idea, but the biggest concern I have, and what's unprecedented, is to tax companies that are not yet profitable, and in our industry where 70% of the companies are not yet profitable, this is going to have detrimental effects in their job growth, in their survival.""  Per data provided by the medical device trade group (in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller), the partial two-year repeal of the MedTech tax had resulted in around an 83% rise in research and development (R&D) investments by MedTech players. The comeback of the tax will lead to a $15-billion rise in taxes in 2018, largely discouraging R&D activities.Undoubtedly, the future of the U.S. MedTech industry depends on the Republicans’ decision on the 2.3% medical device tax.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Earnings however declined 4.5% year over year. Adjustments in the quarter primarily included the impact of restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, divestiture-related items, adverse effects of Hurricane Maria and acquisition-related items. After adjusting for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of a penny, adjusted EPS was $1.06.Without these adjustments, the company’s reported EPS was $1.48, up 85% year over year.Total RevenuesWorldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed $7.05 billion, up 3.5% on a constant exchange rate or CER basis (down 4.1% on a reported basis). The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.07 billion. Foreign currency fluctuation affected Medtronic’s second-quarter revenues by $35 million.In the quarter under review, U.S. sales (52.9% of total revenues) declined 10.1% year over year to $3.73 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.24 billion (31.8% of total revenues), reflecting a 4.7% increase at CER (up 1.4% as reported). Emerging market revenues (15.3% of total revenues) amounted to $1.08 billion, up 12.4% at CER (up 9.8% as reported).Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC Quote Segment DetailsThe company currently generates revenues from four major groups, viz. Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) and Diabetes Group.CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions (APV). MITG now includes the Surgical Innovations (SI) and the Respiratory, Gastrointestinal & Renal (RGR) divisions after the divestiture of Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis (Compression), and Nutritional Insufficiency (Enteral Feeding) businesses. RTG comprises the Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments, while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Service & Solutions (DSS) divisions.CVG revenues improved 7% at CER (up 7.4% as reported) to $2.77 billion, driven by strong, balanced growth across all three divisions.CRHF sales totaled $1.47 billion, up 4% year over year at CER (up 5% as reported). This came on the back of growth in Arrhythmia Management led by high-teens growth in atrial fibrillation Solutions and low-double digit rise in Diagnostics at CER, amplified penetration of the Micra transcatheter pacing system, and strong uptake of the TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope. This apart, strong demand for the company's suite of quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy-pacemakers (CRT-P) along with growth in Mechanical Circulatory Support drove Heart Failure division revenues.CSH revenues were up 12% at CER (13% as reported) to $854 million on the back of high-30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform. Moreover, the company's recent launch of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in the United States and Japan revived the Coronary business.APV revenues registered 4% growth at CER (up 5% as reported) to $452 million, driven by continued adoption of the Valiant Captiviathoracic stent graft systems and strength in the Heli-FX EndoAnchor System. Peripheral was driven by double-digit growth in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and drug-coated balloons. Moreover, the recently-launched Concerto 3D detachable coil system drove mid-single digit growth in endoVenous.In MITG, worldwide sales reached $1.95 billion, marking a 2% year-over-year increase at CER (down 21% on a reported basis) on mid-single digit growth in SI, which was affected by Hurricane Maria, and partially offset by low-single digit decline in RGR.In RTG, worldwide revenues of $1.86 billion were up 2% year over year at CER (same as reported) on low double-digit growth in Brain Therapies, offsetting declines in Spine, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies. Moreover, the Spine and Pain Therapies divisions along with the Pelvic Health business in the Specialty Therapies division in the United States were affected by Hurricane Maria.However, revenues at the Diabetes group declined 2% at CER (flat as reported) to $462 million.MarginsGross margin in the reported quarter expanded 160 basis points (bps) to 69.9% despite a 1.8% decline in gross profit to $4.93 billion. Adjusted operating margin contracted 40 bps year over year to 27.5% owing to a 0.2% rise in research and development expenses (to $555 million) along with a 0.8% uptick in selling, general and administrative expenses (to $2.44 billion). Other expenses in the reported quarter totaled $111 million as compared with $89 million in the year-ago quarter.GuidanceMedtronic reiterated its fiscal 2018 constant-currency revenue and EPS guidance. The company maintains full-year revenue growth projection in the range of 4-5% at CER. However, the company revised its foreign currency fluctuation estimation, which is now projected to have a positive $275-$375 million impact on fiscal results compared with $380-$480 million estimated earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues remains at $29.36 billion.Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share growth is still expected in the range of 9-10% at CER. Currency translation is expected to have an adverse impact of two cents compared with the earlier expectation of a negative effect of 3 cents to a positive impact of a penny. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at $4.7.For the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Medtronic expects currency translation to have a favorable impact of $155-$175 million on revenues. Currency translation is expected to contribute a penny to third-quarter earnings per share.Our TakeMedtronic exited the fiscal second quarter on a mixed note. While the company demonstrated improved segmental performances at CER, escalating costs and expenses continue to weigh on the bottom line. Unfavorable currency translation also acted as a dampener.On the bright side, all the major business groups contributed to solid top-line growth at CER, which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions, in addition to displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets. We are also encouraged by the company’s solid growth trend in the United States as well as healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies. Apart from product innovation, the company is focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses. Moreover, the company’s recent receipt of FDA approval and commercial launch of Azure pacemakers with BlueSync technology buoy optimism.Zacks Rank & Peer PerformancesMedtronic currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX  -  Free Report).Notably, PetMed Express sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1251,MDT,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) announced the receipt of FDA approval and commercial launch of its portfolio of Azure pacemakers with BlueSync technology. According to the company, this technology enables secure, automatic and wireless remote monitoring via the Medtronic CareLink Network. Security controls implemented and validated on BlueSync-enabled devices include access restrictions to protect integrity of device functionality and end-to-end encryption to protect patient data.The Azure XT MRI and Azure S MRI pacemakers are available in single chamber and dual chamber models. These pacemakers offer improved longevity (27% longer than its predecessor) and better ability to detect and reduce atrial fibrillation (AF). AF, one of the most common heart rhythm disorders, is irregular or rapid beating of the heart’s upper chambers. With these pacemakers, patients will probably need lesser device replacement.The Azure XT pacemaker features the Medtronic Reactive ATP (atrial-based antitachycardia pacing) algorithm, which was proved to slow the progression of AF in implanted cardiac devices patients.  The company is consistently trying to improve its Cardiac Rhythm and Heart Failure division —part of Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG). In line with this, Medtronic came up with favorable study results on Reactive ATP (atrial-based antitachycardia pacing) therapy in June. Reactive ATP) therapy slows the progression of AF in patients with implanted cardiac devices. A couple of achievements from the month of May are worth a mention. Medtronic received FDA approval for a portfolio of quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy-pacemakers (CRT-Ps) that improve therapy delivery for patients with heart failure.  Medtronic also announced favorable results from a clinical study which showed that Insertable Cardiac Monitors (ICM) detected a high incidence of AF in patients previously undiagnosed but suspected to be at high-risk for AF and stroke.According to a report by Allied Market Research, the global cardiac monitoring & cardiac rhythm management market is expected to reach a worth of $32,216 million by 2022, at a CAGR of 7.6%. Looking at the bountiful opportunities in this niche space, we believe the company’s latest development is strategic.Over the last three months, Medtronic has underperformed the broader industry. Per the latest share price movement, the company has lost 3.5%, as against the broader industry’s 3.6% gain.Estimate Revision TrendThe estimate revision trend has been favorable for the company. For the current year, six estimates moved north compared with no movement in the opposite direction over the last month. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the full year has risen to $4.70 per share from $4.64.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc.
