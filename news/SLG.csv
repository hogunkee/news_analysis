0,SLG,"Should real estate investment trusts (REITs) have a place in retirement accounts? 
"
1,SLG,"After the 2000-02 bear market, most people would've said yes. The real estate investment trust group rose about 30% in the 2000-02 bear market, while the Nasdaq careened 78% lower. 
"
2,SLG,"How's that for outperformance? Then along came the bear market of 2007-09. REITs not only got hit harder than the general market, they also stayed down longer. (The Finance-Property REIT industry group fell 76% in 25 months vs. 58% in 16 months for the S&P 500.) 
"
3,SLG,"What changed? And what does the change tell investors about using REITs in retirement accounts? 
"
4,SLG,"A Tale Of Two Bears 
"
5,SLG,"Christian Ledoux, director of equity research at South Texas Money Management in San Antonio, says the difference in REIT performance in the two bear markets was tied to the nature of the two recessions. 
"
6,SLG,"""I think the reason they did well in the '02 recession is that the recession was not a financial recession,"" Ledoux told IBD. The 2007-09 recession, however, revolved around financials and real estate. 
"
7,SLG,"REITs rely on financing, Ledoux said. And so they were slaughtered in 2007-09. 
"
8,SLG,"""In a traditional recession, the value of real estate doesn't change much,"" Ledoux said. That makes real estate a good inflation hedge, he says. 
"
9,SLG,"REITs are a nice way for individuals to get exposure to real estate, Ledoux says. It's not as if the average individual investor can buy an office building, but he or she can buy into a REIT that owns office buildings, he says. 
"
10,SLG,"REITs invest directly in real estate or mortgages, and trade on stock exchanges. They're obliged to pay out 90% of their taxable income in the form of dividends. REIT income derives primarily from rent and mortgage interest. 
"
11,SLG,"South Texas Money Management, which manages [email protected] billion in assets, has used REIT funds or ETFs in the past, but ""the preference is for individual names,"" Ledoux said. A money manager doing his own research, as Ledoux does, can outperform REIT ETFs, most of which track REIT indexes. 
"
12,SLG,"Some of Ledoux's favorite names include Kilroy Realty (KRC), which has office buildings primarily in Southern California, and S.L. Green Realty (SLG), which focuses on New York City office buildings. 
"
13,SLG,"Several factors make South Texas Money Management bullish on office buildings in central market districts. Ledoux said foreign investors in Asia are buying ""trophy buildings"" in U.S. cities. There's also a trend of companies coming back to the cities, he said. 
"
14,SLG,"""At this point in the cycle, occupancy is at historical high levels, which tends to lead to strong rent growth,"" Ledoux said. 
"
15,SLG,"Curtis Whipple, founder of C. Curtis Financial Group, says REITs ""can still be a viable part"" of a retirement account. 
"
16,SLG,"The Plymouth, Mich.-based company, which has about [email protected] million under management, considers health-related REITs the best niche in the group. 
"
17,SLG,"ObamaCare is helping the health REITs, Whipple says. 
"
18,SLG,"Whipple also sees REITs as an inflation hedge. And the author of ""Retiree Lifeline! How to Get the Government Out of Your Pocket"" says government policies have set the stage for inflation. 
"
19,SLG,"CAN SLIM Adviser 
"
20,SLG,"Chris Toro, founder of Blueprint Wealth Advisors in New York, is a certified CAN SLIM adviser. 
"
21,SLG,"Most of his clients want to do 100% CAN SLIM and take their income out of stock profits. But some clients aren't comfortable with that approach. For them, Toro fashions a 50% fixed income and 50% CAN SLIM approach. 
"
22,SLG,"The income portion is where Toro sometimes uses REITs. ""I think they are attractive, especially right now when you can't get much yield elsewhere."" 
"
23,SLG,"But he doesn't pick individual REITs. ""I prefer to do it with some sort of a basket like an ETF,"" he said. Should real estate investment trusts (REITs) have a place in retirement accounts?

24,SLG,"The 83-year-old Art Deco-style Empire State Building is an iconic part of Manhattan's skyline, a major tourist attraction immortalized in films and, for a fledgling New York-based public real estate investment trust, the centerpiece of a growing commercial-property portfolio that generates millions of dollars in revenue. More than 200 tenants occupy 83% of the storied skyscraper's 2.8 million square feet…
"
25,SLG,"Hurricane Sandy property damage could reach $20 billion, much of it uninsured. But early estimates suggest REITs won't be hard hit, because of what they own and where — often big buildings in city centers.
"
26,SLG,"The 1,000-mile-wide superstorm that barreled up the Eastern Seaboard this week demolished many homes near the Jersey Shore and other coastal areas around New York and nearby states. Only about half of that expected $20 billion in property damage is insured, says IHS Global Insight.
"
27,SLG,"About 9,000 properties owned by real estate investment trusts were in the path of Sandy, according to real estate investment trust market tracker SNL Real Estate.
"
28,SLG,"Jason Lail, real estate manager there, told IBD that although there's just a trickle of data available so far, ""it looks like Sandy's impact was relatively tame"" for REITS.
"
29,SLG,"The hurricane — really termed an extratropical storm once north of the tropics — devastated housing in some areas, and it wasn't only the wind and water. Sandy sparked fires that leveled more than 100 homes in Breezy Point, Queens, and burned three mansions in Old Greenwich, Conn.
"
30,SLG,"Meanwhile, a 13-foot storm surge swept a wall of water through Lower Manhattan, flooding the World Trade Center construction site and many underground structures in the Financial District.
"
31,SLG,"Yet SL Green (SLG), New York City's biggest office landlord with 74 properties in the storm's path, is reporting minimal damage, Lail said. One property had flooding and four others were without power.

33,SLG,"REITs In Storm's Path
"
34,SLG,"Among other REITs, Mack-Cali Realty (CLI) has 192 properties in the disaster area. Several REITs have their entire portfolios in the storm damage region, including Washington Real Estate Investment Trust (WRE) with 71 properties. Mack-Cali owns office and multifamily properties, while Washington owns office, medical office, retail and multifamily properties, as well as land for development.
"
35,SLG,"SL Green and Mack-Cali Realty shares closed up more than 1% Thursday in the stock market. Smaller Washington Real Estate slid slightly. Shares of all three had slumped, with the S&P 500 index, during the latter half of October.
"
36,SLG,"Although damage to New York commercial real estate owned by REITs may have been less than expected, the storm is expected to rank among the worst in its massive damage to homes and other structures, more than some anticipated.
"
37,SLG,"Tropical cyclones, including hurricanes, caused $5.5 billion in insured losses nationwide last year, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Hurricane Irene accounted for most of that.
"
38,SLG,"""Three of the costliest hurricanes to hit the U.S., based on insured property losses, caused damage in New York: Hurricane Ivan and Hurricane Frances, both in 2004, and Hurricane Irene in 2011,"" the III noted in a recent report.

176,SLG,"Retail REIT Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report) recently announced a hike in its common stock monthly cash dividend, giving shareholders another reason to rejoice. This marks the company’s 94th dividend increase since its NYSE listing in 1994. The company will now pay 21.25 cents per share against 21.20 cents paid earlier.Realty Income will pay the increased dividend on Jan 12, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Jan 2, 2018. The latest dividend rate depicts an annualized amount of $2.55 per share versus the prior rate of $2.544 per share.Realty Income remains committed to increasing shareholders’ wealth. The company enjoys a trademark on the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company” and the January 2018 dividend payment not only marks its 570 consecutive monthly dividend payouts throughout its 48-year operating history, but also 81 consecutive quarterly increases.In fact, the company has generated a compound average annual dividend growth of around 4.6% since its listing on the NYSE. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to that of the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.Realty Income’s portfolio comprised 5,062 properties, situated in 49 states and Puerto Rico as of Sep 30, 2017, containing more than 86.4 million leasable square feet of space. These properties are leased to 251 different commercial tenants, belonging to 47 separate industries. The company leases its properties under long-term, net lease agreements.Notably, shrinking footfall at malls amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers has emerged as a pressing concern, of late, for most retail REITs. However, not all are equally facing the brunt, with some of these companies managing to book gains even in the tepid scenario, thanks to the business models.In fact, this freestanding retail REIT — Realty Income — derives more than 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service, non-discretionary and low-price retail business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing.In addition to the above, Realty Income’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisition have helped the company maintain high occupancy levels consistently. In fact, since 1996, the company’s occupancy level has never been below 96%. Additionally, its same-store rent growth displayed limited operational volatility.The company also continues to maintain a conservative capital structure. It has modest leverage, robust liquidity, and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. In addition, it has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.However, Realty Income’s substantial exposure to single-tenant assets raises its risks associated with tenant default. Further, generation of notable rental revenues from assets leased to drug stores and rate hike add to its woes.Shares of Realty Income have underperformed the industry it belongs to, in a month’s time. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have descended 2.1%, while the industry recorded growth of 0.3% during this time frame. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors. Some other REITs which announced dividend hikes recently include Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE  -  Free Report), SL Green Realty (SLG  -  Free Report) and Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA  -  Free Report).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

177,SLG,"Ushering in good news for shareholders, data-center REIT CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report) announced a hike of 8.9% in its quarterly cash dividend. The company will now pay a dividend of 98 cents per share for the fourth quarter, up from 90 cents paid in the prior quarter.It also marks a 22.5% increase from the dividend rate set in December 2016. The raised dividend will be paid on Jan 16, 2018, to shareholders of record as on Dec 29, 2017.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $3.92 a share, resulting in a yield of about 3.4%, considering CoreSite’s closing price of $115.08 on Dec 7. Moreover, the company’s dividend per share has witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% since 2011 through 2017. This reflects its continued efforts to boost shareholders’ wealth.Also, per the company’s CFO, Jeff Finnin, the company is “targeting the amount and timing” of its dividend hikes “to ensure dividend growth is closely aligned with performance and cash flow generation.”CoreSite has robust fundamentals to back dividend hikes. Per management, this data-center REIT has been chosen by more than 1,200 of the world’s leading enterprises, network operators, cloud providers, and supporting service providers for connecting, protecting and optimizing the firms’ performance-sensitive data, applications and computing workloads.In fact, the company has been a decent performer, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four trailing quarters on funds from operations (FFO) per share basis, with an average positive surprise of 3.91%. CoreSite’s ROE is 15.35%, higher than the industry’s ROE of 5.78%.Also, this data-center REIT churns cash flow per share of $4.96 as compared to the industry average of $2.27. The company has witnessed decent cash flow growth in the past. Further, CoreSite has current cash flow growth of 28.23% against the industry average of 15.88%. This will likely help the company sustain its dividend payout to equity investors.  In addition, fundamentals of the data-center real estate market remains robust. Growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data is not only helping tech companies, but also driving demand for data-center REITs. As such, demand is outpacing supply in top-tier data-center markets, and these are absorbing new construction at a faster pace despite enjoying high occupancy. Also, data-center REITs pulled in their capital and scored well on the return book in the first 11 months of 2017, registering total returns of 30.9%.However, its valuation looks stretched when compared with the industry.

179,SLG,"The Q3 earnings season has just begun and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is already buzzing with activity. Notably, on Oct 18, Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report), SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG  -  Free Report) and Brandywine Realty Trust (BDN  -  Free Report) are scheduled to release their quarterly results.Admittedly, the Federal Open Market Committee meeting has affected the price performance of REITs in the quarter. However, with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery, a number of asset categories displayed strength in third-quarter 2017.Per a recent study from CBRE Group Inc. , the U.S. office vacancy rate contracted 10 basis points (bps) in the third quarter amid growth in office-using jobs. In most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy dropped, taking the national office-vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.The industrial asset category also grabbed attention on the back of robust demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market, and a healthy manufacturing environment. Amid an e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies opting for consolidation of operations to improve supply-chain efficiencies, demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks has been increasing.Nevertheless, dwindling mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online purchases have kept retail REITs on tenterhooks.Consolidation in the wireless industry is expected to bring down demand for cell-tower deployments. Further, evolution of new technologies may reduce demand for site leases. These factors will likely impact the wireless communication tower operators.Therefore, surprises might be in store for some REITs, while others may disappoint this earnings season. Let’s have a look at what’s in store for these three REITs set to release third-quarter figures:Houston-based Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) is a leading wireless communication tower operator in the United States. Crown Castle’s ongoing operation in the consolidated wireless industry has reduced demand for cell-tower deployment. This, in turn, might dent the company’s top line considerably. Also, the latest technologies have reduced demand for site leases.In the last reported quarter, Crown Castle noted that it projects third-quarter site-rental revenues in the range of $888-$893 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $891 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net revenues from network services and other segment is currently pegged at 176 million. (Read more: Will Crown Castle Disappoint Investors in Q3 Earnings?)The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -3.52%.

This is depicted in the graph below: Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Crown Castle International Corporation QuoteSL Green Realty Corp. (SLG  -  Free Report) has been boosting its capacity to offer office space through an opportunistic investment policy. This bodes well for the company amid an improving economy and job-market environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter property net operating income (NOI) and net rental revenues are currently pegged at $183 million and $281 million, respectively, nearly in line with the previous quarter’s figures.  Nonetheless, the company has been long troubled on the retail front, with an increasing number of retailers jumping on the dot-com bandwagon. This will likely create pressure on SL Green’s top-line performance. Of late, many retailers have been filing for bankruptcy and opting for store closures, as mall traffic has been shrinking owing to soaring online purchases. Although the company is aggressively taking initiatives to lure consumers, it may take a while for these efforts to reflect in its operating results. (Read more: Will Rise in Supply Impact SL Green's Q3 Earnings?)SL Green currently has a Zacks Rank of 4 and an Earnings ESP of -1.34%.

180,SLG,"SL Green Realty (SLG  -  Free Report) is revamping its portfolio by disposing of non-core assets and acquiring interests in other properties.The company announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell the fee interest at 635 Madison Avenue for a gross consideration of $151 million. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is likely to be completed by third-quarter 2018. SL Green bought fee interest in this property for $145 million in 2014.Also, SL Green announced that it had successfully bid on the leasehold interest at 2 Herald Square, which was in the process of foreclosing on. The asset, which spans across 369,000 square feet, is conveniently located at the juncture of the Sixth Avenue, Broadway and the 34th Street. Further, the foot traffic along the corridor of 34th Street surpasses 100 million people per annum.Moreover, following the completion of this office and retail asset acquisition, SL Green plans to form a joint venture with an institutional investor based in Israel. The property boasts tenants like WeWork that is largely occupied by Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Victoria’s Secret and Mercy College.Shrinking its ownership in non-core assets gives SL Green an opportunity to channelize the proceeds in high-growth properties. The company is New York City's largest commercial landlord, which primarily acquires, manages, develops and leases commercial office properties in the New York Metropolitan area, especially mid-town Manhattan.However, increased supply in the company’s markets remains a concern. Also, SL Green faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties and other commercial real estates. This restricts its ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors.Encouragingly, in the past three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has outperformed the industry. While the company’s shares have gained 9.2%, the industry has recorded 5.1% rise. Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the same space include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT  -  Free Report) and Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.

181,SLG,"SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 18, after the market closes.Last quarter, this office real estate investment trust (REIT) reported better-than-expected funds from operations (FFO) per share.Over the trailing four quarters, the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions, met in another and missed in the other, with an average beat of around 4.29%. The graph below depicts this surprise history. SL Green Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise SL Green Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | SL Green Realty Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe company has been boosting its capacity to offer office space through an opportunistic investment policy. This bodes well for SL Green amid an improving economy and job-market environment.In addition, per a recent study from CBRE Group Inc. , the U.S. office vacancy rate contracted 10 basis points (bps) in the to-be-reported quarter amid growth in office-using jobs. In most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy declined, taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.However, new supply in the Manhattan area could negate the positive effect of decreasing vacancy rates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter property net operating income (NOI) and net rental revenues are currently pegged at $183 million and $281 million, nearly in line with the previous quarter reported figures.  Also, over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the third quarter edged down 0.6% to $1.57, reflecting lack of any solid catalyst for being overtly positive on the stock. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that SL Green will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for SL Green is -1.34%.Zacks Rank: SL Green’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP.

182,SLG,"SL Green Realty Corp.’s (SLG  -  Free Report) efforts to make opportunistic investments in assets are in sync with the company’s strategy to enhance its overall portfolio and drive long-term growth. However, softness in the retail and office real estate markets is affecting its profit margins.Although the company has been witnessing subpar demand for its office space, we anticipate a healthy increase in demand in the coming months due to economic improvement and recovery in the job market. This is because, corporate sectors seek expansion with economic recovery and consequently rent more space to accommodate the increased workforce.Moreover, SL Green remains focused on strengthening its balance sheet and drive net asset value growth. It recently announced the offering and pricing of senior unsecured notes. Through this offering, the company is anticipated to raise around $495.25 million.In addition, the company’s debt/equity ratio of 0.34, which is lower than the industry’s average of 0.84, enables it to enjoy financial flexibility and easy accessibility to debt markets.However, the dull retail real estate environment has been adversely affecting SL Green’s leasing activities. Declining mall traffic amid growth in e-commerce has forced retailers to opt for store closures. This is impacting demand for retail space, limiting landlords’ pricing power and resulting in lesser absorption.Also, the company faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties and other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from its tenants.This, along with growth in supply of office space in the market, curtails its ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents.Amid these concerns, shares of SL Green have declined 2.9% year to date, underperforming 4.1% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter funds from operations (FFO) per share has been revised downward to $1.59 in a month’s time.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the real estate investment trust (REIT) space include Seritage Growth Properties , Sabra Healthcare REIT, Inc.

183,SLG,"SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P., SL Green Realty Corp.’s (SLG  -  Free Report) operating partnership, has announced the pricing of senior notes valued at $500 million.The offering comprises 3.250% senior unsecured obligations of the operating partnership and will mature in 2022. It will be unconditionally and fully guaranteed by the company and wholly owned subsidiary of SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P. — Reckson Operating Partnership, L.P.The company anticipates raising nearly $495.25 million from this offering. This amount is estimated after making adjustments for underwriting discount and estimated fees and expenses. The offering is anticipated to close on Oct 5, after complying with the customary closing conditions.The operating partnership plans to utilize the net proceeds of this offering to initially settle a 3% Exchangeable Senior Notes borrowing set to mature in 2017. Thereafter, the remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include shrinking debt obligations undertaken by the operating partnership.We believe the senior notes offering will bring down the company’s cost of capital, which will, in turn, strengthen the balance sheet and fuel growth. A balanced capital structure, along with a robust operating platform, will likely enable it to execute strategic priorities and drive growth in net asset value.Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operation (FFO) per share for full-year 2017 has been revised upward to $6.55 in a month’s time.However, due to the unfavorable environment in the office and retail sector, shares of this real estate investment trust (REIT) have underperformed the industry it belongs to, year to date.

186,SLG,"New York-based office REIT SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG  -  Free Report), in partnership with private investment manager RXR Realty, recently signed a deal to acquire a combined stake of 48.7% in New York REIT’s  Worldwide Plaza. The transaction values the asset at $1.725 billion. It is likely to be completed in fourth-quarter 2017.Located in midtown Manhattan, this trophy asset comprises a 49-story, 1.8 million-square-foot Class A office tower, along with a 252,000 retail building with a parking garage and a large open-air plaza. Also, this prominent complex is fully leased.The above discussed acquisition is a strategic fit for SL Green, given that it helps in expansion on Manhattan's West Side and adds a trophy asset which is completely leased to institutional tenants. In fact, the office building houses the North American headquarters for Nomura Holdings, Inc., and Cravath Swaine and Moore LLP.Additionally, its tenant roster includes names of high-quality office tenants, including WebMD, WNet.org and CBS Broadcasting. On the other hand, the retail part has a five-stage off-Broadway theater, a fitness gym, as well as a 475-space parking garage.Furthermore, with an excellent location — at the juncture of Manhattan's Columbus Circle and Times Square submarkets — this property enjoys suitable access to transit. Thus, along with top-tier tenants, it is likely to enjoy steady cash flows from tenants over time.SL Green’s high-quality office properties, diverse tenant base, opportunistic investments and solid balance-sheet strength are likely to help the company ride the growth curve. Furthermore, its leasing activity is likely to remain decent amid an improving economy and job market scenario. However, the company faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties and other commercial real estate. Also, rate hike add to its woes.SL Green currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, over the past three months, shares of SL Green have descended 7.4%, underperforming 0.5% loss incurred by the industry.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the REIT space include PS Business Parks, Inc.

187,SLG,"We are in the first full week of the Q1 reporting cycle, and only a handful of the S&P 500 players have released their earnings numbers, so far. Notably, banking giants kicked off the season on an impressive note, courtesy improved earnings and revenues.Per our latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for five of the 98 Finance Sector companies on the S&P 500 (accounting 23.7% of the total market cap), that have reported earnings so far, have climbed 20.4% year over year on 6.9% higher revenues.Further, for the first quarter, as a whole, earnings of the finance sector, which includes REITs too, are expected to be up 22.7% year over year on 4.7% higher revenues.While the banking sector is already bustling with activity, we have a handful of REITs reporting earnings this week. Among these are Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG  -  Free Report) which are scheduled to release results on Apr 18, after the market closes.     Admittedly, rate hike and cautious approach of investors have affected returns from this industry, so far, this year. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining REITs’ performance, not all players in the space are equally poised to excel or fall behind this season.Therefore, let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ first-quarter results.Crown Castle International Corp.This Houston-based REIT, engaged in the operation of wireless communication towers in the United States, is well poised to benefit from the high level of investment activity of its key customers. The company’s portfolio of assets is expected to witness decent demand in the quarter to be reported. Also, leasing activity across towers, small cells and fiber solutions is likely to remain strong.Moreover, the company’s continued efforts in repositioning itself from being a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity) look impressive. In 2017, it fortified its portfolio with the acquisitions of FiberNet, Wilcon and Lightower that operate in top U.S. markets. These markets have been experiencing high demand for network investment from the company’s customers.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s site rental revenues for towers is currently pegged at $747 million for the first quarter, reflecting a projected increase of 0.8% sequentially. Site rental revenues for fiber are projected at $392 million, denoting an estimated jump of 26.5%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is $1.31 billion, indicating year-over-year projected growth of 29.0%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations (FFO) per share for the quarter is pegged at $1.34, reflecting a rise of around 8.1%.However, Crown Castle competes in a highly competitive wireless tower operator industry, with incumbents like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). In addition, frequent changes in demand for infrastructure support and network services might flare up volatility for Crown Castle’s revenues.Our proven model cannot conclusively predict if Crown Castle will likely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time as it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.(Read more: Crown Castle to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?)Over the trailing four quarters, Crown Castle delivered an average positive surprise of 5.67% in terms of FFO per share.

In addition, its leasing activity is expected to remain decent amid improving economy and job market environment.Nonetheless, the company faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties, and other commercial real estate which curbs its pricing power. Furthermore, elevated supply of office space has been adding to its woes.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter net rental revenues is currently pegged at $262 million, reflecting a 1.1% decline from the previous-quarter figure. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for investment income is projected at $48.4 million, indicating 7.2% rise sequentially.Finally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $268.7 million, 4.5% lower than the prior-year quarter.  The FFO per share is projected at $1.65, reflecting a 5.1% improvement from the year-earlier quarter.In addition to the above, our quantitative model predicts that the chances of a positive surprise for SL Green are low.

188,SLG,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) and SL Green Realty Corporation (SLG  -  Free Report) recently closed a loan refinancing worth $1.2 billion for the Manhattan-based office building — 280 Park Avenue. Both companies hold a joint venture spanning 1,250,000 square feet at this property.The interest-only loan is slated to mature in September 2024, as extended, and carries a rate of LIBOR plus 1.73%. It will replace a previous LIBOR plus 2% loan of $900 million, which was slated to mature in May 2023.The aforementioned joint venture has strategically improved the Manhattan-based building with a renovation plan worth $150 million. The plan was focused on the revitalization of the façade and the interior of the property. It has been upgraded with a premium lobby, new thin-line perimeter induction units, bathrooms and elevator cabs, electrical distribution and an advance security system.  Moreover, the plaza adjacent to this property has been redesigned. Improvements have been made to make the building more sustainable. Such transformative redevelopments helped enhance its profile and achieve 97% occupancy. Following the redevelopment work, Vornado closed the above discussed loan refinancing.Recently, the famous Four Season restaurant became a tenant at this property. Other significant tenants on its roster include Fiduciary Trust, Promontory Financial Group, Teneo Holdings, Viking Global and Starbucks.Vornado is a New York-based real estate investment trust (REIT), which mainly owns office and retail properties. Its portfolio is concentrated in the New York City.The company faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties, and other commercial real estate. In addition, persistent office space efficiency trends continue to curb any robust demand. Hence, Vornado’s strategy to attract and retain tenants at favorable rents through extensive redevelopment programs looks encouraging for its long-term profitability.   Vornado currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Over the past 30 days, the company’s full-year 2017 funds from operations (FFO) per share estimate inched up 0.7% to $4.20, while the third-quarter 2017 FFO estimate remained unchanged at 88 cents.Furthermore, its shares have lost 29.1% year to date, underperforming 4.6% growth recorded by its industry.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the REIT space include Getty Realty Corporation (GTY  -  Free Report), Seritage Growth Properties  and Communications Sales & Leasing, Inc.

193,SLG,"SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 18, after the market closes. While funds from operations (FFO) per share will likely increase on a year-over-year basis, revenues are expected to decline.Last quarter, this real estate investment trust (REIT) met its FFO estimates. The office landlord experienced an increase in occupancy rate in its Manhattan portfolio. However, the company’s Q4 results reflected an overall fall in revenues.Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion, missed in another and met in the remaining two. The company delivered an average positive surprise of around 1.2% during this period. The graph below depicts this surprise history:SL Green Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise SL Green Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | SL Green Realty Corporation QuoteShares of SL Green have declined 7.5% over the past six months compared with the industry’s descend of 11.1%.Factors That Might Influence Q1 ResultsThe company has been enhancing its capacity to offer office space through an opportunistic investment policy. This bodes well for SL Green amid an improving economy and job-market environment.Nonetheless, the company faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties, and other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from its tenants. This restricts its ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors. Further, elevated supply of office space is adding to its woes.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter property net rental revenues is currently pegged at $262 million, reflecting a decline of 1.3% from the previous-quarter figure.

The company’s high-quality office properties in proximity to midtown Manhattan’s key commuter stations and diverse tenant base are likely to help the company ride the growth curve. Moreover, its leasing activity is likely to remain decent amid an improving economy and job market environment.In addition, per a recent report from CBRE Group Inc.  in second-quarter 2017, the U.S. office vacancy rate remained steady at 13% amid a balanced demand supply environment. In fact, in around half of the U.S. office markets, vacancy recorded a decline and the national office vacancy rate is hovering close to its post-recession low.Also, SL Green made concerted efforts to diversify and tap opportunities in New York City’s premium retail locations, with its retail investments complementing the core office and structured finance businesses. Along with a solid balance sheet, such efforts are anticipated to drive the company’s top- and bottom-line growth in the quarter to be reported.However, shares of SL Green declined 5.7% over the past three months compared with the Zacks categorized REIT and Equity Trust – Other industry’s descend of 1.8%.

(PLD  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on Apr 17, before the opening bell.Last quarter, this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) reported a better-than-expected result in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. Net effective rent change improved in the quarter, while period-end occupancy remained at a record high.Over the preceding four quarters, Prologis surpassed the FFO per share estimates in three occasions and met in the other.

The figure denotes a projected year-over-year increase of 17.5%.Nevertheless, recovery in the industrial market has continued for long. Also, there is intense competition in the market.

196,SLG,"Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results, after the closing bell on Apr 18.For this Houston-based REIT, which is engaged in operation of wireless communication towers in the United States, the bottom line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the previous quarter. Results were backed by 28.6% year-over year increase in site rental revenues that included organic growth, as well as contributions from acquisitions and other items.Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 5.67% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. This is depicted in the graph below:Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Crown Castle International Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCrown Castle is well poised to benefit from the high level of investment activity of its key customers. The company’s portfolio of assets is expected to witness decent demand in the quarter to be reported and leasing activity across towers, small cells and fiber solutions is likely to remain strong.The company’s continued efforts in repositioning itself from being a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity) look impressive. In 2017, the company fortified its portfolio with the acquisitions of FiberNet, Wilcon and Lightower that operate in top U.S. markets. These markets have been experiencing high demand for network investment by the company’s customers.For the first quarter of 2018, Crown Castle expects Site Rental revenues of $1,132-$1,142 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $1,138 million, denoting a projected increase of 8.3%, sequentially.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s site rental revenues for towers is currently pegged at $747 million for the first quarter, reflecting a projected increase of 0.8% sequentially. Site rental revenues for fiber are projected at $392 million, denoting an estimated surge of 26.5%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is $1.31 billion, indicating year-over-year projected growth of 29.0%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter is pegged at $1.34, reflecting a rise of around 8.1%.In addition to the above, the deployment of 5G is expected to drive growth on both the company’s tower and small-cell assets. This is because the wireless carriers look to expand and enhance their networks to provide the coverage, capacity and speed needed to support mobile video, the Internet of Things (IoT), and fixed wireless broadband.Remarkably, the IoT space is touted as the next big thing in the evolution of technology and higher investment by the wireless carriers. It is anticipated to boost the company’s revenues.However, Crown Castle competes in a highly competitive wireless tower operator industry, with incumbents like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). Consolidation in the wireless industry might reduce demand for cell-tower deployments and therefore is expected to impact Crown Castle’s top-line performance.Furthermore, customer concentration is very high for Crown Castle. Loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will significantly affect the company’s revenues. Evolution of new technologies might bring down the demand for site leases as well. Developments of satellite-delivered radio and video services will likely weigh on the need for tower-based broadcast transmission. In addition, frequent changes in demand for infrastructure support and network services will tend to increase volatility in Crown Castle’s revenues.Prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there was lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at $1.34 over the past 30 days.Crown Castle’s shares have inched up 0.3%, against the industry’s loss of 4.5% in the past three months.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Crown Castle is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Crown Castle has an Earnings ESP of +0.00%.

200,SLG,"SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth quarter and 2017 results on Wednesday, Jan 24, after the market closes. While funds from operations (FFO) per share will likely increase on a year-over-year basis, revenues are expected to decline.Last quarter, this real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a negative surprise of 5.1%. The company’s Q3 results reflect a decline in rental revenues and steep fall in investment income. Also, the office landlord exited the quarter with lower liquidity.Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion, met in another and missed in the remaining two. The company delivered an average positive surprise of around 1% over this period. The graph below depicts this surprise history:SL Green Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise SL Green Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | SL Green Realty Corporation QuoteShares of SL Green declined 7.9% over the past six months compared with the industry’s descend of 3.9%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that SL Green is likely to beat estimates this time around because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) to beat estimates, and SL Green has the right mix.(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for SL Green is +0.34%.Zacks Rank: SL Green’s Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors That Might Influence Q4 ResultsThe company has been boosting its capacity to offer office space through an opportunistic investment policy. This bodes well for SL Green amid an improving economy and job-market environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for investment income is projected to be $48.7 million, indicating 1.7% growth sequentially.In addition, per a recent study from CBRE Group, the U.S. office vacancy rate increased 10 basis points (bps) in the to-be-reported quarter.

201,SLG,"Ushering in good news for CubeSmart’s (CUBE  -  Free Report) shareholders, Moody's Investors Service recently affirmed the company’s senior unsecured rating at Baa2, with a stable outlook.Per the rating agency, the move is backed by CubeSmart’s premium portfolio of self-storage properties that are concentrated in markets enjoying comparatively lower levels of supply than the national average on a historic basis. Moreover, the rating agency acknowledged the conservative balance sheet of the company that is aided by a considerable unencumbered asset pool. However, the highly competitive and management intensive sector, geographic concentration risks and increasing supply, which might affect the overall sector, remain challenges.The rating agency expects the company to adhere to conservative capital structure, even while pursuing growth, deliver steady performance and maintain decent financial flexibility. This is well reflected in the stable rating outlook.Notably, the latest rating affirmation reinstalls the company’s creditworthiness in the market and is likely to boost investors’ confidence in the stock.

202,SLG,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, office REIT Boston Properties (BXP  -  Free Report) announced a 6.7% hike in the company's quarterly cash dividend rate to 80 cents per share from 75 cents paid earlier. It will pay the raised dividend for the fourth quarter on Jan 30, 2018, to shareholders on record as of Dec 29, 2017.Reflecting positive sentiments of investors, the shares inched up 1.2% during Monday’s regular trading session to $130.96.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $3.20 per share, up from the prior annual rate of $3.00 per share, leading to an annualized yield of 2.4%, considering Boston Properties' closing price on Dec 18.Solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors and Boston Properties remains committed toward boosting shareholders’ wealth. The company has registered a five-year annual dividend growth rate of 4.87%. Prior to this dividend hike, in December 2016, Boston Properties had announced a 15.4% hike in its quarterly dividend rate.Boston Properties also has solid fundamentals to back dividend hikes. The company concentrates on a few select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets that usually fare better in an uncertain economy. Moreover, growth in demand for office space continues to be fueled by technology and life science businesses.The company has achieved an annual compounded revenue growth rate of 8.17% over the last five years. Given the company’s improving core operations, we anticipate this trend to continue, in the near future. In addition, the company is likely to experience solid contribution in 2018 from its non-same-property portfolio, mainly driven by development deliveries.Also, with economic improvement and recovery in the job market, we expect healthy growth in demand for office spaces. This is because, as the economy revives, business grows and therefore, corporate sectors seek expansion, renting more space to accommodate the increased workforce.Additionally, the company remains focused on maintaining strong balance sheet with conservative leverage position. It enjoys substantial liquidity of around $2.5 billion and solid access to debt markets. Also, reflecting optimal utilization of equity, the company’s ROE is 6.43%, higher than the industry average of 5.78%.However, there is growth in supply of office space in the market and this remains a concern because higher supply usually leads to lesser absorption and also curtails the landlord’s capability to demand more rents. There is also a trend of increased concessions in some of the markets.Shares of Boston Properties have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months.

The dividend will be paid on Jan 15, 2018, to stockholders of record on Dec 29, 2017.Also, Piedmont Office Realty Trust’s board of directors recently announced a special cash dividend of 50 cents per common share, giving investors another reason to rejoice. The special dividend distribution was primarily due to taxable gains that the company realized on asset dispositions of around $396 million in 2017. This dividend will be paid on Jan 9, 2018, to shareholders of record on Dec 26, 2017.Usually, special dividends are paid by REITs on capital gains from the sale of assets to avoid paying taxes. Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest attraction for REIT investors as the U.S. law requires these companies to distribute 90% of the annual taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders.The other REIT — Weingarten Realty Investors — announced a special cash dividend of 75 cents per share, which is payable on Dec 29, 2017, to shareholders of record as of Dec 26, 2017.

205,SLG,"Agree Realty Corporation’s (ADC  -  Free Report) board of directors has approved a 3% sequential hike in quarterly dividends for common stock. The revised dividend now comes in at 52 cents per share versus the previous figure of 50.5 cents. The new dividend will be paid on Jan 3, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Dec 20, 2017.The cash dividend, which reflects year-over-year increase of 5.1%, is the company’s 95th consecutive dividend distribution. Agree Realty has achieved a five-year total increase of 30% in dividends since 2012. This highlights the company’s continued efforts to boost shareholders’ wealth.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $2.08 a share, resulting in an annualized yield of about 4.26%, considering Agree Realty’s closing price of $48.79 on Dec 5.The company’s leverage picture looks encouraging. Its debt/equity ratio of 0.59 compares favorably with 1.25 for its industry. Also, this retail real estate investment trust (REIT) churns cash flow per share of $2.65 as compared to the industry average of $2.04. The company has witnessed robust cash flow growth in the past. Furthermore, Agree Realty’s current cash flow growth is significantly higher than the industry average. Secure cash flow will help the company sustain its dividend payout in the future.However, sub-optimal utilization of equity has resulted in a return on equity (ROE) of 7.27%, while the industry delivered 7.44%. Also, its valuation looks stretched when compared with the industry. Agree Realty currently has a trailing 12-month price-to-FFO ratio of 18.4, which compares unfavorably with 17.1 witnessed by the industry. This limits the stock’s upside potential. Year to date, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have underperformed the industry. During the period, shares of Agree Realty have gained 6%, while the industry recorded growth of 10.2%.Admittedly, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors.

Notably, SL Green’s Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured notes have been bumped by a notch to “BBB” from “BBB-.”The rating agency also maintained its stable outlook.The rating agency cited the company’s adherence to tighter financial policies and efforts to attain a balanced capital structure by targeting leverage below 7.0x. The upgrade also reflects the shift in the company’s borrowing strategy to an investment-grade, unsecured borrowing strategy.Further, the company’s recent refinancing activity to increase its unsecured corporate credit capacity by $217 million to $3 billion and stretch the maturities of debts highlights its favorable access to bond markets. (Read more: SL Green Refinances Loan to Upsize Credit Facility)The rating acknowledges SL Green’s premium New York office portfolio that enjoys decent demand for office space and has been able to deliver steady performance throughout the challenging real estate cycles. Additionally, the company’s office portfolio enjoys long-term leases to well capitalized tenants. Notably, in third-quarter 2017, the mark-to-market on signed Manhattan office leases was 4% higher than the previous fully-escalated rents on the same spaces.The rating agency also acknowledged SL Green’s portfolio-repositioning efforts. The company resorts to non-core assets disposition, and reinvests the proceeds in strategic acquisitions and development efforts to reposition its portfolio. Such moves helped reap decent net operating income over the past years, according to Fitch Ratings. The company also enjoys a balanced lease maturity and a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.Though geographic concentration and exposure to capital-intensive office assets serve as negative attributes, the high face rents stemming from the strong Manhattan portfolio would alleviate this risk.Notably, this rating upgrade enhances the company’s creditworthiness in the market and is likely to boost investors’ confidence in the stock. In fact, such moves provide companies an opportunity to enjoy reduced costs on debts and better access to capital.The company’s shares have underperformed its industry, year to date.

210,SLG,"SL Green Realty (SLG  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into a contract with Allianz Real Estate, pursuant to which the commercial property owner will sell 43% stake in 1515 Broadway to the real estate investment division of German-based company Allianz Group.The above-mentioned deal values the Class-A Times Square office property at $1.95 billion and is expected to generate $416 million in cash proceeds for SL Green. Notably, 70% of the transaction will likely close on Nov 30, 2017, while the balance is slated to close in the first quarter of 2018.Per SL Green’s management, the agreement reflects the confidence of foreign investors in New York City’s office realties. Per Allianz Real Estate, this joint venture is a strategic move as well as consistent with the company’s plan of expanding its footprint in the city. Moreover, this trophy asset is anticipated to add significant value to Allianz’s portfolio in the future.Spanning 1.86 million square feet of space, the 57-storeyed building is well placed between the 44th and 45th street of New York's Times Square. This enables the property to boast an enviable tenant roster and enjoy high leasing activity. The building is currently 98% leased to well-known tenants such as Skechers, Milano, Line Friends as well as the Minskoff Theater, which hosts the top grossing show — The Lion King — in Broadway.SL Green initially owned interest in the building through a joint venture in 2002 after which it gained full ownership in 2011. The company then redeveloped the property in 2012 by adding new elevators, signage and a lobby, as well as repositioning the retail spaces. This enabled the company to sign a lease renewal with Viacom. Per a long-term lease renewal, the media giant will occupy the building's office space through 2031.Increasing demand associated with job growth is helping reverse the persistent office-space efficiency trends which have continued to limit robust growth in the office sector fundamentals. Further, with corporate sectors renting more space to accommodate the increased workforce, we anticipate a healthy revival in office leasing activities. The aforementioned joint venture further reaffirms strength of the retail and office real estate market in the Times Square locality.Shares of SL Green have underperformed the industry it belongs to, year to date.
