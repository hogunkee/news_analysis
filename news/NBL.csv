2,NBL,"Exxon stock took a dive then rebounded following a mixed first-quarter earnings report from Exxon Mobil (XOM) on Friday.

As oil prices rise, they are looking now at probable earnings windfalls.A number of those shale oil stocks, including Continental Resources (CLR) and WildHorse Resource Development (WRD), continue to pound out news highs.Among the shale oil companies set to report earnings in the coming week are EOG Resources (EOG), Noble Energy (NBL), Concho Resources (CXO), Parsley Energy (PE), Newfield Exploration (NFX) and Matador Resources (MTDR).

Based on the success of these so-called Version 3.0+ completions, the company is considering adding more of them in the second half of the year.Dove said Pioneer will have a better handle ""mid-year"" on how much the spending increase will be, but the company still plans to spend within its forecast cash flow of $3.2 billion.Shares of Marathon Oil jumped 6.3% to 19.45 on the stock market today, breaking out of a cup with handle base with an 18.76 entry point.

By late Q1, the amount of money raised from U.S. oil and gas equity deals alone was the highest in 15 years, according to Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence.Still, that didn't prevent Rosetta Resources, which announced a 12 million-share public offering in March, from becoming a takeover target.Consolidation in the energy sector was kicked off by Halliburton's (HAL) acquisition pact last year for Baker Hughes (BHI), marking the first major merger since the downturn in oil prices started.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

42,NBL,"Stocks snapped back into a rally mode Tuesday, booking solid gains and new highs after Monday's one-day pause.The Nasdaq tacked on a 1.1% win, enough to move to a fresh high. The S&P 500 also plowed out new highs with a 0.7% advance. The Dow ended the day up 0.6%, in new high territory and not quite 0.4% below the 20,000 mark.Apple (AAPL) rose 1.7% and Intel (INTC) jumped 2.3% to lead the Dow.Boeing (BA) reversed off early highs and slipped 0.3%, despite announcing a 30% dividend hike and a $14 billion share buyback program after Monday's close.Oil trimmed early gains, ending up a fraction, with West Texas Intermediate below $53 a barrel and Brent crude below $55.  Gains faded despite strong economic data out of China and the naming of Exxon-Mobil (XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson as nominee for U.S. Secretary of State, both positives for oil prices. But a report from the International Energy Agency said markets would need time to assess how the production agreement proctored by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plays out in terms of actual oil supply reductions.Domestic oil producer Noble Energy (NBL) popped almost 5%, jumping to a 17-month high. Moody's lifted its outlook on the company's $6.2 billion in debt to stable, from negative, citing the company's cash flow, liquidity and ability to reduce debt.Land rig drilling leader Patterson-UTI Energy (PTEN) dived 7% after announcing it would acquire Seventy Seven Energy, expanding its pressure pumping fleet. The companies valued the deal at just over $2 billion, including Seventy-Seven's debt.Disk drive maker Seagate Technology (STX) spun up a 4% gain, retaking a 39.43 buy point in a six-week cup base.  The stock ended still in buy range.Aircraft components maker Heico (HEI) is scheduled to report after Tuesday's close.Investors receive a brisk ration of early economic data Wednesday, including November retail sales and producer price data, ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee's policy announcement at 2 p.m., which is followed by a press conference.RELATED:Broadcom, TI Enter Buy Zones As Intel, Qualcomm Approach TheirsThe Fed Won't Rain On Trump Stock-Market Parade — For Now

43,NBL,"With crude oil prices on the mend, three companies that provide pipeline services to exploration firms have surfaced on IBD's IPO Leaders screen.All three are limited partnerships. Under that structure, companies get tax benefits in exchange for passing through most profits to shareholders via dividends. With most revenue derived from a relationship with their affiliated oil & gas companies, there's less exposure to the crude oil and natural gas commodity markets. But the stocks haven't been exactly immune.Shares of Antero Midstream Partners (AM) are working their way back from a severe decline of nearly 45% during June and September of last year. The stock has ramped up for more than a week after it found support around the 50-day moving average. Shares have become extended as they rally, underscoring the current strength in energy shares.Antero pays a quarterly dividend of 26.5 cents a share, resulting in an annualized yield of 3.6%. The company has raised the dividend seven times since it went public in November 2014, including the most recent hike about a week ago.The company works as the pipeline and compressor station operator for Antero Resources (AR), a natural gas exploration and production company. Antero Midstream — which announces Q3 results Oct. 26 after the close — operates in the Marcellus Shale in West Virginia and the Utica Shale in southern Ohio. Both are among the most active drilling areas in the nation.Rice Midstream Partners (RMP) went through its own big stock decline in the second half of 2015 until it bottomed in January. From its IPO price of 16.50 in December 2014, it plummeted to a low of 8.40 in January.After forming a base, Rice broke out of a 15.85 handle buy point in April and has continued with an impressive advance. The stock has consistently found support at the 50-day moving average, and its success has also left shares too extended from buy areas.The company was set up by Pennsylvania-based Rice Energy (RICE) to run pipeline and related assets in the Appalachian Basin. It pays a quarterly dividend of 22.35 cents per share (or ""unit"" as they are technically called by limited partnerships). That works out to a 3.9% yield.Rice Midstream will announce Q3 earnings Nov. 3 at 11 a.m. ET.Noble Midstream Partners (NBLX) is the newest of the three. It went public Sept. 15 on the NYSE, becoming the first energy-sector IPO of this year. Shares have surged from the 22.50 IPO price, reaching as high as 30.82 this week. It has yet to form a base, so investors need to wait for a pattern to emerge.The company owns and operates pipeline and related facilities to serve primarily Noble Energy (NBL), the Houston-based oil & gas exploration company that created Noble Midstream Partners as a master limited partnership and owns a 60.7% stake.Noble Midstream's operations are in two areas of the country with rich deposits. The Permian Basin is in western Texas and part of New Mexico. The Denver-Julesburg Basin is in eastern Colorado and touches parts of Wyoming, Nebraska and Kansas.The company will announce its third-quarter results — the first since going public — Nov. 2 after the close. Noble Midstream has not set a dividend, but expects to have a yield of more than 1%, according to its prospectus.RELATED:First Oil Producer IPO In Two Years On Deck As Crude Rallies

52,NBL,"Noble Energy's deal Monday to purchase Rosetta Resources for $2.1 billion could signal a flurry of merger and acquisition activity ahead as oil prices recover.
"

But they have started to come back in recent weeks and jumped 25% in April, marking the biggest increase in U.S. futures since 2009.The decline in the U.S. oil rig count has also slowed, and rigs in the Permian Basin rose last week for the first time this year.Noble's (NBL) purchase of Rosetta Resources (ROSE) is the first major shale deal since oil prices sank.Under the all-stock transaction, Noble will pay 0.542 a share for each Rosetta share. In return, it will get 50,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford Shale and an additional 56,000 acres in the Permian, expanding its presence in Texas. The deal is expected to close in Q3, pending shareholder approval.Noble shares closed down 6% at 46.07, implying a Rosetta bid price of about 24.97 a share. Rosetta shares soared 27% to 24.58.Still, Sorbara doesn't expect more mergers to happen until the end of the year, as oil prices stabilize further and companies hold out for richer offers in line with share price rebounds off all-time lows.Shale Firms' Cash GushersA surge in shale M&A was expected earlier, given that companies with more debt faced a cash-flow outlook weakened by lower oil prices.Consolidation was kicked off by Halliburton's (HAL) acquisition pact last year for rival oilfield services provider Baker Hughes (BHI), the first big merger in the energy sector since the downturn in oil prices started.But shale companies rushed to issue debt and equity to boost cash positions. By late Q1, U.S. oil and gas equity deals alone raised $13.9 billion — the most in 15 years, according to Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence.Whiting Petroleum (WLL) was widely seen as a takeover target a few months ago after taking on debt for its buyout of Kodiak Oil and Gas in December.But Whiting instead chose to issue 35 million shares at 30 apiece, raising about $1 billion.Other shale firms that turned to capital markets include Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO), which announced a $204 million stock offering in March. Noble also raised $1 billion in late February by selling 21 million shares.In March, Rosetta raised more than $200 million from a share offering, but that wasn't enough to keep the company from being acquired.

55,NBL,"Diamondback Energy (FANG) is near a deal to buy Silver Hill Energy Partners, the Wall Street Journal reported late Friday, which would the latest in a series of Permian Basin investments.Diamondback Energy could announce deal for the private-equity owned Silver Hill next week, the WSJ reported, though it's possible the deal will fall apart or that a new bidder will emerge.Noble Energy (NBL), Marathon Oil (MRO) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) had been seen as mulling offers for Permian-heavy Silver Hill, which owns key assets in the basin. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) said last week that 100 rigs could be added to the highly productive Permian.Earlier this month, EOG Resources (EOG) announced it would purchase privately held Yates Petroleum to expand its presence in the Permian. And in July, Diamondback Energy bought $560 million worth of assets in the southern portion of the Permian. The Permian is in West Texas and SE New Mexico.U.S. oil rigs rose by seven to 425 this week, Baker Hughes reported Friday, the highest in seven months. Rigs in the Permian Basin rose by three to 204, nearly half.IBD'S TAKE: Soaring oil prices triggered a slew of shale players breaking out of consolidations and rebounding from 10-week lines, including Diamondback.Oil prices shot up 8.5% for the week after OPEC agreed to cut production, essentially ending its two-year effort to drive out U.S. shale players. Shale stocks surged for the week.Diamondback Energy rose 1.1% on the stock market today and 8.6% for the week. There was little action in late trading, as the Silver Hill report came out well past the closing bell.

56,NBL,"The U.S. rig count, which is already on the rise, is expected to jump next year, in contrast with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is now trying to reduce its own output after pressuring U.S. companies to cut down.Rigs in operation will average 579 for 2017, up 29% from what's expected this year, according to a study out Wednesday by Platts RigData, a forecasting unit of S&P Global Platts. Analysts forecast 11,151 new wells to be drilled next year, up 25% from the 8,915 wells expected to be started this year.After collapsing last year, the U.S. oil rig count is heading back up and climbed by two to 418 in the week ended Sept. 23, marking the 15th gain in the last 17 weeks, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data. Similarly, U.S. production has started to creep higher after a drawdown.Platts RigData expects capital spending this year to rise in the Anadarko Woodford, Marcellus/Utica, and Permian basins as exploration and production companies focus on ""highest-margin opportunities.""Spending is seen falling in the Bakken and Eagle Ford plays as companies keep capital spending targets steady, but drilling improvements and efficiencies have helped lower costs.""We have seen efficiency gains, like  high grading, and companies are able to do more with less as far as capex is concerned,"" said Jenna Delaney, senior energy analyst, Platts Analytics. ""They had to get creative to survive, and even though prices are only going to rise a fairly marginal amount next year, we would still see production rebounding.""IBD'S TAKE: The Permian is the epicenter of low-cost production of U.S. shale oil and investors should look at shale oil companies with large assets in the Texas play. Read more about stock winners in the oil patch in the Industry Snapshot. The Permian has been the focus of heavy acquisition interest lately.Noble Energy (NBL), Marathon Oil (MRO), and Occidental (OXY) are reportedly looking at offers for privately held Silver Hill Energy Partners.EOG Resources (EOG) said earlier this month it would buy Yates Petroleum to expand its presence in the Permian, and in July Diamondback Energy (FANG) bought $560 million worth of assets in the southern portion of the Permian.Chevron (CVX), the Permian's largest net acreage holder, could double its holdings there to $3 billion by 2020, according to a BMO Capital Markets note out earlier this month.Producers will also use their extra capital to finish drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells. Platts RigData  said that DUC ""inventories may get depleted by between 950 to 1,200 wells this year.""The rise in U.S. rig counts comes as OPEC and other top producers agreed to limit production starting in November, according to Reuters.OPEC members are discussing concessions where Saudi Arabia would cut 400,000 barrels a day from its production, which hit 10.6 million barrels  a day in August, and Iran would cap production at 3.7 million barrels, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier, below the presanction level of about 4 million Tehran has said it is targeting.""If OPEC actually curtails production obviously that is going to be supportive of prices, and the rig count tends to track what the price of oil does,"" said Trey Cowan, Senior Industry Analyst, Platts RigData.Shares of Noble Energy climbed 4.55% in the stock market today on news of the OPEC agreement.

73,NBL,"Top shale oil producers like Continental Resources (CLR) and EOG Resources (EOG) are on tap to report quarterly results this week and could give an update on when drilling might start again after crude prices jumped 20% last month.U.S. oil prices are nearing the break-even level of $45 to $55 per barrel, when some producers could start bringing wells online.Some producers may have even started pumping when oil hit $40 per barrel. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Sanchez Energy (SN), which are active in Texas, already reported results in April. Pioneer boosted its 2016 production growth outlook to 12% from an earlier outlook of 10%, helped in part by increased output from the Spraberry/Wolfcamp zones.Sanchez reported a 25% rise in first-quarter production to 56,500 barrels of oil per day, above its 48,000-52,000 guidance, on better-than-expected results in the Eagle Ford’s western Catarina region. The producer brought 11 new wells online in the area.Late Monday, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) reported that its adjusted Q1 loss deepened to $1.12 a share, beating views for a loss of $1.16, while revenue sank 28% to $1.67 billion, below views of $1.81 billion. But in the Delaware Basin of west Texas, Anadarko grew sales volumes by 47%. In the DJ Basin of northeast Colorado, sales rose 11%.Despite the recent sharp rally in oil prices, some shale companies may wait and see how sustainable the upswing really is. EOG Resources  Chairman Bill Thomas said at an industry conference in March that his company won’t rush to boost output right after oil hits $60 a barrel.Producers also have to wait for capital markets to reopen and for workers and rigs to come back. Jason Bordoff, founding director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, has said it could take nine months to a year before production ramps up again.Market headwinds also remain. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped out 32.64 million barrels per day in April, near a new high, according to a Reuters survey. Oilfield service provider Baker Hughes (BHI) has said it doesn’t expect activity “to meaningfully increase in 2016,” but U.S. rig counts may stabilize in the second half of  the year.Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO)  and Noble Energy (NBL) will announce quarterly results before the market opens Wednesday.Analysts see Carrizo's earnings staying flat at 14 cents a share but revenue is expected to fall 17.2% to $123.44 million.  Noble is seen posting a 57-cent per-share loss vs. a 3-cent per-share profit a year ago. Revenue is expected to rise 3.4% to $784.5 million.Continental Resources reports late Wednesday, and analysts expect its Q1 per-share loss to widen to 37 cents from a 9 cents a year ago. Revenue is seen falling 24.6% to $439.52 million, marking a fifth straight decline. After its Q4 report, Continental said it had suspended fracking in the Bakken Shale formation.Concho Resources (CXO) and Marathon  will announce results after the market closes on Wednesday.Analysts see Concho breaking even vs. an EPS of 36 cents a year ago. They see revenue rising 9.9% to $454.2 million. Marathon's loss is expected to widen to 46 cents a share from a 37 cent a share loss a year ago.

75,NBL,"The departure of Bonanza Creek Energy's (BCEI) chief executive and two other top officials earlier this year hasn't stopped the company from moving forward.Those officials, who retired from the firm, co-founded the oil and natural gas exploration and production outfit in 1999. But with newly hired oil-patch veterans aboard — though not yet a permanent CEO — Denver-based Bonanza Creek continues to make marks in Colorado's well-known Niobrara shale play.The company has been tapping more oil in current acreage. And on May 22, it nearly doubled its position when it announced an agreement to acquire nearby acreage and assets from DJ Resources in a deal valued at more than $200 million.Investors showed their enthusiasm by running up Bonanza Creek stock nearly 14% to 52.12 that day. Shares currently trade around 60.Shale At ScaleThe acquisition expanded Bonanza's total from 34,600 net acres to more than 70,000 net acres.""People had worried they would run through the inventory and worried what they would do next. So now they have a larger footprint,"" said Irene Haas, an analyst with Wunderlich Securities.""They can go north and they can go south (from their existing areas).

It's part of a broader regional formation known as the Denver-Julesburg (or D-J) Basin.Noble Energy (NBL) and Anadarko Petroleum (APC) are the largest operators in the area by far. PDC Energy (PDCE) and Bonanza Creek are the third and fourth largest players.Most of the acreage that Bonanza Creek acquired from DJ Resources is not yet productive. But based on what Bonanza Creek knows about the rock formation, the firm is optimistic about the potential.""It allows us to build scale in a geography we already know very well,"" said Ryan Zorn, Bonanza's vice president of finance. ""We feel the risk there is low.""The company intends to start drilling there this year, but ""the real effort will begin in 2015,"" Zorn said.Bonanza Creek has been drilling in the Niobrara for years. But until it shifted to horizontal drilling in mid-2012, the firm had only vertical wells. Horizontal drilling is more expensive but can make contact with more reservoir rock from a single drilling location, making it more economical in the long run.The process involves the now widely used method of hydraulic fracking, the high-pressure pumping of water and sand into rock to open tiny fissures, allowing the release of trapped oil and natural gas.Arkansas Cash CowBonanza Creek still operates vertical wells in another oil and gas play, the Cotton Valley sands in Arkansas. The play contributes about 25% of its net sales volume.""Our cash flow from that asset is more than what we're spending there,"" Zorn said. ""So we're using the excess cash to reinvest in Colorado.""In its core Niobrara drilling area, most of Bonanza's production comes from two relatively deep and thick layers, or benches. Management plans to start drilling in a third, shallower bench this year.Colorado Find Pays OffTo the surprise of some observers, Bonanza recently hit pay dirt in a deeper but thinner layer below the Niobrara, the Codell formation, which was considered too thin to produce much if any oil.""Finding it was like finding treasure in your basement you had not expected,"" Haas said.In the first 30 days from a so-called step-out test, Codell averaged 426 barrels of oil equivalent per day — below the average for one of the other two Niobrara benches. But considering that the well targeted only six feet of net pay, analyst Ryan Oatman of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey wrote: ""We view the result as both impressive and an indication of Bonanza's operating ability.""""With the company executing as strongly as it is and continuing to drill catalyst well after catalyst well, we do not see a pressing need to fill the (CEO) vacancy,"" he wrote in a research note.Bonanza's search for a new CEO is still underway. Board member Marvin Chronister remains interim CEO.Meanwhile, if results from new 40-acre spacing tests in the two already productive layers of the Niobrara prove successful, Bonanza's inventory could essentially double, Oatman noted. ""We expect results in time for Q3 earnings,"" he said.Volume Turns UpIn Q2, Bonanza's sales volume increased 69% vs. the prior year to 22,849 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Some 70% came from crude oil and related liquids. The company's average realized price for oil was $92.60.Bonanza Creek typically hedges oil prices on a portion of its production. This year, 70% of its anticipated oil production is hedged at $90.65, Zorn says. ""Our business performs well at $85 and above. But we know that our economics are resilient down to the mid-$60s.""Revenue in the quarter jumped 79% to $151.7 million, with crude oil and related liquids accounting for about 87% of the total. Adjusted earnings grew 93% to 52 cents per share, but that number was well under Wall Street estimates. The company said that operating costs were higher than expected.Bonanza raised its full-year production guidance modestly to reflect the recent acquisition. It raised a forecast on production taxes for 2014 from 6.5% to 7% of pre-hedge revenue to 9.5% to 10% due to a loss of ad valorem tax credits for low-rate vertical-well production.Colorado has higher severance and ad valorem tax rates than Arkansas and contributed a greater amount of production in Q2 vs. the earlier year, the company said.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate that Q3 earnings will dip 5% from the prior year's same period. For the full year, they expect earnings to rise 15% to $2.28 per share, a slower growth pace than the last two years. But they see earnings growing 45% next year.

76,NBL,"Stock markets struggled for a second straight week as Apple (AAPL) tumbled to a two-year closing low. Tesla Motors (TSLA) stock skidded as skeptics doubted production plans, Under Armour (UA) lost key execs, while shale producers topped low-ball output targets, and Alibaba (BABA) reported strong revenue growth.With the market uptrend already under pressure, stocks continued to slide. The Nasdaq lost 0.8%, dropping below its 50-day moving average after undercutting its 200-day line in the prior week. Apple fell to the lowest since mid-2014, and Tesla Motors tumbled. But Facebook (FB) held on to the prior week's big earnings-related gain. The S&P 500 fell 0.4% for the week, but on Friday found support at the 50-day moving average after briefly undercutting that key area for the first time in two months.The U.S. economy added just 160,000 in April, the smallest gain in seven months. Earlier in the week, ISM's manufacturing index signaled activity barely increased last month, while productivity fell for a second straight quarter. Those headline figures suggested the U.S. is resolving the contradiction -- solid labor market gains but sputtering economic growth -- in favor of weaker hiring. But wage gains accelerated, and the workweek picked up.The week's economic data reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will not raise rates at its June meeting.The luxury electric carmaker’s 57-cent Q1 loss was a penny smaller than estimates, while its 70% surge in revenue to $1.6 billion met views. Tesla bumped up its 500,000 unit build plan by two years to 2018, due to Model 3 demand.The stock dropped 5% on Thursday, as analysts said the projection is too optimistic. For the week, Tesla sank 10.8%, falling below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Tesla partner Mobileye (MBLY) said Q1 adjusted EPS jumped 88% to 15 cents on a 65% hike in revenue to $75.2 million. Both beat expectations but marked a second straight quarter of decelerating growth. The maker of advanced driver assistance systems is working with big-name automakers on their self-driving technology. Mobileye shares fell 8.3% for the week.Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), which is a Tesla supplier, is due to report earnings next week.Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) confirmed a self-driving technology alliance, with Alphabet buying 100 plug-in hybrid minivans from the automaker to more than double its fleet of test vehicles. It is still yet to be determined who will have the first fully autonomous car ready for the consumer market and when regulators will approve their use.General Motors (GM) and ride-hailing service Lyft also plan to test self-driving electric Chevy Bolt taxis on public roads within a year, the Wall Street Journal reported.Shares of the popular athletic apparel maker tumbled nearly 12% for the week, past their 50-day moving average, as Under Armour announced the July departures of its chief merchandising officer and chief digital officer. The exits prompted a downgrade to hold from buy from Brean Capital, which nevertheless remains positive on the stock's long-term outlook. Meanwhile, comeback kid Adidas reported 22% currency-neutral sales growth in North America.Alleviating worries of a slowdown amid a lethargic local economy, the Chinese e-commerce behemoth reported a view-topping 39% Q4 sales leap to $3.75 billion -- the highest growth rate in four quarters. EPS jumped 88% to 33 cents excluding various items, but that fell short. Now Alibaba is gunning for $1 trillion in gross merchandise volume in about four years. Alibaba shares rose 2.9% for the week. Rival JD.com reports Monday.Next year is shaping up as the so-called “inflection point” for cord-cutters -- consumers that cancel pay TV subscriptions.Alphabet's Google YouTube is reportedly ramping up a subscription-based online video streaming service called ""Unplugged"" that would feature live TV channels. Hulu -- a joint venture of Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) and Comcast (CMCSA) -- also reportedly plans to expand beyond on-demand content and stream live TV.By 2017, Verizon Communications (VZ) will likely expand its ad-supported Go90 mobile video service to multiple video streaming platforms.Satellite TV broadcaster Dish Networks' (DISH) “Sling” Web TV service, meanwhile, seems to be gaining traction.Wild cards? Netflix (NFLX) says it’ll stick to its business model. Apple’s negotiations with TV broadcasters have stalled but could be rekindled. Amazon.com (AMZN) also figures to be a player at some point.Continental Resources (CLR), Concho Resources (CXO), Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) and Noble Energy (NBL) raised their 2016 production targets as costs came down in Q1. But shale firms are hesitant to resume drilling until prices hit at least $50 for a sustained period of time, and not just a uptick from OPEC meetings or supply disruptions from the Middle East. ""It will be some time before we think about bringing on more rigs,"" Continental CEO Harold Hamm said on the company's conference call. Even as crude prices rebound, E&Ps will be looking to first use cash flow for capital spending and to reduce debt, then complete drilled-but-uncompleted wells (DUCs), before considering drilling again.Oil prices finished the week near $45 a barrel.After missing analyst estimates in March, the Big Three U.S. automakers -- GM, Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler -- showed only marginal improvement in April U.S. sales, seeming to confirm predictions by some analysts and industry executives that domestic demand could plateau this year. GM sales fell 3.5% vs. April 2015 to 259,447, in large part due to a drop in low-margin sales to rental fleets. Ford sales rose 4% to 231,316, but both GM and Ford were below forecasts. Fiat Chrysler rose 6% to 199,631 units, beating Edmunds.com’s 5% estimate.Meanwhile, Ford sales in China fell 11% in April, while GM’s sales there rose 7.5%, partly on a 13% pop in Cadillac sales.GM shares fell 2.6%, Ford 0.9% and Fiat Chrysler 4.6% for the week, trading near their 50-day lines.Gunmaker Sturm Ruger (RGR) on Monday handily beat first-quarter forecasts and boosted its quarterly dividend by 37%, following similarly strong results in March from rival Smith & Wesson (SWHC).Both companies have benefited from an increasingly diverse crowd of shooting enthusiasts. Regulatory concerns and widening fears following mass shootings like those in San Bernardino, Calif., and in Europe have also made guns more popular in the U.S.On Wednesday, the FBI reported 2,145,865 NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) firearm background checks for the month of April. That’s the best April on record for the system but lower than recent months, in keeping with similar patterns in previous years. The background checks are used as an indicator of gun demand, and stocks of both companies have been sensitive over the years to signs of demand topping out.Sturm Ruger rallied 5.5% Monday ahead of results and climbed 1.5% on Tuesday, but the stock found resistance at the 50-day line and ended the week up 2.6%. Smith & Wesson also wrapped the week with pared gains.

80,NBL,"Stocks scratched out thin gains early Monday, with some help from a passel of decent economic news and a bump up in oil prices.Dow stocks pulled up 0.2%, while the S&P 500 inched up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq made a fractional gain.Volume swept lower, down more than 20% on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, compared with levels Thursday morning, when stocks last traded.The stock market today opened to generally healthy economic news, with Q4 GDP data reported when markets were closed Friday coming in better than expected, at a growth rate of 1.4%.The Labor Department reported early Monday that personal income rose 0.2% in February, down sharply from January's 0.5% gain but better than the 0.1% increase expected by economists' consensus. Spending inched up 0.1%, equal to January's downwardly revised number and in line with expectations. Price growth was steady, up 0.1%, although core prices -- minus energy and food -- slowed to a 0.1% increase, vs. 0.3% in January. Consensus projected a steeper 0.2% rise.Real estate sales were a positive, with pending home sales jumping 3.5% in February, according to the National Association of Realtors. The group also revised its estimate for January lower, to a 3% decline. Economists had expected a 1.5% gain in February.Dow stocks were evenly divided and holding to gains and losses of less than 1% each.Marriott International (MAR) skipped up 4% to the head of the S&P 500. The bidding war between Marriott and China's Angbang Insurance to acquire Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT) amped up Monday. The consortium led by Angbang raised its latest bid to what Starwood estimated Saturday would total a combined current value of $88.66 per share. Starwood shares rose nearly 3% in early trade.Finish Line (FINL) broadjumped 9% after Jefferies raised the stock's price target to 24 from 22, while also maintaining the stock's buy rating.Noble Energy (NBL) dropped 7% in opening trade. Israel's supreme court ruled Sunday against allowing an offshore gas development deal by a joint venture between Noble and Israel-based Delek Group. Israeli regulators had ruled the project illegal in 2014, saying it constituted a monopoly.Video game retailer GameStop (GME) tumbled 4% in early action, though the shares later trimmed their loss to sit just a fraction lower. The Grapevine, Texas, firm gave Q1 EPS guidance well below consensus expectations.Among IBD 50 stocks, handgun manufacturers Smith & Wesson (SWHC) and Sturm Ruger (RGR) rose 4% and 2%, respectively, in heavy trade. Both stocks fell hard Thursday, possibly due to cautious comments tied to a Q4 results report from Sportsman's Warehouse (SPWH). Monday's gain lifted Smith & Wesson back above a 26.64 buy point after tripping a sell signal Thursday.
"
81,NBL,"Iran's oil minister said Wednesday that Tehran backs efforts to stabilize oil prices but didn't say if his country would join an output freeze that Saudi Arabia, Russia, Qatar and Venezuela have proposed.Despite Iran's noncommittal statement, Brent crude settled 7.2% higher at $34.50 per barrel, and U.S. crude jumped 5.6% to $30.66.""The decision that was taken for the OPEC and non-OPEC members to keep their production ceiling to stabilize the market and prices for the benefit of producers and consumers, is supported by us,” Bijan Zanganeh said after a meeting with his counterparts from Venezuela and Iraq.But he didn't say Tehran would go along with the proposal to freeze production at January levels. Saudi Arabia, Russia, Qatar and Venezuela have said they would only cap their production if top producers like Iran and Iraq also participate.Kuwait and the UAE said they would join the freeze. But Iran is seen unlikely to agree to any deal unless it is allowed to keep increasing output to levels seen before the West imposed economic sanctions over its nuclear program.Iran has maintained it plans to boost supply by 1 million barrels per day in the next six to 12 months. It currently produces 1.1 million barrels per day but had produced 2.5 million barrels per day when sanctions were implemented.As oil prices rallied, Exxon Mobil (XOM) closed up 1% in the stock market today. BP (BP) shares jumped 3.1%, and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) climbed 3.7%.Meanwhile, U.S. shale producers continued trimming output and spending plans amid low oil prices.On Wednesday, Noble Energy (NBL) reported earnings that topped analyst estimates but missed on revenue as the company wrote down $1.27 billion in assets.It reaffirmed capital spending would be down 50% for the year vs. 2015, when adjusting for its Rosetta Resources acquisition. Noble sees 2016 sales volumes up 10% but essentially flat after adjusting for Rosetta.Noble shares jumped 6.2%.Late Tuesday, Devon Energy (DVN) reported quarterly earnings above views but said it sees capital spending down 75% in 2016. It also slashed its dividend by 75% and announced plans to cut 20% of its workforce.“Devon’s top priority in 2016 is to protect the balance sheet,” said CEO Dave Hager in a statement.The company sees this year's top-line production from core assets declining 6%, driven by lower gas volumes. It expects 2016 oil production from core assets of 516,000-540,000 barrels a day, down from an average of 560,000 for 2015.Devon shares tumbled 4.4% Wednesday.Also late Tuesday, Laredo Petroleum (LPI) said it sees full-year production of  41,800-42,900 barrels of oil a day down 4.2%-6.7%  year over year. Shares ended up 5.85% Wednesday.Shares of Continental Resources (CLR), which will announce results next week, climbed 5.9%.

82,NBL,"The new year is already shaping up to be a historic one for energy companies as the U.S. exported crude for the first time since the 1970s on Dec. 31, but low oil prices will continue to pressure smaller firms with weaker balance sheets.
"
83,NBL,"In December, Magnum Hunter Resources filed for bankruptcy protection, and dozens of smaller producers have filed in 2015, with the pace likely to pick up this year.""Banks are going to clamp down and are not going to be as generous as in 2015,"" said Dan Guffey, VP of equity research at Stifel Nicolaus.The prospect of less financing from banks comes as energy companies rely less on the bond and equity markets to raise liquidity. And over-leveraged firms in particular will feel the squeeze, as oil is expected to stay lower for longer.In 2015, Brent crude hit an 11-year low, and U.S. prices fell to levels not seen since 2009. Even lower prices may be ahead.How Low Will Oil Go?JPMorgan analysts see oil staying lower for the first half of 2016 before rising in the second. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have said oil could even hit $20 a barrel. Guffey forecasts oil at $35 to $45 per gallon.Tensions in the Middle East are increasing, potentially boosting oil prices. But the rapidly escalating rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia may sink any hopes that Saudi-led OPEC will make room for Iran's additional output and ease the global oil glut.U.S. producers were able to weather the low-price environment in 2015 by slashing costs, payrolls, drilling rigs and capital expenditure budgets. They also used new techniques on their most efficient, productive wells, keeping U.S. output more resilient than expected.But hunkering down for another year may prove difficult. Gains from drilling innovations, such as using higher sand concentrations and higher proppant volumes, are expected to slow this year, and costs have less room to drop.""We might be in the later innings of those efficiency gains as operators don't want to test in the lower oil price environment,"" Guffey said.U.S. Production To TumbleAfter a modest dip, oil production should see a steeper drop this year. The Energy Information Administration expects U.S. crude output to fall to an average of 8.76 million barrels a day in 2016 from 9.33 million barrels a day in 2015.Meanwhile, more budget cuts are on the horizon this year as well. Chevron (CVX) has said it plans to spend $26.6 billion in 2016, 24% less than in 2015. ConocoPhillips (COP) has said capital expenditures will fall to $7.7 billion in 2016, down 25% from 2015 and 55% from 2014.The big, integrated oil majors are also reluctant to pay for companies or oilfields that aren't top quality, and stable U.S. shale producers are hesitant to spend cash on assets that might not be drilled for years from struggling small firms.So the wave of industry consolidation that was expected when oil prices initially sank hasn't happened yet, though Noble Energy's (NBL) $2 billion purchase of Rosetta Resources and Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSA) $70 billion deal for BG Group were among the few that stood out in 2015. But private equity firms could be interested in smaller oil companies, Guffey said.A mega-merger in oilfield services may be clinched in early 2016. While regulators have been skeptical of Halliburton 's (HAL) $35 billion acquisition of Baker Hughes (BHI), discussions with the Justice Department continue, and the companies extended their deadline to April.Amid the gloom of U.S. oil prices at recession-era lows, producers were able to score at least one victory in 2015: ending the ban on exports of U.S. crude.The first crude shipment left Texas on Dec. 31, on its way for the Vitol Group, a Dutch oil-trading firm, according to ConocoPhillips and NuStar Energy (NS).That comes ahead of Iran's expected return to world oil markets, as economic sanctions over its nuclear program could be lifted this month. Tehran has said it can double oil production to 1 million barrels per day in 2016.Hopes are high that opening up export markets for U.S. shale firms will prop up drilling activity and bring back some jobs. Lawmakers also see it as a political weapon.Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, is already paying the price for cheap prices and sees a $98 billion budget deficit for 2015 and $86.86 billion in 2016, as it derives 90% of its fiscal revenue from oil. Saudi Arabia will now face more U.S. competition.""Having the oil export ban lifted permanently is like having 100 Keystone pipelines, and it's really good for foreign policy. . .. It helps us put OPEC out of business,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan said during a Dec. 21 interview on ""The Hugh Hewitt Show."" ""It's not good for Venezuela, the Middle East, Russia and others.""

145,NBL,"The oil and gas sector is a big one in IBD's database, comprised of 10 subgroups. The groups are home to several of the best oil stocks, but the devil is in the details when it comes to identifying the names with the best potential.Headed into Wednesday, exploration and production firms were among the best oil stocks in the market based on six-month price performance. The group is also home to high-quality names with top Composite Ratings and outstanding fundamentals. While many leaders have made strong moves in the group, several of the best oil stocks are finding support at the 50-day moving average or the 10-week moving average for the first time after base breakouts.Oasis Petroleum (OAS), with a Composite Rating of 96, has a healthy weekly chart. After a breakout over an 11.49 buy point, it's getting support at the 10-week moving average for the first time. The company has a big presence in the North Dakota and Montana regions of the oil-rich Williston Basin.Oasis owns a market capitalization of just over $4 billion, and it's very liquid with an average daily volume of more than 11 million shares. It's expected to earn 41 cents a share this year, with earnings expected to surge 105% next year to 84 cents.Other liquid, institutional-quality stocks in the group could also be setting up for more upside. After breaking out from a bottoming base in March, Denver-based Whiting Petroleum (WLL) is also visiting its 10-week line for the first time. It's a top crude oil producer in North Dakota as well as northern Colorado.Like many other exploration and production firms, Whiting has the look of a turnaround story. After a series of quarterly losses, the company reported first-quarter profit of 92 cents a share, along with the third straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. Q1 sales rose 39% to $515.1 million. For Q2, the Zacks consensus estimate calls for profit of 57 cents shares. Sales growth is expected to accelerate again, up 60% to $498.25 million.EOG Resources (EOG) and Noble Energy (NBL) are two other liquid names in the group with compelling fundamentals and healthy charts.Diamondback Energy (FANG), new to Friday's Sector Leaders screen, jumped above its 50-day moving average this week, but it's prone to volatile price swings. The Texas-based firm has been a solid performer since its IPO in 2012 and shows big earnings and sales growth in recent quarters, but it's not in a proper buy area. Still, shares are up about 12% so far this week as it approaches its recent high of 138.14.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

149,NBL,"Occidental Petroleum (OXY) is easily among the best energy stocks in the oil and gas space, helped by strong fundamentals and a bullish chart.It's also a member of IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, thanks in part to a healthy annualized dividend yield of 4%. Its last quarterly dividend of 77 cents a share was paid April 16.The oil giant, with a market capitalization of just over $53 billion, has operations in the U.S., the Middle East and Latin America.When the company reported fourth-quarter results in February, adjusted profit of 41 cents a share matched expectations. Sales growth accelerated from the third quarter, up 27% to nearly $3.59 billion.In the company's Permian Resources segment, average daily production volumes improved to 159,000 barrels of oil equivalent from 139,000 in the third quarter. Results were helped by increased drilling activity and well productivity. For 2018, the company forecasts 40% annual production growth in Permian Resources.Along with its fourth quarter earnings report, Occidental issued guidance for 2018, including a capital budget of $3.9 billion along with estimated production growth of 8% to 12%.At the end of last year, about 58% of the company's proved reserves was oil, 25% gas and 17% natural gas liquids. Of the total proved reserves, 60% comes from the U.S. and 40% is international.Strong earnings reports from other top stocks in the oil and gas sector have been commonplace in recent days.

156,NBL,"Noble Energy (NBL) is making a second test of its 10-week moving average since breaking out from a flat base in September.The test sets up a new buying area, although it's best to wait for big volume to come in on the rebound before buying shares.Some of the stocks' recent down weeks have occurred in above-average volume, but volume wasn't as strong as it was on recent up weeks.Shares rose more than 17% from a 66.40 flat-base buy point before the pullback started Oct. 30.The number of energy stocks in the Stock Spotlight screen has dwindled as crude prices tumbled in recent weeks.Noble — which is just 6% below its prior high — was the only energy issue in Monday's screen, down from five a week ago. Energy stocks got hit Monday on news of Iran's nuclear deal (see story on here), but Noble took relatively less heat than many rivals.Houston-based Noble is the third-biggest oil and gas producer by market capitalization in IBD's Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production industry group. In the U.S., it has operations in the Marcellus shale in the East Coast and the DJ Basin in Colorado. It also has operations in the Gulf of Mexico, eastern Mediterranean and West Africa.After some rocky earnings in 2012 and earlier this year, it has now posted two solid quarters of profit growth. Earnings jumped 92% and 137% in the second and third quarters respectively. Sales climbed 19% and 39% in the same periods. Those figures marked an acceleration from the 5% increase in the first quarter. The company had record sales volumes of oil in the third quarter.Although profit is expected to dip 5% in the current quarter, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see full-year earnings rising 31% to $3.18 a share. For 2014, profit is slated to grow 32%.

157,NBL,"Natural gas is making such a resurgence that some are calling it ""the product of the future,"" and Rice Midstream Partners (RMP) is evidence of that.The natural gas distributor is a master limited partnership formed by Rice Energy (RICE), one of several companies making a big bet on natural gas. Rice Energy owns more than 40% of the relatively young Rice Midstream.Unlike many companies of its kind, Rice Midstream concentrates almost exclusively on natural gas when it comes to transporting energy.""Rice Midstream is a pure play on gathering dry gas production and getting it to the market,"" said Tristan Richardson, an equity research analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. ""Other midstream firms are diversified across wet gas and crude.""But Rice Midstream isn't the only sign energy companies are turning to natural gas for future revenue. BP (BP) has said it wants natural gas to make up 60% of its energy mix in the next 10 years.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said the liquefied natural gas market will grow four times faster than oil, and double in the next 15 years. Plus, Dow component Exxon Mobil (XOM) announced plans to build liquefied natural gas terminals in Texas and Louisiana.There are others who are joining the party in the same vein as Rice, with midstream companies founded by parent energy firms. They include Antero Resources' (AR) Antero Midstream (AM), EQT Corp.'s (EQT) EQT Midstream (EQM) and Cone Midstream (CNNX), which was formed by Consol Energy (CNX) and Noble Energy (NBL).The Oil & Gas-Transport/Pipeline group is ranked No. 84 out of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. Rice Midstream has a 92 Composite Rating, meaning it's outperforming 92% of stocks tracked by IBD. It's also on IBD's IPO leaders list.Rice Midstream debuted in December 2014 and is headquartered in Canonsburg, Pa., near the heart of the Marcellus shale oilfield in the state's Appalachian basin. That's where most of Rice Midstream's natural gas operations are.In addition to distributing natural gas, Rice Midstream supplies water for hydraulic fracturing, a key ingredient in the process. During ""fracking,"" water is injected into wells along with sand or another type of material to loosen the natural gas or oil trapped in the rocks.""The water business has tailwinds right now,"" said Brian Brungardt, a research analyst at Stifel. ""Every (exploration and production) operator continues to improve the well designs they are employing on the fracking side. Improvement largely means using more sand per well.""With more sand comes more water. Another improvement is longer laterals from each well, requiring more water.Of the midstream companies, only Antero and Rice supply water — and Rice stands out from Antero on that count as well.While Antero Midstream just services the needs of parent Antero Resources, Rice Midstream serves third-party customers like EQT, along with parent Rice Energy, its primary customer.Water accounts for 30% of Rice Midstream's operational revenue, but Richardson said the business will be a smaller piece of its operations in the next two to three years as Rice Midstream acquires more infrastructure for distributing natural gas, known as gathering.Midstream companies gather natural gas from wellheads in the field and then ship it along smaller pipelines to larger pipelines that carry gas across state borders.Rice Midstream's gathering volumes jumped 25.7% to 1.2 million cubic feet of natural gas in the fourth-quarter vs. the third quarter. Its Q4 gathering and compression revenue was up 25% to $41.8 million compared with Q3.IBD'S TAKE: Rice Midstream Partners holds a high IBD Composite Rating of 92, but it's not even the highest-ranked stock in its group. Tops on the list is Argentina's TGS (TGS). For more on that company, check here.Gathering volumes could increase even more this year as natural gas prices rise, spurring exploration and production firms to increase spending and drill more.In a January 2017 report outlining short-term production, the Energy Information Administration said it sees natural gas spot prices averaging $3.55 per million British thermal unit this year and $3.72 next year vs. an average of $2.51 in 2016.Rice Energy plans to boost 2017 net production by 59% vs. 2016 and raised its capital spending outlook to $1.035 billion for drilling and completion activity from $686 million in 2016.Even if natural gas prices fall, Rice Midstream will be shielded from commodity price fluctuations as Rice Energy is ""significantly hedged through 2017,"" said Stifel's Brungardt.But if prices were to drop and stay low for an extended period and Rice Energy scaled back production, then Rice Midstream's revenue results could take a hit on reduced volumes, according to SunTrust's Richardson.President Trump's election has given energy firms a boost as his energy policies are widely viewed as a plus for the industry as he promised to push back environmental regulations and allow drilling on federal lands.He also allowed construction on the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline to restart and said TransCanada should ""resubmit its application"" for the Keystone XL project President Obama rejected.But local politics could still inhibit drilling and pipeline expansion.""It appears the new administration early on is taking a more constructive view with various infrastructure projects, pipelines included,"" Brungardt said. ""But local opposition, that 'not in my backyard' mentality, certainly continues to be an issue.""But Richardson said the local regulatory environment has been more bullish as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state governments approved more pipelines in Appalachia in recent months, including the Williams' (WMB) Atlantic Sunrise pipeline and Energy Transfer Partners' (ETP) Rover pipeline.Brungardt has a hold rating on the stock due to valuation, but says Rice Midstream has a ""solid balance sheet."" Richardson has a buy rating on the stock.Shares of Rice slipped 1.3% to close at 24.92 Friday.RELATED:'Permania' Infects CERAWeek But Don't Count Out Bakken, Natural GasAnalysts Are Bullish On Fracking Supplier Antero Midstream

159,NBL,"U.S. crude stockpiles soared last week, according to the Energy Information Administration Wednesday, but oil prices increased on declines in gasoline and distillate inventories.The EIA said U.S. oil stockpiles jumped by 13.8 million barrels vs. the 2.5 million-barrel rise analysts expected. The American Petroleum Institute reported a 14.2 million-barrel increase late Tuesday. Crude stocks at Cushing, Okla., jumped by 1.1 million barrels.But gasoline stockpiles fell by 869,000 barrels vs. analyst expectations for an increase of 1.1 million barrels. Distillate stockpiles only rose by 29,000 barrels vs. analysts expectations for a 300,000-barrel increase.""The draw down in gasoline inventories seems to suggest that much of weak gasoline demand is only temporary,"" said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group.He said that the big jump in crude stocks was probably a one off that could be revised lower but will have to wait a few weeks to see if it's a trend or not.U.S. crude futures reversed early losses on the EIA data, closing up 3% to $52.34 a barrel. Gasoline futures rose 4.4%.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares fell 1.6% to 81.48 on the stock market today, hitting the lowest levels since March 2016. Chevron (CVX) edged up 0.2%. Continental Resources (CLR) was off 1.4%. EOG Resources (EOG) rose 1%.U.S. crude production rose 0.6% to 8.978 million barrels per day, the first increase in three weeks, according to the EIA.Output and drilling activity have been ramping up after OPEC and other top producers agreed late last year to cut output.Qatar's oil minster said OPEC would consider extending its output cuts past its initial six-month deal.""We kept it open to reconsider the rollover, and rollover is an option if needed,"" Mohammed Saleh Al Sada told Bloomberg but said it was still too early to ""make a judgment.""Talk of extending the output-cut deal comes as U.S. firms have been spending more and expanding acreage, especially in the Permian.Late Tuesday, Parsley Energy (PE) said it is buying over 70,000 net acres in the Permian's Midland Basin from Double Eagle Energy Permian, selling shares to help finance the deal.Exxon and Diamondback Energy (FANG) also have expanded their Permian holdings in recent months, and Noble Energy (NBL) agreed to buy Permian-focused Clayton Williams Energy (CWEI).Parsley shares plunged 6.9% to 31.04. Diamondback Energy shares rose 0.4%. Noble shares were down 1.4%.RELATED:U.S. Oil Rig Count Jumps To Highest Since October 2015C

160,NBL,"The International Energy Agency said Thursday that the U.S. shale sector has emerged from the oil bust much ""leaner and fitter"" with productivity showing improvement in ""leaps and bounds,"" threatening a production-cut deal by OPEC and key non-OPEC members.Last year, oil production per rig jumped as much as 39% in the Bakken shale formation, 41% in the Permian Basin, and 26% in Eagle Ford, according to IEA's latest monthly report. While that is also due to companies focusing on their most productive wells, it said improved well completion techniques, longer lateral wells, and the use of more proppants have increased recovery estimates.The energy watchdog now sees U.S. oil production rising by 320,000 barrels per day this year, up from its prior view for only a ""marginal increase,"" after contracting by 475,000 barrels a day last year.Still, that increase is small compared with the 1.8 million barrels a day in production that OPEC and non-OPEC countries have pledged to reduce. But concerns that U.S. shale will roar back have already weighed on crude prices.On Thursday, U.S. crude settled up 0.6% at $51.37 a barrel after diving by 2.8% Wednesday, but pared gains after the Energy Department reported  a U.S. crude inventory buildup of 2.3 million barrels last week vs. expectations for a drop of 342,000 barrels. The American Petroleum Institute's report showed a plunge of 5 million barrels late Wednesday. U.S. production was essentially flat at 8.94 million barrels a day.After OPEC agreed in late November to trim output for six months starting this month, IEA noted that the U.S. rig count increased by 48 for the month of December, the biggest monthly gain since 2014.The stepped up U.S. activity has been focused on the Permian Basin, where acquisitions are also ramping up. On Tuesday, Exxon Mobil (XOM) agreed to pay up to $6.6 billion to more than double its Permian resource holdings, a day after Noble Energy (NBL) agreed to buy Clayton Williams Energy (CWEI) for $2.7 billion to expand in the lucrative shale area.Last week, Parsley Energy (PE), already a Permian player, said it bought $607 million worth in acreage in the area from various sources. And last month, Diamondback Energy (FANG) agreed to pay $2.43 billion for Permian acreage from Brigham Resources.IEA warned higher material and service costs will erode productivity gains, and increases in production will lag growth in rig counts by several months.But bigger gains may be ahead. While well completions are estimated to grow by 26% this year, ""more substantial growth"" is seen in 2018, IEA said.Shares of Exxon fell 1.8% to 84.73 on the stock market today, after receiving a downgrade from UBS to sell. Noble Energy rose 1.2%, Parsley added 0.9%, and Diamondback rallied 1.7%.

The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 slipped 0.3% apiece.  Small caps took harder hits than the overall market, leaving the Russell 2000 down 1.4%.U.S. traders took some cues from London, where stocks dropped hard after Prime Minister Theresa May announced Britain would seek to renegotiate its trade agreements outside the European Union's single-market trade protocol.  The statement of fortified independence sent the pound to its biggest gain since 2008, while London's FTSE 100 equity index shed 1.5%. The CAC 40 in Paris slid 0.5%, while Frankfurt's DAX kept to a 0.1% decline.In afternoon trade, 141 of IBD's 197 industry groups moved lower. Superregional banks fell furthest, trading lower after President-elect Donald Trump signaled opposition to a key piece of the GOP's tax strategy.Comerica (CMA) was hardest hit in the group, down 7%. The Dallas-based bank reported fourth-quarter earnings above analyst targets. The stock had been holding steady just below a Jan. 5 high, but dropped to test support at its 10-week moving average. Regions Financial (RF) and SVB Financial Group (SIVB) fell more than 5% each.IBD 50 stock Arista Networks (ANET) led the computer networking group to the day's second-worst loss among industries.  Shares fell 12% in huge trade after the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agency said it would reinstate an import ban on Arista switches pending further review. The tumble broke support at the stock's 10-week moving average in heavy trade and erased effectively all of its gain since clearing a flat base in November. Both moves are sell signals.Some of the day's strongest moves came from gold miners, as a pullback in the dollar helped boost gold prices more than 1%. A long list of miners — including Anglogold Ashanti (AU), Sibanye Gold (SBGL) and IamGold (IAG) — gained more than 2%.Noble Energy (NBL) topped the S&P 500, rallying 7% after agreeing to buy Clayton Williams Energy (CWEI) in a $2.7 billion deal.

The deal will add 3.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent, giving Exxon more than six billion in the Permian shale formation.The Permian Shale is an area where energy companies can produce shale at relatively low prices. The number of rigs in the Permian shale has soared over the past year, accounting for a fast-growing share of total U.S. rigs in operation. While total U.S. rigs fell last week after 10 weeks of gains, the Permian added another rig to 268, or 51% of all U.S. rigs.Exxon Mobil shares rose 1.2% to 87.36 on the stock market today, with U.S. crude futures up 0.2% to $52.48 a barrel.On Monday, Noble Energy agreed to buy Clayton Williams Energy for $2.7 billion, or $3.2 billion including assumed debt. Clayton Williams holders will swap each share for 2.7874 shares of Noble Energy and $34.75 cash.

"
164,NBL,"For many years, Whiting Petroleum (WLL) was just another bit player in the domestic oil exploration industry.
"
165,NBL,"Yes, it ran with the pack, chasing sexy drilling prospects across America with its hydraulic fracturing expertise. But Whiting tended to buy cheaper acreage in marginal drilling formations. As a player of long shots, Whiting's shares historically have ""traded at a discount,"" noted Macquarie Capital analyst Paul Grigel.
"
166,NBL,"""They liked to go out to areas people aren't focused on, paying less,"" explained Jason Wangler, analyst with Wunderlich Securities. As a result, many were long skeptical of Whiting's prospects. But it's beginning to look like Denver-based Whiting Petroleum knew what it was doing.
"
167,NBL,"In North Dakota's Bakken and Colorado's Niobrara, Whiting is now seeing success with properties that were once thought to be ""fringy.""
"
168,NBL,"""They did their homework,"" notes Wangler.
"
169,NBL,"That homework involved lots of analysis of geological formations. And some contend Whiting is very good at it. ""They're very much ahead of the curve in doing the science on new shale plays,"" said Mike Kelly, analyst with Global Hunter.
"
170,NBL,"In the Bakken, by experimenting with new well-completion techniques, Whiting has been able to squeeze 50% to 75% more in initial production out of new wells, CEO James Volker told analysts in reporting third-quarter results. And in Colorado, initial results on a small number of wells have been ""really good,"" according to Wangler.
"
171,NBL,"Value Plays
"
172,NBL,"Whiting easily topped analyst estimates of $1.10 in reporting third-quarter earnings per share of $1.28. Record production led to record cash flow of $450.1 million, up 31% from the year before.
"
173,NBL,"""Whiting is a major player in two of the hottest Lower 48 U.S. oil plays in the last 40 years: the North Dakota Bakken and now the Colorado Niobrara play,"" said CEO Volker.
"
174,NBL,"Hydraulic fracturing — fracking, as it's known — remains a controversial technology.
"
175,NBL,"Critics cite dangers to air quality and water supply. They are also concerned about the tonnage of chemically laced wastewater such drilling creates. Some researchers suggest a tie may exist between fracking and earthquakes. In Colorado, several cities have voted to either ban or temporarily halt fracking, and a statewide fracking moratorium could soon be on the ballot.
"
176,NBL,"But it's much too early to know how all this will play out.
"
177,NBL,"Meanwhile, Whiting hopes to crack the top tier of drillers in both Colorado and North Dakota.
"
178,NBL,"In North Dakota, a state that has been very friendly to drilling interests, Whiting has amassed huge acreage. While Continental Resources (CLR) still leads in the Bakken, Whiting is coming on strong.
"
179,NBL,"""They've got a massive position in the Bakken,"" said Kelly. ""In North Dakota, they are pushing to be the top producer.""
"
180,NBL,"What's helping now is increased production as a result of more efficient rock-smashing methods. And there are countless variations on the mix of water, sand and chemicals used to fracture rock. Whiting has said that it is using more sand in its mix. It has also made other technical adjustments.
"
181,NBL,"""The new and improved techniques are resulting in more focused fractures,"" noted Macquarie analyst Grigel. (Disclosure: Macquarie owns more than 1% of Whiting shares through its Delaware mutual funds.)
"
182,NBL,"With initial production on new wells up 50% or more, Grigel sees potential for Whiting to blow through Wall Street output estimates. ""If these results are repeatable, there would be significant upside to the total output from these wells,"" he said.
"
183,NBL,"Moves In The Niobrara
"
184,NBL,"Meanwhile, Whiting's early success in Colorado's Niobrara is also attracting attention. Whiting trails Colorado drilling leaders like Anadarko (APC) and Noble Energy (NBL) in production.
"
185,NBL,"But it has begun to exceed expectations. ""Results there have been very promising,"" said Grigel. ""The success they've had in the Niobrara is better than people expected a couple of years ago.""
"
186,NBL,"Wangler says that they ""were considered to be out on the edge of the play.""
"
187,NBL,"Whiting is moving resources into the Niobrara. ""They're ramping rapidly,"" said Grigel.
"
188,NBL,"The company currently has three operating rigs in the area. But by the middle of next year, he expects, they should have five. CEO Volker estimates that Whiting now has 3,300 potential well locations in the area.
"
189,NBL,"And drilling in Colorado is relatively cheap.
"
190,NBL,"""The economics there might be even better than what they are seeing in the Bakken,"" said Kelly. ""They found what is probably the sweet spot out there.""
"
191,NBL,"But even with promising drilling results in Colorado, rock-smashing Whiting will have to keep an eye on political opposition.
"
192,NBL,"""North Dakota is safe. Colorado is not. Colorado is a risk,"" noted Kelly.
"
193,NBL,"Tomorrow's Wells
"
194,NBL,"Whiting continues to look for other plays. Kelly estimates that Whiting has amassed 500,000 acres in unidentified areas. Analysts refer to this as ""stealth"" acreage, but Kelly believes he may know where 200,000 of those mystery acres lie.
"
195,NBL,"""We think it's in Michigan,"" said Kelly. He pinpoints Sanilac County, which borders on Lake Huron in what's known as the ""thumb"" area of the state.
"
196,NBL,"If Whiting has again done its homework well, new production in Michigan would add another kicker to output.
"
197,NBL,"""There is the potential for an increase in production if the Niobrara continues to look good and the Michigan play pans out,"" said Kelly.
"
198,NBL,"Make no mistake: Like other oil producers, Whiting is hostage to global oil prices. The prospect of a negotiated settlement to the Iranian nuclear crisis has already put some downward pressure on prices. The success of fracking in North America has created enough new supply to depress natural gas prices. In time, the success of Whiting and other rock-crackers could weigh on oil prices too.
"
199,NBL,"But Whiting can still earn ""a solid return"" with oil prices ""in the low 80s, "" according to Wangler.For many years, Whiting Petroleum (WLL) was just another bit player in the domestic oil exploration industry.Yes, it ran with the pack, chasing sexy drilling prospects across America with its hydraulic fracturing expertise.

Crude prices have been hit lately on indications that the deal could collapse, but top energy officials will meet on the sidelines of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum later this week to discuss the deal.Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration reported a 5.3-million-barrel build in U.S. crude stockpiles. Analysts were only expecting a 1.5-million-barrel increase, and late Tuesday the American Petroleum Institute reported a 3.65-million-barrel increase.Domestic production dipped 0.1% to 8.681 million barrels per day.U.S. crude climbed on the Russia news before reversing to close down 0.5% to $45.57 per barrel.Shares of U.S. shale bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) climbed 0.8% to close at 49.25 on the stock market today. EOG Resources (EOG) edged up 0.7% to 95.22. Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 1.2% to 85.75. Chevron (CVX) added 0.4% to 108.35.IBD'S TAKE: The International Energy Agency sees ""greater oil price volatility"" in the near term due to shale drilling in the U.S., but oil demand won't peak until 2040 even with the Paris climate deal. Meanwhile, OPEC is concerned about its role in stabilizing oil prices after Donald Trump won the presidential election last week.Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, warned Trump about the perils of his campaign promise of  ""complete American energy independence.""""At his heart President-elect Trump will see the benefits, and I think the oil industry will also be advising him accordingly that blocking trade in any product is not healthy,"" Al-Falih told the Financial Times.Trump has also vowed to open up more land to U.S. producers, which already have plans to ramp up output.Ahead of its investor day Wednesday, Noble Energy (NBL) said it sees onshore oil volumes for 2016-2020 rising at a compound annual growth rate of 23% to 29%.It sees 2017 capital spending of $2 billion to $2.4 billion, with 70% of upstream capital earmarked for U.S. onshore operations. That's up from the $1.5 billion it plans to spend this year.Noble sees total 2017 production volumes averaging between 400,000 barrels per day to 410,000 barrels per day vs. the 427,000 barrels averaged in the third-quarter.Noble shares fell 2.3% to 36.61.RELATED: Oil Rallies By Most In Seven Months As OPEC Tries To Save Output DealIEA Sees Oil Demand Flat In 2017 While Output Grows; Conoco Cuts Capex

207,NBL,"U.S. oil rigs in operation were up by 19 to 471 last week as 11 oil rigs were added to Texas' Permian basin, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data out Friday.The latest rise marked the 22nd gain out of the last 24 weeks. But rig counts fell by one in the Eagle Ford. Rigs were up by two to 18 in Colorado's DJ Niobrara basin. Total oil and gas rigs in the U.S. rose by 20 to 588 after falling last week.But U.S. crude futures reversed higher to settle up 0.6% at $45.69 per barrel. Brent closed up 0.8% at $46.86. Reuters reported OPEC members are willing to grant Iran some leeway as part of a deal to cut the cartel's production.Shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM) edged up 0.1% to 85.28 on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) rose 1%. Continental Resources (CLR) jumped 2.9%. EOG Resources (EOG) climbed 0.9%.

"
208,NBL,"Officials expect domestic natural gas prices to rise next year, but even if prices stay steady or fall, analysts are bullish on Antero Midstream (AM) and other operators in its sector.The provider of water and other services for fracking operations is 62% owned by oil and gas exploration company Antero Resources (AR). Antero Midstream operates its parent's pipelines and compressor stations and is expanding its presence among fracking operations. It operates mostly in the southwestern core of the Marcellus Shale field in northwest West Virginia and the core of the Utica Shale field in southern Ohio.More importantly, as a supplier/distributor, it's shielded in large part from the volatility involved with the natural gas extraction business.""Overall, midstream guys are doing pretty well and aren't so directly exposed to the vagaries of commodity price movement,"" said Barrett Blaschke, a senior analyst at MUFG Securities Americas.On top of that, parent Antero Resources is hedged through 2019, giving stability and security to its master limited partnership, or MLP, with Antero Midstream. Under the rules, MLPs don't pay any taxes but have to pay out most of their profit through dividends. That makes Antero Midstream one of the stronger names in the Marcellus and Utica shale region.""What we like about the story is the way it interacts with its parent,"" Blaschke said of Antero Midstream.But even when you look at the prospects for natural gas, the outlook is bright. In a report issued recently, the Energy Information Administration said it sees natural gas spot prices rising to an average of $3.12 per million British thermal units next year — up from $2.50 this year — as consumption grows and more gas is exported to Mexico.Further, nearly half of all homes in the U.S. are heated with natural gas during the winter and the EIA said the cleaner burning fuel is expected to account for 34% of all electricity generated in the U.S. this year, topping coal, which will only account for 30%.Antero Midstream was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in Denver. Other key midstream companies in the sector — also offshoots of other companies — include Rice Energy's (RICE) Rice Midstream (RMP), EQT Corporation's (EQT) EQT Midstream (EQM) and Cone Midstream (CNNX), which was formed by Consol Energy (CNX) and Noble Energy (NBL).Antero Midstream's new water business also helps distinguish it from its peers. In hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, water is injected into wells along with sand or another type of stimulant to break free the natural gas or oil trapped in the rocks. In the third quarter, Antero Resources used 43 barrels of water per foot in the Marcellus field, up 35% from 2015 and up 2% from the second quarter.In September 2015, Antero Midstream bought its parent company's integrated water business for $1.05 billion in a deal involving cash and assumed debt. Under the transaction, Antero Midstream gets the exclusive right to provide water for Antero Resources' well-completion operations in West Virginia and Ohio.By the end of 2016, the company will have built 19 more miles of surface pipelines. It also is constructing an advanced wastewater-treatment complex scheduled for completion in late 2017.Erik Stevens, an analyst at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., said profits from water operations has accounted for 35% to 40% of earnings to date and he expects the water business to be ""underappreciated going forward.""""Antero Resources is drilling more (completed wells) and as that ramps up they'll be using more fresh water per lateral foot,"" he said.Antero Midstream also benefits from lower drilling costs at its parent. Antero Resources has cut well costs in the Marcellus field by 36% since 2014 on operational efficiencies from faster drilling and completions, and new contracts set a lower prices. Not only are Antero Resources' fields located near the key cores of the play, they're also situated near large customer bases in the Northeast.IBD'S TAKE: Antero Midstream ranks sixth among companies in IBD's Oil & Gas Transport/Pipeline group with a 90 Composite Rating while KNOT Offshore Partners (KNOP) leads the group. Antero Midstream has closed above its 50-day line since Sept. 30.""Deep proximity to demand centers in the U.S. drive growth of production in the Marcellus and Utica,"" said Brian Brungardt, analyst at Stifel.And while regulations have been a risk for pipeline companies out West — with protesters and law enforcement clashing over Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline project — natural gas pipeline companies aren't seeing too much pushback over operations in the Eastern U.S.Currently 2.5 million miles of pipeline snakes its way through the U.S. to carry oil and natural gas to processing plants and then eventually to homes and businesses. Companies have been seeing approval delays for pipelines by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Brungardt says.In Antero Resources' third-quarter conference call in October, Chief Executive Glen Warren said ""given the current environment today as it relates to pipeline projects, I think many would agree there is significant risk.""But Brungardt downplayed the risk, saying he doesn't see any risk in the near term unless things were delayed significantly.Further approval delays could be a thing of the past after Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election and with a Republican majority in both houses of Congress.In a note dated Nov. 9, Brungardt said he thinks midstream MLPs will get a boost from Trump after market volatility settles. He sees Trump offering ""a more conducive regulatory environment, and the easing of a threat to MLP tax code changes.""One caveat: MLPs could be hit by trade policy changes as Trump has been advocating ""America first"" isolationist policies.Shares of the company have camped out above their 50-day moving average since late September, despite a seven-session losing streak that ended the day before Election Day. Antero Midstream shares ended Friday trading down nearly 2%, but rebounded some of that on Monday and ended the day up more than 1% to 28.25.

209,NBL,"Oil prices have been skidding the past few weeks, which is good news for motorists, but maybe not so good news for shareholders of oil explorers and producers.The industry group is ranked No. 5 out of the 197 groups tracked by IBD, but stocks featured in the Stock Spotlight were down on Monday.Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) dropped nearly 10% to 39.03. The Houston-based company drills in the Eagle Ford shale of South Texas, the Niaobrara formation in Colorado, the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania and the Utica shale in Ohio.It reported Nov. 4 that EPS grew 60% and sales were up 50%, but trading both before and after the report has been more volatile than normal. With Monday's sharp drop, the stock plunged through its 10-week line for the first time since May. It found support at the line twice previously.Analysts are forecasting a 43% increase in earnings this year and a 19% increase in 2014.Whiting Petroleum (WLL) fell 5% to 61.55. It was struggling for support near its 10-week line. Earnings growth has been volatile the past few years. The stock has a five-year Earnings Stability Factor of 73 on a 0 to 99 scale where low numbers correspond to stable growth.After reporting earnings Oct. 23, the stock catapulted 8% to a 52-week high, but has struggled since then.Another oil and gas producer, Noble Energy (NBL), fell 2%. Its decline over the past few weeks has been smoother and less volatile, and it's still riding 2% above its 10-week line.It drills for oil and gas worldwide. In the past two quarters, earnings rose 92% and 137%, but analysts are forecasting a flat quarter in the next report.Its five-year growth rate is only 1%, but its earnings growth is steadier. It has a five-year Earnings Stability Factor of 24. Analysts expect a 31% increase in next year's earnings growth.

210,NBL,"This week, Extraction Oil & Gas (XOG) will become the first exploration and production company go public in two years, while a solar company and an oilfield service provider will also debut along with a cellular network products maker.Extraction is the largest initial public offering of the four, looking to raise $550 million from 33.3 million shares at a price range of 15-18. It will list on the Nasdaq under the ticker XOG, and is scheduled to begin trading Wednesday after pricing tonight.Independence Contract Drilling (ICD) was the last E&P companies to go public, back in August 2014. Centennial Resource Production, an independent E&P in the Southern Delaware Basin, filed for a $100 million IPO in July but was then bought out by Silver Run Acquisition Corporation (SRAQ).Extraction is based in Denver with operations in the Denver-Julesburg Basin.The IPO comes as oil prices hover near year highs after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cut production last month.Noble Midstream Partners (NBLX), a pipeline/transit master limited partnership formed by Noble Energy (NBL), also operates in the same basin and last month became the first energy IPO of the year.Oilfield services provider Mammoth Energy Services is looking to raise $128 million, offering 7.75 million shares at a price range of 15-18. It will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker TUSK, debuting Friday.Mammoth operates in the Utica Shale and Permian Basin. The Permian in west Texas and southeastern New Mexico is the epicenter of low-cost production of U.S. shale oil. Shale exploration and production companies like Diamondback Energy (FANG), Concho Resources (CXO) and Parsley Energy (PE) have focused their spending on resources in that play.IBD's TAKE: While the number of IPO filings have been down this year, there have been plenty of winners in recent months including Acacia Communications and Twilio. Azure Power Global, an Indian low-cost solar power producer, plans to raise $75 million by offering 3.4 million shares, lowered from 6.8 million, at a price range of 21-23. It will list on the NYSE under the ticker AZRE, trading Wednesday.Full Spectrum, which develops and sells products used to create private cellular networks, plans to raise $15 million by offering 1.875 million shares at 7-9 per share. It will list on the Nasdaq under the ticker FMAX but a debut date hasn't been determined yet.RELATED: Snapchat Working On IPO Valuing Company At $25 Billion: ReportCoupa Software Doubles, Giving Another Big Boost To IPO Market

211,NBL,"The oil market could rebalance in the first half of 2017 if OPEC sticks to its production cap deal, but oil prices could fall by nearly 20% if the cartel fails to agree, experts warned Tuesday.""The market – if left to its own devices – may remain in oversupply through the first half of next year. If OPEC sticks to its new target, the market's rebalancing could come faster,"" the International Energy Agency said in a report issued Tuesday.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reached an agreement last month to cap production at 32.5 million-33 million barrels per day, down from the cartel's daily production of 33.2 million barrels a day at the end of August. Details on who will cut and how much will be decided at OPEC's official meeting in November.Analysts at Goldman Sachs (GS), however, wrote in a note Monday: ""Failure to reach such a deal would push prices sharply lower to $43 a barrel in our view as we forecast that the global oil market is in surplus in the (fourth quarter).""Brent crude ended the trading day down 0.7% to $52.49 per barrel. U.S. crude dipped 0.5% to $50.81.OPEC's output rose by 160,000 barrels a day to a record 33.64 million barrels a day last month as Iraq's production hit a new high and Libya's ports reopened.As informal talks continue in Istanbul, oil prices jumped to a year high before falling as analysts question producers' commitment to the deal.Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 0.8% to 87.74 on the stock market today. BP (BP) dropped 2.4% to 35.78. Chevron (CVX) lost 0.9% to 103.04. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) gave back 1.9% to 51.22.But on a positive note, Goldman said U.S. shale production is stabilizing and higher prices if the production cap sticks could allow for ""a rapid ramp-up in production in 2017.""Among top U.S. shale firms, Continental Resources (CLR) flopped by 1.9% to 53.14. Nobel Energy (NBL) dipped 0.8% to 35.74. Diamondback Energy (FANG) edged down 0.4% to 104.84.The IEA said global oil supply rose by 600,000 barrels per day in September, with non-OPEC up supply up 500,000 barrels a day on higher output from Russia and Kazakhstan.But the agency sees non-OPEC supply falling by 900,000 barrels per day this year before rising by 400,000 barrels a day in 2017.Demand expected to rise by 1.2 million barrels a day this year and rise roughly the same next year.IBD'S TAKE: The uptick in oil prices is giving oilfield service providers Baker Hughes, Halliburton and Schlumberger a boost in the stock market.RELATED: Despite OPEC Cut, U.S. Oil May Not Top $50 Ceiling Until Next Year

215,NBL,"Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) is bullish about the Permian Basin and expects the rig count there to explode soon, while French oil giant Total (TOT) is cutting back investment.Pioneer Chief Executive Scott Sheffield told Bloomberg Thursday that 100 oil rigs could be added to the Permian in the next year. He also expects production in the region to grow by 300,000 barrels per day, per year.Last week, oil rigs in the Permian rose by two to 202, representing nearly half the 416 oil rigs in operation across the U.S., according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data.In its September update last week, the Energy Information Agency said production from the Permian will rise by 22,000 barrels a day this month to reach 2 million barrels a day in October.

216,NBL,"U.S. crude futures rose in volatile trade Wednesday morning after government figures showed higher U.S. crude stockpiles, but declining gasoline supplies and lower U.S. oil production. Earlier, Noble Energy (NBL)  and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) reacted to the recent plunge in oil prices.Crude stockpiles rose by 1.4 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said U.S. stockpiles fell by 1.3 million.But EIA also said production fell 0.6% to 8.46 million barrels per day, after rising in the prior week. And gasoline supplies fell by 3.3 million barrels, easing fears of a refined products glut.U.S. futures settled 3.3% higher at $40.83 a barrel. That follows a sharp drop from above $50 around mid-year. London-based Brent futures were up 3.2% at $43.12 a barrel.Meanwhile, before the market open, Noble Energy said it sees less oil production this quarter after a surge in Q2. Occidental Petroleum reduced its own output as it continues to cut back on certain operations, and crude prices tumbled back below $40 a barrel after U.S. crude inventories rose.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. crude's tumble below the key $40 per barrel support has shares of oil majors Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell and others further out of buy range.Noble Energy swung to a 24-cent per-share loss in Q2 from a profit of 26 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts were expecting a loss of 29 cents a share. Revenue rose 16% to $847 million.Noble raised its full-year sales outlook by more than 7% to an average of 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. But for Q3, the company sees sales volumes of 405,000-415,000 barrels per day, down from 427,000 barrels in Q2, when volume jumped 43%.Shares fell 1.2% on the stock market today.Occidental swung to a Q2 loss of 18 cents per share, in line with analysts' views, from a gain of 21 cents per share a year earlier. Revenue fell 27% to $2.56 billion, under views for $2.66 billion.Occidental's production fell to 653,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 657,000 per day in Q1 and 658,000 a year ago, as the company continues to reduce non-core operations in the U.S. and Middle East.""Our strong balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities, including reinvesting in the business, while allowing us to deliver on our commitment of returning cash to our shareholders,"" CEO Vicki Hollub said in a release.But for the year, Occidental sees production growth at the high end of its 4%-6% forecast.Shares rose 1.2%.Continental Resources (CLR) closed up 4.8% at 44.48. But Continental fell slightly late after reporting a wider-than-expected loss.
"
217,NBL,"Continental Resources (CLR), Concho Resources (CXO), Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) and Noble Energy (NBL) raised their production targets Wednesday as costs came down further, but a broader rebound in drilling activity isn't likely until oil prices hit $50.Continental now sees full-year average production of 205,000-215,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, up from its prior outlook of 200,000, citing strong Q1 performance. But that is still down from 2015 average output of 221,715.""The resilience of our production has allowed us to increase our production guidance for 2016 without increasing capex,"" said CEO Harold Hamm. ""This reflects the quality of our assets and the success of our enhanced completion technology.""Continental also brought online a net 10 wells that had been drilled and completed in 2015, but not actively produced until Q1.Shares rose 2% after hours.Concho sees 2016 production to be flat, up from an earlier outlook for a 5% drop to no change. Carrizo increased the low end of its full-year crude production growth target by 9% to 24,800-25,300 barrels per day, up from a prior outlook of 24,700-25,300 barrels per day. But that is still down from Q1 production of 25,806 barrels per day, up 21%, and 2015 output of 36,719 barrels.“Well-cost expectations in the Eagle Ford are now down to $4.1 million from $4.6 million previously,” said Carrizo CEO Chip Johnson in the earnings release. “This has allowed us to increase our activity in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford Shale without increasing our planned capex for the year.”Noble, meanwhile, raised its 2016 sales volume target to 405,000 barrels a day from a prior outlook of 390,000 barrels, which was essentially flat vs. 2015 after adjusting for the Rosetta acquisition.The company said total well costs fell 35% in Q1 in the Wells Ranch portion of the DJ Basin in Colorado.Jason Wangler, a managing director at Wunderlich, said that most companies gave low production guidance in Q4 in the hopes of beating it.“They kind of put out numbers that if you looked at the forecasts you thought this production is really going to fall off a cliff,"" he said. ""They did this under the belief that they’ll put out a low number to start and hopefully top that and just take one beating instead of four or five in a row.”Other companies haven't signaled an increase drilling activity. Diamondback Energy (FANG) said it wasn’t going to remove a rig it had scheduled for removal. Sanchez Energy (SN) has said it was running two rigs but cut it to one rig in Q2. Pioneer Resources (PXD) said last week it would add five to ten drilling rigs when oil hits $50.Wangler believes that companies won’t increase activity, including finishing drilled but uncompleted (DUCs) wells, until oil hits $50-$55 per barrel.Mark Hanson, an equity analyst at Morningstar agrees. “On the whole prices just haven’t risen to levels that would incentivize E&Ps to ramp up production.”He thinks U.S. crude would have to be at $50 for at least two quarters before companies would even think about boosting production not just seeing a short-term rise from an event like an OPEC meeting or supply disruption due to violence in the Middle East.Meanwhile, shale producers continued to see falling revenue in Q1.Continental’s Q1 adjusted per-share loss widened to 41 cents from 9 cents a year ago. Analysts were expecting a 37-cent per-share loss. Revenue from crude oil and natgas sales fell 30.7% to $403.6 million, below views of $441.22 million.Concho swung to an adjust loss of 5 cents a share, missing views for a break-even quarter, as revenue sank 31% to $283.6 million.Carizzo's adjusted Q1 earnings rose 14.3% to 16 cents per share, above the 13 cents Wall Street analysts were expecting. Revenue fell 11.2% to $132.4 million, under views for $123.4 million.Shares closed down 1.2%  in the stock market today. Oil gave up gains following the Energy Information Administration’s report that crude stockpiles climbed by 2.8 million barrels last week, above views for a 1.7 million barrel increase, though production fell 1.3% to 8.825 million barrels per day.Noble swung to a loss of 53 cents per share in Q1 vs. a year earlier, but it beat analysts’ views of a 57-cent per-share loss. Revenue fell 4.6% to $724 million, falling short of views for $784.5 million.Capital expenditures were $374 million, below the company’s expectation, and it sees full-year capex under its original $1.5 billion estimate.“Significant capital efficiency gains and outstanding operating performance, combined with robust liquidity, position us well in any price scenario,” CEO David Stover said in the earnings release.Noble shares rose 1.1%.Late Monday, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) said that its adjusted Q1 loss deepened to $1.12 a share, but that beat views for a loss of $1.16. Anadarko’s revenue sank 28% to $1.67 billion, below views of $1.81 billion. But sales volumes in the Delaware Basin of west Texas rose by 47%. In the DJ Basin of northeastern Colorado, sales rose 11%.

218,NBL,"After crude rose nearly 50% over the last six weeks, Deutsche Bank raised the price targets of Apache (APA) and ConocoPhillips (COP) on Tuesday but lowered Exxon Mobil’s (XOM) and Marathon Oil’s (MRO).In a ""heat check,"" Deutsche analysts said that cash flows improved by 9% or $6 billion since the start of 2016 in the integrated oil group.""We view the rise in price as constructive for balance sheets, though many areas of operation onshore (in the) U.S. remain below breakeven at $40/bbl, limiting activity increase in the near term,"" the analysts wrote in the note.Deutsche raised Apache’s price target to 53 from 50, Conoco’s to 62 from 55 and EOG Resources’ (EOG) to 85 from 83.Apache shares closed up 0.3% to 48.56 in the stock market today. Conoco shares dipped 0.15% to 39.62. EOG shares rose 1.2% to 75.45.But Deutsche Bank lowered Anadarko Petroleum’s (APC) price target to 58 from 60 and Devon Energy’s (DVN) to 32 from 48. The analysts also cut Marathon's to 18 from 19 and Exxon's to 82 from 85, along with Noble Energy’s (NBL) to 41 from 42.Exxon Mobil ticked up 0.4% to 84.53. Anadarko shares rose 1.3% to 46.23. Devon shares rose 1% to 26.09. Noble shares gained 1.2% to 30.05. Marathon shares added 2.4% to 10.40.The analysts believe that EOG's biggest risk is ""execution on its growth programs in both the Eagle Ford and Bakken (shale plays).""

219,NBL,"Oil prices may finally be poised for recovery, the International Energy Agency said Friday, but other analysts warned that oil may fall again and must climb about 50% from current levels before U.S. production starts to ramp up.The IEA noted that prices have rallied recently and cautioned that it shouldn’t be seen as a definitive sign the worst is over. But the energy watchdog added, “there are signs that prices might have bottomed out,” and pointed to OPEC and non-OPEC output declines as well as a weaker-than-expected production from Iran.“For prices, there may be light at the end of what has been a long, dark tunnel, but we cannot be precisely sure when in 2017 the oil market will achieve the much-desired balance,” the IEA continued.In a note Friday, Goldman Sachs said it sees Q2 oil prices of $25-$45 a barrel, up from a $20-$40 range in Q1.Brent crude futures rose 0.8% to $40.39 per barrel, and U.S. crude climbed 1.7% to $38.50. Baker Hughes (BHI) also said Friday that the U.S. oil rig count fell by six this week to 386, while the combined oil and gas rig count dropped to the lowest on record.But James Williams, a WTRG energy economist, expects oil to dip again between now and June, before ""the recovery really starts.""He said the recent increase in oil prices was only due to hopes that a possible meeting this month of top producers will lead to an output freeze. But even then, such a freeze won't solve the fundamental problem of excess supply and slowing demand, he added.And prices would have to get close to $60 per barrel before U.S. production returns to growth, Williams said. At $50 per barrel, ""quite a bit"" of production could come back online but only enough to maintain U.S. production.Even with a sustained rebound in prices, a rebound in U.S. production may be slow to come. Last month, EOG Resources (EOG) Chairman Bill Thomas said at an industry conference that his company won't rush to boost output right after oil hits $60 a barrel.""We’re going to make sure the market is in good shape, it’s balanced, and we’ve got a future,"" he said, according to Bloomberg. ""We don’t want to ramp it up and drive the price of oil down again.""Meanwhile, Apache (APA) has said it could match 2015's North American production rate if oil averaged $45 during 2016. And Whiting Petroleum (WLL) said it would consider completing some wells in the Bakken shale formation if oil hit $40-$45.For now, production is falling. The IEA said OPEC production fell by 90,000 barrels a day last month due to lower production from Iraq, Nigeria and the United Arab Emirates.Non-OPEC production also fell by 90,000 barrels a day in February, and the IEA sees production outside the cartel falling by 750,000 barrels a day this year, with U.S. output down nearly 530,000 barrels per day.Oil majors like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as shale companies like Continental Resources (CLR) and Noble Energy (NBL) have slashed capital expenditure plans, weighing on the production outlook this year.Meanwhile, Iran’s output increased by 220,000 barrels a day in February as sanctions for Tehran’s nuclear program were lifted in January.But Iran’s return to the market ""has been less dramatic than the Iranians said it would be,"" the IEA said, adding that ""it appears that Iran’s return will be gradual.""Members of OPEC, as well as top oil producers outside OPEC, plan to meet in Moscow on March 20 to discuss freezing output. But the meeting is on shaky ground as Iran hasn’t said it would participate in the talks and wants an exemption from the freeze because production in January remained well below historic levels.Even if a deal can be reached, the IEA doesn’t think it would affect the supply-and-demand balance in the first half of this year.And even if producers eventually agree to go beyond an output freeze, Goldman Sachs said any cut in OPEC production would be ""self-defeating,"" as shale oil could come back online quickly and push prices down again.Goldman also warned that U.S. oil inventory is expected to grow though April, and the risk remains high of ""storage saturation""  pushing oil prices sharply lower in coming weeks.Chevron shares closed up 0.7% in the stock market today.

220,NBL,"Chevron (CVX) announced capital spending cuts for the next two years at an analyst meeting Tuesday, while also reiterating the importance of keeping its dividend.The integrated energy giant plans to spend $26.6 billion this year but just $17 billion-$22 billion a year in 2017 and 2018. Last year, the company said it might have to cut capex to as low as $20 million in 2017 and 2018.However, CEO John Watson again spoke of the importance of keeping the company’s dividend intact, even as oil prices stay lower for longer.“We’re completing major projects that have been under construction for several years. This enables us to grow production and reduce spending at the same time, which should improve our net cash flow significantly,” Watson said in the release.Chevron shares closed down 2.1% in the stock market today.Top oil companies have vowed to protect their dividends during the downturn in oil prices so as to keep investors happy. They are hesitant to lose investors if they plan to do a follow-up stock offering.Last week, rival Exxon Mobil (XOM) reiterated plans to cut 2016 capex by 25% to $23.2 billion but similarly said it will focus on paying a larger dividend.But last month, ConocoPhillips (COP) slashed its dividend by 66% and trimmed its 2016 capital expenditure outlook by 17% vs. a prior view in December.Anadarko Petroleum (APC) and Noble Energy (NBL) have also cut their dividends to save cash.Anadarko shares plunged 8.8% Tuesday, and Noble fell 6%. Conoco lost 6.7%, and Exxon dipped 2.2%.Chevron also said Tuesday that it had started production at its Gorgon LNG project in Australia this week and would begin shipping next week.Image provided by Shutterstock.

222,NBL,"Shale companies have issued another round of steep capital spending cuts, suggesting the industry may be cutting investment by even more than expected with oil prices near $30 a barrel.Hess Corp. (HES) on Tuesday announced a 2016 E&P capital and exploratory budget of $2.4 billion, down 40% from 2015 and 20%below  its earlier 2016 guidance issued in October. Full year oil and gas production is expected to be at 330,000-350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day vs. 2015 production of 368,000 barrels of oil equivalent.""In response to the current low oil price environment, we have significantly decreased our 2016 capital and exploratory expenditures and we plan to reduce activity at all of our producing assets. Moreover, we will continue to pursue further cost reductions and efficiency gains across our portfolio,"" said COO Greg Hill in a release.On Wednesday Hess reported a loss of $1.40 per share, 7 cents above analyst estimates, its first quarterly loss since 2002. But revenue fell 45% to $1.39 billion, under views. Production rose 4% to 358,000 barrels per oil a day.Hess shares rose 3.3% to 35.99 in morning trading in the stock market today.Late Tuesday Continental Resources (CLR)  said it would cut its 2016 spending budget by 66% to $920 million to save cash. It also plans to cut 2016 oil output by 10% to 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.The company plans to spend most of its 2016 budget in the Bakken shale with Oklahoma's SCOOP formation receiving the second-largest budget.  Continental Resources said it would not be profitable until oil returns to $37.Continental shares fell 2.5% to 18.37.Late Tuesday, Noble Energy (NBL) issued its 2016 capital spending budget at $1.5 billion, 50% less than spending in 2015, pro forma for the acquisition of Rosetta Resources. Noble also cut its Q4 cash dividend by 44% to  10 cents per common share.Noble shares dipped 0.1% to 28.74.But others in the energy sector are focused on keeping their dividends to keep investors happy. Oil majors ConocoPhillips (COP), Chevron (CVX) and others have said they would keep their dividends despite crashing oil prices.Oil prices fell Wednesday as U.S. crude inventories rose by 8.38 million barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration, more than double what analysts had expected. Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute estimated inventories leapt by 11.4 million barrels.

Often, that means the stock is poised for further gains.Align Technology soared 26% to a record high in massive volume on Oct. 18 after the maker of invisible dental braces reported that third-quarter profit climbed 62% from a year earlier. It was the biggest gain in five quarters and far exceeded Wall Street estimates.The stock has since eased but remains just 5% off its high. Meanwhile, volume on the pullback has been weak, a sign that big funds haven't participated in the selling.NIC has shown similar action. The provider of website development services to state and local governments jumped 8% to a new high on Oct. 18, clearing a 23.76 buy point. Volume was more than triple its daily average.Since then, the thinly traded stock has trended lower in light volume, but it remains just 4% off its high and remains within the 5% limit that defines a buy area.Meanwhile, Ocwen Financial (OCN) is just 2% off a record high hit last week when the stock jumped 6% for the week after reversing off its 10-week moving average.Ocwen Financial, which buys and services mortgage loans, is the top stock in the highly rated Finance-Mortgage & Related industry group. The stock is extended from its rebound off the 10-week line.A pair of oil and gas stocks have also outperformed after soaring to new highs on Oct. 24.Noble Energy (NBL) and Whiting Petroleum (WLL) have continued to hit new highs after their big price spikes, though both reversed lower after testing new peaks Wednesday.Noble enjoys a best-possible A+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, indicating strong demand for the shares.
"
272,NBL,"Having a laser-sharp focus in business is an important element of success. And for Cabot Oil & Gas, its focus on the Marcellus Shale has paid off handsomely.
"
273,NBL,"Not only is the Houston-based oil and gas explorer and producer reaping results this year from the Pennsylvania shale, it's also expected to have excess cash flow in 2014.
"
274,NBL,"The company will then need to decide what to do with the free cash flow: issuing a dividend increase, repurchasing shares, exploring new ventures or accelerating development of existing acreage positions. That's a good problem to have.
"
275,NBL,"About 95% of Cabot's (COG) production comes from the Marcellus Shale, where the company has a 200,000-net-acre position from which it generates natural gas. The remaining 5% comes from Texas-based Eagle Ford, where the company has been drilling for oil.
"
276,NBL,"Cabot's management believes the Marcellus Shale could yield more than 3,000 potential drilling locations over time. This translates into a 25-year inventory and production rates of 44% to 54% in 2013 and 30% to 50% in 2014.
"
277,NBL,"""I'm pretty bullish on the Marcellus, which is the heart of this company,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Robert Christensen. ""Natural gas is going to be developed by this company over the next 20 years.""
"
278,NBL,"He cites several factors that will put the company in an advantageous position. ""It's going to be the lowest-cost, largest natural gas play ever to be had in the U.S.""
"
279,NBL,"The nation's energy outlook has been improving. In October the Energy Information Administration estimated that the U.S. will be the top producer of petroleum and natural gas hydrocarbons combined this year, passing Russia and Saudi Arabia. Tuesday, the International Energy Agency's calculations pegged the U.S. as leader in oil output in 2015, two years earlier than expected.
"
280,NBL,"The Right Rocks
"
281,NBL,"One of the contributing factors to low-cost production is the quality of the rock, which absorbs more natural gas than in other areas of the U.S. Cabot ""chose the rocks that really make a difference,"" Christensen noted.
"
282,NBL,"Another factor is the increased efficiencies that Cabot is able to realize in the area. Technological improvements as well as better gathering, processing and transporting of natgas allow Cabot to have a lower cost structure than its competitors have.
"
283,NBL,"Thanks to the company's extensive experience in the region and improved technology, it's been able to reduce drill times from 22-25 days to 12-15 days, noted Global Hunter Securities analyst Curtis Trimble.
"
284,NBL,"""If you look at the behavior of the stock, it's been amongst the best performers for the past year and a half, and that's despite a very challenging natural gas price environment,"" said Trimble, speaking of stocks in his energy coverage area.
"
285,NBL,"""Cabot has done an excellent job of lining up transport capacity and contracts for gas, and this has allowed them to retain a more resilient price basis than many of the competitors in the Marcellus,"" Trimble said.
"
286,NBL,"Cabot stock is up 36% this year through Wednesday, but in recent weeks has been trading off a high above 40 that it notched in early September.
"
287,NBL,"During the last five reported quarters, the company's earnings per share have grown between 22% and 667% and revenue has improved between 13% and 69%. Cabot's third-quarter report, delivered Oct. 24, showed a 64% EPS gain to 18 cents on sales up 47%, to $435.9 million.
"
288,NBL,"Industry Group Performs
"
289,NBL,"Cabot is the ninth largest by market capitalization in the 102-company Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production industry group. This group, whose largest constituents are EOG Resources (EOG), Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Noble Energy (NBL) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), is ranked No. 6 in performance of 197 that IBD tracks. It's up 38% year to date through Wednesday, but like Cabot is trading off its highs.
"
290,NBL,"Cabot recently divested some minor assets in Oklahoma and Texas so it could further streamline operations and focus on only the best areas.
"
291,NBL,"The company expects to have 100 net wells in the Marcellus region this year and 130 to 140 net wells next year. It will have seven rigs in Marcellus and two in Eagle Ford in 2014. Eagle Ford drilling should result in 30-35 net wells in 2013 and 40-50 net wells next year.
"
292,NBL,"Cash Is Coming In
"
293,NBL,"Analysts forecast that Cabot will generate $1.1 billion in operating cash flow in 2013, which should fund all or nearly all of the firm's capital investment requirements. In 2014, Cabot is estimated to produce $1.6 billion in operating cash flow, of which some $300 million will be in excess.
"
294,NBL,"The company will then be evaluating potential uses for the extra cash. It has a $10 million share repurchase authorization and it could also increase or offer a special dividend. It did this in July, when it doubled its dividend and announced a 2-for-1 stock split.
"
295,NBL,"Drilling, Moving, Selling
"
296,NBL,"Cabot's midstream operations also have been improving. The company's gas marketing has transportation contracts and long-term sales agreements with durations of eight to 15 years on many pipelines that provide access to various markets, wrote Barclays Capital analyst Jeffrey Robertson in a research report. Cabot currently transports gas on three interstate pipelines and there could be others in future years.
"
297,NBL,"It also established a partnership with Williams Cos. (WMB) to build gathering, dehydration and compression infrastructure to bring gas to the interstate pipelines.
"
298,NBL,"""Low-cost production is marketable and when it's abundant, it's more marketable,"" Christensen said. Having access to power plants, committing your gas long-term to an interstate pipeline or to industrial facilities "". . . to the extent you have that long-term supply and to the extent it's low cost, you have an edge in moving your gas out of the region.""
"
299,NBL,"Some of the risks for Cabot's business include natgas prices and the quality of the free cash flow reinvestment choices next year. However, Christensen believes that the price pressure risk is overdone. He noted that the company's marketing force is very strong and that a lot of action is taking place behind the scenes, to do with the infrastructure and improving access via various pipelines.
"
300,NBL,"Management has improved significantly over the past several years, analysts say.
"
301,NBL,"""When CEO Dan Dinges came in, Cabot was not perceived amongst the highest-quality operators,"" Trimble said. ""I think what you see is a company willing to take their lessons learned and apply those."" The evolution of the quality profile of the company ""very much has mimicked the massive increase in shareholder value,"" Trimble said. ""I don't think they'd get to where they are in terms of share price without a very high-quality level of execution.""Having a laser-sharp focus in business is an important element of success.

"
304,NBL,"Oil and gas explorer and producer Continental Resources (CLR) is once again at the forefront of technological innovation and advancement.
"
305,NBL,"The Oklahoma City-based company isn't afraid to go after the higher-hanging fruit in the North Dakota Bakken Shale formation. As the Middle Bakken zone is starting to mature, Continental Resources is now leading the way in the lower Three Forks formation.
"
306,NBL,"The firm is the sixth-biggest by market cap in IBD's Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration and Production industry group, after EOG Resources (EOG), Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), Devon Energy (DVN) and Noble Energy (NBL).
"
307,NBL,"Continental, however, is the largest leaseholder in the Bakken area, operating 22 rigs across some 1.2 million net acres in the Williston Basin. The company is also the largest and the most active driller in the area, drilling about 300 net wells in 2013.
"
308,NBL,"Cooking At Three Forks
"
309,NBL,"As the largest producer, Continental derives about 65% of its total production from the Bakken play.
"
310,NBL,"""If you think of the Williston Basin as a layer cake, you have the Middle Bakken — the main area that everyone was focused on at first,"" said Paul Grigel, analyst at Macquarie Research. Below that, there is an area called the Three Forks, which has four different benches. The first bench has proven to be very prospective across a large acreage swath for much of the industry, he says.
"
311,NBL,"""The area where Continental is really leading the way is on the testing of the lower Three Forks benches,"" Grigel said. ""There are some other industry peers who are testing various benches there, but Continental has the most thorough program to go through in both the second and third benches, and testing a couple of wells in the fourth bench.""
"
312,NBL,"Continental plans to drill 20 wells this year to test the commercial productivity of the three lowest benches. As of the end of the last quarter, it had finished 13 wells.
"
313,NBL,"""We see oil there (in those deeper benches); we see the appropriate rock type that we think we can drill horizontal wells in and fracture stimulate. That program is about two-thirds of the way,"" said Continental President Rick Bott. ""Results have been pretty much according to plan. We think we have proven now about a 3,800-square-mile area within the overall 15,000 to 18,000-square-mile area that's productive in the Middle Bakken.
"
314,NBL,"""That is essentially helping the industry see that there is much more oil there to be gotten out at commercial rates than was previously thought. And that's not in a lot of estimates of the basin capacity.""
"
315,NBL,"Refining Some Techniques
"
316,NBL,"Another initiative Continental has undertaken in the Bakken Shale formation is downspacing. In downspacing, the company drills more wells in the same acreage area, thus increasing production.
"
317,NBL,"Continental applies what it calls an ""appraisal approach"": It tries to determine how far apart the wells need to be to try to maximize oil that can come out of the rock.
"
318,NBL,"""After we get those results, we are going to do some more of these types of programs into 2014 and then probably if you look onward into 2015, we'll be taking all that knowledge and going into fulfilled development,"" said Bott.
"
319,NBL,"Continental also has been using innovative techniques to cut costs and produce oil more efficiently.
"
320,NBL,"By using what the company calls an ECO-pad, it is able to drill four wells from a single drilling pad in the same smaller area. After drilling the well, instead of having to disassemble and haul the rig to a new area, the ECO-pad walks from one hole to the next on hydraulic feet.
"
321,NBL,"Not only is this technique more ecologically friendly with less impact on local farmers, but it also reduces costs, due to time savings and having less surface infrastructure.
"
322,NBL,"""Think of it as buying in bulk,"" said Grigel. ""They've done a good job in 2013 of reducing costs on the per-well cost front and that's something they want to continue to focus on in 2014."" Grigel estimates the per-well cost savings to be 5% in 2014 from this technology.
"
323,NBL,"Another promising area is the SCOOP, or the South Central Oklahoma Oil Province. Continental has 277,000 net acres prospective in the area.
"
324,NBL,"Sideways In The SCOOP
"
325,NBL,"The company is addressing the area with horizontal wells with the goal of unlocking value.
"
326,NBL,"""They've shown some interesting results there. I think it's an area they're still working to understand as well as investors,"" said Grigel.
"
327,NBL,"Continental is investing 15% of capital in the SCOOP this year and the company plans to allocate 25% of its budget in 2014.
"
328,NBL,"In addition to the cost savings that come from using the ECO-pad, Continental also increased efficiencies in drilling and completion of wells and worked out transportation bottlenecks. It is currently using rail in addition to pipelines to transport oil.
"
329,NBL,"The company also has shown strong capital discipline. Even though it has been outspending its cash flow due to continued capital expenditures, the rate of the outspending has slowed. Continental's credit was recently upgraded to investment grade by Standard & Poor's Rating Services.
"
330,NBL,"Quarterly earnings grew at a strong double-digit rate in the past eight quarters, with significant acceleration in the past three. Revenue growth has slowed down in recent quarters.
"
331,NBL,"In the second quarter, earnings per share were up 96% from a year ago to $1.33 as revenue rose 10% to $1.1 billion.
"
332,NBL,"Pushing Ahead Production
"
333,NBL,"The company has set its 2014 production target to between 26% and 32% growth, in line with analyst estimates. It plans to have 400 net well completions, a 22% year-over-year increase. Capital expenditures are expected to be $4.05 billion.
"
334,NBL,"CEO Harold Hamm, who is Continental's founder, and his family hold a 74% controlling interest in the company's stock.
"
335,NBL,"Risks for Continental include the level of oil prices as well as risks associated with exploration of unknown areas. Investors will be watching further developments in the downspacing and the Three Forks area, noted Grigel.
"
336,NBL,"""It's an interesting story and they're certainly one of the leaders in the Williston Basin,"" added Grigel. ""I think they're going to keep pressing forward with new concepts. It's an exciting time to be an investor or a company who is operating in the Williston Basin.""

"
349,NBL,"Oil-and-gas exploration and biotech stocks continue to dominate the list of 20 leading big-cap stocks, but a few others are near buy points. Discovery Communications (DISCA), which operates TV channels such as Discovery, TLC and Animal Planet, is just below an 89.68 flat-base buy point. The pattern is third-stage, which tends to be riskier than those in earlier stages. Also,…
"
350,NBL,"There are two keys to Frank Caruso's investment strategy.
"
351,NBL,"First, the lead manager of $2 billion AllianceBernstein Large Cap Growth directs his team to seek what he calls dynamic gaps.
"
352,NBL,"Those gaps are big differences between how fast Caruso's team expects a stock's earnings to grow and Wall Street's consensus expectation.
"
353,NBL,"The second key is where Caruso has his team look for that gap: four to five years out.
"
354,NBL,"Caruso is adamant about avoiding a focus on the near term.
"
355,NBL,"This approach had the fund up 32.46% this year through Nov. 30. That topped 78% of its large-cap growth peers, which averaged 29.96%. The S&P 500 was up 29.12%.
"
356,NBL,"Over the past three years the fund's average annual gain is 18.14% vs. 15.70% for its peer group and 17.73% for the big-cap bogey.
"
357,NBL,"Caruso, age 57, discussed his investment process with IBD from his office in Manhattan.
"
358,NBL,"IBD: How does your search for leading stocks differ from other growth investors'?
"
359,NBL,"Caruso: We think of equities generally (in terms of) a combination of growth and capital returns in the form of dividends and share buybacks, which support the valuations of equities over a long period.
"
360,NBL,"And we take a long-duration approach to investment opportunities. But most growth investors are dangerously focused on the moment, growth in the short term. We try to exploit this phenomenon where not a lot of analytical work is being done four to five years out.
"
361,NBL,"IBD: Give me some examples that show how your tack works, please.
"
362,NBL,"Caruso: In the spring of 2012, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) missed a couple of months of sales estimates and the stock was crushed. It went from about 440 to 230 a share. But our research let us be marginal buyers in that lurch. We were confident in the caliber of management. We bought a distressed stock in a great long-term franchise (between May and July 2012 between 380 and 400). Later, they began to execute and sales improved. (We added to our position) through the beginning of October 2012 at prices between 284 and 330.
"
363,NBL,"IBD: Is Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) another example? You added a big chunk to your stake a few quarters ago.
"
364,NBL,"Caruso: They have a great core competency in technologies that are increasingly desired by clients: in the cloud and in mobility. It's been growing in the high teens and low 20s for years. It has no debt, and it has excess cash.
"
365,NBL,"After putting up a strong quarter, they got caught up in the immigration debate. They rely on a lot of foreign visas to conduct their business. The stock went down about 25% in a heartbeat.
"
366,NBL,"That was an opportunity for us to reload. In the spring of 2012 we started initiating. The stock broke down into the high 50s (from 78). We met with Cognizant managers for three or four hours, and we left convinced they still had a great business and plan. The stock moved higher. The immigration debate percolated, and we bought in the 60s. Now it's in the 90s.
"
367,NBL,"IBD: Are you looking for investment opportunities created by the prospect of the Federal Reserve tapering its bond buys?
"
368,NBL,"Caruso: We don't try to overthink the macro environment. So our marching orders to our analysts are to focus on company fundamentals.
"
369,NBL,"But when (Fed Chairman Ben) Bernanke started the tapering discussion, after having underperformed the broad market and value in particular the prior 12 to 15 months, growth securities started to do well. So the market response to tapering seems to have catalyzed a shift on the margin to growth stocks.
"
370,NBL,"IBD: Is that because growth stocks tend to have more foreign exposure?
"
371,NBL,"Caruso: Yes, growth stocks generally have a little more exposure to foreign earnings growth. And U.S. value stocks have more exposure to, let's say, earnings that are fueled by Federal Reserve stimulus steps. This is speculation on my part, but the discussion regarding tapering might auger well for future growth stock performance.
"
372,NBL,"IBD: Computer services, software and systems are your largest category of holdings at 12.36% of assets. Why do you expect good things from them?
"
373,NBL,"Caruso: Cognizant is one, with close to a 4% weighting. The portfolio is built around companies like that and Google (GOOG). We think of Priceline (PCLN) as a service company. Some people think of it as a technology company.
"
374,NBL,"Ansys (ANSS) is an engineering simulation software company. People think of this as a company that benefits from innovation.
"
375,NBL,"In the old days, you had a team of engineers design a new product, build mockups, then software would run calculations that tested stress characteristics. It was on the tail end of the innovation. And it might take weeks to run those simulations.
"
376,NBL,"Today you can run millions of simulations before you even get to the real engineering side of things.
"
377,NBL,"IBD: Biotech is your second-largest industry group, with 5.45% of assets. Why are you focused there?
"
378,NBL,"Caruso: Biotech came out of a very long, severe stock price underperformance. Now we're seeing far greater pipeline productivity emerging from a couple of leaders. We've centered our investments on Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead (GILD). Each is in a different area of disease management.
"
379,NBL,"Biogen has been mostly a multiple sclerosis story. They've come to market with a new oral medicine called Tecfidera, which has experienced one of the most unbelievably successful product launches in pharmacology history. But (investors) have been so focused on MS that they haven't paid attention to some of the products that are in development.
"
380,NBL,"There is a hemophilia product (Eloctate) that we expect to launch in mid-next year. It has the opportunity to take share from Baxter (BAX) and drive growth. And there's upside left for Tecfidera for a long time to come.
"
381,NBL,"Gilead is basically an HIV and hepatitis C story. It has new product launches on the horizon. We expect Gilead to remain dominant in HIV in the near- to midterm. Their hepatitis C portfolio is starting to contribute meaningfully to corporate growth.
"
382,NBL,"Celgene is a multiple myeloma story, a cancer story. We see expanding use of the marketplace.
"
383,NBL,"All of these companies were coming off of pretty conservative valuations for the kind of growth we envision them experiencing for the next couple of years.
"
384,NBL,"IBD: Why did you trim your Facebook (FB) stake recently? You could not have foreseen the pullback that began in mid-October.
"
385,NBL,"Caruso: The stock had an amazing run after reporting Q2 earnings. They demonstrated great acceleration in their mobility business, which people got excited about. The stock doubled in a short time.
"
386,NBL,"We made a meaningful reduction in exposure in that euphoria. It had become close to 3% of the portfolio. So we cut our position roughly in half. It is roughly 1.5% today.
"
387,NBL,"Their 20% fall? The stock had gone up the day they reported earnings. Then management talked about the need to spend more on investing in people and their product. A lot of highly valued, high-growth companies have seen similar price corrections.
"
388,NBL,"I'm comfortable owning the stock. At the right price, we're getting back in.
"
389,NBL,"IBD: Michael Kors (KORS) is relatively new for you. Are you concerned that earnings-per-share growth has sharply decelerated in recent quarters?
"
390,NBL,"Caruso: We're always concerned about decelerating growth rates. But Kors' decline is to a less-than-extraordinary level. That's still better than a lot of companies. The stock is reasonably valued for the kind of growth we envision. They have opportunities in Europe and elsewhere overseas. Kors is seen as differentiated here and overseas.
"
391,NBL,"IBD: Any surprise to Starbucks' (SBUX) accelerating EPS growth?
"
392,NBL,"Caruso: No. They're just an unbelievable company. They're one of the few that has been able to consistently reinvent themselves. They've done a brilliant job of expanding their product offerings in small footprint stores, in being first to market in using new technologies to connect to their customers and their rewards programs are best in their class.
"
393,NBL,"IBD: Precision Castparts (PCP) is up this year, but you've done some trimming. What are your concerns?
"
394,NBL,"Caruso: They are persistent in acquiring businesses that let them leverage their own infrastructure. And they're an important supplier to Boeing (BA) on the 787. They generate about $10 million of content on every 787 that Boeing ships. Part of our reduction is that we own both companies. If we sell, it probably will be out of Boeing. Precision has lagged Boeing, so Precision has more upside.
"
395,NBL,"IBD: Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is way down this year. Yet you've added to your position in some recent quarters. Are you still optimistic?
"
396,NBL,"Caruso: This has been the most disappointing stock in the portfolio in 2013. The interest we had was centered on the uniqueness of their business. There are no competitors at their scale. Robotic surgery is here to stay and will continue to grow.
"
397,NBL,"Procedure growth continues to expand at a midteen clip year over year. The issue with execution relates to installation sales, which has slowed, especially in the U.S.
"
398,NBL,"We expect a couple more tough quarters. Procedure growth will continue in the 16% area. There's no competition. Unbelievably high margins, big share buyback, no debt. Hopefully, it will be a contrary growth stock that recovers.
"
399,NBL,"IBD: Are you concerned that LinkedIn's (LNKD) EPS growth has slowed for two quarters?
"
400,NBL,"Caruso: They've brought a new (advertising product for mobile devices) to market. It will help their growth rate re-accelerate into next year. Like we did with Facebook, we made decent sales in the summer on the market euphoria around this stock. We're more interested in finding a price to re-engage LinkedIn than Facebook.
"
401,NBL,"We think of it as a core holding, a business that's tough to replicate due to their network effect and LinkedIn managers who think of this as a business and want it to be profitable. It's a good business that is richly valued. It will grow into that. So getting the entry and trim points right is important.
"
402,NBL,"IBD: Noble Energy's (NBL) EPS growth has soared the past two quarters. But tumbling crude oil prices have doused energy producer stocks' spark lately. This stock has pulled back about 10% since Oct. 30. Why stick with it?
"
403,NBL,"Caruso: Noble is one of the best-positioned energy companies by way of its fracking inventory. Overseas — in Israel and Africa — they have unbelievable reserves. And they are really good operators, really focused on creating value.
"
404,NBL,"Energy firms are more volatile than what we typically engage, but this company's assets are special.
"
405,NBL,"We've seen a reduction in underlying commodity prices, so we would welcome an opportunity to buy some of this back, make it larger in the portfolio. It's not quite at a point where we would start buying it back.
"
406,NBL,"IBD: What's the biggest change you've made since taking this fund's helm in February 2012?
"
407,NBL,"Caruso: Basically, our perception of growth is linked to a company's ability to create long-term value. So our focus is further forward than many other investors' focus is. It's more on the economics of business and profitability than on the hunt for earnings growth, which is sometimes very episodic. We're still looking for opportunities in large-cap growth. But we're focused on the longer term.
"
408,NBL,"IBD: What was the fund's prior time horizon?
"
409,NBL,"Caruso: I can't say, but it was probably more consistent with most growth managers'. Annual turnover in growth portfolios is often 100% to 150%. We're trying to do closer to 50%. We want great franchises that have the ability to win over a very long time. I tell my analysts I want them to understand how companies are competitively differentiated. I don't want them spending their time trying to anticipate when a bad business is a good stock.There are two keys to Frank Caruso's investment strategy.First, the lead manager of $2 billion AllianceBernstein Large Cap Growth directs his team to seek what he calls dynamic gaps.Those gaps are big differences between how fast Caruso's team expects a stock's earnings to grow and Wall Street's consensus expectation.The second key is where Caruso has his team look for that gap: four to five years out.Caruso is adamant about avoiding a focus on the near term.This approach had the fund up 32.46% this year through Nov. 30.

"
410,NBL,"When you think of Texas-based oil companies, you probably don't think of deepwater rigs in faraway places like Malta, Equatorial Guinea, Australia or Thailand.
"
411,NBL,"Then again, Atwood Oceanics (ATW) isn't your typical Texas oil company. For one thing, it doesn't drill on land. For another, only a tiny portion of its revenue, about 5%, comes from the U.S. Most of its business is centered in the South Pacific or off the coast of West Africa.
"
412,NBL,"Atwood specializes in the drilling and completion of exploratory and developmental oil and gas wells. Its fleet of 13 rigs includes semisubmersibles, deepwater drillships and jack-up rigs. It also has three ultra-deepwater drillships under construction.
"
413,NBL,"The company maintains offices on five continents and boasts a multinational workforce of 1,200 people. It makes money by charging day rates to oil companies for using its rigs. Its biggest clients include Chevron (CVX), Noble Energy (NBL) and Kosmos Energy (KOS).
"
414,NBL,"Heavy demand for oil in many global markets has pushed day rates to a range of $550,000 to $600,000 a day, well above the historical norm.
"
415,NBL,"Competitive Advantage
"
416,NBL,"These high rates have led to an expansion of the number of fleets on the water. Although this means more competition for Atwood, the company has a number of advantages over most other drillers, analysts say.
"
417,NBL,"""Among offshore drillers, Atwood is one of the companies that is better positioned to take advantage of current conditions,"" said Ian Macpherson, an analyst at Simmons & Co. International.
"
418,NBL,"""They have relatively modern assets, so they are not as exposed to the threat of obsolescence as other companies,"" he said. ""And they're small enough that the investments they make have a material effect on earnings.""
"
419,NBL,"Those investments include efforts to expand Atwood's fleet of deepwater drillships, which can drill in water 12,000 feet deep.
"
420,NBL,"It takes $650 million to build a drillship, and five or six years to pay one off at current day rates. That's a hefty sum for Atwood, which had $787 million in revenue last year. But the company has shown a knack for turning investments into profits.
"
421,NBL,"""They have a pretty good balance of capitalizing and free cash flow,"" Macpherson said. ""Historically, they also have better-than-average return on capital and they're pretty reliable in terms of operating efficiency. Some of the smaller competitors are a little more extended now and less able to expand their assets.""
"
422,NBL,"Of the three deepwater drillships currently under construction, two are already under contract.
"
423,NBL,"The latest of those deals was announced June 10, when Atwood was awarded a drilling services contract for the Atwood Achiever drillship by a subsidiary of Kosmos Energy. The contract is for an exploration program off the coast of Morocco.

424,NBL,"The Achiever is one of the rigs under construction at the Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering shipyard in South Korea. It is scheduled for delivery in June 2014.
"
425,NBL,"The new contract specifies a base operating rate of $595,000 per day over three years. It adds $652 million in revenue backlog, bringing Atwood's total revenue backlog to around $3.9 billion as of June 10.
"
426,NBL,"Haithum Nokta, an analyst at Clarkson Capital Markets, notes that the Achiever might eventually move to other operating locations ""for which the day rate will be properly adjusted"" for differences in taxes and operating costs.
"
427,NBL,"""We believe other potential locations may be Mauritania and Suriname,"" Nokta added. ""We view the contract positively, and the rate comes in line with recent fixtures in the region.""
"
428,NBL,"Two more new contracts, both for existing rigs, were also announced this month.
"
429,NBL,"One of them involves the Atwood Beacon, a jack-up rig that is currently operating off the coast of Israel under an agreement with Italian energy company Eni S.p.A. When that work ends, probably in July, the Beacon will move off the coast of Italy under a new two-year contract that will add $128 million in revenue backlog.
"
430,NBL,"The other contract, with Shell Offshore, involves the Atwood Condor semisubmersible rig. Work under the new contract will probably begin in late August. The contract is for 39 months and involves a day rate of about $550,000 for a drilling program in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. It adds about $502 million in revenue backlog.
"
431,NBL,"Financially, Atwood has produced pretty steady growth over the past few years, with only the occasional hiccup.
"
432,NBL,"Sales And Earnings
"
433,NBL,"The company has run off three straight quarters of double-digit sales and earnings growth. During its fiscal second quarter, which ended in March, it logged earnings of $1.28 a share. That was up 42% from the prior year and a nickel above consensus analyst estimates.
"
434,NBL,"Revenue for the quarter gained 48% to $253.2 million, the highest increase in more than four years, but slightly below views.
"
435,NBL,"The company's stock price touched a nearly five-year high of 56.71 June 18 and currently trades near 55.
"
436,NBL,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect fiscal Q3 earnings of $1.34 a share, which would be a 70% year-over-year gain. Profit for the full year is seen rising 25% to $5.16 a share.
"
437,NBL,"""(Atwood) has the mix of backlog and newbuild catalysts that we find attractive, and we believe more announcements of ultra-deepwater contracts will result in further rig additions and continued multiyear earnings growth,"" noted Matt Beeby, an analyst at Williams Financial Group.
"
438,NBL,"The movement of day rates will play a part in future earnings. Analyst Macpherson says current day rates ""are pretty mature,"" and are not likely to go much higher.
"
439,NBL,"""But I also don't think they are vulnerable to collapse either,"" he added.
"
440,NBL,"What has gone up are costs to operate the rigs, mainly because heightened competition for labor has narrowed the number of skilled crew members.
"
441,NBL,"""The top end of the labor spectrum is very competitive right now, so those costs have been rising,"" Macpherson said. ""Insurance costs are also rising. You tend to see higher costs on everything in these kinds of expansionary cycles.""When you think of Texas-based oil companies, you probably don't think of deepwater rigs in faraway places like Malta, Equatorial Guinea, Australia or Thailand.Then again, Atwood Oceanics (ATW) isn't your typical Texas oil company. For one thing, it doesn't drill on land. For another, only a tiny portion of its revenue, about 5%, comes from the U.S. Most of its business is centered in the South Pacific or off the coast of West Africa.Atwood specializes in the drilling and completion of exploratory and developmental oil and gas wells. Its fleet of 13 rigs includes semisubmersibles, deepwater drillships and jack-up rigs. It also has three ultra-deepwater drillships under construction.The company maintains offices on five continents and boasts a multinational workforce of 1,200 people. It makes money by charging day rates to oil companies for using its rigs. Its biggest clients include Chevron (CVX), Noble Energy (NBL) and Kosmos Energy (KOS).Heavy demand for oil in many global markets has pushed day rates to a range of $550,000 to $600,000 a day, well above the historical norm.Competitive AdvantageThese high rates have led to an expansion of the number of fleets on the water. Although this means more competition for Atwood, the company has a number of advantages over most other drillers, analysts say.""Among offshore drillers, Atwood is one of the companies that is better positioned to take advantage of current conditions,"" said Ian Macpherson, an analyst at Simmons & Co. International.""They have relatively modern assets, so they are not as exposed to the threat of obsolescence as other companies,"" he said. ""And they're small enough that the investments they make have a material effect on earnings.""Those investments include efforts to expand Atwood's fleet of deepwater drillships, which can drill in water 12,000 feet deep.It takes $650 million to build a drillship, and five or six years to pay one off at current day rates. That's a hefty sum for Atwood, which had $787 million in revenue last year. But the company has shown a knack for turning investments into profits.""They have a pretty good balance of capitalizing and free cash flow,"" Macpherson said. ""Historically, they also have better-than-average return on capital and they're pretty reliable in terms of operating efficiency. Some of the smaller competitors are a little more extended now and less able to expand their assets.""Of the three deepwater drillships currently under construction, two are already under contract.The latest of those deals was announced June 10, when Atwood was awarded a drilling services contract for the Atwood Achiever drillship by a subsidiary of Kosmos Energy. The contract is for an exploration program off the coast of Morocco.The Achiever is one of the rigs under construction at the Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering shipyard in South Korea.

442,NBL,"The U.S. energy sector renaissance under way the past five years is continuing as domestic drillers such as Continental Resources (CLR) hone ways to reach oil and natural gas in fields across the nation.

443,NBL,"Before George Mikan was a legend, he was a boy who looked up to his father for guidance.
"
444,NBL,"Joe Mikan, who helped operate Mikan's Tavern in Illinois, was as workmanlike as his blue-collar clientele, wrote Michael Schumacher in ""Mr. Basketball: George Mikan, the Minneapolis Lakers and the Birth of the NBA.""
"
445,NBL,"""Do the best you can,"" Joe Mikan told George, ""and so be judged.""
"
446,NBL,"With that advice, a healthy dose of determination and the guidance of his DePaul University basketball coach, Ray Meyer, Mikan transformed from a clumsy, 6-10 project who with his thick glasses and dark hair looked like Clark Kent, into basketball's Superman.
"
447,NBL,"Mikan (1924-2005) simply was pro basketball's first great big man.
"
448,NBL,"A prolific scorer and rebounder, Mikan led his pro teams to seven titles, one with the Chicago American Gears of the National Basketball League and six with the Minneapolis Lakers, who ended up in the National Basketball Association.
"
449,NBL,"Towering
"
450,NBL,"He was so impressive, the Associated Press in 1950 named him Mr. Basketball for the first half of the 20th century. ""I felt determined to live up to the honor,"" Mikan wrote in his autobiography, ""Unstoppable: The Story of George Mikan."" ""I never had to look any further than that award for inspiration.""
"
451,NBL,"Three of his five Laker titles were still to come. Mikan's 1950-51 season was best statistically. He led the league in scoring at 28.4 points per game, his highest, and finished second in rebounding at 14.1.
"
452,NBL,"With career averages of 23.1 points and 13.4 rebounds per game, Mikan led his teams to seven professional basketball titles overall. Elected to Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959, he was named one of 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996.
"
453,NBL,"""Mikan was a competitor; he never gave up during a game,"" said John Kundla, 96, who coached him in Minneapolis. ""He was easy to coach, to get along with.""
"
454,NBL,"Whitey Skoog, a Mikan teammate, said: ""George was an intelligent man. He was a good teammate and didn't make a lot of mistakes. He had a lot of pride in his performance. George practiced that way and played that way.""
"
455,NBL,"Mikan's dominance changed the game, prompting rules changes that included goaltending, widening the free-throw lane, and the 24-second clock.
"
456,NBL,"A life-size statue of Mikan stands at Minneapolis' Target Center, home to the NBA's Timberwolves.
"
457,NBL,"""He showed the world a big man could be an athlete,"" Wilt Chamberlain, who followed as a titanic big man in the 1960s, told USA Today three years before his death in 1999. ""Not just some big guy who could hardly walk and chew gum at the same time. He was a splendid athlete. He was the first true superstar of the league.""
"
458,NBL,"Mikan squeezed the NBA onto the national stage alongside baseball, the era's giant. ""He literally transcended the sport and he created such visibility,"" said Bob Cousy, who in the 1950s helped start the Boston Celtics' dynasty. ""He lifted us out of the doldrums and made the league respectable.""
"
459,NBL,"Standard-Bearer
"
460,NBL,"Mikan was an ambassador for pro basketball, which as with football in the 1940s and '50s was considered by many minor against the college game.
"
461,NBL,"Mikan, who would earn a law degree and become commissioner of the American Basketball Association, showed his business and marketing acumen. He didn't miss opportunities, either orchestrated by the NBA or on his own, to mingle with the fans. And he cultivated a good relationship with the press.
"
462,NBL,"When Mikan died at age 80, champion center Shaquille O'Neal recalled of his predecessor: ""I know who he was. I know what he did. Without George Mikan, there is no me."" O'Neal went on to offer to pay for Mikan's funeral, and did.
"
463,NBL,"Born in Joliet, Ill., Mikan grew up working in the family tavern business. Later he tended bar.
"
464,NBL,"After failing to make his freshman basketball team, he transferred to another school. ""Mikan would never accept defeat, even the suggestion that there was something he couldn't do, once he applied himself,"" Schumacher said.
"
465,NBL,"Big Man On Campus
"
466,NBL,"He was so effective his senior year, DePaul University offered him a basketball scholarship. Soon the Chicago school had a new coach, Ray Meyer, who grasped that ""this big guy is my future.""
"
467,NBL,"Mikan not only brought height, but also bulk in his shoulders.
"
468,NBL,"Meyer made Mikan his main project, putting his willing pupil through a battery of drills to boost his skills and athleticism.
"
469,NBL,"The right-handed Mikan learned to use his left hand by launching 300 shots a day.
"
470,NBL,"To help Mikan get off the ground better on his hook shots, Meyer put a bench near the basket that the kid had to jump over while firing.
"
471,NBL,"That hook lived on decades later. ""He showed us how to do it,"" said Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who rode the sky hook to the Hall of Fame. ""I certainly would not have the hook shot that went in if it wasn't for the fundamentals I learned from George Mikan's game.""
"
472,NBL,"Said Schumacher: ""Meyer worked with Mikan all the time and after hours. He saw something in Mikan, his absolute drive to succeed. And not just succeed, but excel.""
"
473,NBL,"Mikan proved a quick study. He became a three-time All-American and was named College Player of the Year twice. Mikan led DePaul to the National Invitation Tournament title in 1945, when the NIT was a major event. His 53 points beat Rhode Island in the semifinals and helped him win the NIT's Most Valuable Player award.
"
474,NBL,"After college, Mikan signed with Chicago's NBL team. He promptly took the Gears to the 1947 league title while averaging 16.5 points per game.
"
475,NBL,"When the team folded the next year, Mikan wound up with Minneapolis' Lakers and took them to the 1948 NBL championship.
"
476,NBL,"The Lakers jumped to a new league, the Basketball Association of America, the next season, and Mikan led the team to a familiar result — another title — by averaging 30 points in 10 playoff games.
"
477,NBL,"The NBA was born when the BAA and the NBL merged in the fall of 1949. Mikan led it in scoring at 27.4 points per game and won a fourth straight pro championship.
"
478,NBL,"That run ended the next year, largely due to Mikan's fractured leg in the playoffs.
"
479,NBL,"""Mikan went home and dreamed about starting a new string of titles,"" Schumacher wrote. ""He'd never forget the one that got away.""
"
480,NBL,"Said Skoog: ""When George walked on the court, the intention was to win that game. He was a highly competitive man.""
"
481,NBL,"Mikan cemented his legacy by leading the Lakers to three more titles. He was out of the game by age 32, four years before the team moved to Los Angeles in 1960.
"
482,NBL,"Good Guy
"
483,NBL,"Mikan was known as a gentle giant off the court. It was a demeanor applauded by Terry Mikan, one of six children from George and Patricia, who said after his father's death that ""whenever he would make a toast at a family function, Dad would ask us to raise our glass to kindness.""
"
484,NBL,"On the court, Mikan was hardly gentle. He was simply driven to perfection. ""Mikan had a work ethic,"" Schumacher said. ""He wanted to be the best. That was George Mikan.

For the same period, capital expenditure was $1,161 million compared with $578 million in the year-ago period. GuidanceWPX Energy expects total production in 2018 to be within 117-126 thousand barrels of oil-equivalent per day (MBoe/d), within which oil production amounts 75-80 thousand barrels per day (Mbbl/d).WPX Energy’s capital budget for continuing operations and midstream equity investment in 2018 is expected to be in the range of $1,160-$1,310 million.Our View WPX Energy's performance in fourth quarter was better than expected owing to production from its oil assets and recovery in commodity prices compared with the year-ago level.The company continues to work on its strategy of increasing oil production, which is evident from the rising liquid mix in total production. Production from the Delaware Basin increased substantially during the fourth quarter with the help of assets acquired by the company during the first quarter.We believe, post divestiture of its holding in San Juan Basin, WPX Energy's exposure in the Delaware and Williston basins will enable it to achieve its new goal of higher oil generation in 2018.The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

769,NBL,"Noble Energy Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 20. Last quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 84.62%. Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderNoble Energy is focused on improving its United States onshore assets and oil volumes. The company has taken initiatives to divest non-core assets and primarily concentrate on U.S. onshore and Eastern Mediterranean assets, which might help boost its cash flow and margins. Fourth-quarter U.S. Onshore volumes are anticipated to be 15% higher than the third quarter of 2017 with each commodity expected to increase by double-digits.  This clearly indicates the possibility of acquiring a major chunk of sales volume from the company’s domestic operations.Noble Energy expects its fourth-quarter total sales volume in the range of 380,000-390,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d), of which, the United States sales volume is estimated in the band of 270-284 Mboe/d. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter sales volume is pegged at 386 Mboe/d, better than 355 Mboe/d sold during the third quarter and near the higher end of the projected guidance.  A possible rise in crude oil prices is likely to drive the company’s top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for crude oil prices in the United States stands at $49.40 per barrel, up 6.5% year over year. Better sales volume combined with higher realized prices for commodities is predicted to positively impact the company’s earnings.Noble Energy Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Noble Energy Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Noble Energy Inc. Quote Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Noble Energy is likely to beat estimates this quarter because the stock needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients for this to happen: a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). But that is not the case here as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Noble Energy has an Earnings ESP of -9.09% as the Most Accurate Estimate of 3 cents is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 4 cents.Zacks Rank: Noble Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few players worth considering from the same industry with the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:EOG Resources, Inc.

771,NBL,"Noble Energy, Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report) signed a definite agreement to divest 7.5% interest in the Tamar field, offshore Israel, to Tamar Petroleum Ltd. The companyanticipates receiving $560 million in the form of cash proceeds and 38.5 million shares of Tamar Petroleum. Based on the closing price of Tamar Petroleum, as of Jan 29, 2018, the total value of deal comes to $800 million. It expects the transaction to conclude by the end of first-quarter 2018, subject to Tamar Petroleum's terms and conditions.Notably, Noble Energy is currently divesting its Tamar Interest to support its commitment in accordance with the government of Israel's Natural Gas Regulatory Framework.The company intends to use the cash proceeds from the transaction to aid in its investment for the Leviathan development. Further, it anticipates capital gains tax of 23% after the completion of the transaction. In 2016, Noble Energy had divested 3.5% in the Tamar field. The sum total of proceeds from both transactions has resulted in the generation of $1.25 billion, of which $1 billion is in cash.Per management, the operations in Tamar supported by Leviathan development is expected to aid the company in generating competitive margins that will ensure a stable and long-term cash flow profile, in the future. Going ahead, Noble Energy intends to divest the shares held in Tamar Petroleum.Utilization of ProceedsNoble Energy’s current debt to capital ratio is pegged at 42.96%, higher than the industry average of 36.75%. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company's long-term debt was $7,487 million higher than 2016 end level of $7,011 million.. We expect the ongoing divestitures to aid the company in strengthening its balance sheet position and development of its ongoing capital projects.Noble Energy has been divesting non-core assets in order to increase focus on core assets. In November 2017, the company signed a definite agreement to divest nearly 30,200 net acres of company’s non-core DJ Basin portion to SRC Energy Inc, for a sum of $608 million. The sales proceeds will be used toward developing core assets and also strengthen balance sheet. Such asset dropdowns and reduction of debts surely bodes well for the company’s growth.Price MovementShares of Noble Energy have outperformed the industry last month.

772,NBL,"Noble Energy Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report) has announced plans to strengthen and expand in Israel through production operations ahead of the 2019, according to a report by Reuters. The production operations will begin at the large Leviathan natural gas site close to Israel's Mediterranean coast at the end of 2019.Per another media report, the company is leasing nine floors in the Herzliya Hills office project, to support its expanding operations and increasing work force in Israel. Noble Energy will lease the offices for 10 years with an option to extend the lease by a further 14 years. The company will move into its new Herzliya Hills offices in 2019.Noble Energy’s Position in IsraelThe company already holds 40% of Leviathan gas site, which has estimated gas reserves of 622 billion cubic meters, while Delek Group Ltd.  owns 45% of the same through subsidiaries. Additionally, Noble Energy holds 32.5% of the Tamar field, Israel's primary reserve of natural gas.Noble Energy is currently focused on strengthening operations in Israel. Notably, the company has spent 20% of the capital expenditure toward development operations for the Leviathan development, during the third quarter. At present, Noble Energy has gained the required permission to progress with the remaining of its Leviathan development work of which 23% has been already completed.During the third quarter, the company witnessed a rise in gross recoverable resources by 10% to 11 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe) of natural gas in the Tamar Field. Further, higher gas demand was also witnessed owing to the addition of more industrial customers in Jordan during the third quarter.  It was also aided by demand from Israel due to the government mandate of reducing coal-fired power generation.Going aheadNoble Energy expects to invest in the range of $600-$700 million in the fourth quarter. Additionally, natural gas volumes are anticipated higher at 1,005-1,045 million cubic feet of natural gas per day while natural gas liquids (NGLs) are expected to be between 69 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d) and 74 MBbl/d.Further, the possibility of extracting higher gas volumes in existing assets of the Tamar Field is expected to bode well with the growing demand of natural gas in Eastern Mediterranean region. However, the company will have to reduce its holding in Tamar field to 25% by 2021 as government plans to open the market to competition.Per management’s opinion, higher recovery of gas from Leviathan at the end of 2019 and the continued operations in Tamar are expected to boost Noble Energy's operations in Israel. Along with operations in Israel, its operations in Big Bend, Dantzler and Gunflint fields in Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and Equatorial Guinea are expected to aid the company in achieving production target for 2017.Price MovementNoble Energy has underperformed the industry in last six months.

774,NBL,"The sentiments of investors have changed drastically regarding businesses in the U.S. shale spaces. Oil producers are not in a position to give more focus on drilling in the domestic shale resources as investors are demanding further returns from the explorers, stated John Hess — CEO of Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report).Hess added that since 2017, investor’s current priority has changed to ‘show me the money’, from ‘drill, baby, drill’. Lower focus on production will eventually draw less money toward investment. This will be a serious concern as low long-term capital spending will further reduce production in the coming years.Per our proprietary model, through 2017, the companies belonging to the Zacks U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration industry collectively generated $1.2 billion of net operating cashflows, from which $0.9 billion was allocated toward capital spending. The remaining amount of $239 million was free cashflow, from which only $65 million was paid as dividends to the investors. Hence, investors received 6% of the entire operating cashflows.  It seems that investors are not happy with the percentage of return — considering only dividend payments and excluding share buybacks. In other words, they are asking shale explorers not to spend so much capital for operations.Along with long-term production threat, the U.S. shale players are exposed to limited short-term domestic production possibilities — especially in the Permian Basin — following pipeline bottleneck problems. Producers that are exposed to Permian pipeline bottleneck are Energen Corporation (EGN  -  Free Report), Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) and Noble Energy Inc (NBL  -  Free Report).The Permian region has always been in the spotlight when it comes to oil and natural gas production in the United States. In terms of production, Permian has recorded higher reserve than Anadarko, Appalachia, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Niobrara. From nearly 1 million barrels a day of crude at the beginning of 2009, Permian’s daily production is now heading toward 3.5 million barrels, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).  However, Permian is now facing limited pipeline capacity for transporting oil to Gulf Coast export facilities, major refinery terminals and principal hubs like Cushing. This is because drillers have been pumping out more oil as crude prices are favorable, which exceeds the capacity of the Permian.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

775,NBL,"Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) recently agreed to participate in the EPIC Crude Oil Pipeline, run by EPIC Midstream Holdings, LP. The strategic alliance also includes Noble Energy, Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report). The pipeline will connect southeastern New Mexico to Corpus Christi, TX and transport crude from the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale. The under-construction pipeline will help to clear the infrastructure bottleneck caused by excessive production in the Permian, resulting in lower prices.The Strategic Alliance Being one of the largest acreage holders in the prolific Permian Basin, Houston, TX-based Apache's commitment of 75 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d) in the pipeline is expected to secure the project’s future. Noble Energy, headquartered in the same area, also secured 100 MBbl/d in the pipeline. Per the agreement, Apache and Noble Energy hold an option of acquiring as far as 15% and 30% stake in the pipeline, respectively. These options can be exercised by the first three months of 2019.Oil producers in the Permian Basin have recently seen their product price decline due to the increase in production, which overwhelmed the infrastructure that ships crudes to ports. The situation is alarming for the producers in the area, as their profit margin is threatened by the discounted crude prices. The strategic alliance thus gives Apache, as well as Noble Energy a chance to improve margins.About the Pipeline The pipeline is expected to have an initial oil transport capacity of 590 thousand MBbl/d. Around 74.6% of the total capacity will come from the Permian Basin while the rest from the Eagle Ford. The pipeline will have an option of upsizing to a 30-inch line that will further increase the shipping capacity from the Permian Basin to 675 MBbl/d.Incorporating Apache and Noble Energy’s committed acreages, more than 500,000 acres were devoted to the pipeline and at least 10% of its total capacity is planned to be kept for uncommitted shippers.The 730-mile crude pipeline will run beside EPIC's natural gas liquids pipeline. Construction of the pipeline is anticipated to start in the October-December period of 2018 and it will come online in 2019's second half. The EPIC Crude Oil Pipeline has the capital commitment support from funds managed by Ares Management, L.P.'s (ARES  -  Free Report) Private Equity Group.Price Performance of ApacheThe upstream oil major has lost 18.8% in the past year against the 5.3% gain of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderApache has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the Energy sector can opt for a better-ranked stock in the same space, namely Nine Energy Service, Inc.

785,NBL,"Noble Energy (NBL  -  Free Report) has returned 24.8%, outperforming the industry's rally of 15.4% in the last six months.

The company is currently benefiting from ongoing strategic acquisitions and non-core divestitures. Further, its well-placed global assets base is also aiding performance. However, stringent drilling regulations and lack of infrastructure facilities near the company’s drilling zones continues to hinder growth.Noble Energy has been divesting non-core assets at regular intervals. Notably, the company has been making a series of divestments to sell off its non-core assets.These divestments are aiding the company to shift focus on core assets and develop them.

In the beginning of the same month, it sold 30,200 net acres of company’s non-core DJ Basin portion to SRC Energy Inc, for a sum of $608 million.

788,NBL,"Noble Energy Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results after the closing bellon Oct 30. Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 26.7%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Noble Energy is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates and Noble Energy has the right mix.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is +1.29%.Zacks Rank: Noble Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Noble Energy’s favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise this season.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or #5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Noble Energy Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Noble Energy Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Noble Energy Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderThe company recently updated outlook for third-quarter 2017 owing to solid production from its organic and inorganic assets. On the production side, the total oil volumes for the third quarter reflected a 4% increase from prior expectation. The company’s natural gas volumes and production of natural gas liquids (NGLs) have also been hiked for the quarter.Notably, the company updated outlook on the back of several favorable factors. Better-than-expected rise in DJ Basin volumes due to robust performance in Wells Ranch and East Pony have led to an increased oil production. Additionally, its first central gathering facility came online in July and has been connected to the Advantage Pipeline carrying crude volumes to Crane County, TX. Robust performance in Eagle Ford due to increase in South Gates Ranch activity and Alba field reflected an overall increase in the production volumes.On the sales end, volumes for the third quarter have been increased by 3% from the previous expectation. Toward this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Noble Energy’s total crude oil sales volume per day is currently pegged at 126 MBoe/d compared with 119 MBoe/d during the prior-year quarter. Additionally, its total natural gas liquids sales volumes have also increased from 60 MBoe/d to 66 MBoe/d at present.In the quarter, the company also completed the acquisition of Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. which further reinforced its position in U.S onshore.Consequentially, we expect the company’s raised outlook for the quarter on the back of several other supporting factors to positively reflect on its third-quarter results.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few players in the same industry that too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Earthstone Energy, Inc.

789,NBL,"Per a media report, Noble Energy, Inc (NBL  -  Free Report) has entered into an agreement to divest minerals and royalty package to Houston-based Black Stone Minerals LP (BSM  -  Free Report) for $340 million.Per the agreement, the acreage includes about 1.1 million gross mineral acres, 380,000 gross acres of non-participating royalty interests and 600,000 gross acres of overriding royalty interests. Notably, this acreage is spread across 20 states with significant concentration in Texas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota. Further, the aforementioned deal is expected to close on Nov 28.The acreage is situated in the Permian Basin, the Bakken/Three Forks play, the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, the SCOOP play in Oklahoma and the Granite Wash play in Texas.Why is Noble Energy Divesting?Noble Energy has been divesting its non-core assets at regular intervals when it gets a suitable buyer for its non-core assets. In May 2017, the company divested assets worth $765 million to Quantum Energy Partners. Most recently, the company signed an agreement to divest 30,200 net acres of its non-core DJ Basin portion to SRC Energy Inc, for $608 million in November 2017. The sales proceeds will help the company to develop core assets and strengthen balance sheet position.Noble Energy operated the Tamar field with a 36% working interest before it had divested 3% interest in the same to Harel Group back in 2016. Notably, it currently anticipates monetizing an approximate 7.5% working interest sale in the same over the next twelve months for funding its Leviathan capital program in 2018. Further, it expects to retain a 25% working interest and operatorship in Tamar.Following completion of the sell-down process, the company has plans to retain a 25% working interest in the Tamar field, which has recoverable gross mean natural gas resources of 10 trillion cubic feet.Our ViewNotably, the monetary gains from Noble Energy’s past and ongoing divestments are aiding it to focus on core assets and carry out further development activities in these assets. Notably, gains from developing the high-return assets are expected drive the future performance over next few years and improve the financial position of the company.The proceeds from these divestitures are aiding the company to lower its high level of existing debt burden. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company's long-term debt was pegged at $7,487 million. Notably, we expect the company to gain and strengthen balance sheet position, through periodic ongoing divestments and by monetizing its non-core assets.Price MovementShares of Noble Energy have underperformed the industry in the last 12 months.

796,NBL,"The Q1 earnings season is past the halfway mark, with 267 S&P 500 members having already reported their quarterly numbers. Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies are up 25.1% from the same period last year on 10% higher revenues, with 76.8% delivering positive earnings surprises and 73.8% beating revenue estimates.Near about half of the S&P listed energy companies have released their first-quarter results. These include Halliburton Company, Kinder Morgan, Inc., Schlumberger Limited, Baker Hughes, Hess Corporation, Valero Energy Corporation, Range Resources Corporation, Phillips 66, National Oilwell Varco, Helmerich & Payne, Inc., EQT Corporation, ExxonMobil Corporation, Cabot oil & Gas Corporation, Chevron Corporation and ConocoPhillips.Two biggies — ExxonMobil and Chevron — reported their results on Apr 27. While Chevron delivered earnings beat on higher oil prices and volumes, ExxonMobil missed estimates amid output and refinery throughput decline, along with lower margins at chemicals business.Bullish Results & ExpectationsIn the last reported quarter, earnings for the energy sector saw the strongest growth, recording a massive 136.6% year-over-year gain on 23.6% higher revenues.Also, for the first quarter of 2018, we expect the energy sector to eclipse all the 16 Zacks sectors. Per our expectations, earnings for the sector are expected to jump 70.8% from first-quarter 2017, while the top line is likely to witness an improvement of 15.4% from the year-ago levels.Q1 Oil and Gas Price Report CardOil: The first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite record high domestic production. Per EIA data, the commodity rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at $64.87 per barrel. Crude was supported by various catalysts, including strong demand and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies. Needless to say, such favorable developments have buoyed investors’ optimism surrounding the sector’s first-quarter results.It goes without saying that all oil-producing companies are thus poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices, as they will be able to extract more value for their products. However, the recent oil price rally has made the commodity costlier for refiners, leading to higher input cost for them.Natural gas: However, price of natural gas dropped about 7.4% in the January-March period. Along with the sequential fall, natural gas prices also remained unfavorable compared with the corresponding period of 2017. Commodity futures were $2.73 per MMBtu at the end of the quarter, down more than 14% from the Mar 31, 2017 settlement of $3.19 per MMBtu.Energy Stocks Reporting Q1 Earnings on May 1Let’s find out what’s in store for the below-mentioned five energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers on May 1.Headquartered in Midland, TX, Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) is an upstream energy player focused mainly on the lucrative Permian Basin. The company is expected to release results after the closing bell.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.In the last reported quarter, Concho delivered an impressive 43.48% positive earnings surprise on the back of higher commodity price realizations and robust production growth. As far as earnings beat is concerned, the company has an excellent history. Over the trailing four quarters, it surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 48.89%.It looks like Concho is all set to keep its earnings streak alive in the first quarter, as it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.86% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for daily production is currently pegged at 218.2 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE), higher than 181.4 MBOE reported in the year-ago quarter and 211.1 MBOE in the prior quarter. Moreover, analysts also envision higher price realizations that will further buoy its top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average oil price is expected to jump 20.2% and 11.3% from the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2017, respectively.Next up, we have Oklahoma-based independent energy producer Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report), which is slated to release numbers after the closing bell.  In the fourth quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 36.67% amid higher impairment charges. Nonetheless, the company surpassed earnings estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters.However, our proven model does not show that Devon Energy is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter as it has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Weather-related issues are expected to affect first-quarter production of the firm. The company estimates total production from its assets in the first quarter of 2018 to be in the range of 530,000-554,000 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day, compared with 548,000 Boe achieved in fourth-quarter 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is $3,852 million for the first quarter, exhibiting a sequential decline of 3.33%.Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report), — an oil and gas producer with operations focused in the Gulf of Mexico — is set to unveil results after the closing bell.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last reported quarter, with the positive earnings surprise being 18.3%. Moreover, it has topped earnings estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 15.9%.However, our proven model does not show conclusively that the company will be able to beat estimates in the to-be-reported quarter, as it carries an Earnings ESP of -0.76% and Zacks Rank #3.While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average sale price of natural gas is $2.70 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), implying a year-over-year decline from $2.93 per Mcf, the estimate for gas production is pegged at 35.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf), reflecting an improvement from 29.4 Bcf in the year-ago quarter.Next in line we have Noble Energy Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report), slated to release results before the opening bell. The independent oil and gas producer mainly operates in the Rocky Mountains, Mid-Continent and Gulf of Mexico regions.In the last reported quarter, the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 700%. The company boasts an excellent track record of having outperformed estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 246.16%.However, our model indicates that Noble Energy’s earnings streak might come to a halt this time around, as the company does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients. While the company carries a Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter’s total sales volume stands at 361 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), indicating a decline on both yearly and sequential basis. However, estimates for first-quarter total revenues increased 21.54% to $1.2 billion from the same period last year.Lastly, we have independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report), slated to release results before the opening bell.  In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.37% on higher refining margin. As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the Findlay, OH-based downstream operator has a good history. It went past the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports.However, this time around, our model does not predict earnings beat for the stock, as it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. While Marathon Petroleum’s retail and midstream segment bodes well, a more conservative refining outlook is likely to affect the company’s bottom line. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the refining segment’s bottom line stands at a loss of $112 million. This is also wider than the year-ago operating loss of $70 million.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

798,NBL,"Noble Energy (NBL  -  Free Report) updated outlook for the third quarter of 2017 owing to solid production from itsorganic and inorganic assets.Details of the UpdateOn the production side, the total oil volumes for the third quarter have been raised to 126-130 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d), reflecting 4% increase from prior expectation. The company’s natural gas volumes are anticipated have been raised to 965-990 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, while natural gas liquids (NGLs) are expected between 63 and 65 MBbl/d for the quarter.On the sales end, volumes for the third quarter have been raised to range between 352-358 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d), reflecting 3% rise from the previous expectation.However, the company has maintained original capital expectation of $625-$725 million for the quarter.Reason for Update?The company updated outlook on the back of several favorable factors. Better-than-expected rise in DJ Basin volumes due to robust performance in Wells Ranch and East Pony have led to an increased oil production. Along with this, its first central gathering facility came online in July andhasbeen connected to the Advantage Pipeline taking crude volumes to Crane County, TX.Robust performance in Eagle Ford due to increase in South Gates Ranch activityas well as inAlba field reflect an overall increase in the company’s production volumes.Factor to Drive Peer PerformanceThe Houston, TX-based company has been engaged in making the most of its well placed organic and inorganic assets. As such it has been gravitating toward expansion techniques for exploring and producing more crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) globally. The company has a diversified basket of short and long-term projects, both onshore and offshore, in domestic and international locations.With robust productions from its existing assets, the company is well poised to benefit and further aid the company to achieve better results. Noble Energy is also currently benefiting from a number of asset divestments that are driving overall production. Consequently,it is important for peers like Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report) and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) to undertake initiatives and strategies that will aid their production volumes further, as Noble Energy.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

800,NBL,"We updated our research report on Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) on Aug 17. This oil and natural gas exploration & production company reported a loss in the second quarter, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Despite the company’s disappointing performance in the second quarter, its premium shale properties, including the Delaware and Denver-Julesburg basins, and the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico are expected to be the primary production drivers in the future.In addition to domestic assets, Anadarko’s international assets are also yielding positive results. During the second quarter, the company increased sales volume by 25% year over year, driven by oil volumes from the TEN project offshore Ghana. New discovery and existing Columbian assets will boost the performance of the company.Anadarko Petroleum has been systematically selling its non-core properties since 2004. The company exceeded its monetization target of assets worth $4 billion in 2016. It monetized asset worth nearly $3.5 billion in the first half of 2017. The company will utilize the proceeds to repay debts and strengthen its balance sheet.Anadarko operates in a highly competitive oil and gas business space.  Some of its peers like major integrated oil companies, state-owned foreign oil companies and independent producers of oil and natural gas have greater and more diverse resources.Oil and gas companies need to explore and find economic reserves to stay competitive in this space. Increase in dry hole expenses is a cause of concern for the company. Dry hole expenses in the first six months of 2017 were $843 million compared with $6 million in the year-ago period.

801,NBL,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) – formed following the merger of Tesoro Corporation and El Paso-based Western Refining Inc. – recently announced plans to initiate the construction of Conan Crude Oil Gathering Pipeline in West Texas. The news came a couple of days after the company announced its first earnings release under the new name and delivered better-than-expected earnings.The open season for this 130 mile crude oil pipeline in Delaware Basin (located on the western part of the lucrative Permian Basin) had been launched in May by Western Refining. Apart from bolstering its network of assets, downstream operator Western Refining’s buyout is likely to help Andeavor enhance its geographic footprint in the prolific Permian Basin, driving double-digit earnings growth in 2018. As it is, over the last two years despite the industry’s downturn, the energy companies including Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report),Noble Energy, Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report) and many othershave been increasing their investment in the prolific Permian Basin owing to its lower costs and widespread infrastructure.The pipeline will begin in the Lea County and will extend to the Loving County, where it will join with other pipelines. Conan Pipeline is also expected to connect with the Wink Pipeline – owned by Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) – and supply the oil to the company’s El Paso Refinery. The first phase of the pipeline will have a transportation capacity of 250,000 barrels per day (bpd), expandable up to 500,000 bpd in the future phases. The company is expected to invest around $225 million in the first phase of the completion of the pipeline, out of which it is likely to spend $75 million this year. The commercial service of the Conan Pipeline is most likely to begin by mid-2018.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

802,NBL,"It was a week where the price of oil spiked to its highest settlement since June 2015, while natural gas futures rose to a five-month peak.On the news front, France-based integrated major TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) agreed to buy liquefied natural gas assets from utility company Engie for around $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, downstream operator Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) and Canadian natural gas firm Encana Corp. (ECA  -  Free Report) came up with weaker-than-expected earnings reports.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 2.3% to close at $56.74 per barrel, while natural gas prices jumped 7.7% to $3.213 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Shell, EOG, Concho Report Strong Q3)The U.S. oil benchmark rallied on expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March when they meet at the end of the month. The agreement, already renewed once, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Further support came from the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release, which showed steep declines in domestic gasoline and distillate inventories.Political turmoil in Saudi Arabia, where the kingdom’s 32-year old crown price – Mohammed bin Salman – ordered the arrest of much of the country’s top leadership, was also bullish for oil prices.Meanwhile, natural gas futures logged a big gain following strong power burn consumption from residential/commercial customers. Despite the commodity’s Lower 48 production being at its highest level on record, colder-than-normal weather forecasts over the next two weeks are expected to drive natural gas demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    French energy giant TOTAL S.A. announced that it has entered into a definite agreement to acquire the upstream liquefied natural gas (LNG) assets of compatriot gas utility Engie for $1.49 billion. The decision to buy the assets and expand footprint in the LNG business is expected to benefit the company significantly.Per the agreement, TOTAL will have control over Engie’s interest in the Cameron LNG project in the United States, long-term LNG sales and purchase agreements, and an LNG tanker fleet. It will also have access to regasification capacities in Europe. TOTAL might pay another $550 million to Engie, subject to improvement in oil markets in the coming year. This transaction is expected to close by mid-2018.This deal, scheduled to be closed in 2018, will expand TOTAL’s total volume of LNG sales to 40 million tons per year in 2020. So, the decision to acquire Engie’s assets will expand TOTAL’s operation in LNG and increase revenue contribution from this space.

A 24% decline in Retail and Branded fuel margins and increased operating expenses resulted in the earnings miss.The bottom line, however, increased from the year-ago quarter figure of $1.43 per share on strong performance of the refining segment. Refining margin increased 66.2% year over year to $15.09 per barrel. Region-wise, refining margin was up almost 44.7% to $13.37 per barrel in California, 109.6% to $15.03 in the Pacific Northwest and about 57.9% to $17.27 in Mid-Continent on a year-over-year basis.Andeavor expects throughput level for the fourth quarter between 1,070 MBbl/d and 1,125 MBbl/d. Region wise, California expects throughput volumes between 520 and 545 MBbl/d. Pacific Northwest and Mid Continent expects throughput levels within 165–175 MBbl/d and 385–405 MBbl/d, respectively. The company expects total capital expenditures to be around $1.3 billion in 2017. Turnaround expenditures for full year 2017 are expected to be $540 million.

Further, the bottom line declined from 4 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. Lower production adversely impacted results.Quarterly natural gas production declined approximately 29% year over year to 939 million cubic feet per day, while liquids production rose 9% year over year to 127.5 thousand barrels per day. Total production declined 16% to 284 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d).Revenues of $861 million, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $827 million due to a rise in realized commodity prices. However, revenues were 12.1% lower than the prior-year figure of $979 million.Encana's realized natural gas price was $2.23 per thousand cubic feet, up 10.4% from the year-ago quarter level of $2.02. Meanwhile, liquids price rose marginally to $41.86 per barrel from $41.82 in the third quarter of 2016.

803,NBL,"Noble Energy, Inc.  (NBL  -  Free Report) announced that it has signed an agreement to divest approximately 30,200 net acres of company’s non-core DJ Basin portion to SRC Energy Inc, for a sum of $608 million.Details of the SaleThe acreage located in Weld County, CO, include Non-operated production of 2,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d) and operated production of 1,600 Boe/d. Notably, the initial closing is anticipated to conclude by the end of 2017predicted toinclude mainly non-operated production acreage, followed by a second closing that is expected to conclude by mid-2018 and will include mainly producing properties.How will this Benefit Noble Energy?Noble Energy is currently making optimum use of its non-core properties and utilizing the proceeds to lower debt levels. Additionally, it is undertaking investments to further strengthen its core operation. The DJ Basin enjoys a distinct competitive advantage in terms of better infrastructure and long lateral drilling benefits. The competitive advantage that the rest of the liquids-rich area enjoys will help the company with strong production volumes for the rest of year.Looking AheadThe company has a diversified portfolio of short and long-term projects, both onshore and offshore, in several locations. The company gained largely from the onshore sales that accounted for major sales volume during third-quarter 2017.Since a major portion of Noble Energy’s total production comes from its United States properties, the company is also investing substantially in these properties to further increase its total production.Noble Energy reiterated total sales volume in the range of 380-390 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day and U.S. onshore volumes are anticipated to be 15% higher than the third quarter levels.Looking ahead, robust production volumes from its organic and inorganic assets especially in DJ Basin volumes, along with its planned divestiture programs are anticipated to lower existing debt burden of the company going forward.Price MovementShares of Noble Energy have underperformed the industry in the last  twelve months. The company’s shares lost 22.8%, broader than the industry’s loss of 12.4%.A high burden of debt along with company's exposure to stringent regulations are causes of such underperformance.Zacks Rank & Peer PicksNoble Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors can consider other better-ranked stocks from the same industry that have released their third-quarter results.Bill Barrett Corporation , Continental Resources, Inc.

805,NBL,"Noble Energy, Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report) announced its decision to issue senior notes in two tranches. Per the company, it will issue $600 million of 3.850% senior notes with the maturity date of Jan 15, 2028 and $500 million of 4.950% senior notes with the maturity date of Aug 15, 2047.Subject to customary closing conditions, this offering is expected to close latest by Aug 15.Proceeds from the OfferingThe company wants to utilize the net proceeds from the issue along with some available liquidity or cash on hand to purchase cash tender offer or redeem a part or the entire of its outstanding $1 billion or 8.25% senior notes which will also include paying fees, premiums, expenses and other unpaid and accrued interest related to the tender offer or redemption.Factors Favoring Noble EnergyNoble Energy is backed by organic and inorganic assets, cost reduction initiatives and higher demand from international and domestic assets. The company’s presence in the resource-rich Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin was highly boosted with the acquisition of the Rosetta Resources.Permian Basin Shale covers roughly 75,000 square miles, almost half the size of California. As per experts, it is cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in the Permian Basin than most other major fields. This is the reason why Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report) and Resolute Energy Corp. (REN  -  Free Report) have been more inclined to increase their portfolio in the region. (Read More: 5 Ways Permian Basin's Oil Boom Can Make You Rich)NBL Energy has also completed acquiring the Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. and further strengthened its position in onshore U.S. The company expects production volumes to improve sequentially due to higher number of wells brought online in the DJ Basin, Eagle Ford and the Delaware area.The company is also targeting to sell off some of its non-core assets. This way it aims to generate at least $1 billion cash proceeds.Additionally, the company exited 2016 with liquidity of $4.5 billion. An improved liquidity profile, following the asset sales, will enable Noble Energy to pay off some of its existing debt. This will lower the underlying cost structure and strengthen its balance sheet.Price MovementShares of Noble Energy have lost 29.2% in the last 12 months compared with the industry's loss of 26.7%.A stringent drilling regulations and lack of adequate infrastructure facilities near its drilling zones could affect performance.Zacks RankNBL Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

806,NBL,"We updated our research report on Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report) on Aug 18. This oil and natural gas exploration & production company’s second-quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the back of improving cost structure and commodity prices.Devon has been able to generate positive results through cost-cutting initiatives. The steps resulted in savings of more than $1.4 billion in annualized Operating and General and Administrative expenses. The company expects these savings to be sustainable in 2017 owing to higher production rates from the company’s U.S. resource plays and relatively flat Lease Operating Expenses.Devon continues to monetize its non-core assets and use the proceeds to lower its debt levels. Debt reduction in 2016 had lowered its annual forward financing costs by $120 million. The company aims to monetize assets worth $1 billion over the next 12-18 months. Devon has already sold $340 million of assets and achieved one-third of its divestiture target.During 2017, the company plans to invest $1.9-$2.2 billion in Exploration & Production activities. Consistent investments in resource-rich assets are helping it boost total production. Devon now expects 2017 total U.S. daily oil production to improve in the range of 18-23% from the 2016 level. Rapidly expanding higher margin production is expected to drive production level higher in 2018.However, Devon operates in a highly competitive oil and gas industry. Some of the competitors in this industry are financially stronger than it with more resources at their disposal. This might limit Devon’s capacity to apply for new drilling rights or acquire properties.In addition, certain properties in which Devon has a stake are being operated by third parties. As a result, the company has limited control over these operations or the fate of their future development. These limitations as well as Devon’s dependence on the operator and other working interest owners over these properties could result in unexpected future costs and adversely affect its financialsDevon currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
